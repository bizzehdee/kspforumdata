The idea that you can collect and gather data on planets is not only interesting just as a objective, but leaves you guys with some interesting design space to screw with. My immediate thought is something like sending probes to get info on planets so you know not only where to mine, but also get access to better flight planning(would kill for atmosphere calculations to be stock)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"toric5","CreatedById":58046,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T17:33:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eso this will probably not break saves?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HarvesteR","CreatedById":4,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T17:35:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022toric5\u0022 data-cite=\u0022toric5\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eso this will probably not break saves?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of yet, none of the features for 0.20 require wiping saves.
