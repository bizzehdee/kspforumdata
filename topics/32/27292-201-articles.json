Once in space \u0022high over Ike,\u0022 I took a full set of all applicable science readings, in pairs, so as to max out transmittable science, and then ejected the spent materials bays and goo pods, since their data was already passed along and they were inert mass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ybw0k26.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ybw0k26.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(The spent science devices were ejected on Ike-impact trajectories, to reduce space junk.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then repeated this process in \u0022space near Ike.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EPFPLHN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EPFPLHN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then the probe set down on the surface, and took a third and final set of paired science readings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9UNGxt3.png\u0022 alt=\u00229UNGxt3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal yield: 506 science.
