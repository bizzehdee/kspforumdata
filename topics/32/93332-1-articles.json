All my lifters are just shy of the amount of DV needed to make orbit so they will fall back to Kerbin. All Fairings are discarded before orbital velocity is met, usually upon breaching the top of the atmosphere but before circularizing. The transfer stage must have enough fuel to do the transfer burn, insertion burn, and deorbit burn, but not enough to do the landing. I\u0027ll even put retro-boosters on it to make sure it is destroyed on impact. The Lander/ascent stage must be able to reach orbit, transfer, and put me into an aerocapture back at Kerbin.

I even wrote a short fan story about the catastrophic events that lead to the formation of the \u0022Clean Space Act\u0022 (sadly that was before the forum reset so it got lost). But I\u0027ve decided to take a more relaxed approach for two reasons. 1) I\u0027m bored of doing it that way and the extra lengths it sometimes requires, 2) I\u0027ve become a little jealous of the stories some people have about near-misses with orbital debris! (I want in on that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI won\u0027t go the other way and go to lengths to leave things in space, but if they happen to be decoupled in orbit then that\u0027s where they\u0027ll stay. It also opens up later mission possibilities of trying to recover debris and bring it back home for recycling (we gotta at least pretend to be green).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut when I was playing with Clean Space Act rules I didn\u0027t allow anything that wasn\u0027t an active craft to be left in orbit. Crash sites on planets were allowed to stay because they became little memorials to the fallen Kerbals, but Landers had to be single stage craft and not leave anything behind. Most times I\u0027d design the craft so its ascent stages where dropped before circularizing (keep space clean, to heck with anyone living under the flight path of spent fuel tanks!). When doing transfers I\u0027d burn till I was on a collision course with the target planet and then jettison any spent parts before raising the Pe again (I\u0027ll still prob do that now). It was also acceptable to leave a stage in orbit so long as it had a control pod and enough fuel that it could be remote controlled and orbited later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T22:40:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI used to Keep my Space Debris free but since I know that there is a mod to render distant objects so you can see them beyond 2.3-2.5km render distance, i enjoy some flickering Pixels, travelling Overhead like Shooting stars almost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98943-0-25-Distant-Object-Enhancement-bis-v1-4-2-%2811-Dec-2014%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98943-0-25-Distant-Object-Enhancement-bis-v1-4-2-%2811-Dec-2014%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDont know if it works for .90\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SorryDave","CreatedById":119474,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T22:43:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor a long time I have been minimizing debris, but I thought it was because of one of my mental disorders.
