Basically it was a 3 prong approach:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Small budget from the \u0022government\u0022 on an annual basis. Increases/decreases with reputation. Use the money or lose it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Contracts to help supplement the annual budget. That way, you\u0027re not totally reliant on ridiculous contracts for funding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Stump for funds! Basically, you select Kerbalnauts to go on fundraising drives. This makes them inaccessable for missions while fundraising, but allows them to generate funds based on their experience level. The longer the drive and the higher experience level, the more funds you get. This also adds the gameplay element of choice between sending your high level Kerbal off on a mission to Jool, or send him/her out to fundraise the money to support that mission. Obviously, some changes would have to be made to how you hire Kerbals or add them to your roster via \u0022rescue\u0022 missions, but I think it could be easily done. This also mirrors the real life experiences of the Mercury astronauts who spent a lot of time traveling around to schools and civic meetings to drum up support for the space program. Given the massive number of very public failures early on in the American space program, it\u0027s doubtful that it would have continued if not for the efforts of those guys assuring the public that they could do it and were willing to risk their lives to do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-26T20:01:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222380350\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130706\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221453828144\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002270807\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, regex said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust make it\u00A0a fixed budget per timeframe calculated from those variables. \u00A0If you never go out and do stuff you never increase your fixed budget. \u00A0Hell, have a small rep penalty for every timeframe that you don\u0027t at least launch one new craft or something. \u00A0Solves the worries about \u0022free money\u0022 nicely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis.
