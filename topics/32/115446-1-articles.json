In fact Visual Studio has a special feature that called //TODO that basically just creates a list in the GUI for reminders (the TODO comment itself has been around even longer than Visual Studio, it just didn\u0027t do anything special)\n\nThe problem is, we don\u0027t have the source code, and comments are not compiled so we can\u0027t even reverse engineer it. (Not that we would want to)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T02:38:32Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 02:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T03:36:55Z","Content":"MODULE\t{\t\tname = ModuleScienceConverter\t\tscientistBonus = 0.25\t//Bonus per scientist star - need at least one!
