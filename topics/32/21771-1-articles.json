It\u0027s behaviour changes, or just odd behaviour in general, just seem to happen or are consistent. On one of my rockets, having SAS on will make it roll, to the point of uncontrollability. On a couple of my jets, ASAS wants them to fly backwards, but only at random times during the flight, which can cause a lateral spin, or some other travesty.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OtherDalfite","CreatedById":8317,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-09T07:12:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheHengeProphet\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TheHengeProphet\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks!

Holding F will temporarily disable the ASAS while decoupling.
