If only because as a dev you\u0027re going to get a much more consistent set of bug reports, etc. than if you were to release it to the general public. Just look at how many new players post on the forums regarding things like strut placement or fuel transfer issues (things I have zero problem helping with). TBH, things like that don\u0027t belong in the dev process prior to the release. Sorry, but you\u0027re just going to have to be patient and wait for the release. As to feeling \u0027insulted,\u0027 I really don\u0027t know how to respond.

The Media Group get the stablest build that we can do and they go through all the changes and produce excellent videos on them. The Experimental Team don\u0027t do that at all, they test all day, every day and write up reports on the issues they find. Now, the reason we still keep the whole closed Testing thing going is that there are simply too many issues with handing out unstable builds of the game to the general public. I mean, the Media Group know of the current issues in their build and thus know to avoid them, so whilst their builds might seem stable, they\u0027re most likely not. Believe me, if we were sitting on a perfect, polished and finished build of 0.21, you guys would already have it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, it\u0027s best that this thread is closed as it\u0027s serving little purpose, other than to simply rant about a topic that hasn\u0027t been fully understood. Over the next few weeks, I\u0027ll be posting more and more blogs on the whole Testing Process and why it\u0027s necessary that it\u0027s done the way it is. Keep an eye out for them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
