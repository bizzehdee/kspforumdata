I have it between two ore tanks. When I get a kerbal out (the two in the thing are Harming and Barkin Kerman) they appear inside the ship, wedged between the cabin and an ore tank. I press the spacebar and he ends up on top of the ship (the ship is horizontal, it\u0027s a literal ship). I can\u0027t get him inside again because there\u0027s no door on the side of the cabin, the only entrance appears to be at the point the kerbal spawned at (marked by a green blob in the SPH). I had to reload a quicksave.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Landge","CreatedById":57671,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T23:52:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you tried to right click on the Crew Cabin?
