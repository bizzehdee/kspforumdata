I tracked my Kerbonauts, their missions, achievements and flight time. I had a table of \u0022scientific data\u0022 I\u0027d discovered with the four basic instruments available at various altitudes and positions on Kerbin, Mun and Minmus. I\u0027d done a number of missions such as launching my own \u0022Stayputnik\u0022, docking with a practice target, launching communication satellites, mapping satellites, tested my Munar lander in LKO (after watching \u0022Spider\u0022 in \u0022From the Earth to the Moon\u0022 admittedly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E) and spent countless hours crafting and testing a Munar rover that could fit in the 1.25m KW fairing, before landing it on the Mun itself and driving several KMs to scout a potential landing site. I played the game like a career and approached the game kind of like NASA would - test it, investigate it and then do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo since the first part of career came out, I\u0027ve stubbornly stuck with career mode. From the wonky tree where probes and landing gear are horribly placed and the click-fest science grind, to the \u0022test some random part at some impossible position\u0022 gobbledygook contracts and the budget constraints that basically sink a space program after two or three failures. I\u0027ve tinkered with the custom career settings over and over trying to find a balance to make it challenging enough to be fun and yet not be a horrible grind. And I\u0027ve still yet to land on anything past the Mun! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E Every release I\u0027ve started a new career, tried to enjoy it and then get bored just before or after I land on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the release of 0.25, I spent some time finding a bunch of mods to start my career over (\u0022it\u0027ll be fixed this time\u0022, I told myself, \u0022these mods will add more fun!\u0022) yet I\u0027m three missions in, already being told to go to the Mun, low on funds, still without landing gear and already bored. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall I think what I\u0027m missing in career mode is the sense of accomplishment and fulfilment in doing things (even simple things like lander tests). The tech tree limits the parts in a really arbitrary way (although I have made some wacky rockets as a result) and science is just plain dull to collect. The contracts that should fix it by adding another dimension just turn the game into this huge rush out of Kerbin SOI, and the funds stop you from doing even the little things like testing parts because they\u0027ll just be a waste. And to top it off, powered flight increasingly seems like a mid to late game technology and probes/rovers are pretty much relegated to uselessness (seems odd given that they\u0027ve done far more space exploration than their fleshy counterparts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorely tempted to go back to sandbox and a spreadsheet, but I\u0027m also wary as to how much \u0022real\u0022 science I can do now that so many mods are geared towards the career mode.

I did all of the tutorials, which was kind of neat. I will say this though, the contracts do nothing to help teach you the game.

I don\u0027t use wheels yet, and the only need I see for them anytime soon is for a rover.

I\u0027ve been able to successfully get into Kerbin Orbit, transfer to Mun Orbit, Land on the mun with a lander, get back to Mun Orbit, redock with the command module, and transfer back to Kerbin orbit and land on Kerbin. And all of this, has been the most amazing experience in gaming, for me, in a very long time.

Most of the testing seems kinda silly. I do wish now, though, that there was a bit more progression in the game. Launch a probe around kerbal, launch a probe around the mun, land a probe on the mun, launch a kerbal into orbit, send a kerbal to the mun, land a kerbal on the mun, yadda yadda - those types of things. So I have started sort of doing my own missions (like buliding a space station around the Mun) but I realized I became a bit strapped for cash - so now I have to sort of try to implement a bit of the contracts with my own quests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo sure - career is probably far from perfect - and I agree it could use some tweaking - but I think it\u0027s also meant for the new player (like myself) and THEN you move to sandbox when you\u0027re done with career - versus most people here, probably experienced it the other way around.

I joined right when career mode was science-only to unlock the tech tree, and that was my favorite experience in the game to date. The funds and contracts system just isn\u0027t there yet, especially with the unbalanced funds-to-science conversion in the admin building, but that\u0027s an entirely different, and dead, horse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I\u0027m optimistic that .90 is the turning point. Fine Print \u002B new biomes on all planets will bring back that sense of purpose and exploration-- I am convinced. For example, taking a temperature reading and then blasting off for home feels like a clickfest, but ironically the survey contract idea where you are taking temperatures at 5 different sites feels like you\u0027re truly painting a picture of that planet\u0027s climate despite the fact that it sounds like just more grindy clicking. I\u0027m weird...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tech tree really does need some work, though. It \u003Cem\u003Epains \u003C/em\u003Eme to pay 160 science points for extendable ladders, and 300 science points plus a lot of prerequisites to get a cubic octagonal strut, when the Modular Girder Segment is available at the start of the game. I\u0027d suggest moving those obvious parts to the beginning of the tree and making rocket engines and such way more expensive science-points-wise and additional steps down the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo your point about probes being useless, I think that can be fixed by adding a regolith-sampling part. We should have camera and telescope parts for probes and space telescopes, and maybe a dust counter since that\u0027s been in the news recently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also really love to see a girder that is meant to sit vertically for the purpose of putting a little bit of extra space between radially attached tanks that you \u003Cem\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E intend to separate with a radial decoupler. Kind of like the Small Hardpoint (which by the way is another 300 science unlock.
