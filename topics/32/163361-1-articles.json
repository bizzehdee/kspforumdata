there is a good admin strategy that you can use called \u0022Leadership Initiative\u0022 which will reduce the funds, science, and rep from contracts, but give you much higher gains for funds and reputation from milestones as well as a boost to any science data you collect in the field. \u00A0I usually upgrade my admin building to level 2 and then save up to buy this strategy at 60% (which is the max for this building level). \u00A0Contract gains will be about 45% lower but milestones are 90% better and the science gained in the field is about 30% better. \u00A0The setup cost is not cheap

Initiative\u0022 which will reduce the funds, science, and rep from contracts, but give you much higher gains for funds and reputation from milestones as well as a boost to any science data you collect in the field. \u00A0I usually upgrade my admin building to level 2 and then save up to buy this strategy at 60% (which is the max for this building level). \u00A0Contract gains will be about 45% lower but milestones are 90% better and the science gained in the field is about 30% better. \u00A0The setup cost is not cheap (something like 160k funds, 320 science and 64 reputation cost and you need at least 250 reputation to access it), but I can usually grab it after 5 or 6 launches in an early career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you have this enabled, then you can just go anywhere you want and the first time you do anything you get nice milestone bonuses. \u00A0The disadvantage is you don\u0027t get funds up front like you do with contracts and also you only get the milestone rewards once, so it\u0027s not very good if you plan to make repeated trips to the same locations. \u00A0You can still do some contracts, they just don\u0027t pay out as much, but if you come across ones that align with what you were planning to do anyway then you may as well take them. \u00A0But the way I like to play is to explore lots of new places, so the milestone rewards are the easiest way for me to do that and I don\u0027t have to rely on finding the right kind of contracts to fund my missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeadership Initiative was added when milestones were added because there are indeed players that wish career mode was less guided, and more free-form, like sandbox\u00A0mode with funds and science. These players wouldn\u0027t be satisfied with any changes to contracts, because contracts are not what they want from career mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason it has such a large activation cost is because of the initial \u0022record\u0022 milestones - altitude records, speed records, distance records, and depth records. There are a lot of those early in the game to\u00A0kickstart your career on a positive note, and give new players some wiggle room. Having Leadership Initiative active as those are earned would be quite unbalanced, however, which is why the activation cost is a bit steeper. This ensures that players get it a little later in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like that you noticed that it forces you to keep moving forward, instead of doing the same things repeatedly. This was intentional, to emphasize a playstyle that is very different than following contracts. It emphasizes more of a trailblazer or pioneer attitude, which is why it is called \u0022Leadership Initiative\u0022. You want to be the first in your field to do these things that have never been done before. You want to keep moving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother point I\u0027d like to make is the boosted science gains. This might appear strange to someone initially, but the intent of that was not actually to give you more science. What do you do if you are using this playstyle and you are stuck? You\u0027ve done everything you can do in the Kerbin system, but you can\u0027t make it to Duna yet? What if you\u0027ve explored everything in the system, and there are no milestones left? The intent of the boosted science was not to give you science, but to give you a source of recurring\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Efunds\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0when\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Epaired with another strategy.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EWhen initially doing science, this still supports the trailblazer attitude, as science comes from finite pools (doing it in the same places lowers and eventually uses up all the science there). However if you\u0027ve done all the science there is to do, this will boost the amount of science your labs produce, and therefore potentially boost the funds they produce when paired with other strategies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, a lot of thought went into that strategy, hopefully I\u0027ve explained some of it. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-20T21:58:05Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2017 09:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Arsonide\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-21T01:10:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223126817\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022163361\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221500587826\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002232604\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Arsonide\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Arsonide said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeadership Initiative was added when milestones were added because there are indeed players that wish career mode was less guided, and more free-form, like sandbox\u00A0mode with funds and science.

Correct me if I\u0027m wrong, but I think the rescue mission can also count as your first orbital rendezvous too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis strategy is perfect for me so thanks for coming up with it (and milestones in general)! \u00A0I can\u0027t imagine playing career without it now. \u00A0It entirely fits my free-roaming play style, I like to change up my career games and doing things in a different order form game to game. \u00A0The beauty is that you can still do some contracts on the side, it\u0027s not like they are disabled, they just are not as lucrative as before. \u00A0If I am thinking about doing my first mission to Duna for example, I may choose to grab a satellite mission for Duna so that I can drop that off when I get there for a little extra cash and then use it going forward as a relay for my communications network.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI never use labs for science - that is a mechanic I never really liked much. \u00A0I love the labs for designing stations, but I don\u0027t bother with putting data in them. \u00A0I also never transmit science over antennas if I can help it (maybe the occasional crew report). \u00A0That sample return container made my life so much easier. \u00A0Now all we need is to allow a scientist to reset experiments without doing an EVA, being on board should be sufficient in my mind -- this part sucks in early career before you can do EVAs in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
