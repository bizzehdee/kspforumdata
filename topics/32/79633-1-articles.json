I crashed a plane near the capsule he was in, and when i switched to his capsule, something weird happened. I was unable to revert or go to the space center. When I went on EVA he was walking around normally, but it was hard to control. When i went to go back in the pod, he froze on the latter. I switched to the pod, and Jeb was in it, although we was also outside. I tossed the other Jeb out and they were indeed both Jeb.

A 3 man team of Jebs..........Anyone else scared to think of the hijinks that would happen on a mission with them? Me personally I think Bill\u0027s panicking, and Bob\u0027s fearful reaction help keep Jeb under control when he\u0027s flying (NO JEB YOU CAN\u0027T MAKE THE LANDER DO FLIPS 100 METERS OFF THE GROUND) He\u0027s scary enough at times on his one man missions, think of what 3 of them at once would be like. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kamuchi","CreatedById":110857,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T01:40:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elol, that was funny \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"anorangechristmas","CreatedById":104453,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T17:15:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI promise you i didn\u0027t, watch the video for proof, you can see as the capsule fills it self back up.
