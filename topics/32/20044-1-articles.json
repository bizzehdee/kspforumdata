Viewed from the right perspective, any ellipse can look like a circle, if the viewer is deprived of depth-perception (which we are; our screens are flat...and KSP doesn\u0027t output stereo images). That, combined with the small eccentricity, makes it quite easy to see how one might mistake it\u0027s orbit as circular.
