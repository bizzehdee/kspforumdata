No science. No tech tree. No money. Build anything you want without having to unlock the parts you need or earn the funds needed to pay for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Sandbox, I can build an Apollo Saturn 5 replica and fly it to the Mun. I can build a giant space station that dwarfs the ISS. I can send a monster interplanetary spaceship with dozens of crew to establish a base on one of Jool\u0027s moons. Why? Because I can. That\u0027s why. I can build anything I want, let my imagination run wild and have a lot of fun doing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer Mode places obstacles in our way to add challenge and strategy to the game. Each mission I send out is another step along the road towards the ultimate goal of overcoming all the challenges Career Mode has to offer. There are constraints that limit what I can do. At each step, I\u0027m working to push back those limits so that I can do more and progress further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI start out with limited funds and a limited number of parts. As I progress through the game, I unlock more parts and earn more funds. I have to carefully decide which tech tree nodes to spend my precious science points on. Which parts do I pay funds to unlock? How can I get maximum mission return from my spacecraft for minimum cost? Do I really need to unlock that expensive new part, or should I try to complete the mission without it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: If you want Career Mode to be challenging and fun to play, you need to increase the difficulty offered far beyond the 60% resource returns offered by \u0022Hard\u0022 difficulty. \u0022Hard\u0022 mode is a free lunch at current difficulty settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.90 introduces upgradeable buildings and upgradeable kerbals (through experience). We are told that this will improve the performance of parts through better ISP, more thrust, and so on. This has been pointed out as a potential game-breaker. It has therefore been suggested that upgradeable buildings and kerbals will ruin the game and should not be implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say that Squad keep the relationship between Sandbox and Career as they are now: \u003Cstrong\u003ESandbox is KSP without constraints, Career adds constraints to make the game more challenging\u003C/strong\u003E. How does upgradeable part performance fit in with this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn obvious approach is that Sandbox presents the parts without constraints, while Career imposes constraints on the parts to make the game more challenging. Suddenly, this turns the idea of upgradeable parts upside down and makes this feature a positive change, not a negative one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s set this out clearly: I start a career save with limited science, limited funds, and \u003Cstrong\u003Elimited engine performance\u003C/strong\u003E. In this context, upgrades to buildings and kerbals suddenly make a lot more sense. Sandbox gives me each part at full performance without any constraints.

You probably have quite a different definition of \u0027fun\u0027 than Squad or most new players would though. Masochists, maybe, but not the average KSP player (if there is such a thing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen again, my own favourite option is for Kerbal experience to implement features of MechJeb - navigator/pilots can plot/execute manoeuvre nodes for the player if requested. There are quite a few people who think it\u0027s critical to KSP that the player is always the pilot so hate that idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think we all have to accept that Squad started with the \u0027simulator\u0027 side of things, so stuff works more or less. As the game gets closer to beta they\u0027re concentrating on the \u0027game\u0027 parts to flesh things out and appeal to a broader range of customers. Naturally, the people who liked \u0027simulator\u0027 are less likely to be excited about watering that down for \u0027game\u0027 components we don\u0027t care about at best or, at worst, actively dislike. As such whatever Squad do now there are likely to be existing/old players who hate it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
