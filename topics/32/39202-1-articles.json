I have posted this question my mod thread and I am about done with my J-2X and I haven\u0027t received a response so I\u0027m going to ask the question here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk so there is a delta cryogenic stage, and on the Nasa site it seems they used the 5M version of it when it looks like it should really be the 4m version which will be used in the first two missions. So if thats the case fine, I can see how the 4M version will work with the 70T Block I Crew version. But for the 105 and 130T versions they are supposed to be using a Large cryogenic stage. I cant find too much information on this, wikipedia has it at 5M and thats what I have been able to find online. I just am not sure how it fits into what they have shown in the diagram is the entire stage housed inside a covering and those are jettisoned? I havent been able to find anything on this. So if anyone could point me in the right direction it would be very much appreciated. Also the upper stage of the 130T version has 3 J-2X engines now? Is that correct? Well thanks guys for the help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Wy1Wo5V.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Wy1Wo5V.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI superimposed some of my reference images onto the it and I guess it makes sense what do you think? This is for the 5M cryo stage. I dont know it still seems wrong for the entire stage to be inside like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VBBT0rV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VBBT0rV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BostLabs","CreatedById":57527,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T21:47:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhew!
