After that, try \u0022complete the tech tree\u0022 and/or \u0022obtain all science from Minmus\u0022 or something like that if you\u0027re playing career mode, or mess around with the new mining and refining tools.

I like to browse sites like the [Encyclopedia Astronautica](http://www.astronautix.com/index.html) and [Beyond Apollo](http://www.wired.com/category/beyondapollo/) to see if anything stands out as something I\u0027d like to replicate, whether simply as a craft design or as a whole mission."},{"CreatedByName":"Seshins","CreatedById":71258,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T00:55:26Z","Content":"I struggled myself after 450\u002B hours in game, but i read a few of the mission reports (Brotoro\u0027s are excellent) and that gave me the inspiration to start again. I got past the initial grindy parts of career mode, and am starting to really enjoy the challenge. There are a lot of nail biting moments now.\n\n I was traditionally a sandbox player, but i found that setting my own goals become a bit same same after a while.\n\n I have also found if i watch anything to do with some notable space missions (Voyager, NH, Apollo, Rosetta etc) i have an intense urge to jump into KSP and do it myself."},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T00:59:12Z","Content":"(It\u0027s also OK to move on and do something else with your life.)"},{"CreatedByName":"luizopiloto","CreatedById":97503,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T01:21:30Z","Content":"I have the Eve-X program, a base on Eve with periodic crew change and planet exploration.\n\nEach part of this program is a challenge...

Usually inspiration for anything comes from within and if that spark isn\u0027t there then there\u0027s no one that can lit a fire for you. At the end of the day you need to ask yourself what it is you really want to do. Why aren\u0027t you interested in the game anymore? Is it too difficult? Too complicated? \n\nIf you feel you\u0027re not prepared to \u0022tuck in\u0022 then there are other things in life you can spend time on until you feel you\u0027re ready. The game isn\u0027t going anywhere. This community will probably not go anywhere either (and most of us will send postcards from the Mun) so we\u0027re here when you want to return. \n\nThe idea of starting a thread to ask people to convince you playing a computer game makes no sense to me."},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T17:46:49Z","Content":"Started playing again after watching some old Scott Manely vids.\n\nAnd naturally, I promptly got to orbit on the first try, and had enough fuel to probably do a good orbit of Mun and possibly an orbit of Minmus (or at least a flyby).\n\nDon\u0027t know why so many are having issues flying with the new aerodynamics, though then again, it does kinda reveal just how many people did actually use FAR.

The Eve one survived, though it had little use because it was merely intended to be a flyby. The Duna one was DOA even though the completely automated ship performed smoothly. Forgot to set the interplanetary dish to target Kerbin so by the time I was halfway out from Kerbin, I could no longer give any commands to the lander. \n\nChances are I\u0027m going to set up a Duna mission. Its high time I landed a Kerbal there."}]}
