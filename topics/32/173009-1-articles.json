If they want another developer to work on it, they can ditch Squad in an instant. If they want to bolster Squad by providing additional resources, as they have in the case of the QA team that Squad has told us about, they can do that too. If Take-Two wants to delay release because the product is not up to their standards, they can make that call at any time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, Squad is the developer, but they are working for Take-Two. Take-Two calls the shots. If Squad says they need more time for an update, Take-Two can choose to listen and respect Squad\u0027s recommendation, or they can choose to say Squad has to meet the deadline. If Squad doesn\u0027t meet expectations, they might find themselves no longer the developer of KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I said, I get that everyone is making business decisions, but I also think it\u0027s a shame that quality suffers for it. This release could have been delayed to spend a little more time finding and fixing the most obvious problems. Take-Two either chose to release anyway, or Squad told Take-Two everything was ready and Take-Two trusted them. Either way, it is indicative of the attention and care that Take-Two is currently giving to their property. Which as I said previously is not completely unreasonable given the limited popularity and small community that KSP has.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I like KSP and want the best for it, so I\u0027m internally conflicted between what I want for KSP and what I expect as logical business decisions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
