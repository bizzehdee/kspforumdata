I suppose I\u0027m a suicide burner? I\u0027m not entirely clear on what a suicide burn really is, but here\u0027s what I do. I keep my tail on the retrograde marker and burn at full throttle and try to get it so that my horizontal and vertical speed fall to zero as close to the surface as possible. I usually end up killing my horizontal speed well before the vertical though, and then make a powered descent straight down.\n\nWhy the hell would anybody use docking mode?

For 2 and 3 way symmetry rockets, I rotate them prior to the gravity turn. I never rotate them in the VAB because it messes with the way I orient the camera for things like docking vs which way I perceive to be the top of my rocket.\n\nI can land one way or the other, but most of the time it\u0027s a combo deal I think. I come in on whatever angle pleases me with a trajectory that has me slightly overshooting my landing target. I\u0027m still burning to kill both lateral and vertical velocity together for most of the landing, but I like to make the final descent pretty much vertically so that I can use RCS to zero out lateral velocity perfectly, and I have time and means to inspect my ship and landing site properly and come in nice and gentle.\n\nThe majority of the time I am docking to a rotating target, so I need to be able to move laterally as well as rotate, so I find it easier not to use docking control.
