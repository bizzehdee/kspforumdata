And like other games, once development is done then this issue resolves itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt can be very hard, and sometimes impossible, to add new features or improve old ones AND not break existing features or mods. Often the game devs will have to repair, modify, replace, overhaul, and/or enhance existing features that may seem entirely unrelated to the new changes they are implementing just to keep everything working. And when that happens it is likely that the mod devs will need to do that too, but the mod devs often won\u0027t be aware of what specifically must be changed or updated until after the game devs release the new version. Only then can the mod devs do their awesome work. These things take time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can\u0027t have big new updates to KSP (like changing engine versions)\u00A0and totally avoid breaking mods at the same time.
