It\u0027s been a long time since I\u0027ve been in a simulator with real rotational and translational controllers, but I\u0027m pretty sure the ones I\u0027ve been in and the NASA human interface guidelines have Y and Z translation in the direction of translation along the axis, which makes Z translation \u0022inverted\u0022 from pitch. A joystick in rotation acts as a line along the Z and rotating around the other two, which is why pitch is traditionally the way it is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TwoHedWlf","CreatedById":7163,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-24T00:50:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brotoro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Brotoro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAren\u0027t we all pilots used to joysticks where \u0022towards us means pitch up\u0022?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI usually swap it around though, the usual for most games with a translate RCS type system is up to go up, down to go down.
