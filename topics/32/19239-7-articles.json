Instead, they require you to continuously tap the \u0022B\u0022 button until the plane becomes slow enough to apply the full breaks. Now it will be impossible to stop such planes.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is entirely possible that due to the new CoL, CoM and CoT indicators in the VAB and SPH that your planes will be \u0027hardier\u0027 and better balanced, so they won\u0027t break up when the parking brakes are applied. Additionally, if this is happens to you a lot, try landing at a lower horizontal velocity, or just more struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe parking brake is certainly a good thing, considering how many people will want to fly spaceplanes to other planets without them rolling away when they get out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
