Because stock turret bearings almost always use two vessels this will allow much larger tank battles for the battle thread! Because most stock tanks have 1/5 of their parts in the turret this will stop the enemy tank, turret and your turret from effecting the lag because they will all be on separate threads! (This is how it works right?)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-19T03:31:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUh... what?
