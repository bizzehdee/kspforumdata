I created a new career with difficulty set on Moderate and found myself flying missions almost entirely on the basis of getting cash. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the new bottlenecks that are provided from the up-gradable buildings, the Launchpad keeps early missions down. Then the VAB and then arguable the Tracking Center (its hard to do everything without nodes or mods haha)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFine-Print is such a great addition, throwing satellites into orbit for big bucks is a lot of fun. I have yet to go for any scouting/ viewing missions because of the fact Rockets aren\u0027t designed for such and jets come later. I still prefer the idea of having Rockets come before jets, simply because in atmospheric gameplay is bland, and boring. Plus the current parts would allow a player to get to orbit much easier than it currently is. Things will probably stay this way until there is an areodynamic update and focus on space planes in general.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the new MK3 parts are at the end of career, I have yet to see their viability in Career. But in Sandbox these new parts do live up to the hype. The new Editor system helps a lot in creating Shuttles and SpacePlanes that simply could not have existed before. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe editor upgrades are great. The editor gizmos open up many more doors, while at the same time leaving the \u0022old school\u0022 ways untouched. I still find myself rotating parts with the WASD keys but find using the rotate function much more useful when i need it. Offset alone gives great command on where you want to put parts. Part clipping can now be done to the extreme, but I\u0027d rather have that in stock and have great looking crafts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince its only been 1 day I have yet to check out any biomes, or build any stations (one of the main Fine-Print missions im looking foward too) but I can totally feel the viability of Career over sandbox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe nails in the coffin are down, Sandbox is cool and all, but a full fledged Career is much more satisfying to play hands down.

When SAS is enabled, it appears it defaults to \u0022Stability Control\u0022 where the pilot is holding it steady (eg: old SAS). While not addressed to you, but related; I\u0027m also happy to see that in sandbox the SAS abilities have been expanded to the probe cores as well but not sure how it pans out in career.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy biggest disappointment with the update is radial decouplers, and still no dv readout.
