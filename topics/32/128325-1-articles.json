Still it could be nice if you seperate just a small probe with a heat shield and chutes, and lob it at eve at the end, and keep the rest of your craft with the ISRU at gilly to serve as a fueling base (have the probe that goes to eve be the root part to be safe?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOtherwise, the entire craft is basically a complete loss once it goes suborbital at Eve.
