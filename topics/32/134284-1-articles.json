With a TWR of 2,\u00A0140 dv has to be expended to get 70 dv when going vertical and this assumes a perfect suicide burn. \u00A0As TWR goes up this becomes less and less important but with lower TWR lighter craft\u00A0are possible for the same dv.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QOP0DM1.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022QOP0DM1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/n51v4HW.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022n51v4HW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fearless Son","CreatedById":133397,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-15T22:59:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other words, you did deliberate, non-ironic lithobreaking. \u00A0A rare thing among KSP players (who tend to lithobreak accidentally.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Archgeek","CreatedById":116048,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-16T07:46:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222458857\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022134284\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221458082789\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133397\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fearless Son\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, Fearless Son said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other words, you did deliberate, non-ironic lithobreaking. \u00A0A rare thing among KSP players (who tend to lithobreak accidentally.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLitho\u003Cem\u003Ebraking.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003ELitho\u003Cem\u003Ebreaking\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0is what you get when it\u0027s not actually successful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-16T08:12:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was doing somewhat similar testing recently -- to test out the real capabilities of the micro landing gear.
