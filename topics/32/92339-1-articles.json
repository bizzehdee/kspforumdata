I can\u0027t put the game down. In high school, Physics/Math were my favorite subjects (why I never went on to do something in those fields, I\u0027ll never know), and this game plays on everything I loved so much about both. I loved all of it, force, momentum, acceleration, figuring out crazy formulas for with friction and yadda yadda yadda...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, with that said - here\u0027s my crazy story - and I\u0027ve read through some of the forums, and I\u0027m sure this won\u0027t amount to what you all have been up to - but this story just hit me in the face today about how AMAZING this game is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027ve been playing on career mode - normal. Haven\u0027t done any sandbox or anything (just so you all know where I\u0027m at with the game).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve unlocked quite a few trees so far (mainly by doing the mission where you have to test that really huge rocket in orbit - that seemed a little too easy, and netted me like 1200 science points) anyhow. So I\u0027m mostly on the 300 science point tier, with a few 600 done (I think). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo - my first \u0022self made\u0022 mission from this past weekend - I wanted to start building a mini space station around Mun - so I could refuel, put a science lab there, just for fun. Well, I managed that - it had solar panels, all that great stuff - then I realized - i forgot docking ports... ahhh... So... Bob Kerman has been floating around the moon twiddling his thumbs, oh well, he can stay there and watch the action from a far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, I got home from work - fired up the game, and decided to finally land on the actual moon. This time, i built a REALLY awesome commander/lunar lander combination. The intent to undock the lander, drop it onto the moon, fire it back up to the commander pod, redock, refuel, send the science back to kerman, rinse and repeat. Right? Sounds amazing. Well I managed to do it! I got the whole thing into orbit, put 5 docks on to it, so I could build off of it in the future. So I get the lander on to the mun, the commander module is orbiting the Mun without anyone in it. My little kerbal dude is jumping around the moon, having a blast. collecting some rocks, EVA reports, all that jazz. Plant the flag, we\u0027re good to go. Get back into the lander, and take off. Only to realize, I only had enough fuel to BARELY get into a stable orbit around the mun. So now, I have a lander in orbit (with no fuel) and a commander module in orbit (no pilot)... oh crap... looks like we have another kerbal stuck around the mun...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut wait... I still have Bob, floating around Mun all happy in his science lab! So I take control of Bob the Scientist - drive the science module towards the Commander Module - Send Bob on a spacewalk to the commander module - he gets in. He turns everything on, heats up the Commander module (it\u0027s been drifiting idle for awhile now) - and fires it on an intercept course for the hopeless lander. I get within 500m of the lander, only to realize... I don\u0027t have any RCS on this!! oops... so I target the lander, drop the speed difference down to .1 m/s line it up, switch to the lunar module, spin it around to face the commander. and tell my poor Kerbals to hold on! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little bump.. annnd... we\u0027re DOCKED! I make sure the fuel transfer is shut down, so I dont\u0027 dump all fo the fuel into the lander - and make a return course for the science lab. Since the science lab doesn\u0027t have any docking ports on it, I figured it\u0027s time to return it to Kerban. So I space walk the Kerbal that walked on the Mun, leaving Bob back in orbit around the moon (Meh, he\u0027s used to it by now, I figured he wouldn\u0027t mind staying awhile longer, maybe he\u0027ll catch the next trip home). I grab the science from the pod, and take it with me to the science module. Fire that back up, and I\u0027m now currently on a return trajectory to Kerben. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of that wasn\u0027t any type of required mission (except for the science gather and flag plant)... I\u0027ll get a decent amount of science out of it - recovered all the kerbals - have the first piece of a Mun Space Station in orbit, complete with 4 open docking ports. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean... amazing... AMAZING... I love this game... And to think, I have all of those other planets out there to explore... I\u0027m having an absolute blast with this game... I have 42 hours logged according to Steam so far... I can\u0027t put this game down...
