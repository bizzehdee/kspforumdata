When those sections first got created I was really disappointed at the change in the number of views things relegated to those sections got. It almost makes posting about things there pointless. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example I posted about my Constellation mission in live from mission control and it got 8 replies and the vid got a few more hits. It was then featured on KSP weekly (thanks xPDxTV) and the vid got more hits than any other vid I\u0027ve made, but the thread in mission control remained inactive. A little later someone else made a post about it in General Discussion and that thread is now 9 pages long (with 14 times more views). That thread in GeneralD also produced a noticeable spike (\u002B1000 hits) in the vid\u0027s view count graph (noticeable even after the mountain of a spike the KSP weekly feature produced). I\u0027d also posted the craft in the spacecraft exchange and that has got a high view count as its linked from the vid, but mission control is a dead section! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of new users still post their \u0022I made it to Mun\u0022 threads in General Discussion, which I think is great, they are actually seen and they get some encouragement from the community, if they post them in mission reports then they don\u0027t get seen and they don\u0027t get the encouragement that makes them feel like coming back with more (and in the early days of me playing KSP it was partly the enthusiasm of the community that really made KSP something special).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can understand the goal of having a more organised forum, but also I think that the first goal should be to have more active discussions and it should be structured to put content in the face of the majority of users. I think the mods are a bit hasty to move things out of general discussion before people have had a chance to see them (especially when taking different time zones into account).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt work we have a similar discussion forum; there is a general discussion analog called the hub, everything goes there to start with and things stay there for a minimum of 3-4 days. Once something has been seen by most people and has had a good initial discussion it is then filed into a more relevant sub topic. Topics in the hub that don\u0027t generate interest fall off the first page but they still remain in the hub for a few days, once they fall to about the 3rd/4th page (or are 3-4 days old) they are filed/archived. There is also a most-recent-first log of what topics have been moved where that is accessible from the hub.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aim of this system is fast access to new information by as many people as possible without them needing to spend much time on it. People only ever need to check the first two pages of the hub to quickly see everything new that\u0027s going on, they don\u0027t have to trawl the many sub sections and very few people miss out on seeing new topics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think the sub-sections of the forum are a bad idea but it is just a fact that very few people check them. It\u0027s become quite discouraging to post in those sub-sections. Most people check GD frequently so I think that is where new topics should start out and I think they should stay there long enough that most people get a chance to see them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to ask the mods to be less efficient in filling topics please! File things that have fallen to the 2nd or 3rd page and give us more chance to see things and take into account that many of us don\u0027t have the time to check all the sub sections. It would also be really helpful to have a sticky thread in GD where the mods record (most recent first) which topics have been moved and to where.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease don\u0027t take this as a criticism of the mods (who I think do a great and difficult job) and this isn\u0027t meant to sound like I\u0027m telling you what to do, it\u0027s just a suggestion to ponder.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CoriW","CreatedById":57866,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T13:49:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022katateochi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022katateochi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E(.......)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, that pretty much sums it up, I agree.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpsterMan","CreatedById":32671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T13:56:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, I\u0027ll post in your thread so I can sub myself to it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SolarLiner","CreatedById":41047,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T14:14:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI never had such \u0022fav\u0022 forums or sub ones.

Although I do like the idea brought up by \u0022katateochi\u0022 to have things in one place for a couple days, then move it to an appropriate sub-forum, it does still have a couple flaws in how disorganized things could get with the number of threads that are actually created and posted on in a day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the number of sub-forums in the \u0022Add-ons\u0022 forum, I never suggested that any sub-forums be merged or removed. All I suggested is that one of the sub-forums be moved so that it is no longer the sub-forum of an unrelated sub-forum. The reason I suggested that is because right now a lot of people don\u0027t even know there is a forum for Out-of-Game Add-ons because it\u0027s hidden away where nobody would expect it to be located, inside the In-Game Add-ons sub-forum, when really Out-of-Game and In-Game Add-ons really aren\u0027t related to each other in any way except for being \u0022Add-ons\u0022, which is exactly why they should both be located under the main \u0022Add-ons\u0022 forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RocketPilot573\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RocketPilot573\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETools and Applications forum?

Although anybody can agree to the idea a thread should in principle go in the most fitting subsection and no one is actually disagreeing with a moderator for enforcing this, there can be a legitimate discussion about what effects a certain subdivision has and whether such a subdivision is desirable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECertain overly specific subdivision might be having the undesired effect of placing some threads, which many might enjoy, in a very specific sub forum which because of its low action doesn\u0027t get much views.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECoriW\u0027s case is an excellent example. Reasonable people could disagree on whether giving tools and applications their separate forums is beneficial. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor one I do know it exists but I never go there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe subdivision is also in some way arbitrary. Not in the sense that there isn\u0027t a fundamental difference between ingame and outgame add-ons, but in the sense that we could imagine other subdivisions like for example between part, plugins and part-plugin combination mods which we don\u0027t make.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think everybody can appreciate why you might want the questions and discussions of modders seperate of the general game discussion, both for the sake of the developers as the rest of the community. The same might be said for those wanting to post lengthy fan fiction, you\u0027re either in to that or you don\u0027t. But for this subdivision the reason is not so apparent other than that we can make the distinction. For example like threads are currently marked with [Part] and [Plugin] in the showcase section there could be another [Tool] marker just as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at the relevant sizes (Add-on Releases and Projects Showcase Threads: 651 Posts: 68,485 Tools and Applications Threads: 57 Posts: 2,164) the order this subdivision brings is questionable. (I\u0027ll bet this subdivision was made before it was a problem.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome diversion of topics on a subforum isn\u0027t necessarily a bad thing.

Too bad, because I and lots of others never go to fan works just to find out a short and passable little comment like this among the often longer, more serious stuff which we\u0027re at least right now not interested in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike katateochi already said, besides order there is a relevance to having activity and, maybe more base, to having views when you post something. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the suggestion of using the new posts functionality as a preferred way to use the forums.

The reason for this is simple, because even if the person has never actually browsed or used those forums they have seen them multiple times every time they go to the root forum, so subconsciously their brain takes a note that those forums exist. However in the case of the \u0022Tools and Applications\u0022 forum, if mentioned a lot of people quickly get confused and ask where that forum is simply because they never even knew that it existed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo with that being said, the solution I\u0027m proposing may seem like something that wouldn\u0027t really effect much, but in reality I think it really would, simply because while on the root forum people would see the Tools and Applications forum and even if they weren\u0027t browsing it, they would indeed know it existed.
