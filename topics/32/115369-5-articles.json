Does it have an ISRU unit?\n\nYes I\u0027m onto next-generation craft now. They all (mostly) have ISRU units on board along with anything else you might need to explore the Kerbol system. I have no need for space stations or mining bases or transports, I can do everything quicker and easier with my fleet of starships. I\u0027ll still build a few bases/stations but I like to keep then total number of active flights on my save games less than 20 - and with that number I could have infrastructure all over the Kerbol system. Then I would just need to build a ship that can go as far as Minmus and it will be able to go anywhere after that.
