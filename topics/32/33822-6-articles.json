Just had returned from a hard work\u0027s day (I was doing 15h00-23h00 shift) and finished supper, so most likely around midnight/midnight and a half. Now since this was Friday, it was STAR CITIZEN\u0027S NIGHT ! (oh yeah), and I found myself on the chat room, talking to a few people there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo time was passing and around 2am, someone called \u0022Dr. Hawk\u0022 dumps a link about streaming somekind of game... Now I rarely ever watch live stream stuff, but I was bored of the limited subjects of conversation on the forums. So I clicked it, and I see him playing some kind of new game. He\u0027s in orbit of what seems like the Moon with a quad engine lander... he\u0027s asking where he should land. Everyone sais the DarkSide. and so he does it, after 2 tries, he sets his (well illuminated) lander on the moon\u0027s darkside, walks about a bit and takes off to return to earth. He lands but crashing 2 of his 4 engine (commented about landing with nukes would irradiate everywhere on the countryside).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I was getting very tired, and I asked him what game that was... \u0022Well that\u0027s Kerbal Space Program!\u0022 he said, and dropped a link of where to get it from. I don\u0027t know why, but I got a good feeling of that one, and it was only something like 25 box. I thought \u0022what the hell\u0022, bought it, ran the install, and went to bed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next day I installed this, and was hooked. Took me forever to achieve my first orbit, and I kept staging wrong... couldn\u0027t understand why. Watched a few vids by Scott Manley (was hooked on his stuff to after that) and managed to stage correctly. A week later I was also landing on the Mun (yeay!). I recently revisited all my very first designs that I had give up on, and after experienced tweaks here and there, most of them where pretty good designs, if only a tad heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a game that was not (still is not) finished, it was *FAR* better than the recent crap I had gotten in the last year or two for PC, if not longer than that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you Squad, Thank you. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:kiss:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
