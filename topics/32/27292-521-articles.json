The jet engines come on and rev up, then the RT-10s ignite as the launch clamps release. These get the plane climbing immediately, without the need of the runway, so I can use more parts than my SPH allows. It\u0027s a rather straightforward flight to orbit, and Engineer Nelton got it to a ~90km circular, though I think I wouldn\u0027t like him to fly it without the Okto\u0027s stability assistance. Those fins on the payload satellite ensure that the CoL is in the same location relative to the CoM with or without the payload attached, which is nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was at this moment that I realised that the target orbit for the satellite went around the other way. My quicksave in orbit (and quickload to same) had removed the ability to revert the flight, so I decided to go ahead and salvage it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/RAkxxk.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RAkxxk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/at13IH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022at13IH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/xvNIvB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xvNIvB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, I disabled access to 55 units of the plane\u0027s oxidiser, then burned prograde until the rest of the plane\u0027s oxidiser was used. Those 55 units would be reserved for deorbiting the plane to go to the survey locations and land. Next, I detached the payload, and had it raise its apoapse to half-way between the target periapse and apoapse. Then, a burn retrograde until that became prograde, reversing the orbit and bringing the periapse to 1Mm. A prograde burn with some radial components put the periapse in about the right place, and a burn at the descending node fine tuned that and matched inclination. Finally, I made a burn at periapse to get the target orbit, and there was still a bit of fuel left over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the first burn of the payload satellite, I worked out some timings. Using a Keostationary satellite I put up for another contract a while ago, I determined how many orbits it would take to bring the survey locations almost exactly under the plane\u0027s periapse, and from there how long before I wanted to deorbit. I also checked the times of the burns for the satellite and Seanski. It turned out that the satellite would perform its reverse, then about an hour later was Seanski\u0027s escape from Mun SoI (and thus his burn), then an hour and a half before Nelton\u0027s deorbit in the plane, and about another hour after his landing was the satellite\u0027s inclination burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/VrXGnp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VrXGnp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/0mMebq.png\u0022 alt=\u00220mMebq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/IXPXrD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022IXPXrD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurning the last of the fuel brought the periapse just under 190km, so it was clear that Seanski would have to use the miraculously-refilling EVA pack, get out, and push. I determined that it was probably easiest to push from the bottom of the capsule, so one long shove later his periapse was down below 55km - I left 0.25 units to get back in. Now, that\u0027d work, but it would take several passes, so I got Seanski out to push again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/q0MrvN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022q0MrvN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/Y1aLeG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Y1aLeG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know the exact point, but there is a particular height of periapse where the camera angle of a Kerbal on EVA changes. It\u0027s somewhere between 20 and 50km, I know that much. Every time Seanksi\u0027s periapse crossed this mystery point, the camera turned 90 degrees, changing the \u0022downward\u0022 direction between radial in (below) and antinormal (above). This was rather irritating when adjusting the periapse to roughly 25km, and when subsequently trying to get back in, but I managed. This trajectory should bring Seanski home without any additional passes, I think, and that\u0027ll be about a Kerbin day away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/8LRqrT.png\u0022 alt=\u00228LRqrT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/ZRxrio.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZRxrio.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, Nelton\u0027s flight back. I used all the reserved oxidiser to deorbit with the 30km periapse roughly at the survey locations, which were both \u0026gt;18km on pretty much the opposite side of Kerbin to KSC. In fact, these were the two left over from the mission I sent my VTOL on. Making use of the wings and drag to adjust course, I got the westernmost survey location first, then fired up the jets to fly to the other one, climbing back over 18km altitude in time to get that too. Next, I cut throttle, quicksaved, and glided down to the grasslands below. Deceleration and low speed, low altitude behaviour was horrible, uncontrolled loops, spins and sudden lifts all over the place, but fortunately Nelton had parachutes to make the landing easier. This still wasn\u0027t great, but I guess it\u0027s because I never checked against the dry CoM when I adjusted the wings. Perhaps there was a bit much lift, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, Nelton did eventually land safely, and was recovered - and the combined rewards from the contracts brought my funds to 1038k, finally enough to upgrade my R\u0026amp;D centre to level 2.
