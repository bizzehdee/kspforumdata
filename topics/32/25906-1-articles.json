However well I was transistioning between kerbin and the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn a thought hit me, Is there a more efficient altitude delta V to place them at (i think as it stands the 30km M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn orbit takes about 800m/s delta V to launch to). However im not the best at space fysiks so i couldnt even think of where to start on calculating acurate launch altitudes, although in my mind the lowest orbit possible without scraping mountains would be best so around 4k for the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and 6k for Minmus, however this may lead to some real interesting launches of kethane tankers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone worked this out / is there a way to easily calculate this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny input apreciated\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECtrl\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: Literally every single one of my M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn orbits since 0.12 have been at 30-50km with the exception of comm and mapping satelites.

I personally think it\u0027s quite a good idea for the orbits to be pretty low, but not too low you risk smacking into the surface. 30-50k is probably fine for the Mun, and I\u0027d personally go for 15-20k around Minmus \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T18:50:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn theory, the most efficent orbit is the lowest one , as you can take full advantage of the Oberth effect. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo as low as you can.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BeefTenderloin","CreatedById":25612,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T18:52:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022fysiks\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a very creative spelling \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhysics, for further use.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spatzimaus","CreatedById":57215,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T19:08:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt depends on what you want to use the orbit for. In general, lower orbits are best, but there are a few notable exceptions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1\u0026gt; Things you want to dock with on the way DOWN into the gravity well, when you might not be able to reach a lower orbit safely. For instance, if you\u0027ve got an interplanetary vessel that gets back to Kerbin but doesn\u0027t have enough fuel to land; you\u0027ll want to dock with something to refuel, and a station in high orbit is less fuel to do that with than one in low orbit. This is especially useful for Jool, where you\u0027ll need fuel to do a rocket landing on four of the five moons; placing a fuel bunker out by Pol is a good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; A station you want to use as a refueling waypoint for something coming from outside the gravity well that intends to again leave the gravity well afterwards without stopping on the actual body you orbit. Take a Minmus station as an example; if your intention is to have a place for a vessel to refuel before proceeding on out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI, then the option that uses the least fuel is to not even put the station in Minmus\u0027 SOI; you\u0027d be better off putting it in a Kerbin orbit. Putting it in Minmus orbit takes a little more fuel, but makes refueling the station from the surface MUCH easier, so you\u0027ll do that instead. But if you\u0027re trying to minimize the amount of fuel a vessel requires to enter the Minmus well, slow down, meet the fuel station, and then leave again, then a higher orbit is better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3\u0026gt; When you\u0027re flying a vessel that\u0027s extremely hard to maneuver. The more massive the body, the more \u0022curved\u0022 a low orbit is. If you try docking in very low Kerbin orbit (or better yet, Eve) you\u0027ll find that your approach vector \u0022drifts\u0022 to the side; a straight burn towards the target just won\u0027t work well; you\u0027ll end up wasting a lot of RCS fuel to compenstate. Higher orbits are much better for this. (Also, less chance of clipping any atmosphere or terrain if you screw up your approach.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4\u0026gt; There\u0027s probably something involving bi-elliptic transfers, where you\u0027d want a station at a far-out radius just to be used for these transfers, but the bi-elliptic doesn\u0027t involve circularizing at the outer radius, so I\u0027m not sure how you could use this to your advantage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, though, you want to go as low as you possibly can, unless you\u0027re trying for a geosynchronous orbit of some kind.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CtrlAltEL1TE","CreatedById":2847,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T19:29:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheers guys, Just leaving my orbits at 30km (M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn) and 15km (Minmus) for now. Done some experimenting on the moon and your orbital velocity at 30km(ok 29km close enough ^^) is 533m/s versus a 550m/s at 2km, Wouldnt recommend the 2km orbit either for obvious reasons, those being that A. Its extremely hard to dock incoming from Kerbin and B. It went on rails when i warped focused on something else and decided to lower its orbit by ~500m thus smashing into a mountain. I doubt ~20m/s would make a massive difference for exploiting the Oberth Effect but I rarely go interplanatery from my M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn base anyway, I got 2 refueling depot\u0027s over kerbin for that (one at 80km another at 100km).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help guys\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spatzimaus","CreatedById":57215,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T19:44:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CtrlAltEL1TE\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CtrlAltEL1TE\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt went on rails when i warped focused on something else and decided to lower its orbit by ~500m thus smashing into a mountain. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, this brings up another one: planets have limits on what sort of time acceleration you can use at a given altitude. For instance, Gilly\u0027s gravity is so low that orbits around it are going MAYBE 20m/s, which means it takes days to do a single orbit, but if your orbit is below 8km then you can\u0027t use any kind of time acceleration. (Given that the highest terrain is something like 7km up, you wouldn\u0027t want to put a station that low anyway, but you never know.) In most planets\u0027 cases, the comfortable altitudes allow 50x acceleration, but sometimes you want to go more than that and it won\u0027t let you. Higher orbits avoid this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most notable example is that on Kerbin, a station below ~120km is much more limited on acceleration than a higher one, so even if the lower orbit is better for Oberth work, you\u0027re usually better off putting your big space station above that line for practical reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fyrem","CreatedById":57131,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T19:48:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Spatzimaus said, .. your desired orbital alt will depend on what the station is FOR, and who is intended to visit it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BeefTenderloin","CreatedById":25612,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T19:50:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edouble post, derp.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tavert","CreatedById":57383,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T19:50:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can always switch craft and warp to pass the time in something else.
