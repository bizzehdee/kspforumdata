Together with science these 3 things are supposed to put restraints on your missions - the cost of each part is actually used, so sending out a few cheap probes may be a good way to earn science if you are short on cash. Reputation is also a factor - losing kerbals or failing contracts lowers your reputation which makes some things harder to get (I don\u0027t know if it was said but it may cost more to hire Kerbals if you\u0027ve lost several). An unmanned probe carries far less risk since there is no Kerbal to lose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m actually quite happy with the mechanics of science in .23, it is more balanced (less spam) and has less busy work - even though I found my recovery systems in .22 interesting it got really time consuming when I went to Duna. The only thing I think that still needs major work is that the science costs need to be adjusted to account for all the available biomes being added. If you check out my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/62464-Dave-s-Voyage-%28-23-career-log-PIC-HEAVY-ANI-GIFs%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E.23 career\u003C/a\u003E you\u0027ll see that even with 4 completely normal missions you can earn an insane amount of science compared to the tech tree costs. I think the first few tiers, up to the 45 cost items, are well balanced for the science you can earn at that stage. I might be inclined to see the 90 science items increased just a little, maybe to 135. But I think the items that really need a cost increase are the 160 and above - instead of 160, 300 and 550 I think those tiers might work better at something like 300, 600 and 1200 or more. You want there to be some reason to go beyond the Mun and Minmus for science, and your first interplanetary mission should have at least some challenge (keeping things like nuclear engines out of play until you\u0027ve at least visited another planet with a probe should be a definite goal here).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aragosnat","CreatedById":60487,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T17:55:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo disagree with 1.

The data you gain is only part of the science. The rest come from did it work to checking out the part back at Kerbin to see what type of stresses where placed upon it during its travels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Do agree something like this would be useful.

I think you should start with 1950s era tech, with tree progression focusing on parts that actually make a difference (like the LT-N).
