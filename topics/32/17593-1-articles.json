That is 42,340,000,000,000,000,000kg. In order to change its orbital velocity by 1m/s, you would need to give it a momentum change of 4.234E19kg m/s. Assuming a rocket exhaust velocity of even 5000m/s, you\u0027d need around 1E16kg of fuel exhausted out your rocket engine to get that velocity change. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat mass is something aproximately equivilent to the mass of all of the water in the north american great lakes. It is a LOT of mass. And this is only to get 1m/s of velocity change. If we wanted to stop its orbit say, 270m/s of velocity change, then youd need 270 times more reaction mass... Think of this as something closer to the mass of all of greenlands glaciers, looking at 3E18kg of fuel now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we then consider that we have to get this fuel from the surface of kerbin to minimus, call it a delta V of 8000m/s, assuming KSP engines with ISP = 300, hence Ve = 3000m/s, we require about 14x the payload mass of fuel to get our fuel to minimus. We\u0027re now looking at about 4E19kg of fuel on the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo visualize this mass, think of the mass of all of antarcticas icesheets, and you get a pretty good idea. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince kerbin is much smaller then earth, and has a mass of 5.29E22kg, we are looking at burning about 1/1000th kerbins mass in order to stop minimus in its orbit. The mass of earths water is about 1/1000th of earths mass, so we can assume the same about kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, in order to stop minimus in irs orbit you would need to use a reaction mass equivilent to completely draining kerbins oceans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you intend to do this, I reccomend you find some way to distract greenpeace when you drop the hose in the ocean to start draining it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tk5800thesecond","CreatedById":16577,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-23T15:29:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure they wont mind when I say \u0022there was an oil spill\u0022 XD\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
