I enjoy the shielded docking port for use on spaceplanes and rockets, for their use and looks rolled into a relatively less massive form (although the inline port has a nice animation). I like the inline reaction wheel for its stabilizing effect and the AVR8 winglet for its size and function; the telus ladders for their use and cool animations.
