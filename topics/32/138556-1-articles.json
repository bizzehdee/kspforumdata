The shadows in other games get around it by updating their positions every few (milli)seconds. Since KSP\u0027s world is an actual star system in constant motion with all the objects tracked constantly, the shadows update in realtime (or near enough), making them shimmer. If you have the Scatterer mod you\u0027ll be able to increase the shadow biases to mitigate this effect, but inflating these enough to make it go away completely messes up the positioning of shadows in another way (they will be offset away from the object casting them, leaving a gap between ground contact and the shadow).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://docs.autodesk.com/3DSMAX/15/ENU/3ds-Max-Help/index.html?url=files/GUID-C6CFDCFD-93D8-48C8-B9CF-063C3AB56B98.htm,topicNumber=d30e610772\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://docs.autodesk.com/3DSMAX/15/ENU/3ds-Max-Help/index.html?url=files/GUID-C6CFDCFD-93D8-48C8-B9CF-063C3AB56B98.htm,topicNumber=d30e610772\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-15T22:41:21Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2016 10:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
