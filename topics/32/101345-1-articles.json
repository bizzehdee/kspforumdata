The trouble is, I\u0027m not sure where best to begin learning. The internet is like a vast ocean, and a good learning resource a particularly rare fish--one can reel in catches while still coming up empty-handed. A good education is key to becoming proficient in a field, but without outside advice, a layman\u0027s eyes cannot easily differentiate between quality learning tools and sub-adequate ones. I know many people who frequent these forums are well-versed on the subject, and it is my hope that you might share with me and others the best resources you know of for learning the concepts and math behind physics and its sub-fields.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany thanks! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T01:26:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s KSB? :|\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, do you mean KS\u003Cstrong\u003EP\u003C/strong\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt uses patched conics for orbital projections.
