Or at least what appears to be one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I sent up a Shuttle Spacelab type mission last night around this time, and because I had to go to bed I just let the game sit and had it as a screensaver, like I might do with the ISS HDEV page. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I woke up this morning to go to work, my shuttle was still in orbit and was just fine. So I went to work. Now, some 9 hours later, I come home and inexplicably my shuttle flight had popped up with the \u0022Catastrophic Failure\u0022 box. After looking at the flight log, it appears that inexplicably around hour 15 or so of the flight (which was like, 3 Kerbal Days), my shuttle somehow went from a stable 185x120 orbit to crashing straight into the launchpad. However, the camera had not moved from I think is a point in the orbit close to apoapsis. It was as if the ship just exploded and I was stuck in its last location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, barring someone breaking into my apartment and somehow causing my ship to explode, I believe I have run into a bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, don\u0027t maintain an active flight for 15 hours, at least.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T23:20:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmmm...
