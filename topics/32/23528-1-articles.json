Initially, it was positioned like \u0022We\u0027d post here everything devs have posted anywhere for the last week, so you don\u0027t have to read thru reddit, watch all the KSPTV streams, Nova\u0027s twitter and KSP facebook page to get all the new info\u0022. Then it turned quickly into \u0022This would be another source you need to check out to get all the new info\u0022.
