So if you have an aircraft that travels at ridiculous speeds (2000\u002B m/s) and you want to minimise the number of intakes then this is the one to go for. \u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Circular Intake, Small Circular Intake and XM-G50 are dead after Mach 3.5 but don\u0027t suffer a drop-off at \u0026lt;Mach 1.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Adjustable Ramp Intake (Radial) and\u00A0Adjustable Ramp Intake keep going until Mach 8. They make good spaceplane intakes and weigh less than the Shock Cone.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy little SSTO only gets up to Mach 4 at 30km, so the 50% mach-caused intake drop-off\u00A0at that speed doesn\u0027t matter as there is no useful air by then anyway.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-26T23:07:41Z\u0022 title=\u002201/26/2016 11:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Foxster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fourfa","CreatedById":151713,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-26T23:14:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreat info, thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Val","CreatedById":126227,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-27T10:09:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113764-foxster/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022113764\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113764-foxster/\u0022\u003E@Foxster\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0I saw your thread in Gamplay Questions and remembered that someone did research it.
