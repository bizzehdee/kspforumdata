I recommend Eve Rocks and Jool-5. I just did a Jool-5 (maybe I\u0027ll get around to posting a mission report) and it was really hard on the Jebediah level.

The flight computer is limited in what it can do (I doubt you can land something with it), but it can help complete maneuvers during comms blackouts.\n\n4) master the system\n\nEstablishing self-sufficient colonies is both extremely difficult and extremely rewarding.
