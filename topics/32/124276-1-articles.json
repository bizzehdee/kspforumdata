As long as you have an ISRU setup, they\u0027re like big fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, Mun mining is more to support Mun operations not for export. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna and Ike and all other places I prefer to combine mining rig with tug who also is the first base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBase get extended with an second base later with lab and more crew quarters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emining tug is an spaceship itself with LV-N often some chemical to so you can land on Duna or other medium gravity places. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo then establish base extensions you will refuel the second base in orbit from tug and land it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus is special as you want to send fuel down to LKO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use KAS so I land an tanker on Minmus, connect to miner and fill it, without KAS, its easiest to take base to low orbit and refuel tanker. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven simpler to take base to LKO, this is less efficient as you have to drag the mining setup and crew quarter all the way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/bzyUkjy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bzyUkjyl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bzyUkjyl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my setup. Tanker is three long MK3 tanks. miner is 4 medium length 3.75 meter tanks. I use an rover to connect the tanker and base as its more than 50 meter from base. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use old 3.75 meter core stages as fuel depots in LKO, they are set up with probe, power, reaction wheels, docking ports and KAS, one also has an small station for LKO services. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have issues with how much oxidiser versus fuel you use it might be practical to take some ore down to LKO and have an refinery in orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI simply make sure I store enough and then adjust the next shipment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T18:36:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeems to me the best solution would be to create a mining operation near the tourist Mun base (that I haven\u0027t built yet) and refuel the lander, which shouldn\u0027t need much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T20:00:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scarecrow88\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Scarecrow88\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESeems to me the best solution would be to create a mining operation near the tourist Mun base (that I haven\u0027t built yet) and refuel the lander, which shouldn\u0027t need much.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou problem is the ground refueling, KAS is perfect here but still require that you land 50 or closer from miner. 100 with an extender. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout KAS you will need an fuel truck with the claw. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yes this is an decent plan for an repeated opperation. My standard qualification run for new kerbals is, usualy pickup in LKO around the mun or minmus. Orbit around Mun then of to Minmus to land and refuel, outside of kerbin SOI, then back to LKO. I might take an Mun flyby if I have kerbals from Minmus. deliver kerbals to shuttle, refuel taxi and repeat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T23:25:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, in a previous incarnation of KSP I set up a Mun exploration adventure. I used a vehicle similar in operation to the Eagle from Space 1999 to get around, and set up a lot of fuel dumps as waypoints. The method of refuelling the Mun Hopper was to land near a fuel dump, and use a rover fitted with a tank and a claw to ferry fuel from the tanks in the dump to the Hopper.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
