It was before I\u0027d unlocked a solar panel, and managed to severely underestimate the power requirements for a probe core and RemoteTech link back to Kerbin. I\u0027d managed to perform all of my science experiments at Mun, but didn\u0027t have enough power to either transmit results or survive the entire trip back. So in a last-ditch survival attempt I increased the minimum pressure of the probe\u0027s chutes to maximum, decreased their full opening height to a few hundred metres, and deployed them while still in Mun\u0027s SOI. \n\nReentry was pretty hairy. I was able to tweak it to a reasonable angle, but completely misjudged the attitude, so it came in sideways. There was enough fuel left in the tank to push the CoM down and it swung around to point engine-first soon enough, but I suspect the extra heating was what caused the Stayputnik core to explode soon after.\n\nLuckily both chutes survived, but the minimum opening pressure on Kerbin is *very* low. I thought losing the core was the end of it, but they finally popped open almost at the last minute, and it finally dropped to the side of a hill, tipped, and rolled out of control for a while before coming to rest under a tree. \n\nI used the science points from that flight to research solar panels immediately."},{"CreatedByName":"hugix","CreatedById":55379,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T01:07:45Z","Content":"I always do some roleplaying in my head when I perform certain actions.
