It\u0027s more of a \u0027wondering\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was just wondering. If you\u0027ve ever looked up KSP on youtube, and looked beside the Scott Manley videos, you\u0027re bound to run into Danny2462\u0027s videos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor, him, everything glitches out. He drives a car off of the runway, his game glitches out. He makes a rocket blow up into a bunch of pieces, and ends up with hovering fuel tanks and girders flying skyward. He breaks off a few solar panels, his game glitches hilariously. He crashes a plane, the game glitches and he has an endlessly running engine. He pokes a rod into the ground, and he has a runway flying in orbit or a glitched out map view. I can go on and on like this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve crashed quite a few planes, had quite a few high-momentum collisions, and similar stuff. My game almost never glitches out like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s all caught on 1080p camera, which i imagine takes up quite a bit of space, so it doesn\u0027t seem like he records huge amounts of footage to pick out the glitches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot that i don\u0027t like the video\u0027s - they\u0027re absolutely hilarious, it\u0027s an awesome side of KSP to have fun with and to watch.
