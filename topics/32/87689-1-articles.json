You build a gigantic, dark room, with robotic sorters inside. Whenever a creeper spawns, it is dropped out the back of the rocket, where it intersects a bolt of electricity from the ship. Thus both supercharging and detonating it. The rest of the mobs spawned are just jettisoned as a reaction-mass drive, like a low-tech Ion drive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOOOH.
