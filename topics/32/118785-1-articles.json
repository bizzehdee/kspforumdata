Thank god for KAC, but I\u0027m doing way too many things at once. I launch a probe to Jool, do stuff on Duna, get more science, get a other Jool contract, so send another probe. Do stuff on Minmus, send something back from Duna and get 20 other things on the go while I\u0027m waiting for my first probe to get to Jool. Finally gets there, do science, return to Kerbin. Second probe for Jool is only halfway there....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure you see what I mean and run into the same. I feel like just leaving my Kerbals on the other planets for a few years to time warp just so I can get my probes to and from Jool but it seems like a waste of time for the poor Kerbals on the moons and on Duna... But I get anxious to get the missions to far away planets done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you do? Leave them and time warp? Or do you just keep going and pile up the missions while probes and ships are on very long interplanetary trips?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T20:04:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s perfectly normal.
