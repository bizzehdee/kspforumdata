It\u0027s actually more of a hold back. Let me explain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we know 0.21 will break saves, and this is causing lots of players noobs and pros to set back from KSP until the new update. Now, the devs did say that the reason the saves are breaking is because of the whole crew management. As a result, they added the redone textures/models of the planets knowing that they will no doubtfully break saves. From my understanding from the media group, dev blogs, and such, told me that; Kerbin, Mun, Eve, Duna, and Moho have been redone. From the pictures and, they look fantastic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the one thing that peeves me the most, is that other planets/moons didn\u0027t get an update. Now, I completely understand why, it\u0027s a pain in the *** to add those craters and ask your artists to remake HD textures and so on (Not being sarcastic, honestly mean that). It\u0027s just that, these planets/moons would look so great, however knowing that the whole texture/remodel thing breaks saves.... I\u0027m not too sure about how people are going to react to when they don\u0027t play KSP for 1 month because of the saves breaking for 0.21, then when the others moons/planets are redone saves break once again, and people end up not continuing what they were doing after 0.21 (asuming that this update comes out in 0.22)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in a nutshell, I actually want the devs to overhaul the whole system and finish the rest of the planets/moons, before they release 0.21 with only Moho, Eve, Mun, Kerbin and Duna. Unless there is a way to make it compatible with saves of 0.21 and above depending on when you choose to add the redone planets/moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom my understanding there is 10 planets/moons that must be redone, those being; Gilly, Minmus, Ike, Dres, (Jool?), Laythe, Vall, Tylo, Bop, Pol, Eeloo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I\u0027m not sure if the developers were entirely thinking of remaking these moons and planets... maybe it wasn\u0027t planned, then I\u0027m completely sorry for asking so much. Otherwise, I\u0027d rather wait longer for 0.21 so the developers can withhold saves breaking for future updates, and add these wonderful planets \u0026amp; moons. This is mainly for the sake of those who like to build massive space stations, Bases, or just get something into orbit without having to realize that in the future, it was all mere \u0027waste of time\u0027 (Maybe not the best word choice... Maybe practice?). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully the Squad can read this and some people can agree with me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESincerely, \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlaskafish\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"orangexception","CreatedById":72566,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T14:53:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScope creep is bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you\u0027re asking for would basically be ruining this entire release cycle.

To expect something like you are suggesting is a tall order for any development team in this stage of development. Key word there is \u0027development\u0027. There are draw-backs to developing a game, and \u0027breaking\u0027 your saves is one of them. We are extremely lucky that we have the ability to work with the development teams and shape how this game turns out. Why not keep the version you have your large stations on, and continue enjoying the new releases on a separate install? Anything you have to do over from a new version will just make you more efficient at whatever task that is. I am expecting my saves to be broken many more times before the final release.

IMHO, this is a ridiculous idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs stated above, this is an alpha staged game. The fact we can have updates that don\u0027t break saves isn\u0027t what it should be, it\u0027s a real gift. The developers are literally holding back to break saves for us. I\u0027m pretty sure if it wasn\u0027t for the community that plays the game, they would theoretically break saves on every single update. They\u0027re just being well thought and plan things out to put it in the best way possible for us. They tested the idea for the Mun mainly, and now they\u0027re gonna see how it works with the next few updates. I\u0027m 100% sure that the Mun is gonna change again before 1.0, and so will all the planets. Saves will break again and again, changes will come, stuff will be done, and updates shall be.

But it\u0027s far from being a final product and something they can release. If they were to get that out then, You would likely be angry at the amount of bugs in it and scream it over the forums. The amount of bugs in a version isn\u0027t proportional to the amount of content, or even the amount of work put into it. Bugs appear for no reason and at unexpected place, and you can\u0027t know how different parts of the coding are gonna react together until you test it. And that\u0027s what they\u0027re doing. Yes, some people are angry, but I can tell by far that those people form a minority.

You won\u0027t admit that teasing people for so long and QA testing that takes half of development time is any bad. You accept and praise every step they make. I know this forum is just a hugbox , but cmon be honest with yourself. It\u0027s not like this update brings any big content like all versions before 0.19 did. And they take even longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh ho there. I\u0027m not defender of Squad, I defend solely what is right. Squad aren\u0027t god, they are not perfect, they make mistakes and some things they do are still rough on me, but your attack is unjustified. As I said, the time needed to correctly test everything is far from being proportional to the development time. Some updates can be quick on testing, others not. That\u0027s nothing to make a fuss about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I think you are underevaluating the assets brought to us in .19 and .20 because you totally overlooked infrastructure and backend work. .16, .17 and .18 were all content updates. They were all updates who brought us new stuff and made everyone happy. Problem is, after a while, you need to optimize. You need to return in your code and reshape things to be able to still add some more stuff over. If you don\u0027t you\u0027ll end up wasting space, time, and therefore money. The last two updates we focused on working with the infrastructure and the coding. Those are all necessary foundations to the future updates that are inbound. You can\u0027t build a building by starting with the 30th floor, you have to build the foundations, the basement, the first, then second, and third floor, all the way up to the 30th floor. Even if the company that will own and that pays for the building is on the 30th floor and that all the other floors will be rented by small companies, you gotta start from the bottom to get up there. And that\u0027s what Squad is doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll remember you that you paid for a game in early alpha, not a complete product. You get the updates, but not to control what comes with the updates. You are not positioned in any way to tell Squad what to do, just as you aren\u0027t placed to tell Sony how to build the next Play Station, even if you preordered it. You paid to get it. IF that doesn\u0027t make you happy, the only thing I can suggest to you is to take a break from the game and come back when it\u0027s complete, you paid for it anyway. You can now proceed with your pointless joke on how that will be in 2025, the facts are still there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
