The smaller rover uses stock wheels, but it doesn\u0027t have enough crew for those contracts. I highly recommend using treads, though, simply because of the fact that they don\u0027t rip themselves apart under even minor shears. (They do have a very poor top speed, though.

The wheels don\u0027t have to touch the ground, the ports don\u0027t have to be reachable, etc., they just have to be on the craft (even inside a cargo bay).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my career I\u0027m still in the second tier of techs, and I\u0027ve got a 7-man lander (3-man pod plus hitchhiker) that I use for quick astronaut training.
