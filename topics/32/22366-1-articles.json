The model of Kerbin isn\u0027t entirely \u003Cem\u003Emodelled\u003C/em\u003E, so to speak. Most of it, especially the fine details, are procedurally generated to save on file sizes, which would otherwise require an extremely complex map of each and every planet, making KSP well over several GB in size. Because of these small random deviations, often the KSC or KSC2 will appear to \u0022float\u0022 a few metres above (and very occasionally be slightly buried) in the ground. It\u0027s a model in its own right, with a flat bottom, that\u0027s effectively just stamped on Kerbin, and sometimes it doesn\u0027t quite match up with terrain very well. In addition, because of this, the game renders ocean underneath the KSC/KSC2 models, which can be seen from certain angles, because it assumes the KSC/KSC2 is flush with the ground and doesn\u0027t bother rendering ground. I have a hunch there\u0027s a glitch with KSC2, where the ocean section underneath hasn\u0027t got the... (was it called occlusion culling, or something?) applied, where it doesn\u0027t render what you can\u0027t see, to save on VRAM. This is likely because the coding for KSC2 was done slightly differently (unintentionally, obviously) than the original KSC when it was put in, and they probably cut a few corners as it wasn\u0027t originally intended to stay in the main game until (perhaps) much later. I assume it works OK with the normal KSC, but KSC2 wasn\u0027t originally really intended to be left in the game and was one of two unintended ones left in because it made a good easter egg, so I assume they skipped the normal optimisations on it, because the devs\u0027 computers are (obviously) really top-notch systems. The third used to be on the Mun before they removed it, btw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s my theory why it\u0027s laggy around KSC2 for you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love to have a Dev check my theory, but they tend to be rather busy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
