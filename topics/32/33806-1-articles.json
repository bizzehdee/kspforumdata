It was a flight with landing, flagging, driving a rover around Eeloo and returning to kerbin. Now I only am playing stock (not even mechjb) so my return trajectory wasn\u0027t ideal (read I came into Kerbin super hot with 5km/s relative velocity from a high elliptical orbit from 120 billion m out).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing this was my first real attempt at atmosphere braking I picked a peraposis of 20,000m.
