I\u0027ve made an atmospheric version (replaced the RAPIER engines with Turbojets and added some more intakes) and I\u0027d quite like to replace all the Mk2 Rocket Fuel tanks with Mk2 Liquid Fuel tanks (i.e. so I\u0027m not carrying around unnecessary Oxidizer). I can\u0027t easily replace the tanks manually because they\u0027re integral to the structure of the vehicle, it would require a total disassembly.\n\nIs there a mod or other technique that can easily do this, or should I start editing the craft file?\n\nThanks"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T22:05:32Z","Content":"You could always just right-click the tank and drain the oxidizer, but I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s exactly what you\u0027re looking for.
