Some hours were spent messing around but mostly just trying to make a round trip. I looked at numerous rocket designs and watched YouTube videos to figure out the best way to do it. I had just enough fuel to make it home, I had 2.7 seconds of burn left to spare from an L10. The rocket flies pretty well, you just have to be a little careful when tilting 90 degrees early on in the atmosphere as there is a possibility it will tip over.\n\n![Mun%20Lander%20Successful_zpsgthi4fix.png](http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a513/jbakes727/Mun%20Lander%20Successful_zpsgthi4fix.png)\n\nHere\u0027s the rocket. Complete with 9 engines (1 M3, 6 T-30, and 2 L10\u0027s). 7 engines for lift off, 1 M3 and 6 T-30\u0027s with asparagus staging to get into orbit. The M3 runs out about midway circularizing an orbit, then the first L10 takes over to get into orbit. I then use the rest of the first L10 to orbit around mun. While circularizing the orbit around Mun the first L10 runs out and then I activate the 2nd L10 to complete the orbit, land, and get back home on Kerbin safe and sound.\n\nThe design could probably use little tweaks but for now it works good enough. \n\nIf anyone has anything to add feel free to do so (Ways to improve, share your own designs?)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T23:56:38Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 11:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jbakes**"},{"CreatedByName":"Trentendegreth","CreatedById":86953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T22:51:43Z","Content":"first off congrats on a mun landing its probably the most rewarding first. as far as tweaking the design in my opinion if its not broke dont fix it. it looks good and has the DV what more could you ask for."},{"CreatedByName":"jbakes","CreatedById":145551,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T23:09:48Z","Content":"Thank you and yes very rewarding because it\u0027s so difficult at first but now I can do it with minimal problems.\n\nAs for the design, I already did ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I fixed the tilting problem, all it needed was some wing-lets.

Setting up the transfer orbit is a little trickier, because it\u0027s further out and at an angle, but once you\u0027re there orbital maneuvers and landing are easy-peasy because of the low gravity.

And doing your first Mun with a 3-Kerbal pod no less. That\u0027s impressive. I was strictly a 1-K can-lander for the longest time. (I also did the really bad move of killing my orbital velocity about 70km up and dropping -- sloooowly. Monster ship, stupid delta-V (I was terrified of running out of fuel), can on top of an FT-400 with three legs (to save weight of course -- don\u0027t try that), ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif)).\n\nHaving now established my street-cred...\n\nI\u0027d call yours a good solid design overall. Kind of depends on your flight profile, really. Some critiques/suggestions:\n\n1) Your second L-10 Poodle is a bit overmuch. 250kN for what it\u0027s pushing is far more than you need to lift from Mun or Minmus and return. Go with a LV909 Terrier. You\u0027ll have to retro-burn sooner/longer, but it will save you 1.25 tons you could carry as extra fuel instead. Or you can \u0022cash\u0022 that in as extra delta-V. I know you mentioned being concerned about that.\n\n2) Your middle stage, the first L-10 Poodle should have more fuel loaded. You only have a Rockomax 200 there (if I\u0027m seeing right). Eight tons of fuel for a 1.75 ton engine isn\u0027t a very good fuel/mass ratio. I also note that your TWR for almost every stage is around 2. That\u0027s pretty up there for upper stages. Either add more fuel or get rid of this stage and merge the Rocko-200 with the orange tank. That\u0027s another 1.75 tons you\u0027d save overall = more delta-V.\n\n3) Your asparagus looks solid, but think about adding an FT-400 to the top of each. I also like to put a strut between my center tank and the bottom of the boosters to keep them from torquing into the main tank when the engines fire. YMMV.\n\n4) Add a 2.5m SAS (if you have it) to the first stage (or 2nd, if you decide to keep it). You should be fine after that, but having good SAS (and fins, you might need those too) it atmo is good.\n\n5) Move the landing legs down, right to the edge. You do not want to lose your return engine to landing impact 12,000km from home. If you can, use some girders to extend them outwards. A wide and low landing stance is very important for the first several landings...\n\n6) I\u0027d dump half of your RCS jets, it\u0027s best to rely on SAS for attitude control. Put the remaining four on the Command Pod\u0027s perimeter. For final adjustments to your re-entry.\n\n7) Solar panels should move to the Command Pod as well. Those things are your only renewable resource -- don\u0027t toss them until you have to. You could misjudge your re-entry, bounce off the atmosphere and have to circle around again. At which point you might have drained your batteries. What will you do then?\n\nHope all this doesn\u0027t sound like too much. Like I said, your design is a good solid start. Overpowered and under-fueled would be my main critique, but much better than my first Mun!\n\nFWIW, my \u0022standard\u0022 lander is a LV909 \u002B 1-K can, with Mission! \u0026 Science! and a Donut tank. Then a symmetric pair of radial decoups with fuel tanks. From each fuel tank there\u0027s two more decoups going to more fuel tanks (total: 2\u002B4) which end in landing legs. Fuel ducts connect everything of course. I use the fuel tanks instead of girders to widen my leg stance, and then eject them to save weight on the way back. @12 tons, I get about 4600 m/s overall which gives me multiple landings. Not very aerodynamic going up though -- got to work on that."},{"CreatedByName":"SelectHalfling0","CreatedById":105051,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T00:39:23Z","Content":"Congrats!

After that it is optimization in details.\n\nFor your future designs you should keep in mind that there is a sweet spot at which weight, thrust and fuel just match perfectly. Beyond that point you begin to add fuel just to lift the fuel you added. Sometimes less is more.\n\nAs an example of a definitely not perfect but also working design (which I guess weights a lot less, but is definitely not as beautiful as yours): this is my latest Munlander:\n\n![munlander.jpg](http://s12.postimg.org/een7k3mhp/munlander.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"sam.johnson841","CreatedById":104846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T09:04:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E As for the design, I already did ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I fixed the tilting problem, all it needed was some wing-lets.
