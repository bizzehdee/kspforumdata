And that is where I would prefer it stay. We manage to cause enough destruction trying to launch our kerbals into space than to expand it further into some militaristic direction. I am going to say it now, I am getting sick of these posts saying let\\\u0027s make KSP into a bombing simulator. Let\\\u0027s don\\\u0027t and let the modders say they did. KSP is a ballistic and aerospace flight simulator. It is meant to build something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you really want to destroy stuff, then collaborate with someone to make a mod for it. You will get what you want and actually feel better for it than just sitting there and begging for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forum, and take my reaction here as proof that this has been discussed to death already by the community.
