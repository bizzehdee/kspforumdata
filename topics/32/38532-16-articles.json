Push the wrong button while trying to end recording.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you see here, is that when the SAS is given control, it makes no attempt at all to return the orientation to the point where control was released. Instead, it simply brings the ship, rather slowly, to a halt. The ramping of the control force suggests it\u0027s actually getting closer to its aim point as it slows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe distance past the release point it gets is proportional to the rotational speed when the SAS is given control: The higher the speed, the further off the mark it goes before stopping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne key thing to note is that each time after it stops, it briefly reverses the controls a tiny amount before settling in. This suggests that it\u0027s not merely movement damping, and that there IS in fact a target attitude it\u0027s trying to reach. It\u0027s just not being set to the release point for some reason. The fact that it\u0027s proportional to the movement speed and the way it ramps down as it slows leads me to believe that it\u0027s probably resetting the target attitude constantly as it slows, probably being triggered by the SAS\u0027s control inputs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat this means in practical purposes is that whenever you release your controls to the SAS, whatever movement you\u0027re engaged in will continue for some distance, and when it\u0027s halted the SAS will hold it on a point that\u0027s more or less where it stopped at. This means that while making fine adjustments, unless you get the craft all but stopped before you let go, you\u0027re going to overshoot by some distance and have to re-correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is on Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit, KSP version 0.21.0.272 from Steam, on a fresh reinstall with no addons installed.

The fact that it lets it keep sliding on after you\u0027ve let go is a PROBLEM. it is a FAULT. it prevents you from being able to point exactly where you want to point, because you have to somehow manually get on that point and then stop there, which is extremely difficult at best. Sure, it holds once you\u0027ve gotten stopped, but it doesn\u0027t MATTER because it\u0027s absurdly difficult to get it to the attitude you WANT it to hold.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with the old SAS wasn\u0027t that it brought you back its target attitude: It was that it wouldn\u0027t ever change what its target attitude was unless you turned it off, then back on. If you tried to use your controls, instead of adjusting the target attitude to where you moved the craft to, it would keep the old target and actually fight you to try to get back to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new version allows controls to override it, so that isn\u0027t a problem anymore. What it SHOULD be doing, is setting the target attitude to the point where you release the controls. Not moving back to where you started, to where you let go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb\u0027s killrot function has worked exactly this way as long as I\u0027ve been using it, and it\u0027s why I haven\u0027t used stock SAS since I started using Mechjeb. When I first bought the game. in 0.16.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to see the behavior I\u0027m talking about as what it SHOULD have, try the \u0027KillRot\u0027 function on Mechjeb\u0027s SmartASS. It\u0027s basically identical to the old ASAS, only it allows for control input overrides and takes the point where you release as the new target attitude automatically, without having to turn it off. But it\u0027s just as inefficient and wobbly as the old SAS too. I\u0027d really like to use the new SAS at least some of the time, but as it stands it\u0027s unusable and vastly inferior to Mechjeb\u0027s very flawed KillRot implimentation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T09:33:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ComradeGoat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ComradeGoat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWatch the video I posted.
