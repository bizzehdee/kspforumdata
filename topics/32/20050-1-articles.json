Over 1129 days ago on the plat from of KSC. The Ship (Memorization I) took of to head where no other Kerbal Has gone before. The Jool System. Over 64 Million Miles from Kerbol, it took these 3 brave Kerbals 3 years and 1/4 to get to the Jool System. They achieved orbit around Jool and took many screenshots, but unfortunaly when i tryed to quit KSP today the game crashed and it never saved anything. They achieved a 300,000 by 300,000 orbit around Jool then headed off for a intersection of Laythe. They had a 134,000 periapsis around laythe and decided that they wanted to land on Laythe. I packed enough parachutes for a landing on Laythe and a return parachute to Kerbin too. They hit the atmoshpere around 2000 meters a second, while areo braking in the atmoshpere the parachutes deployed and all the Kerbals were happy because they went so far and so long to land on this moon. 20 meters from a island on Laythe something goes wrong. One of the landing legs will not deploy and when i click it to deploy it wont deploy. If this is a glitch plz someone say so. I hit the ground around 9-7 meters a second. And the ship tips over! and the command module separates form the fuel tank RCS tank, etc.......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEveryone at KSC was waiting for the news......... and they got it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the (made up conversation between Jeb and KSC.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Um.....
