I am looking at this thing, and I am SO seeing a lot of potential for this. The Stick is 3 axis: forward/back, left/right, Twist CW/CCW. It\u0027s designed to toggle between two sets of control sets for 6DOF stick control (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E/Attitude???). The thumbwheel is for cruise control (throttle). Those ten buttons up top are screaming Action Groups to me. The Switches are singing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, Gear, and Brakes. There are the 6 other yellow buttons, and the three buttons beside the stick... Maybe have the yellow buttons control lights, brakes, and gear, and use a pair of switches to lock abort and lock staging, and use the buttons near tyne stick for abort and staging... I can\u0027t tell if the large grey spot is a button or a logo plate. That\u0027d make a great stage or abort button too, if it\u0027s a button!\n\nSo...

Each of these games has a target audience. I have extensively played Farming Simulator 2013 on PS3, and I only havn\u0027t gone back to FS15 because I got hooked on Kerbal. The real appeal of Farming Sim games is the acquisition of bigger and better toys, and the ability to so more stuff. Ironically, Kerbal was the next logical step for me to follow... Trying to get better equipment, managing a budget, a workforce, and snagging those coveted new fields... Its very equatable to unlocking new R\u0026D tiers, managing my budget, managing a crew of Kerbals, and snagging all that coveted science and destinations!\n\nFarming Simulator even covers your desire for a flight sim... Its physics can get wonky sometimes... I once launched a tractor 2/3 of the way across the map! Add moar boosters... or cultivators...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T00:07:19Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 12:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by richfiles**"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T20:25:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I dont understand the appeal of these \u0022sim games\u0022 that are popping up.

(I am not one of them) To them buying the DLC is no different than going to the hobby store an buying a new car for their model train, but takes up less physical space.\n\nTrucking simulators have the same appeal as a flight simulator but for a different target audience. Some people like to fly planes, other like to drive trucks. Personally I find both pretty boring.\n\nI\u0027m not sure about farming sims but I can probably think of a target audience.\n\nThings I don\u0027t understand entirely are really stupid things like Goat Simulator and Grass Simulator.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T20:33:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 08:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"Netskimmer","CreatedById":144822,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T20:33:45Z","Content":"I\u0027ve put some time into Farming Simulator.
