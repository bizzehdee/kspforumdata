When it was written off as feature creep I wondered why as it seemed most of the hard work was done. Now with multiplayer being implemented after it has been stated time and again it will be a post v1.0 feature it makes people worry what squad planed for the future. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have got hundreds of hours out of a game I paid $15 for, it is the cheapest entertainment I have ever had. I am planing to buy it again at full price once v1.0 is released, I only hope that game is a great as KSP 0.11 through 0.19 showed it can be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(EDIT:typo)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-14T21:36:52Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2013 09:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by bowdlerize\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PDCWolf","CreatedById":58026,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T21:22:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA lot of players have put Squad on a high pedestal, and much is wanted from KSP, but we all have to remember that they are a small number of normal people, not world class games designers and only a few of the people at Squad even code.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this case, resources was a wanted feature because of kethane and it grew even more after the official announcement (back in between 0.18/0.19)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESquad is a normal company, they have deadlines, meetings, they work 9 to 5 and sometimes have to work after hours to meet those deadlines.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENobody is really discussing this.
