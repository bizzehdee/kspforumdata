Never tried reentry heat, there is the new engine ISP, we don\u0027t even know the new delta-v requirements for orbit, will jets stay superstrong in the new atmosphere, the engine balancing will most likely be different, the ISP-update will add new difficulties, what about Eve, mega sonic speeds on laythe(?), how will the new chase-cam affect flight, need to see how to abuse a non-kethane ressource system, how will the new tools help plane-construction, etc...\n\nSo yeah, lots of stuff to do. That update isn\u0027t just some \u0027add mod features to KSP\u0027 thing, but even brings some modifications to the systems mods were built on.
