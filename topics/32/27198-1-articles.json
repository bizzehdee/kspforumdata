I was going to use KAS to refuel it. Just get it close, attach the nozzle, etc. But that would have been tedious and I got tired of the rescue mission scenario so I just ended the flight I was trying to rescue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spatzimaus","CreatedById":57215,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T01:38:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere are a few ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1\u0026gt; As they\u0027ve said, put a Jr. port on everything, and make sure they\u0027re at exactly the right height. Once the vessels are linked, you can transfer fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; Download the Kerbal Attachment System mod, which adds winches and fuel connectors. Only works in a gravity well, or when you can EVA the connector over. On a surface, this allows you to drop a connector from directly above the destination port, which means you don\u0027t need to be precise with positioning of the ports in your initial designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3\u0026gt; Download the Quantum Fuel Transfer mod. Similar to #2, but with less parts involved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4\u0026gt; Download the robotic arm mod. The Buran arm weighs 0.5 tons, and once connected to the other vessel you can transfer fuel through it. It\u0027s kinda cheating, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5\u0026gt; Make a design that can \u0022squat\u0022, to link up vertically aligned docking ports similar to #2. The easiest way is to make a wheeled rover, and then add some folding landing legs to it; you drive near the vessel you want to refuel, then activate/deactivate the legs to raise/lower the rover to make up any minor height differences. This can be designed to work either from above (raise the rover up, pull the spaceplane in underneath, then lower) or below (put a \u0022tongue\u0022 on the rover, drive it underneath, then use the legs to raise it until they connect), but the heights have to be very close for this to work. Note that you can combine this with a non-fuel winch from the KAS mod to make up larger height differences, but the basic concept can be done with stock parts. (Also, by retracting landing gear you can make up larger height differences, especially if you use the Modular Multiwheels for landing gear instead of the stock wheels.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are more, but that\u0027s a good start.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T02:28:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E^^ what Spatzimaus said, but I\u0027d suggest the KAS is the way forward for on land refuelling. The fact you have to get out and run a \u0027fuel\u0027 line over is quite nice. And your fuel truck can carry spare transferable docking ports that a kerbal can bolt onto anything that you want to refuel, so you don\u0027t even have to plan ahead for something to be refuelled.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"B787_300","CreatedById":31055,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T02:37:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKAS, the quantum mod, and Lazor System are all good options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a rover that can squat and raise with the MOdular Multiwheels mod that i use to conect to docking ports on top of everything...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"georgTF","CreatedById":57397,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T02:44:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESometimes it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s24.postimg.org/p1ct8czcl/screenshot341.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot341.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes things go boom for no rhyme nor reason...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s4.postimg.org/ppv4xeai5/screenshot671.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot671.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s8.postimg.org/5wj98zwb9/screenshot679.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot679.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect that if two heavy craft are connected with lightweight pieces, the CoM will shift towards the middle of the joined craft and probably end up near weak, lightweight pieces. Somehow pulling and torsion occurs and the whole thing just twists itslef into a pile of debris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut just like planes that steer themselves for no real reason, sometimes you will build a craft that refuses to behave when docked to a fuel rover.
