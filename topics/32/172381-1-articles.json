It has the highest \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and the highest Thrust-Cost-Ratio (tied with the Reliant) of any \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/Ox engine - and by a fair margin. Other than the Reliant which is also an outlier, it offers about 30% more thrust-per-funds. That\u0027s not all, if you want to recover it the Twin-Boar will never burn up on reentry. Drop it into the atmosphere from near-hyperbolic speeds and even then it probably won\u0027t burn up. This is because it\u0027s pretty draggy, and when going in reverse its flared base makes it really draggy. Also a quirk of the heating model is that parts have \u0022thermally superconductive skin\u0022, the entire skin of a part is one thing. The skin heats up where it is exposed to the oncoming air, and radiates heat where its not exposed, this means that long parts have a better \u0022heat in to heat out\u0022 ratio than short parts (Mammoth and Aerospike both burn off really easily). The Twin-Boar has the highest fineness\u00A0ratio of any engine which is a second reason it handles reentry heating gracefully. After the hot part of reentry again the\u00A0high drag in reverse means it slows easily to safe chute speeds, and then when it hits the surface it has a 20m/s impact tolerance so you can skimp on chutes and really spectacular buoyancy, a Mammoth can have trouble protecting parts above it in case of a splashdown, but a Twin-Boar will never slide into the water deeply enough to threaten higher up parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Twin-Boar works well both as an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E and as a first stage with a Skipper or Wolfhound second stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, the Twin-Boar is really cost effective and idiot-proof to recover making it my go-to engine for launching stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I also have to give honorable mention to the LV-N, which is my other go-to engine, beyond a certain mission deltaV - roughly Moho or Jool mission or even biome-hopping on Mun, LV-N becomes a no-brainer.
