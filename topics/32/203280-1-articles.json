I have a rover that I landed just pre- and it had no trouble climbing similar inclines on the Mun\u00A0before (at least I didn\u0027t notice any trouble) and\u00A0 after an hour of button mashing, I think it\u0027s completely\u00A0stuck in one of the midland craters. I know the team did a big overhaul on rover mechanics, and I\u0027m wondering if this is just me.
