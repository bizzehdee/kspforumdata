Finally got a spaceplane, a reusable SSTO version too! (design number 5) into orbit (for the most part) and had 4 Kerbals long for the ride. The Areo in 1.0.2 is a bugger, but fun as hell. Notes: Breaks!. The whole thing was glowing danger red on the way down, getting the speed arrested was problematic. But, it stayed together and the crew enjoyed a nice soft landing and roll out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1292.photobucket.com/albums/b580/fragglea/ksp_11_zpsscmgnial.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ksp_11_zpsscmgnial.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts so strange when you play about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the longest time I was using just the 2 engines and those big Delta wings.

I almost went with those for my SSTO space plane, except the way I get into orbit almost always gets some parts up past 1500. I lost several shock cone air intakes before I realized that they had changed them so that the Ram air intakes take in more air, and have higher temperature limits. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yeah, MOAR ENGINES seems to be the way to into space with SSTOs these days.
