It\u0027s a small thing but adds a lot to the immersion. For example I\u0027ve just completed a very simple four flight program using the 1-kerbal capsule and iterating the design between flights. The notes let me add some history to that - reasons for iterations based on past mission, which Kerbal flew the previous mission etc. Its just nice to be able to select a ship from the launch pad and then get all the history and mission notes along with it - feels much more like a coherent space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s possible that building a rover (plus a pod on legs to get crew out to the pad to drive the rover) for the sole purpose of driving over to the old capsule monument and planting a commemorative flag at the end of the program was a little over the top \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T21:52:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENotes?

Problem is I\u0027m not sure how well automagic sorting would work. You could filter out the stock designs and do a crude kerballed vs non kerballed separation but beyond that I think you\u0027d need to be able to drag and drop ships yourself between the different tabs. If I launch a monster booster with a crew cabin, a hitchhiker module and a rover on it, (not unrealistic) then how do you pigeonhole that? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
