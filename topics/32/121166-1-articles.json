The decision to launch POS-1 on a cycler orbit from the Mun was due to the fact I would have waited a long time for Mun and Minmus to be in the correct position for a conventional transfer, and thought a gravity assist from Kerbin would be a fun thing to try.

If we ever were to colonize a close by planet, a Cycler would over a few years save as much dV as its life-support would have added for the same number of colonist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough, just saying : I don\u0027t believe we will ever have a need for them. Colonizing a planet is less efficient that simply living in asteroid belt (though you could use an asteroid-cycler).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKegereneku,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The original question was about cyclers in KSP, not RL. Kerbals do not need life support or comfortable habitat, so cyclers aren\u0027t useful at all *in- game*. In addition, the transfer shuttles burn more fuel to match a cycler orbit than they would need to establish a Hohmann transfer and the trip is longer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Best,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Der Kosmos","CreatedById":7632,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T22:54:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are using a life support mod, it might be interesting to have a cycler that was a closed loop habitat to cut down on life support requirements on interplanetary trips.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
