I have many systems in place which can be used to transfer crew to and from the moons, and I can\u0027t decide! Please vote, and pick a different ship for each moon. Thank you!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Mun one comes first, and the ships don\u0027t need to land, as I have a lander in place, a Vau derivative, as well as an older 4 seat lander. The Minmus one requires ships to land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis career is intended to be realistic-ish, progressing slowly in order, building stations and bases, and has KSP IE installed, although not much has been researched yet, just enough to make some fancy experimental nuclear SSTOs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShips:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nT-01 Spectre. The oldest option, the first and only so far transfer ship launched. Has two nuclear engines, can seat 20, and can land with no modifications. Currently stationed at my understaffed and semi-abandoned \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E station. Has been used on a few prior transfer missions, succeeding in all of them, so this method is pretty safe.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGalactus. Designed to replace the 2 seat Explorers and short lived 6 seat Pioneers, Galactus can seat 6 or 8 depending on the requested configuration, but is completely expendable. Sort of like Orion. Has only flown a handful of times but is pretty safe.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nX-6 Voyager - Generation 2 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E. Can be used for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E or farther but may need refueling to return. Needs modified cargo bay to hold enough crew. I don\u0027t think any have ever failed, but I can\u0027t remember what SN 2 was, I\u0027m missing one, but that\u0027s probably just a paperwork error. So also pretty safe.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nX-8 Robinson - Generation 3 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E. Mk3 profile. Can go pretty far, can carry a large payload and many people, but the first two serial numbers were destroyed during landing attempts (no loss of crew though) and the third serial number has never, I think, had a flawless mission. Something has always gone wrong, usually on landing, but again, no loss of life. Considered moderately safe.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nVau - Generation 4 capsule. Has a lot of Delta-V, can seat 6, features integrated \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E, power, comms, etc. Can function without a service module and does for LEO missions. Designed to propulsively land and carries no parachutes. Has had a fairly troubled development, is sometimes unstable on re-entry, needs redesigned \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E lifter but not a redesigned BLKO lifter. Has flown once with crew, after several unmanned tests, with varying degrees of success. Moderately safe.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for helping!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:48px;\u0022\u003EEDIT: PLEASE CHOOSE A DIFFERENT OPTION\u00A0FOR EACH QUESTION.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:36px;\u0022\u003EI have a variety of systems, I don\u0027t want to use one twice in a row.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-02-28T18:24:40Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2019 06:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Ultimate Steve\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbolExplorer","CreatedById":177191,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-28T15:00:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI recommend launching ships that can do \u003Cu\u003Emore\u00A0\u003C/u\u003Ethan the mission needs.i like the first craft on the mun list.Since it can do 2 missions in one launch,so you can save an intire launcher and save money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ultimate Steve","CreatedById":161505,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-28T17:10:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223548880\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022182517\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221551366028\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022177191\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerbolExplorer\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, KerbolExplorer said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI recommend launching ships that can do \u003Cu\u003Emore\u00A0\u003C/u\u003Ethan the mission needs.i like the first craft on the mun list.Since it can do 2 missions in one launch,so you can save an intire launcher and save money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, that will do for the Mun transfer, and I need another node at that station anyways, so I\u0027ll use that as the payload.
