I\u0027ve gotten them really close, but can never get that last 5-10 meters or so because the physics engine bugs out so bad, the Ap and Pe start to fly around the orbit in spasms and you can never settle them down again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-26T16:37:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, congrats Starchristian! Getting a circular orbit is the second achievement. In my opinion, getting the PE and AP within 1km is \u0022close enough for rocket science\u0022. Now, can you do it again at 100km? Can you do it with less fuel?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-26T17:07:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELess than 1 km difference is circular enough for NASA. The ISS is currently at 403km AP and 402km PE. Actually, a little lower now, as it\u0027s slowly decaying at around 2km/month and those numbers were from July 30th.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
