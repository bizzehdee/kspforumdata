The reason is that I planning to conduct a Kerbal Space Program 54 hour real time challenge live on twitch. The challenge is to start in science mode at 4 pm on friday to 10 pm on sunday and to see how much I can get done in real time without using time warp. I will most likely be running many missions simultaneously.\n\nNow, I am still going to sleep about 6 to 7 hours a night, have 3 meals, and even do other things in that time span, but that whole entire time kerbal space program will be running on the computer, and I will need to be back on my computer on time to meet transfer windows and encounters. I need to know how much time passes in KSP vs. real time so that I can plan my breaks, know exactly how much real time I have until that next burn I need to make, etc. I will have Kerbal Alarm Clock, but that won\u0027t help me if I am not there at critical moments.\n\nI plan to start streaming at 4 pm and go until 6, take an hour for dinner, then go from 6 to 10, at which point I will go to bed. As soon as I wake up in the morning I will have breakfast and then stream all day in 3 to 4 hour segments with time for lunch and dinner on Saturday, as well as taking care of chores while the game is going. I would again be on until 10 pm saturday night, and then sunday would just be a repeat of saturdays schedule. At the end of Sunday at 9 or 10 pm, I would then see how much progress I have made in those 54 hours.\n\nSo, how do you convert KSP time to real time?"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T10:14:08Z","Content":"[http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Time](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Time) should have everything you need to know."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T10:16:06Z","Content":"How game time passes in relation to real time depends on the Max Physics Delta Time setting and the overall power of your pc. I would definitely recommend doing a trial run just to make sure KSP will even run for that long under the simplest of conditions, like only one simple ship in Kerbin orbit, much less multiple ships crossing SOI boundrires."},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T10:26:48Z","Content":"Short version; \n\n1 kerbal hour = 1 earth hour. \n\n1 kerbal day = 6 hours.\n\nYour 54 hour challenge is thus 9 kerbal days.\n\nBut... time is a variable.

I would make sure the game setup is stable enough to go to bed and still be running when I wake up. Even with a completely stock install, graphics settings can have large effects on stability, especially wip settings like terrain scatter."},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T13:44:18Z","Content":"\u003E There won\u0027t be a lot of SOI boundary crossing; would need a day-zero launch to get to Minmus in the time window.

By using a more aggressive burn in LKO, the time to the Mun can be reduced to about 3.5-4.5 hours for a reasonable cost, or even shorter time for less-reasonable costs.\n\nThe return trip can also be sped up, by burning towards the planet (burn towards the dot in the \u0027bottom\u0027 half of the navball. Burns between the dot and the prograde marker will raise the PE, and burns on the opposite side of the dot from prograde will lower the PE)\n\n![BTSM-TMI.jpg](http://alpha.renegrade.net/images/BTSM-TMI.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T14:53:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E FYI - you can do transfers to/from the Mun in significantly shorter time frames than that for just a small increase in delta-v costs.
