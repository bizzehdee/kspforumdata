It\u0027s strongest for desktop virtualisation, on my PC I have a Linux host and a Windows 7 VM for work stuff, and a second win7 VM I use to test OS and software deployment. Snapshotting is very helpful for that, if an aspect of the deployment doesn\u0027t work I can revert that without needing to redo the whole thing. I use it for servers too because of my familiarity, though I think other VM software would be better.

Two games are having strange graphical issue as seen here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://40.media.tumblr.com/62ed4c1798e81fef45f625bb1abde8ee/tumblr_nrcj4v9RtG1rpsnwro3_r2_1280.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ebig picture\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first thought when I see those kinds of artifacts is that your video memory has issues, or maybe the GPU chip (though that generally shows in different ways). The fact that some games suffer from the problem and some do not seems to point another way, though it is not impossible that these games do something that the others do not. It is not the most clear cut case of memory issues I have seen (generally there are more repeating patterns), but these colours and patterns do raise suspicions. The fact that windowed mode does work adds to this, since it forces the card to work in another way due to the 2D desktop being displayed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way for you to test that card in another system? Did you try any more games? Does the behaviour always show with these games, or only after a certain amount of time or when you do something specific? Is all other 2D display behaviour okay?
