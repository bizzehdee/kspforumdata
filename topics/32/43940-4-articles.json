With a detachable nuclear drive unit The lander was from a mod whose name escapes me but it was a combo garage, habitat and ascent vehicle. It was basically just to give the original three Kerbals somewhere to live while I put together the REAL rescue mission. So I land the little mini base, send the rover out on auto pilot to rescue the Kerbals, drive back then the two crews hang out and party and then it was time for the second crew to depart. They take off into orbit and I look around for the propulsion unit to I can rendezvous and dock up. And it is GONE. Turns out that it got classified as debris when I undocked and hey guess what! When I installed the mod with the combo lander/garage/habitat I had crashing problems so I set max debris to 0. Hilarity ensued.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I had to redesign the rescue mission so that it carried a brand spanking new propulsion unit and an ascent vehicle for crew #1.
