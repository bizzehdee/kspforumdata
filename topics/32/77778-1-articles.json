Note how the LF/O engines have sorted themselves by Isp, with the best Isps having the worst delta-v for this scenario, with their crushingly high dry mass. Also, the higher delta-v rockets presented here are lighter, meaning the lower stage(s) can be smaller OR have better delta-v (or some fraction of both).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncreasing the mass of the O-10 would get rid of this problem, and it wouldn\u0027t take much of an increase either.
