Develop aircraft for different purposes (transport both heavy and light, bombers, fighters, helos).. All of this while having competition and enemy nations, trying to sell to governments. KSP could be integrated by making it a solar system-wide conflict so you would have to deliver supplies to other bodies.. I would start a kickstarter for this to be a standalone.\n\nI know there are some mods that give KSP a flavor of this and there are also those who would abhor the idea of violence... but doesn\u0027t that sound like where KSP should really go?
