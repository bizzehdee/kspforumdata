Squad, please create an unambiguous, consistent set of rules or conditions under which material from KSP can be used in Youtube videos or other forms of publication on the web. Put these in a single and easy to find place. Create a policy for how these rules can be changed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to keep this as short as possible, but it\u0027s a complex subject. Here we go...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen a lot of KSP videos on Youtube (gameplay, tutorials and others) and I thought it would be fun to make some of my own. However, having looked at the legal situation, I don\u0027t think I can.

We just ask to be given credit, a mention and a link to our website is enough. You must also make it perfectly clear that we are the copyright holders of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds encouraging. However, the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/eula.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEULA\u003C/a\u003E does not allow me to do so. In fact, the paragraph titled \u00224. COPYRIGHT\u0022 explicitly says that no such rights are granted. Between these two conflicting statements, I\u0027m pretty sure the EULA legally wins over an informal FAQ answer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut let\u0027s assume for a moment that somehow Squad considers the FAQ overriding the EULA. Next, in a recent \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbaldevteam.tumblr.com/post/93259026294/devnote-tuesdays-the-administrative-edition\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etumblr post\u003C/a\u003E, Bob mentioned working on copyright issues (consider this my contribution to the debate by the way). I really appreciate you\u0027re thinking about these issues. Well, I go on reading and find this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe use of the phrase Kerbal in user-generated content. Right now, we try to ask that people don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t use it (it goes on to say, you can use the word under certains conditions, but they\u0027d rather you didn\u0027t)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait, what?! First of all, you did? How exactly should I have known? I tried to google, but couldn\u0027t find any quote by Squad asking us not to use \u0022Kerbal\u0022. So, if I hadn\u0027t accidentally stumbled upon your blog (which is not even on the official KSP page), I would never have known. To me it\u0027s a bit frightening to see a widely visible \u0022Sure, go ahead!\u0022 and then find a massive restriction hidden on tumblr. It makes me wonder what else I have missed. I think this clearly shows that there needs to be one central and easy to find page (preferably on the official KSP website) where you put all that stuff. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, what exactly do you want us to call Kerbals in user-generated content? I imagine KSP videos that never use \u0022Kerbal\u0022 must be pretty awkward. Also it outright contradicts the FAQ because how can you give proper credit without using the word? (\u0022All rights to Those-who-can\u0027t-be-named Space Program belong to Squad, buy it on their website at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.INSERT-K-WORD-HEREspaceprogram.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.INSERT-K-WORD-HEREspaceprogram.com\u003C/a\u003E\u0022?) Note that they explicitly said \u0022use of the phrase Kerbal in user-generated content\u0022, so this is not about selling products under the Kerbal brand (which they quite reasonably don\u0027t allow). Again, this calls for a single (non self-contradictory) set of rules for using KSP content. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t get me wrong, I understand that Squad have to protect their IP and I appreciate the fact that they allow users to make web content (many other publishers don\u0027t). I also understand that they might be hesitant about giving a legally binding permission to youtubers by putting it in the EULA, as this would mean giving up a certain amount of control in case someone does something awful with KSP (which according to rule 34 must already have happed, but I\u0027m afraid of googling that). On the other hand, not having a legally binding permission to use KSP material under certain conditions puts users under permanent threat. For instance, the rules might change at any time and users who published content may suddenly and without warning be threatend with persecution (in some jurisdictions even retroactively). Thus, my second request to Squad is this: Give us some assurance to notify us when you change the rules so we can act (i.e. take the content down) or to first ask people to take down their material before starting legal action. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, let me address two points which I\u0027m sure will turn up in this thread sooner or later: First, the concept of \u0022fair use\u0022 does not exists in most parts of the world. So bare in mind that these problems concern some people (continental Europe) more than others (US). Second, to those who will say \u0022But everyone does it, the publishers won\u0027t complain because it\u0027s free publicity\u0022. True, in the majority of countries copyright infringements aren\u0027t prosecuted unless the copyright holder asks for it (it\u0027s still illegal though). Thus, the probability of getting in trouble is low, assuming (which I do) that Squad genuinely wants user-generated content of KSP on the web. Unfortunately company policies can change and franchises can be sold. Plus, risk is probability times potential loss, and the latter ranges between four figure sums and prison. In other words, the odds might be in your favour, but are you willing to bet your house on that?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonik","CreatedById":79705,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-03T13:27:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think the owners of these 500k\u002B views youtube videos, many which have been up for over a year, are worrying about it to much.

I doubt this issue would even be under discussion if it wasn\u0027t for some BM by certain community members who have found themselves over-invested in the game yet lacking the wherewithall to check their egos at the door before interacting with SQUAD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s all I\u0027ve got to say about that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jdcr","CreatedById":117829,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-04T07:37:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you guys, it\u0027s good to know I\u0027m not the only one who\u0027s concerned about these issues!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pecan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pecan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETo be fair the recent devnotes says they are working on it: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88741-Devnote-Tuesdays-The-Administrative-Edition\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88741-Devnote-Tuesdays-The-Administrative-Edition\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWow, I have no idea how I managed to miss that thread. Thanks for pointing it out to me. Given this, I have to take back some of the things I said, like it being a statement only made on tumblr and not on the official KSP site. I will have a more thourough look at this thread and your PDF. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pecan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pecan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E(Just what is the ruling jurisdiction here anyway?

Plus any other country that recognises some form of intellectual property and doesn\u0027t forbid lawsuits between foreigners who could sue in their own countries. I think the US always works. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022No one\u0022 data-cite=\u0022No one\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf it is possible for Squad to give explicit consent to you to use their stuff in youtube videos which bypasses the EULA, wouldn\u0027t the FAQ and/or that tumblr post be enough to count as written consent?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think it would. Where I live, whatever the website says is irrelevant just because it\u0027s not signed. Apart from a very limited number of things (like EULAs which you have to accept explicitly by clicking a button or standard business conditions hanging in a shop\u0027s window) every contract needs either to be verbal and have a witness or be in writing and signed. Again this depends heavily on the jurisdiction in question, but I guess no matter where you are, a good enough lawyer would manage to invalidate some statement on the website, especially when it\u0027s unclear and contradicting others.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
