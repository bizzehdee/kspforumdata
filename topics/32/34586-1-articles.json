Neptune, the last solar planet to be discovered (Pluto should never have been a planet), was found in 1846, more than a century before the dawn of spaceflight (or slightly below a century if you consider the A-4). Also, most of the Joolian Moons more or less mirror the Gallilean moons, so they should be known as well. And Eelo has a pretty high albedo, so even it may have been discoveres before spaceflight. However, things like Gilly or Pol would probably need a probe (or a quite powerful telescope) to be discovered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut we should totally need probes to determine things like atmospherical properties and the like.
