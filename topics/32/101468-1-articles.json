But why do we assume this. Because they look like human suits, but are not(assuming of course). Because they have seemingly have to use them in space(assuming also). What if they are not needed(why they can stay in orbit) or need them for very different reasons? What if what they are keeping in is not oxygen but something their body produces that they do need like amonia or some other bodily produced gas or substance. Maybe it\u0027s just or also heat for instance. Or simply for style and/or comfort!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny way, to cut this short, I thought it might be funny if they really produce a gas from their bodies that they need(energy from sun or other radiation naturally.) In reality the suit is a simple containment field for themselves and not specifically oxygen. I also thought it would be funny if being potentially self sufficient if this explains their personality. Since they possibly don\u0027t have to eat or sleep but just produce this gas/whatever they have no need for thought beyond their own pleasure and goofiness! this could explain their existence as a species and seeming attributes. Maybe they go from planet to planet as the please and start producing this gas to as they go for their survival(no necessarily consciously) and it fills an atmosphere having various affects depending on the planet. Hence the lack of plants on kerban(maybe it was earth and this is also an affect somehow). Maybe this also explains their love of space travel. It developed eons ago as a form of enjoyment(maybe they had a low gravity planets and just flung themselves into the dark void out of sheer amusement and joy!). And it changes as they move(assuming they ever hit anything afterwords) and adapt/absorb encountered cultures or phenomenon they encounter(also explaining the oddity of the form of their space vehicles in KSP) but potentially have a slightly detrimental/modifying affect on them most of the time(also potentially explaining the lack of any other cultures). But being kerbals they go on with joyful glee oblivious to the surroundings no matter the affect and just keep going on. Maybe their only function for eating or doing certain things is to accelerate the development of this gas/substance to be able to survive in their normal kerbal way on any planet they go to and it\u0027s ingrained in them to do so as they travel. Maybe they can eat almost anything including rocks(reason for kerbal being smaller than earth) but usually eat the more interesting moving things first or seeming fun things to eat the cultures they encounter eat as it is most fun to enjoy their customs first!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow realistic does that sound. Then maybe they ate the moon and other things over time to try to develop atmosphere(instinctively trying things as the visited over time) but it never held the gas.( on top of possibly being told the moon was made of cheese!! Imagine the carnage after the moon shrunk down 1/10th to the earth....) Changing the solar system forever!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe this is the real reason they take dirt samples everywhere they go. Maybe it\u0027s not for science in the way we think of science.

That is, also, assuming they evolved.... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sealed:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf nothing else it could give them really long periods of time. Let alone, again, if they went dormant in that state(like the cryochamber vs a suit) they cold last in space and fling themselves between stars or galaxies. Heck they could use interstellar materials if they, say, developed(or were developed...sshhhh!!!) on a low gravity planet that had the characteristics of both life barring and barren worlds. Or whatever floats your boat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr are you saying that doesn\u0027t really work in terraiums. I haven\u0027t actually done them yet.

In seed barring plants sun tends to speeds up the lifecycle/reproductive cycle. Like with lettuces and alot of root plants you might want to limit sun. So, you can use sun in different ways. If you know you are going to potentially be adrift you may purposely limit sun to stop aging etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think terrariums have alot of open space becuase they are inside alot. Inside the sun is limited and you may need it for any growth at all. Plus it\u0027s for appearance and you want to see it. So, less sun would be potentially accurate. I beleive you can keep terrariums in the dark or in limited light. I think it makes them last longer potentially. Plus, again, the variance of plants can change any of that drastically. Plants are the most complex mechanical devices we probably know of. There is way more variation than most people realize.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-09T20:11:24Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2015 08:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
