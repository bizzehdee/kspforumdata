Things have been slow for me since .19. I blew a disc in my back back in May and June.

And it rolls down a crater for 4km and blows up several times chasing it with a kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then jet up a nearby mountain with my kerbal and plant a flag. Jetting back to the Apollo 1 lander I come in way too fast and dust the kerbal. Upon dusting it, it auto switches back to the lander...my finger is still mashed on the shift button trying to save the kerbal...it throttles up the lander (because I forgot to disable the engine, which is SOP for me), and I cut the thrust almost immediately, but too late. It bangs down, tips over and breaks in half. No chance of ascent stage working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI write him off. I return my lone kerbal in orbit in the CSM. I get about 150km out and jettison the SM readying for re-entry.

After the failure of Apollo I, in part because of lack of terrain recon, I created and landed the Celeste probe to find some flat enough ground to put down on. Apollo II MM came down about 150m from the probe in a text book perfect landing. One of my kerbals climbed down, mounted the rover and I popped it. Mental note, change seperatrons for decoupler on the rover next time (in testing on Kerbin it only kicked it about a meter and tipped backward on to its wheels. On the mun it kicked it 6m and rolled on to its side and I had to manually kick it over).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI drove off toward the crater rim wall of the giant crater on the terminator line with the far side of the mun. About a 25km round trip trek. Lessons learned, quick save often (I learned that on Moho back in .19). I also need a new rover design. Top safe speed was about 5m/sec and I still had to be careful. Occasionally I could push 8-9m/sec, but not downhill. I am thinking something a little lower slung and try to push the wheels out and to the sides a little more. Maybe some small trusses on the corners to push it out some. A little RCS and some jets might also be useful to right the thing if/when it flips. I don\u0027t need much, but if I can safely rove on the Mun at 10m/sec, that would be a huge improvement in getting places (and might also mean I could hit 12-15m/sec on Duna safely).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I got to \u0022Jack Crater\u0022, turned around and went back to the landing site. Total trip, about 25km (10.6km out, circituitous route) in about 90 minutes includes only one quick load and 5 or 6 flips that I had to get out and push the rover back on to its wheels. Also a little on foot sight seeing once I got to Jack Crater (a small crater in the rim wall of the giant impact basin formed on the terminator). If the thing were a little more stable and I could have pushed another 25% on speed it probably would have been only 45 minutes between the extra speed and fewer flips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I got back to the Apollo II landing site unlimbered my other Kerbonaut and planted a flag at the landing site. I am going to wander around the site a little bit (maybe go over to Celeste 1 and play kick the probe). After that it is back to the CSM and back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure which direction to go after this. I may do another Apollo mission, or I may go to Minimus next.
