Because of KSP I was able to point out so many flaws with the movie itself. Granted I did love it and know that Hollywood will never go off of true realism. But there was one scene that really bothered me. It was where where Sandra Bullock was tethered to a space station by some parachute ropes to her leg. She caught George Clooney and stopped his momentum so he didn\u0027t float away. He decides let me go because he says he\u0027s pulling her away.

It is (currently) unfeasible to manufacture a space suite capable of maintaining an internal pressure of 14.7 PSI (standard pressure at sea level, aka \u00221 atmosphere of pressure\u0022). The problem is that, in the vacuum environment of space, a flexible suite pressurized to 14.7 PSI will become too stiff to maintain any sort of reasonable motion range (this is due to ballooning). To counteract this, space suite internal pressures are maintained very low (with very high partial pressures of oxygen). The Space Shuttle, Soyuz, and the ISS all function at 14.7 PSI (it is worth noting that the Apollo program operated at 5.7 PSI and that the pressure in the LEM was even lower during moon landings). Any diver knows that going from a higher pressure to a lower pressure involves the risk of off-gassing nitrogen in solution with blood (severe off gassing results in pain and nervous system/brain damage and his commonly known as \u0022the bends\u0022). This means that prior to ANY EVA activities, an astronaut must spend HOURS pre breathing pure oxygen while stepping ambient pressure down to control this off gassing (US space suites operate at 4.7 PSI while Russian ones are at 5.7). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, it will be traumatic to the body to rapidly transition between either the low pressure environment of EVA or the high pressure environment of the ISS/Shuttle/Soyuz. Going from low to high is uncomfortable but going from high to low is lethal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brianorca","CreatedById":109756,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-07T21:28:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steampunked\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Steampunked\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not a widely known fact, but manned space flight does not function under standard pressure conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the new Mars suit NASA is designing has rigid joints, (constant volume rotating metal) instead of ballooning fabric for exactly this reason, so they can keep it at full pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-07T21:29:37Z\u0022 title=\u002210/07/2014 09:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by brianorca\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eclarity\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
