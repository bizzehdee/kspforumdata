For example, a jet aircraft with two of only one type of engine would be a J-20. Why a zero at the end? If there are more planes of this class, they would be J-21, -22, and so on. If a craft has more than one kind of engine, things get complicated. An SSTO with two jets and one rocket would be an HS-210, assuming it is the first of that class. If there are more than ten models in a given class, an additional hyphen is inserted so the eleventh SSTO with two jets and one rocket would be an HS-21-10. Technically, this doesn\u0027t allow for engine counts in the double digits, but I\u0027ve never built something with that many anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor craft still in development, a lowercase \u0022p\u0022 is appended to the model code to mean \u0022prototype.\u0022 Prototypes are numbered separately from released models, so a J-10 and a J-10p are not the same aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I like to give each craft a whimsical name based on what it does.

First group is the range of the craft/where it is designed to operate. If a ship can operate anywhere from Kerbin to Minmus, for example, I\u0027ll put K\u0026gt;mM.

Second, is the class of ship that it is abbreviated to a four character callsign. Shuttles are SHTL, rockets are RKTS, and so on. The final group is the maximum crew supported, if any.
