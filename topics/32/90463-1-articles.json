I have seen those words before, and mostly it is with my Laythe Shuttle to transport Kerbals around the Spheroid, outpost to outpost.

Unless you are wasting your entire budget with every launch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould it not be better to let us go negitive instead? As that would also give the instentive to land closer to KSP as well as have ways to return all or the bulk of the parts back. With how much you sacrifice your reputation allows you to go deeper and deeper into det before they shut your program down.

Shuttles are such a decision. It\u0027s more or less a reusable upper stage that has a significant amount of extra weight due to aerodynamics. The important part is, that those super heavy ssto rockets are not that easy to build and are less effective. The big dumb booster looks atractive again \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E and of course spaceplanes are still around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejust to be clear I prefer shuttles in my DRE/FAR career for most stuff. They are flexible enough to perform many different tasks so I don\u0027t have to design and testflight a new design as often. I\u0027m a hard mode roleplay kind of guy. So all the testing happens (mostly unmaned) in career and I already invested some money into designs that turned out to be useless \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
