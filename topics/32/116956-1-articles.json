This should be easy to prove with an hypersonic plane, but I\u0027ve never found the time to do it [1].\n\nI don\u0027t have advanced shadder activated, so it\u0027s displayed as a red colored overlay. I don\u0027t know if this is the case for you, but this might be a reason why nobody did catch it in testing.\n\n[1] Possible test case:\n\nLevel at 15,000m and accelerate to 1450 m/s in normal view, slow down to 300 m/s, check if the temperature overlay came and went. Then switch to map view, repeat (300 -\u003E 1450 -\u003E 300), check if the overlay has stuck. Switch to normal view, repeat (300 -\u003E 1450 -\u003E 300), check if that fixed the overlay."},{"CreatedByName":"X-SR71","CreatedById":108775,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T10:53:53Z","Content":"With all the LV-Ns and PB-NUKs I got in my ships it\u0027s a wonder my kerbals don\u0027t glow too!"},{"CreatedByName":"keeper","CreatedById":124530,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T12:12:09Z","Content":"I found parts to start flashing orange whilst taking damage from re entry. Those parts taking too much damage don\u0027t stop flashing; others that manage too cool before the threshold will stop eventually.\n\nMore annoying is sometimes I accidentally briefly mouse over the staging and certain parts remain with a green outline until I mouse over that again."}]}
