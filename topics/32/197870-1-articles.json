I messed around a lot with ICBM\u0027s... and all kinds of mods but I think my favorite is HYPERSONICS! I created a cruise missle on stock KSP, which reached a maximum of Mach 5.56, and made it about 2000 miles in 20 minutes. I felt very impressed and entertained. What have yours guys experiences been with developing missiles on this game? Seen some really cool stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lewie","CreatedById":203745,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-02T01:42:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kerbal-forum-uploads/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGotta say...that\u2019s pretty impressive!
