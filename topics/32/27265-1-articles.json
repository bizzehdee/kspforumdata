Though I am one of the users of mechjeb as I enjoy using it for auto docking for me as I am extremely rubbish at doing docking manuevers and launching a craft. I am fully capable of launching crafts from Kerbal, it just that IRL, it is done with computers. The launch platform that I do use for the stock model does have fuel to spare, but only a couple of hundred m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just wondering if I\u0027m doing something wrong or is that particular stock craft only good for missions to Duna or Eve? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that I have never been to most of the outer planets and yet I\u0027m would say I\u0027m a noob/veteran of the program as I probably do need help in building more advance crafts to conquer these worlds that I haven\u0027t explored.

I think it has some 250 odd m/s of delta-V where you need around 530 m/s to land on the moon with no fuel left. (my numbers are from recollection as I cannot verify at the moment)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis leaves you with a few things to do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Analyze the stock skycrane\u002Brover and note all of its important pieces, examine TWR and test what you can add without making it unstable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Try landing the default skycrane\u002Brover on Kerbin, utilize parachutes. This will give you an idea of what its capabilities are on atmospheric planets. Ideally you shouldn\u0027t have to burn until the moment when you\u0027re about to touch down to kill off the remaining vertical velocity then ditching the skycrane to fly off into oblivion. (If you have \u0027shutes deployed lower your velocity to 0 and they will auto-cut then deploy the rover)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You may design a better skycrane\u002Brover to have more delta-V (This should be as easy as adding more small fuel tanks as the default TWR is fairly high) Test your design and profit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpsterMan","CreatedById":32671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T16:13:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the above poster menioned, it is designed to be used in atmosphere.
