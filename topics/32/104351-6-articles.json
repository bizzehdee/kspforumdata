I mean, I know even the Shuttle TPS tiles were a lot of work post-landing, and highly fragile on the way up and down, which kind of reduces their practical use as a reusable permanent heat shield). Although given the Lego approach, the idea Bill Phil gave certainly shows a design engineering solution to a materials science problem... Wonder how this affects the heat shields on space planes--are those ablative, too?\n\nKinda worried about that \u0022good GPU... chugging\u0022 line there... point in comparison: scene changes in 0.90 for me sometimes \u0022stick\u0022 to the point where Task Manager says \u0022not responding\u0022, even if memory usage is \u003C1mb... Running in high quality (if not full) graphics settings and default other graphics options (light sources, etc.), and I do have a separate graphics card on this laptop. *And* ATM at the moment. On the other hand, liking the load optimizations. Especially if it can translate to lower memory requirements, = just a little extra room for mods? ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI wish there was a larger electric put-put engine (greater thrust) to go with the larger Xe tank... but yeah, I know, Lego approach. I like Legos, I appreciate the design challenge.\n\nAaaand I\u0027m not liking the multi-segmented fairings in the screenshots, if only for the parts count. I know, its probably not that many parts for a given payload (unless we\u0027re talking about a large payload here?), and it doesn\u0027t count towards final in-orbit parts count (unless they\u0027re made a non-thermal part of the aeroshell?). Maybe the approach does lend itself to different load sizes (heights per given diameter), without having to go procedural (again, going Lego). That said, I kind of prefer the approach used in the SpaceY payload fairings parts (haven\u0027t played with it so much since ProcFairings, but I think it\u0027s baseplate \u002B nosecap, and the fairings get plugged in between automatically, so it can accommodate a range of payload heights?). \n\nOh, hai 6S! (I never did get a hang of using the mod back in 23.5, though the widgets should make interior placements easier now.)\n\nI\u0027ve loved EPL either with Kethane or Karbonite/Regolith integration, but hopefully the base ore in 1.0 will be the base ISRU for EPL and \\*some others. At the least, I can worry about one less mod to plug in (though I will miss those propfan engines in Karb...). I tend to prefer my resources abstracted... and few to manage. \n\n\\*EDIT: Some. People do prefer a more diverse ISRU management game, and that\u0027s okay. Thematically, I\u0027m the opposite. Hey, RoverDude did say that his MKS/OKS is highly abstracted, and I still feel it\u0027s a lot of management work (so sticking to Karb for the moment). And I like Snacks as a life support mod. \n\nI see the old Mk2/Mk 1 inline there. I wonder if there will be a proper IVA in the 1.0 release... (Was there a proper IVA in the 0.90 release? I haven\u0027t touch the pod yet). And--considering the mod IVA for it showed that there\u0027s way too much room in there for one Kerbal... I wonder if, if the inline stays in 1.0, it could b made a 2-place inline? Probably won\u0027t happen, but it\u0027s nice to think.\n\nAnyway, time to make a backup copy of 0.90 for what I\u0027ve got in saves now. I don\u0027t think my designs there will be appropriate for 1.0\u0027s new aero...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-18T03:52:45Z\u0022 title=\u002204/18/2015 03:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by B-STRK**"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T03:46:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E everything looks great to me except the single \u0022ore\u0022 resource. \n\u003E I\u0027ve just finished reading [Robert Zubrin\u0027s book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Case_for_Mars) and was really looking forward to designing my chemical plant lander. electrolyzing water, splitting CO2, combining the products to make CH4 fuel. \n\u003E \n\u003E The \u0022magic ore\u0022 resource system just means every rock is made of fuel.
