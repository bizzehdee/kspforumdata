He\u0027ll do anything to complete his mission, and even go rogue just to make them even crazier. Bill is a professional, and will always get the job done. And Bob is... well, Bob. He didn\u0027t have Jeb\u0027s nerve, or Bill\u0027s brains. Really, the only thing that qualified him to be a Kerbonaut was his heart for the job. But he never went on a solo mission. He was too afraid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn every mission, he would scream his lungs out until they were safely landed back home. Bill and Jeb never held it against him, and even did their best to comfort their friend at every step of the way. But after every mission, Bob could only feel shame for his behavior. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne by one, Bob\u0027s friends had become famous as pioneers. And Bob was just... the one that tagged along. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst Jebediah made the first ever Mun walk...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yKgTM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yKgTM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...and then Bill walked on Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tYHou.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tYHou.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob had been to both of these places himself, but only much later, in the company of his friends. He was never a pioneer, like them. When that unmanned probe discovered other planets beyond... he knew he had to prove himself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe space center would be sending a single Kerbonaut to Duna. Bob begged be the one to go, and mission control reluctantly agreed. Finally the day came, and Bob\u0027s dreams were crushed: The craft he\u0027d be piloting would not be a lander, but an orbiter. Bob went through the launch procedures, but he felt numb. Once again, Bob Kerman was part of a mission that no one would remember him for. After many months, he had achieved a low orbit around Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E After spending about a week in this position, he received a transmission from mission control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bob, we don\u0027t know how to tell you this... it doesn\u0027t look like you\u0027ll have enough fuel to make it back. We\u0027re sorry, Bob.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob sank. He had lived a nobody, and now he was going to die a nobody. But then he had an idea. Maybe, just maybe...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust then, he received another transmission from mission control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bob, we\u0027ve got great news! Using the information we\u0027re sending, we think you can make it back with a gravity assist from the Mun!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob ignored them, and began burning retrograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bob, knock it off, you\u0027re going to need every drop of fuel to come home!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob ignored them, and Bill and Jeb pushed the controller aside, grabbing his mic. Jeb\u0027s voice came over the speaker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bob, you\u0027re gonna get yourself stuck up there and it\u0027s gonna be a while before we can come get you!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob\u0027s ship entered Duna\u0027s atmosphere, and he began to slow his descent. Suddenly Bill realized what his friend was doing, and tried to protest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bob...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob waited for him to go on, and when no answer came, he switched the speaker off. He didn\u0027t need to hear this. He was only a few kilometers from Duna\u0027s surface now, and he was coming in far too fast. He throttled up, closed his eyes, and hoped for the best...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6ehTz.png\u0022 alt=\u00226ehTz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob Kerman: First Kerbal to walk on Duna. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe miss you, Bob.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-23T03:05:05Z\u0022 title=\u002209/23/2012 03:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 23, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Dizzle\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sneezedr424","CreatedById":33670,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-23T03:13:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E It\u0027s nice to see that Bob turned out in the end.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Aramchek_","CreatedById":12588,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-23T03:55:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBob was first to land anywhere on my game too, in .17 and on Duna too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
