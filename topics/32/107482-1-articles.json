This feature is really slick, and the GUI implementation is pure eye-candy. I\u0027ve been sitting here just waving the mouse around in front of the fairings to reveal the contents. Back and forth back and forth over and over for probably 15 minutes, it\u0027s quite hypnotic and, in the true sense of the word, awesome. Beautifully done.\n\nAnd they make getting funny shaped stuff into orbit a heck of a whole bunch easier I can tell you."},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T18:44:03Z","Content":"B-but....they split apart like a frag grenade ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T18:45:51Z","Content":"Same here, the \u0022explode fairing and work inside\u0022 thing is simply brilliant.

What\u0027s worrisome is that they seem to be tuned poorly so that in many cases you\u0027re better off not using them. Between their high mass and high drag (for fairings, anyway) they can impede a launch instead of facilitating it. However, I agree the UI is pretty darn slick, and with a bit of rebalance they will be an excellent addition to the game."},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T19:02:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Real fairings use pyrotechnic charges to break open don\u0027t they?
