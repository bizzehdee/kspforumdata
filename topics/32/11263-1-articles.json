Mun and minimus both have tiny surface gravities and no atmosphere so that the delta V to lift off of them is small. To more accurately simulate a flight to another planet, try doing a double munar return with a single ship. That is Kerbin - Mun landing - Kerbin landing - Mun landing - Kerbin landing. This would give a better idea of the delta V it would take to say do a kermars return mission.\n\nSo far I have only been able to get to a crashland on the Mun on the second launch off kerbin, but I am getting there.\n\nTo the OP. Minimus is in orbit around kerbin as can be seen by its orbital path on the mpa view."},{"CreatedByName":"patrickcanttype","CreatedById":25923,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-23T22:00:10Z","Content":"He meant the principle of moving from one orbiting body to another is the same.
