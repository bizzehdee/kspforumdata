Thought I would take a rover to max out the amount of science for my career mode save. After many failed attempts and 3 hours playing KSP tonight, I finally get myself into an orbit around Duna, \u0022yes, finally I\u0027ve done it\u0022 I tell myself. \n\nI realised my first mistake as I land on the planet, I had attached my solar panels to the decoupler, so when I ditched the engine, I lost my power source! I was gutted that I couldn\u0027t take advantage of all the science jr and fluid Specto tests I bought along. Ah well, I\u0027m still on Duna, so all is not lost.\n\nI open up the service bay and get ready to unleash my unmanned rover only to find i have blocked it in with a slightly overhanging puff mono propellant engine! \n\nI dunno whether to laugh or be mad right now!

Already had a stable, reliable single-propeller monoplane designed, so I slapped a couple of Goo canisters under the wings to pick up some science data on the way, threw Valentina in the cockpit, and away she went.\n\nThe plan was to fly to the two sites, then back to KSC to either do a regular landing or a parachute landing and recover the maximum value of the plane. Easy peasy.\n\nWell, because the plane is so stable, I just turned on SAS once I was pointed at the first site and at an acceptable altitude (around 2km) and then went about my internet browsing. A while later I hear a crash and jump back into the game\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACthe plane is flying nearly vertical up a mountain, missing its right front landing gear and right tail fin. Whoops. But hey, no problem, it still flies pretty well, so I situate everything and get it heading back on track. With landing gear only on one side of the plane, the plan is definitely of the \u0022parachute landing\u0022 variety now.\n\nGet to the first site, take the report, head off to the second. Reach the second (in the middle of the ocean), report, and do a quicksave. Less than two seconds later, the plane runs out of fuel\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACcompletely off-guard, because I had not been monitoring the fuel even a little bit. I just *assumed* it was fine. It was not fine. Okay, well, we got our contracts, time to parachute this thing down to the water.\n\nI didn\u0027t put a parachute on the plane.\n\nSo now I have a monoplane with no fuel, 2km above the ocean, and only half of my landing gear.\n\nVal goes into a steep dive to maintain speed, then yanks up at the last minute to try to coast down to the surface... The resulting impact (at 25m/s or thereabouts) destroyed the whole plane except the cockpit. Goo results? Gone. Salvage value? Gone. Valentina: Still alive! Parachute?
