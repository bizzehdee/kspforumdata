But that was mostly about possible exploits and nested cargo bays.\n\nNow, I wouldn\u0027t think that *any* aerodynamics model is going to like clipped parts, since we want it as intuitive as possible, and *intuitively or realistically* you can\u0027t have matter inside matter. It really all depends on how Harv chooses to simulate airflow. (That is, if we\u0027re just dealing with maths or if the code is taking, essentially, a snapshot of the craft and deciding how the air would flow around it.
