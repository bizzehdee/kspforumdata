Instead of stacking parts by their green nodes, sometimes you can also just stick the part onto the side of another part. For this to happen, the part must be attachable, and the target part must allow attachment. For example, a mk1 command pod allows attachment, but isn\u0027t attachable itself. You can stick things to it, but it cannot be stuck onto other things except by way of its green nodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason I\u0027m telling you this is that liquid fuel tanks are both attachable and allow attachment. That means you can create a multi-stack rocket simply by radially attaching fuel tanks to other fuel tanks, and then later sticking engines to the bottom. Now, you will not be able to decouple those side stacks in flight - for that, you would need radial decouplers, and I am not sure if they are available in the demo. In fact, since you ask like this, they probably aren\u0027t. But don\u0027t let that stop you - there\u0027s a lot you can do even without them. For example, there is not a single radial decoupler anywhere on \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7UMLoKX.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis 30-ton payload lifter\u003C/a\u003E (though there are some structural elements that the demo doesn\u0027t contain which keep it from wobbling).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTrebor","CreatedById":172975,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-14T08:22:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe demo has radial decouplers, so that would allow you to decouple the stacks in flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-14T08:49:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven better, then! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"C128user","CreatedById":175843,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-14T15:41:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have tried out the side mounting fuel tanks, and they do attach.\u00A0 Getting the thing to launch is another story.\u00A0 I keep getting some parts detaching when they shouldn\u0027t (such as my latest attempt to launch, and the capsule detached instead).\u00A0 Any other key to launch besides the Space bar?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SchweinAero","CreatedById":126909,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-14T17:32:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the saying goes, check yo staging!

You probably deployed the parachute too early. The parachute icon in the staging stack should change color to indicate when it is safe to deploy. red=not safe, yellow=probably ok, gray=ok. You should also be able to right click the parachute itself and it will tell you if it is safe to deploy. Anything under 300m/sec should be safe, but make sure you deploy at least 1km above the surface, as it takes time to fully deploy and slow you to a safe landing speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck.
