I managed to get it to a 75km LKO with around 3600 dV (based on burning my nuke engine), carrying a whopping 26.7% payload fraction in fuel. Using my RAPIER engines on air at Kerbin, that would be 27000 dV, not sure how the ISP translates to the thin air on Laythe. I also have a couple hundred units of oxidizer, which I think (well, hope) is just enough to push me back into Laythe orbit when I top out in atmospheric flight on the return trip. If all I wanted to do was touch down on Laythe empty, I could easily make it to the Jool system by a direct Hohman transfer, with plenty of maneuvering fuel left to manage my Laythe approach, but if I want to get there with enough fuel to seriously think about getting back, I\u0027ll need to get fancy with the gravity assists. I spent several hours trying to figure out how to do the Kerbin-Eve-Kerbin-Jool slingshot to no avail. I\u0027m not quite ready to just go look it up, but I am wondering if trying to go Mun-Duna-Jool would help me any. I think if I can shave something like 600dV off of my Jool transfer, getting back would not be out of the question. Once I\u0027m in Laythe orbit, I could probably manage a Tylo transfer for another 900-100dV, which I believe can get you ejected from the Jool system entirely if you set up the gravity assist right. I imagine that boosting prograde at an 8km Tylo periapsis will also get me some serious Oberth, maybe enough for me to eject from Jool straight to a Kerbin encounter with my remaining fuel. With all the possibilities for gravity assists and aerobraking, it\u0027s tough to say just how far I could get. It would be great to have some kind of tool for calculating how much dV you can get out of various assist maneuvers, but I have not seen one around.
