I think that \u0026gt;1 g is possible, actually. It\u0027s essentially the same violation of Newtonian mechanics as the EM drive claims- the spacecraft pushing against itself pushes the whole spacecraft forward. The Kraken engine operates at a fixed thrust in a fixed direction, and can be switched on and off. Going to 2X time compression cuts the thrust in half, 3X cuts it to 1/3, etc. I found this crack in the physics engine by accident, when I noticed that a legitimate spacecraft I made had an anomalous acceleration.

I knew this bug was far too easy and obvious for it not to be known. So apparently, I need to test my Kraken drives above 800 m/s, so effectively, in space... that will make it much more time-consuming. I\u0027ll probably just go back to playing real KSP. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, I\u0027m not using any other mods than Mechjeb, so your games ought to be behaving the same as mine in regards to physics....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust did a close fly-by of Laythe at 110 km/s...

It does float around- for a little bit until there is a hiccup in the drive- but it\u0027s not very controllable. Things work much better in deep space, where the hiccups in the Kraken drive- there are a lot when it first starts out as parts settle- don\u0027t cause you to immediately crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1voKzEnUopbZktpRVdEYURDUEk/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1voKzEnUopbZktpRVdEYURDUEk/view?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
