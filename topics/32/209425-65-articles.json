If you\u0027re on a tight budget, I\u0027d suggest going to Tom\u0027s Hardware and looking at their best GPUs for the money article that comes out each month. I\u0027d aim for $125-$150, if you\u0027re on a tight budget.

When doing my searches I found out it was driver related indeed, that a lot of people were suffering from the problems across a range of cards and that fixing it is a rather hit or miss affair. Nvidia did not seem to recognize the problem at all. I finally managed to fix it in a way I am still not sure how, but I am too afraid to poke it any more.

These features, with a compatible motherboard, allow a user to link multiple identical graphic cards together for added performance. In real world terms, this lets you buy a second identical graphics card down the line as a relatively cheap and easy way to gain a fairly large boost in performance. However, this requires buying a SLI/CFX compatible motherboard and PSU now, which may result in slightly higher initial cost.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that\u0027s more cost efficient, I am all for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the time being, I want to build a pc in a tower, but I will probably upgrade it into a case with a glass, led and water cooling, for the awesomness sake.
