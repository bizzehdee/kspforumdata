Now that we see what the remaining KSC models look like, does anyone else think the Barn was the best one of them all? I liked how it was modeled completely different from the Tier 4 buildings. It looked original and as if it held it\u0027s own. The current tier 1 \u0026amp; 2 models look like they are just empty space. I want to see my space center evolve, not just be filled in.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T20:27:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/103579-Bring-Back-the-Barn%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/103579-Bring-Back-the-Barn%21\u003C/a\u003E\n"}]}
