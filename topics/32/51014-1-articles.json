The only real issue is guessing where your apoapsis will be on ascent and therefore when you must begin to circularize. Other than that it\u0027s just a case of remembering certain orbital velocities and positions (e.g. In a 100km orbit around Kerbin, burning to 3km/s at \u0027Munrise\u0027 will get an encounter). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy limits:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Anything that requires more than a central orange tank and a maximum of 4 orange tanks to lift into orbit. It just falls apart no matter how many struts I put on it. This morning I was working on a craft to launch a 5 half-tank fuel depot to the Mun, yet whatever I did with struts and structural pieces one part always fell off. I blame performance causing physics to go wrong; the craft weighed in at 1038t on the pad and had nearly 500 parts which is just about all my computer can do and still be playable\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- SSTOs. The only ever SSTO I\u0027ve built required manually transferring fuel from the jet tanks into the rocket tank because the rocket burned up all its fuel.
