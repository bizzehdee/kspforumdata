itself compared to 1.2.2.\u00A0 My computer doesn\u0027t handle a bunch of extra stuff well (Core2Quad, with lower per-core performance than a current i3 iteration), so I don\u0027t run a bunch of

months, after almost 25 years without a malware infection.\u00A0 Both times, I was able to defeat it on my own, but that prompted me to actually start \u003Cem\u003Eusing\u003C/em\u003E the Linux I\u0027d had set up for dual boot for a while.\u00A0 That was when MEPIS 11 was fresh.\u00A0 When it failed to upgrade for a long time (project fizzled, apparently), I switched to Kubuntu (I was used to KDE by then).\u00A0 I haven\u0027t booted XP on my desktop machine since 2011, and it\u0027s no longer bootable (not sure what\u0027s broken, don\u0027t really care).\u00A0 My laptop still has Win7 dual booted with Kubuntu 14.04, but I haven\u0027t booted it into Windows in almost two years (I bought it just over two years ago).\u00A0 My next machine will hopefully be preinstalled with Ubuntu,

killed a lot of my visual pleasure in using Kubuntu (a lot of the eye candy was removed, and/or the developers of the eye candy couldn\u0027t be bothered to update their stuff in time for the release).\u00A0 I\u0027m thinking of replacing my 16.04 Kubuntu with Xubuntu 16.04 to see if the underlying system has any significant improvements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan
