Launched, transferred, aerobraked, and did the chute-assisted descent and landed without damage at an altitude high enough that I could get back to orbit. The lander design was such that the kerbal sat in a lander can near the bottom of the ship for the descent; for the ascent it would be jettisoned along with the gear and chutes while the kerbal rode back to orbit in a stylish lawn chair. After the obligatory flag planting and photo op, it was time for ascent so I sent the kerbal up the ladder to the chair. That\u0027s when I realized I hadn\u0027t put an angled ladder section on top to get over the lip of the fuel tank, so there was no way for him to get to the chair.
