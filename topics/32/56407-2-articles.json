You\u0027re being childish and destructive to the community/developer relationship. I\u0027ve seen a couple of your posts over the past couple days and they\u0027ve been nothing but toxic.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntil your title includes \u0022moderator\u0022, I don\u0027t give two kerbals about your opinion of my posts\u0027 tone/content/POV etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve as much right as you do to present my opinion in whatever manner I please so long as I keep my posts within the forum rules. You\u0027re just going to have to suck it up and live what I write.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr totally ignore it. Your choice. I seriously could not care less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, if you already think so little of my intelligence that you think your \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Epatronization\u003C/span\u003E explanation regarding project development or my tone would be informative, then I really don\u0027t see how you can believe that anything I say, regardless of tone, could possibly have any impact.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
