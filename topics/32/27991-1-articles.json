They did also announce that they need/want/are going to work on career mode is a major focus moving foward since they realized they hadn\u0027t really done anything about it yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027d half suspect we won\u0027t see mining even in .21, but maybe .22? I have a feeling that mining is probably going to be implemented in at least 2 or 3 more steps. WAG is that next we\u0027ll see resource mapping/scanning. Basically HOW to find the resources. That might not be in .21, but it\u0027ll probably the next iteration. Then we\u0027ll probably see the initial form of mining and resource refining/use. It\u0027ll probably take at least 2-4 revisions of this to get the \u0022final\u0022 form. Or at least that is my guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am betting that .21 is going to be the initial implementation of career mode. Though it is possible SQUAD may need to implement something else in support for implementing career mode in .22.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWho knows (probably not even SQUAD yet).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027ll get here.
