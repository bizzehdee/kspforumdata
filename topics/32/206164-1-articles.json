I built an arduino 4 joystick controller. The reasons I did this include that i have some space games that are like,, shooters and such, and I was flying FPV drones, and wanted to drive a spaceship with a controller and imagine it\u0027s a space robot. ,, so actually the end goal is exactly my first goal, to make an FPV course and go fly around it with a bottle and some thrusters just like the SPHERES robot (I imagine astrobee to be heavy). I have some other games that do allow some sort of thus simulation. I have starmade, for example, which I can sort of do this. Also, there\u0027s Lunar Flight, which is quite different, but does offer some degree of such activity. Also, there\u0027s Orbital Racer, which is exactly right,,,,, except,,,, it\u0027s not a small drone, it\u0027s a huge spaceship that a rider sits in, and the game physics are according to that idea. But,, if you rode in a quadcopter (like a flying car), it\u0027s not going to be as agile and capable as the tiny drones that people race with.

I will post a video. ,,, ok I will post 3.\u00A0 ,,, so,, my first picture, but with Lunar Flight sort of fuel limitations (SPHERES had about 30 seconds of actual thrust,, so you would need to thrust just right, and float to your goals, and then you should be able to get about a minute or two of time to manuever around a small course) ,,,,\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean actually my end goal is to get the real life drone and race it, but ,,,, that would require ,,, well,,, that would be a \u0022lofty\u0022 goal is the joke.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/JUqmNj1YQSA?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/gmNDwtaGZs0?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/r3Kf0WE5v2E?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022271130833_4756475731086170_2985026961474\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022171.67\u0022 height=\u0022903\u0022 width=\u0022526\u0022 src=\u0022https://scontent.fhnl3-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/p526x296/271130833_4756475731086170_2985026961474235947_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106\u0026amp;ccb=1-5\u0026amp;_nc_sid=730e14\u0026amp;_nc_ohc=iSfMBdGg940AX_dFbqr\u0026amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fhnl3-2.fna\u0026amp;oh=00_AT_MXaX_oK25vXVqpeV6oe8M18R-iPMbWlInU6_SERgi5Q\u0026amp;oe=61D49D72\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-12-31T08:07:01Z\u0022 title=\u002212/31/2021 08:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 31, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by tsmspace\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tsmspace","CreatedById":166436,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-01T06:18:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk,,, for any interested,, I\u0027ve managed to fly around the spaceport after hacking gravity.

So, I can basically build a course out of parts, it looks pretty cool, with motors and wings all over randomly, and then I can launch it from the airfield, set position near the launchpad, hack gravity as low as it goes, and then launch my craft and go fly around the course. For some reason I wasn\u0027t able to get my course to stay out when launched from the launchpad, although other drones that landed elsewhere would, so I guess I must still be doing something wrong somewhere,, but ideally I would be able to make a world with several courses all set up and then make longer courses out of them . but, I also like the small course format, which is what I imagine to be realistically feasible for someone to actually try right now.

It\u0027s really quite fun! I will post a video eventually, but not yet. Also, I don\u0027t know how the game works, but it appears to me as though loading in the course is actually not particularly efficient for the computer,,, I get a not responding flash, and then my graphics are breaking up a bit. maybe there\u0027s a way to crank them down a notch, but it looks pretty low, it just seems that the entities all being individual parts are a lot of processes compared to normal graphics with textures instead of all kinds of mass and aerodynamic surface and position and vector data. (so, by the time I load in a course, it\u0027s quite a few parts).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"swjr-swis","CreatedById":152460,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-01T20:53:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224071441\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206164\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221641017930\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166436\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tsmspace\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 hours ago, tsmspace said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, it doesn\u0027t look like theres a way to achieve FPV.

I\u0027m using the smallest parts I can, so I can\u0027t zoom in to the very front, it only zooms to a close view of that part. I did, however,, get a fairly useful view by zooming in to the thruster on the very TOP of the craft,, which blocked a lot of the screen but did give me a good view of what I could see, one that was pilotable now that I know what the craft can fit through. it\u0027s hard to fly locked 3rd person because of the same reason it\u0027s hard to fly inverted if you\u0027re not used to it,,, when you go left, and your camera is at the front of what\u0027s rotating,, then your view all goes one direction,, but if you are rotating around something out in front of you,, then part of what you see goes the opposite,, so depending on where your eyes are scanning at a given moment, you will think you are going backward.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
