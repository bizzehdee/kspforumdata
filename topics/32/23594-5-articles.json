I see very little difference between my SSD and the RAID0 I used to use. I\u0027m sure there\u0027s room for improvement somewhere in the loading code - but hey, that\u0027s why it\u0027s not finished yet.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still pretty certain the reason for huge delay in loading a lot of parts is that the config files all have to be read, digested and then inserted into memory. Reading straight english text is not a quick and easy task for some languages. Sure, you don\u0027t see much difference between one or two additional config files, but install the B9 Aerospace or KW Rocketry packs and look at the difference. What\u0027s the major bloat factor? Not the models; they\u0027re already set up in a fashion the engine is looking for in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggested in another thread that the parts could be \u0022compiled\u0022 into a more game engine-friendly format beforehand, with a small utility (simple drag-n-drop window) being available to re-compile from the sources when changes are made. Yes, that would mean the file count would go up for each part, because you\u0027d want to maintain those sources for editing later, (which is already done for most mods anyway), but the number of files the game is \u003Cem\u003Eactually loading\u003C/em\u003E wouldn\u0027t change. The only change would be that the game would \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E have to read the config files, parse the english text to determine attachment points and orientation and other various parameters of each part, and then load them in. Instead of a straight human-readable text .cfg file, the game could be given something more compressed that it doesn\u0027t have to translate at load time, which as far as I know, could shave a TON of time off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough I know there\u0027s a world of difference between Unity and PHP, it would take some effort to convince me that the game is faster than a simple PHP application at parsing and sorting out straight english text files. Just opening a 20-line .csv file and extracting values based on identifier tokens (the same method used in KSP parts) adds a LOT of processing time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m getting at is that it\u0027s not the drive, and it\u0027s not even the CPU on a given computer that cause the loading delay for games with lots of additional mod parts. It\u0027s the game engine having to open, parse and translate the values it\u0027s needing from straight simple text files. A way to \u0022compile\u0022 those files would be to throw out the logic that looks for identifier tokens, and hard code the engine to expect values for given elements in-sequence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo instead of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E// --- asset parameters ---mesh = model.mu\u003Cbr\u003Escale = 0.1\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E// --- editor parameters ---\u003Cbr\u003Ecost = 500\u003Cbr\u003Ecategory = Aero\u003Cbr\u003Esubcategory = 1\u003Cbr\u003Etitle = Standard Control Surface\u003Cbr\u003Emanufacturer = C7 Aerospace Division\u003Cbr\u003Edescription = Made of the finest materials at hand, these flight surfaces are guaranteed to operate while attached to the craft.
