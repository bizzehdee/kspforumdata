But I\u0027ve begun to notice that whenever I rendezvous with another vessel so that I can dock to it, as soon as I get within about 2.3km of the other vessel, the game freezes for upwards of 30 seconds and then resumes. Although this is the distance that it loads the other ships physics and whatnot, I\u0027ve never seen the game freeze up like this while loading other vessels physics, and it\u0027s extremely irritating especially when I\u0027m trying to land near another vessel on a planet or moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of this starting to happen with my addition of mods to the game, I\u0027m about 99.98% sure it\u0027s a mod that\u0027s causing this to happen, but before I go removing mods to see which one it is I want to just get a general idea about any mods that are known specifically to cause this problem or similar problems. So what I\u0027m going to do is list all of the mods I use below and it would be great if anybody could let me know if they\u0027ve had or heard of similar issues with any of the following mods or if there are any issues in general I should know about with any of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EKethane\u003Cbr\u003EMechJeb\u003Cbr\u003EQuantumStrut\u003Cbr\u003ESubassemblyLoader\u003Cbr\u003EDeadlyReentry\u003Cbr\u003EHaystack\u003Cbr\u003ECrewManifest\u003Cbr\u003EEngineerRedux\u003Cbr\u003EIoncrossCrewSupport\u003Cbr\u003EProtractor\u003Cbr\u003ERemoteTech\u003Cbr\u003ERomfarerLazorDockingCam\u003Cbr\u003ERomfarerRoboticArmsPack\u003Cbr\u003EKerbalAttachmentSystem\u003Cbr\u003EKerbalAlarmClock\u003Cbr\u003EFairingFactory\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this is my list of mods, and while typing this list up I have a growing suspicion that it may be the Romfarer mods that are causing my particular issue, although I am not sure of it yet.
