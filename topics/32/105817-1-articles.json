However, I can\u0027t find a new Delta-V or charts (like this one [http://deltavmap.com/](http://deltavmap.com/) but updated) for orbiting Kerbin with the new aerodynamics model ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif).\n\nIs it the same as the old one (4500 m/s) or did it changed (like FAR reduced the Delta-V required orbiting in the previous version) ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif) ?\n\nThx in advance (I count on you guys, don\u0027t let me down )\n\n***BY THE WAY, I\u0027M NEW HERE, SO PLEASE IF IT IS IN THE WRONG SUBFORUM, LET ME KNOW AND TELL ME WHERE I SHOULD POST***"},{"CreatedByName":"DanJourney","CreatedById":116043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T23:10:32Z","Content":"I know that it is significantly changed. FAR (a mod) used to have some Delta-V charts that are apparently fairly close. I\u0027ll see if I can find one.\n\nEdit: based on a quick search, it appears that Delta-V between planets should remain the same (which kind of makes sense when I, you know, actually *think* about it ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif)). Where it *will* change is on bodies with an atmosphere.\n\nThat being said, I\u0027m sure that there will be plenty of new material being produced by the community in the coming days/weeks/months. My brief experience is that the new aero works kind of like FAR, but I also never have used FAR/NEAR.\n\nOh, and WELCOME!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T23:19:24Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 11:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DanJourney**\n  \nResearch"},{"CreatedByName":"EladDv","CreatedById":118368,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T23:21:16Z","Content":"some experiments by GoSlash27 show that the Delta V for kerbin orbit hangs around 3400-3500. link to thead: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116993-Helpful-1-0-observations](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116993-Helpful-1-0-observations)\n\nGo give him some rep"},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T23:21:44Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been hearing 3,300 m/s thrown around for LKO, Not sure how much it varies right now though."},{"CreatedByName":"M-G","CreatedById":119904,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T00:15:23Z","Content":"OMG, thx everyone especially [EladDv](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/121572-EladDv)"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T00:54:33Z","Content":"Anything above 3000m/s for getting to LKO is too much. It can be done for less than 3000m/s, but that takes a bit of forethought. The efficiency of the launch is highly dependent on flight profile and initial TWR, but with a bit of practice anybody should be able to do it for 3000m/s routinely."}]}
