You want to only go in one direction with this shot, in my mind. You don\\\u0027t want to be using orbits (unless you can time the \u0027single shot\u0027 using one to reduce fuel consumption) for this. Find a route across the system that is as close to a straight line as possible. It doesn\\\u0027t necessarily mean sitting on the Mun for a week so the closest path comes to you (if you\\\u0027re trying to be at least semi-realistic about it), but if it\\\u0027s only 30 degrees off from you and there\\\u0027s no orbital interference going on, burn at it and adjust when you\\\u0027re halfway there and don\\\u0027t have any interference. When you start to toy with orbital paths, things can get a bit complicated because you have to mentally adjust for the curvature given to you at the time of \u0027zero acceleration\u0027, you know, your escape is pinpointed in one place, and the direction you assume you\\\u0027re coming from is completely different because the orbital map doesn\\\u0027t show what happens while you will be caught in orbit of another planet while in the orbit of a different one - you onl see the exit point and have to imagine what happens in between. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, you want to see how fast Minmus is moving in correlation with the Mun at your current location on its surface. From there you want to try and plan a shot at a tangent point between the Mun and Minmus. You say fuel\\\u0027s not a problem, but depending on when you make the initial burn, you could push yourself way off course and may need to spend more fuel than you initially intended. This is going to be all about making sure the first burn is correct. Better to be safe than sorry... I hope with all that extra fuel you have you filled some cargo space with food stuffs, as you might want to wait a day or two to get the optimal and easiest exit, and hungry Kerbals are stupid(er) Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ocf81","CreatedById":3426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-05T23:10:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022scotty110\u0022 data-cite=\u0022scotty110\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei\\\u0027ve never made a minmus attempt yet but i would imagine it would be similar to getting to the mun. make an orbit around kerbin and burn as soon as minmus appears on the horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would be true if launching from Kerbin, but I\\\u0027m launching from the M\u00C3\u00BCn. Since the M\u00C3\u00BCn is orbiting the same body as my target, it isn\\\u0027t as simple as a Kerbal based shot where you start at the center of the (locally) dominant gravity well and everything is relative to that well. With a Kerbin based shot you do an injection shot when the target is on the horizon and hope then for the best. The relative speeds of the launch body and the target body make it a tad more complex.

You have to make an out of plane orbit which shoots in the right direction taking in account the curve and the travel time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, I did end up on Minmus several times, but most often I need to so some orbiting and quite a bit of orbital adjustments around Kerbin to be able to intercept Minmus.

(I haven\\\u0027t tried it yet but there\\\u0027s no reason it shouldn\\\u0027t work):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn elliptical transfer from 50 km above the Mun to 10 km above Minmus (Pe = 11650 km altitude above Kerbin\\\u0027s surface, Ap = 46470 km altitude) takes 75.023 hours. Minmus moves 90.246 degrees in its own orbital plane in that time. As Minmus\\\u0027 orbit is only inclined at 6 degrees from the Mun\\\u0027s, and given the accuracy to which we know the Mun and Minmus\\\u0027 position at any time, it is reasonable to neglect Minmus\\\u0027 orbital inclination when calculating its angular displacement from the Mun\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C/sup\u003E. For this transfer orbit, a window occurs every time the Mun is located 89.8 degrees behind Minmus. This first occurs at 1d, 17hr, 51 minutes UT. It occurs again every 44.324 hours after that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn reality, you\\\u0027d have a hard time flying that transfer because of the nature of the required Munar escape trajectory (it needs to be elliptical rather than parabolic or hyperbolic). A more realistic transfer is a 11850 km x 46550 km orbit, which would take 75.559 hours from Pe to Ap. Actual transfer time from transfer orbit insertion burn to Minmus intercept is closer to 79 hours due to the time it takes to escape the Mun\\\u0027s SOI. The extra transfer time has a significant effect on the timing of the window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo insert into that transfer orbit from a 50 km circular, prograde, equatorial Munar orbit, our Kerbals would have to accelerate to 695.5 m/s starting the instant that the last bit of Kerbin\\\u0027s upper limb sets below the Mun\\\u0027s horizon, as seen from the 50 km high circular orbit (all described manoeuvers should occur within the Mun\\\u0027s equatorial plane). That\\\u0027s a delta-V of only 185.1 m/s and results in an elliptical orbit with Ap outside the Mun\\\u0027s SOI (Ap = 3050 km). If they flew the transfer orbit insertion burn accurately, then our Kerbals should find themselves in a 11850 km x 46550 km orbit about Kerbin after leaving the Mun\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s SOI. That transfer orbit should intercept Minmus with only minor orbital trim manoeuvres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for intercepting Minmus near the ascending or descending node, you\\\u0027d have to wait a long time before a launch window results in a Minmus intercept near one of the nodes. The earliest such option that results in Minmus intercept within 1000 km of the Mun\\\u0027s orbital plane occurs at 12d, 19h, 53 min UT (intercept ~850 km below Mun\\\u0027s orbital plane). The next one after that occurs at 31d, 7hr, 7min UT (intercept ~275 km above Mun\\\u0027s orbital plane). Fortunately though, it doesn\\\u0027t take much Delta-V to adjust your orbital plane enroute to Minmus if you start your transfer at one of the other windows, so you should be able to use any of the windows. Just be sure to start your insertion burn at exactly the instant that Kerbin sets, and try to have that burn start coincide as close as possible with the windows that I\\\u0027ve given above. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C/sup\u003EI made up a MathCAD spreadsheet that takes the orbital inclination into account, but the difference is insignificant for the purposes of planning this type of transfer. The maximum error that results from assuming that the Mun and Minmus are coplanar when calculating their angular displacement is on the order of 0.16 degrees. This can safely be ignored because it is silly, after all, to measure with a micrometer when you\\\u0027re marking with chalk and cutting with a chainsaw... The Mun moves through 0.16 degrees every minute. Minmus moves through 0.16 degrees every 8 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ocf81","CreatedById":3426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-08T09:29:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\\\u0027t been able to try yet, but your post has certainly given me a rough idea how long it takes/how much delta-v it will take and when to launch from the M\u00C3\u00BCn.
