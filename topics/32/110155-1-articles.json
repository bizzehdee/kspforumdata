The aerospike\u0027s niche is \u0022an efficient burning of fuel at all altitudes\u0022. That implies it has a very shallow Isp curve (I\u0027m assuming KSP models thrust as a linear function relative to barometric pressure, and barometric pressure is handled as a quadratic). A shallow Isp curve makes an engine take a relatively low thrust hit when under higher than 1 atm pressure (*cough*Eve*cough*). This is very much not the case, and if you land on Eve below ~5km above sea level, you are not going back to space today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Nerv is a bit on the hot side. I think that\u0027s a bit ridiculous. I know we\u0027re running a nuclear reactor and all, but this thing is not a nuclear lightbulb. I don\u0027t expect it to run on the razor\u0027s edge of meltdown. I went ahead and edited the heat production down in my personal config edits, along with fixing the now-useless aerospike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engine nerf makes it harder to get delta-V with chemical engines, which is a pretty strong buff to interplanetary travel. I\u0027d like to see vac Isp come up some (definitely not to where it was before, which would be too strong, but certainly an improvement over current is needed). ASL Isp might need a minor boost to prevent creating a massive TWR curve on launchers, but I think vac engines like the 909, the poodle, and arguably the skipper to a lesser extent. need to be able to achieve good delta V again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy all-chemical Duna transfer stage is a lot bulkier than before, IMHO very unnecessarily so. Larger, bulkier payloads do not go to space as easily, so artificially inflating the amount of fuel I need to carry (thus increasing my tankage needs and the size of the DTS overall) makes every step of the process which was, to my knowledge, not the target of these nerfs, harder overall. I understand the need to offset the 1000 less dV required to get to orbit now, but inflating the fuel requirements to acquire dV once in orbit I find wholly uneccessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sidereus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sidereus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI voted \u0022LV-N\u0022, though I suppose it\u0027s mostly the fact that it doesn\u0027t have a very wide variety of fuel tanks for it atm.

I thought the whole point of it was that it\u0027s supposed to have the same Isp regardless of atmosphere, but now it has the same Isp range as the LV-T45, which is more than twice as wide as the LV-T30.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-N, I haven\u0027t bothered trying to use yet. It was awkward enough before due to its long length and crazy-go-boom fairing. The change to LF-only makes sense for realism, but we really need an option to change any LF\u002BO fuel tank to be LF-only without leaving it half-empty. The overheating issue really seals the deal on keeping me scared away from them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rest of the liquid fuel engines seem fine now. The Spark is still useful without being ridiculous now, which gives the Terrier much more of a role than it had before. I\u0027ve also found the Skipper and Poodle to be more useful than in the past, even with the Mainsail still being fantastic.

Beyond the first couple missions of career mode where there aren\u0027t any other options, I just haven\u0027t had any use for them. When I play career, I\u0027m always trying to minimize the costs of my rockets. In my 0.90 career, almost every rocket I built used solid boosters in some way - usually an all-solid first stage. But now they\u0027re just terrible, and I\u0027ve never found a case where a rocket making use of solids is cheaper than an equally-capable all-liquid rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, the liquid engines mostly just received a nerf to Isp and a slight hit to atmospheric TWR. But the solid motors got hit from almost every angle.
