There\u0027s not a single best way to play KSP, you are totally free to experiment with unusual play styles without much in the way of penalty. Want an all SRB space program? Go ahead. Want to make planes and just fly around Kerbin? Fill your boots. Start a colony on Laythe? Have fun with it. Build replicas of real life rockets? You can do that, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- There\u0027s always more to learn. I\u0027ve played for about three years now, and I still learn things all the time that make me better at KSP, as often as not from some new poster here who\u0027s been playing for a month. I don\u0027t know that any other than a very elite few can say they are fully expert at all aspects of KSP with nothing left to learn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It\u0027s different. As the investment to create games gets higher and higher, companies are less and less likely to take chances on game genres that aren\u0027t already established. So we get Shoot People in a Slightly Different Way 5, Drive Really Fast in Photorealistic Cars 4, and Endorsement-filled Professional Sports Game 2015. KSP is fresh, and engages parts of the gamer mind that the repetitive other genres do not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It\u0027s SPACE. I\u0027ve loved space exploration since I was in grade school, a game that lets me be the rocket scientist, mission controller and the astronaut is incredibly appealing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It\u0027s cerebral. KSP appeals to the intellect in a way most games do not. There is a delay of gratification that makes your accomplishments more satisfying. It takes smarts to do well in KSP, not just the quick reflexes and relentless practice that most other games reward. It doesn\u0027t dumb down difficult concepts to make them easier, it challenges you to figure out those difficult things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It\u0027s customizable. Don\u0027t like some aspect of KSP\u0027s gameplay or wish there was a certain part in the game? I\u0027d give long odds that some modder has felt the same way and made a mod for it, likely thinking of things you didn\u0027t. Want more data for design and flight? Mods. Want hyper-realism and greater difficulty? Mods. More eye candy? Mods. Beautifully crafted replicas of real rockets? Mods. ISRU or theoretical propulsion systems? Mods. Your mix of mods can make the game just about perfect for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It keeps getting better. Each new release adds more features and bugfixes, and mods keep getting more refined and capable. I took a break from KSP for a few months in late 2012, when I came back to it the game had changed considerably for the better. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It has a great community. For all that KSP is mostly a single player game, the level of interaction I\u0027ve experienced in KSP\u0027s community is well above any other game\u0027s community of which I\u0027ve been a part. People are incredibly helpful when a player is trying to get over the initial hump of difficulty or otherwise struggling, they congratulate each other on their accomplishments, and there are tons of high quality tutorials, videos and other community-generated content out there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EdFred","CreatedById":108599,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T18:16:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy is a tree good?
