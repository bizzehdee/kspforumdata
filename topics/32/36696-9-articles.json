You are the one refusing to have an open mind, you are the one that is trying to deny a certain gameplay. When in reality simply providing the choice of to use or not use is all we need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had fun debating but i see this may start getting out of hand and also see there is no hope in debating this further with you at least, you seem to be set in your way and unwilling to see that providing a CHOICE is more logical than forcing something on someone. I am 100% confident the devs will provide the choice rather than restrictions, they have thus far in any feature they added\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KWilkiePJ","CreatedById":73880,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T22:38:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022OtherDalfite\u0022 data-cite=\u0022OtherDalfite\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThank you for being civil in your response.\u003Cp\u003EFor question 1, I would have to say no, as the devs haven\u0027t added the need to watch Oxygen and other gas levels yet, and that it falls under the same categories as RemoteTech or any other mod that increases game challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor question 2, I\u0027d have to say that it\u0027s a bit off. SQUAD has said that they will add a sort of thing like automatically doing maeuvers, as you said, but they will have a given chance of failure. This, I would be completely fine with in career mode, so long as the success rate wasn\u0027t 100% all the time. Mechjeb does everything exactly as you say, and doesn\u0027t give the classic chance of failure vibe as real rocketry does. I\u0027m not with the whole \u0022fly manual or GTFO\u0022 group either, I use ASAS on nearly all my craft, and will probably do so even more with the amazing new ASAS system being implemented. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the system that SQUAD has in mind would be implemented, you would hear no gripes from me. So long as you aren\u0027t guaranteed success, then the game still has a bit of difficulty to it. I agree I\u0027ve been a bit hasty in my responses, so thank you for making me realise that. And I do agree that mods enrich the gaming experience and that modders will eventually find a way to break through.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree that Squad doesn\u0027t want to lose interest, but they also deeply care about the end product of the game. The creation of ASAS was precisely made to the point that it is to not make the game too easy, but manageable in your flights. If Squad simply bent the will of KSP to what the community wants, it probably wouldn\u0027t be the game it is today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I started modding, I made sure I mastered everything by hand, launch, rendezvous, docking and landing. I then added mechjeb to speed up the process of establishing larger vessels like space stations and lunar bases, this is my preference though. I think this is true to life as quite a bit of current space travel is automated, hell the first space vessels made didn\u0027t even have a joystick! I disagree about the mechjeb point, mechjeb has crashed me quite a few times randomly. Ultimately, mods allow for variety, and variety is the spice of life! Also, its freedom of choice, let people choose!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OtherDalfite","CreatedById":8317,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T22:42:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo what\u0027s the point of restricting mods in some future career mode we don\u0027t have any concrete information about?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere really isn\u0027t a point.

And hear you ask \u0022Well some mods make it harder, why don\u0027t you want those?\u0022 I\u0027ll respond to this by saying that even though I want career mode to be difficult, I don\u0027t want to overwhelm a new player with extra difficulty mods they may install.
