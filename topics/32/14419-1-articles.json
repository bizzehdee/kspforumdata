That was my most recent attempt. Earlier I was touching down in the same manner, 4m/s no horizontal velocity but the hill is at a grade and I am totally perpendicular to the ground, so my left lander legs touch the ground first and just break off (at less than 4m/s) and then of course explode for some reason.

They will jettison when you take off your booster tanks, but the smaller mass at that point usually wont need to turn your rocket. RCS are best for the large rockets. Also the speed. 4m/s is a final approach speed, and once you get close can cut it down to less than 1m/s, and just tap the surface ever so gently. This last point is usually good to have any SAS off.
