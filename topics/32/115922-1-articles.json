However, you should have a choice of contracts being offered to you. Are there any easier ones in that list? Can you cancel one you\u0027ve agreed to and do another instead? If not, then yes, it looks like you\u0027ll need to start over. \n\nMeanwhile, I understood your question and you are welcome to post here, but if you feel more comfortable in your native language, we do have a [sub-forum for Polish](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/61-Polish). \n\nAnd welcome to the forum. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T19:47:42Z","Content":"If you\u0027ve only got $3500 and 2 contracts taking up both contract slots in Mission Control, the only choice (other than restarting, which is fine really as you seem to be just starting out anyway) is to cancel them, take the hit, and start anew.\n\nNote: You won\u0027t go under $0 for canceling the contracts, so you\u0027ll only lose the $3500. And you can build a $3500 ship and put it on the launch pad, then cancel the contracts, and then recover the vessel to get your money back. So, all you\u0027ll lose is a little rep.\n\nThen you can take 2 new contracts that will give you some seed money to build a ship that can complete them. You could also just take a few \u0022test this part on the launch pad\u0022 type stuff to build up a bankroll so you can tackle harder missions (and get your rep back you lost earlier)."},{"CreatedByName":"Tylerd","CreatedById":147949,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T19:52:21Z","Content":"with career mode ive found its much more fun if you set your starting money to 500,000, and set starting science to like 300 or so.
