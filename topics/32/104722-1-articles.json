Newer players really take that feature for granted. Before 0.14, you couldn\u0027t even save, let alone have multiple craft active at one time. A trip out to the Mun had to be done in one go, and if anything went wrong, well, there went about a half an hour of effort. Better luck next launch!"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T17:32:39Z","Content":"My favorite feature of the game is the Create and Play feature.\n\nStep 1: Create your own Rockets\n\nStep 2: Play with them in Sandbox or Contracts.\n\nStep 3: Profit (if playing Career Mode)!"},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T18:35:42Z","Content":"I think docking ports really are one of the most significant game-changing features of the whole shebang. The ability to attach two separate structures together (either permanently to make a larger structure or temporarily to transfer crew or fuel) opens up so many possibilities. In career mode my primary driving goal, above anything else, is to research that first docking clamp and atomic engines--with those, I can put together enormous space tugs, meaning that any ship that can reach orbit can be towed to anywhere else; and also tankers to refuel anything anywhere that needs it."},{"CreatedByName":"Wolfos31","CreatedById":61724,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T18:35:56Z","Content":"For me, definitely the fact that you can build your own ships. I\u0027ve seen people create some truly epic designs. Archaic Alibi on Youtube does some really neat stuff. And I\u0027m pretty proud of a few of my own designs too. \n\nBut building ships without flying them would be very boring. So I don\u0027t feel like any feature in the game can really stand on its own."},{"CreatedByName":"ArmchairGravy","CreatedById":78526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T18:41:21Z","Content":"The various design challenges involved in exploring the Kerbol system.

If I want to get rigorous, I can install DRE \u0026 FAR (or upgrade to 1.0 and slide the difficulty up :-) )\n\nIf I want a goofy gadabout the KSC in a one-man plane I can do that, or if I want to see how many Kerbals I can scrape off Eve, I could do that too.\n\nI think the place Orbiter fell short was you have to be H-A-R-D-C-O-R-E to even get off the pad. It doesn\u0027t have a \u0022oh I just want to goof around today\u0022 mode.\n\nBut the biggest feature is the fidelity. Sure it does patched conics and a shortcut aerodynamic model, but it\u0027s pretty damn close to real life when you want to be, and I will never forget the first time I watched MechJeb do an automated rendezvous and realized I could talk the space talk but I couldn\u0027t walk the walk, and I needed to seriously bone up on orbital mechanics. \n\nWhen I do an asteroid rendezvous, then by gum, I had to work at it and I accomplished something to be a little proud of. The game didn\u0027t hand it to me on a silver platter.\n\nI think this XKCD expresses what I\u0027m trying to say: [https://xkcd.com/1356/](https://xkcd.com/1356/)"},{"CreatedByName":"Xacktar","CreatedById":88876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T20:45:14Z","Content":"Freedom.\n\nFree to build what I want, go where I want, and break what I want."},{"CreatedByName":"ouion","CreatedById":38531,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T20:47:06Z","Content":"The \u0022build whatever you want\u0022 feature"},{"CreatedByName":"micr0wave","CreatedById":136352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T20:49:31Z","Content":"those little green dudes are still entertaining me ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T20:49:47Z","Content":"The fact that i can make whatever im in the mood to make, and see if i can make it fly or go to space. I really like the dynamic nature of this game, while you can always try to make replicas, the fact that you are given a ton of parts and told to go make something out of them is what i like. No prebuilt or preset craft, no particular limits on what you can fly (if i want to recreate reality there are plenty of more realistic flight sims out there), and the best thing is that so many funny designs end up actually working.\n\nThat and i like making combat vessels, from small SSTO fighters, to massive capital ships made of 400ish parts. While i dont necessarily make every vessel from a combat perspective, almost everything including conventional rockets and supply ships end up armed with something."},{"CreatedByName":"SUPERNERD101","CreatedById":133059,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T20:52:54Z","Content":"Spaaaace!
