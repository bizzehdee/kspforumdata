Newer players really take that feature for granted. Before 0.14, you couldn\u0027t even save, let alone have multiple craft active at one time.

The ability to attach two separate structures together (either permanently to make a larger structure or temporarily to transfer crew or fuel) opens up so many possibilities. In career mode my primary driving goal, above anything else, is to research that first docking clamp and atomic engines--with those, I can put together enormous space tugs, meaning that any ship that can reach orbit can be towed to anywhere else; and also tankers to refuel anything anywhere that needs it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wolfos31","CreatedById":61724,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T18:35:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor me, definitely the fact that you can build your own ships.
