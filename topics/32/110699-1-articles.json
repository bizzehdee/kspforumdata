So I decided to fire up the sandbox game and start designing and testing a eve lander. Haven\u0027t seen anyone else post a return mission from eve so I thought I would post my mission to \u0022help\u0022 others. Although I\u0027m sure there are better way to do things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy final rocket cost was $9.6 million and the mission contract offered $652K. I\u0027m not sure if its possible to make money on this contract? And if it is I would think you would have to land on the highest eve mountain which means a ton of reloading for all the failures. I wanted to make a craft that could at least launch from 1000m so where I landed wasn\u0027t a big deal as long as I landed in one piece. Also once I had the eve landing and interplanetary stages designed I pretty much started strapping on engines and fuel tanks to get off of kerbin. Which could have been done better and saved some money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen 1.0 was coming out I was worried that this mission would be too easy compared to .90. Boy was I wrong! Arguably it is easier to launch off of eve but the extra delta v required to land and get into eve orbit makes it overall more difficult (see lessons learned below).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELessons learned:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Drag is Huge! And it doesn\u0027t work like you would expect. For instance, I built a rocket that would get into eve orbit...Then I added ladders for my kerbal and it would no longer get into orbit. Things like struts as talked about in other threads also cause more drag than expected (IMO). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Aero braking to get into orbit like in .90 doesn\u0027t seem to be viable unless you have a very small craft. Which means packing on alot more delta v to get into orbit at eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Its difficult to land without your ladders exploding due to heat. Which means deorbiting with a lot of delta V to get your speed down. I used a lot of air brakes to help with this. They seem to be pretty helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Drogue parachutes are helpful here. They don\u0027t rip your aircraft into pieces when trying to land and keep your craft pointing the right direction when trying to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-In .90 i used to shoot for 1.4 TWR to get off of EVE. With the limited testing I did being around 2.0 is much better. I was seeing mach effects and re-entry effects until about 32,000m during my launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is the pictures from the mission. I forgot to put a second kerbal in the 2nd capsule and I used hyperedit to get the 2nd kerbal to my spacecraft (Doh!). So now is the time to call me a cheating *. Also I used kerbal engineer and KW rocketry (maybe some B9) addons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/0rora\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
