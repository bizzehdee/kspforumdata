You just have to be really careful how you tweak the CG to make sure you have a stable lander.\n\nAs for three, I recall Manley doing lots of missions with three mounted radially with FAR installed. \n\nThere\u0027s definitely a tradeoff now that you didn\u0027t have before. The atmosphere acts as a much thinner one now, so the dV requirements for a single streamlined stack is reduced, but you get really penalized for not streamlining. So if your dV is poor, what about streamlining the outboard components with cones or fairings? You\u0027ve still got a large cross section, but you should be able to manage better.

I can go 800ms at 1000m to 2000m but I can only go 900ms at 18km when theres less than 1/4 the air... Do you physics bro.. or common sense even. less air hitting your craft at a given speed will mean less heating it doesn\u0027t have to be exactly liner but like being off by that much makes no sense, either make it so you have to travel less fast down low or make it so the heat is less aggressive higher up.\n\nAlso the non inclusion of heating indicators for AT LEAST the cockpit is a massive oversight, also the cockpits should have active heat shielding, this problem more comes with space planes and rockets are fine the way they are mostly because the fairings act as a heatshield and have a 2400 max temp, and the arcing of a Rocket is a lot different than a space plane.\n\nAlthough I think all of the engines need nerfing now for rocket, just thrust not so much DeltaV although they could do with a little nerfing in deltaV just in the higher thrust engines, solid rocket fuel should keep its deltV because its under used anyway because of the OPness of KSP liquid engines TWR and pure thrust.\n\nOnce deadly reentry is updated I am so moving back over to that, although for aerodynamics I think they hit a happy medium between being intuitive and being fun, ill probably move back over to FAR when its updated but the stock aerodynamics are good, I just like the difficulty of FAR, but I can wait quite a while for FAR because the stock aerodynamics are good enough.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T16:09:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 04:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by etheoma**"},{"CreatedByName":"jara_","CreatedById":141609,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T15:56:46Z","Content":"In a way I\u0027m sad that most of my ships won\u0027t work anymore, but on the other hand it feels like when I first started playing and was learning.\n\nSuffering with deadly reentry, but having fun as well."},{"CreatedByName":"Kerano","CreatedById":107460,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T16:02:47Z","Content":"The whole heating system seems a bit like black magic at the moment.

Basically, rather than assuming the engine is limited by the total thrust it can create, it\u0027s limited by how fast it can pump fuel into the chamber. At max thrust, the fuel rate is the same, but you get less thrust due to lower ISP.
