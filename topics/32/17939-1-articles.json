Last night, I had a stroke of inspiration while watching videos of Saturn V launches, and built what I would argue is the most overbuilt rocket I\u0027ve ever made. Of course I am very happy that I have finally designed a rocket that flies smoothly, effeciently, and can get me to mun, land, then to minmus, land, back to mun, land and then back to kerbin with fuel to spare, lol.. but the game has somewhat lost a little challenge for me. This rocket is so adaptable, I can suit it to any mission role... rescue, satellite deployment, lander operations, rendezvous operations... I\u0027d post the .craft file, but I am a hopeless mod addict, and couldn\u0027t even begin to list the mods I have, or even how many mod parts I have used in this rocket, lol. I can\u0027t bring myself to just... stop using it, because i love flying the thing. So my question is this... what sort of unique and interesting challenges have you all come up with to keep yourself entertained? My next objective after building an awesome rocket was to build one that would be able to reach the new planets next patch, but this one is more than capable of that too, lol.
