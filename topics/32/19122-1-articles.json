However, I noted a few oddities and I am not sure if that is working as intended or a bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, discarded stages at a low orbit (Periapsis \u0026gt; 40000) seem to continue orbiting forever without noticeable atmospheric braking. I thought to myself, \u0022hey, i\u0027ll also use a low periapsis (~25.000, Apoapsis roughly 140k)) to slowly brake myself into a landing trajectory. Turns out, that low, my upper stage never makes it out of the atmosphere again. On the other hand I have a large piece of debris (a few big tanks with a big engine) which swings by at 25.000 (plus minus 2k) and goes back up to the periapsis of 140k. Why? Intentional simplification, much MUCH lower drag?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, the efficiency of the engines seems to dependent on level of thrust quite a bit. Is this intentional or a bug?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EK\u0027toff\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-12T12:59:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIntentional simplification apparently, I\u0027ve read there\u0027s no drag for discarded stages until they hit a lower altitude limit which auto-removes them (I think that\u0027s somewhere around 25k).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel use scaling with throttle level is currently bugged for liquid rocket engines, the factor is applied twice so 1/2 throttle uses 1/2*1/2 (1/4) fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-12T13:17:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I ran into the lack of aerobraking for debris early on...
