They destroy weak parts such as solar panels. \n\nI\u0027m guessing they were only tested on single payload craft where the deployment parts won\u0027t hit anything. But on more complicated craft these parts flying off can wreck a mission. \n\nMaybe have a deploy force slider on the part?"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T06:45:14Z","Content":"\u003E Maybe have a deploy force slider on the part?\n\nPlus it would be nice to have an option to connect each part of the fairing to another, so you can slide your payload carfully out of the shroud."},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T06:50:21Z","Content":"A quick work around is to time warp right after you jettison the fairings.
