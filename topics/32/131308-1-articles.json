I was trying for Duna. This was my first try at any interplanetary trip. It took a few tries just to get the phase angle right as several times I timewarped past it. Then my next hurdle was the atmosphere and areobraking. I tried 5 times, 4 of them I went to low and burnt up and the 5th I just carried on right past Duna. Then finally I managed to get into an orbit with only minimal retro burns. This was my first bit of joy. I then detached my Ike probe and put it into a parking orbit so I could land my Duna craft with Jeb Bob and Bill inside ready to do some science and take their picture (they probably tasted the surface sample). This also took a couple tries. But finally I managed to land on the orange surface. This moment was one of great joy. Then I thought, \u0022well... I have far less fuel than was I planed to have at this point but I still have 100 more m/s than this app on my phone tells me I need\u0022. I was concerned because I had only around 30 hours into the game and honestly had a very vague idea of how to get back. I then proceeded to land my Ike probe which tipped over upon landing but it fulfilled my contract. I went back and did other things in the Kerbin system while I waited for the phase angle and all I could think about was getting my guys back.
