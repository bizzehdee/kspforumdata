(Don\u0027t deny it, even if you just reverted the flight.) It is a major pain, especially with designs optimized for ultra-high speeds that use ALL the runway to get aloft (including that little ski-jump effect at the end \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I ask you, has anyone been able to succeed in safely landing their ENTIRE spaceplane in the water, without tearing off something?

You\u0027ll start to lift upwards if your center of lift is particularly off-balance, but most of the time it will work out in such a way that the extra height you gain is negated pretty fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, you know, you can just stick a few parachutes on and bypass the whole problem...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qromodynmc","CreatedById":87139,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T22:29:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEvery part in ksp has own crash tolerance,Some of them 5,10,20ms etc.,So if you want to land your craft into water,you need to go slower than these speeds,The only way to do this; Parachutes. or you can put metal plates under your aircraft,but this would make your plane pretty heavier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rosenkranz","CreatedById":57152,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T22:39:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVTOL is the only sure way to do this.
