For me, KSP is currently sadly lacking in the actual space exploration department. Or rather, space exploration has been allowed to fall behind fripperies like planes and boats.

I don\u0027t need c-beams glittering in the dark (in fact I actively dislike going military in KSP), I don\u0027t even need much to look at once I get to another world (although that would be nice). But I would really, really like to have some new stock parts for space stations. Some stock options for building things in orbit. Some stock options for building bases that aren\u0027t a motley collection of Hitchhiker modules and landing rockets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeck lets push the boat out (har) and go for some actual moving parts, so that I can build a nice little rover, launch it in halfway sensible payload fairing and then unfold and deploy it after landing.

Personally I have spent very little time with the aircraft etc., I have nothing against it but the reason I play the game is for SPAAAAACE! (I did actually get a plane to fly the other night, but it was the first one I did anything more than slap a few parts together and give up as soon as it crashed immediately after take off!) I see the attraction of building planes and especially SSTOs but it does feel like the SPAAACE part is being neglected somewhat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tseitsei","CreatedById":139058,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T18:47:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree that now that we have somewhat working atmo and reentry heat we need much more versatile station/space building. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that said atmo update was imo even more needed because souposphere and no reentry heating.
