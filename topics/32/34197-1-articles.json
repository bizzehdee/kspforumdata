I thought, since the scale of the Kerbin star system is much smaller than ours, yet the planets and stars exert comparable gravitational influence (something that is usually explained as an effect of the celestial bodies being much more dense) it led me to realize that the physical laws in this universe must be somewhat different from ours to compensate for these differences. From that point, I began wondering if the cosmic speed limit - the speed of light - would be different as well. Most importantly, given the knowledge we \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E know about the Kerbin system, is it possible for us to either calculate or take an educated guess as to the exact value? Not only is this a subject of scientific inquiry, however for practical reasons as someone interested in experimentation within KSP, understanding the presumed physical laws and constants of the universe in this game are important. If anybody has any ideas regarding finding this magic number, I\u0027d be willing to entertain them and try my hand at finding it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks alot!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Dan\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AceMgy","CreatedById":50962,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T00:05:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes it is quite different. The speed of light is infinite in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game uses purely Newtonian mechanics, as none of the calculations done by the game contain a gamma correction. I\u0027m assuming, there, as I\u0027ve not decompiled the game and gone diving into the source code to find out (which would be a pain), but I\u0027d be \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E surprised if they went to the trouble of including special relativity for no conceivable benefit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Just realized you weren\u0027t asking if the game calculated relativistic mechanics, but if one could derive a revised speed of light from the constants in KSP. The gravitational constant in KSP is the same as ours, and we have no data about the electromagnetic constants (permittivity and permeability of free space, for starters) that would allow us to caculate the speed of light directly if relativity were to be implemented into the game.
