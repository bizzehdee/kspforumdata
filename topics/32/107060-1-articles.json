To start, I\u0027ll share something I\u0027ve discovered recently:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I was testing out a new plane when I accidentally EVA\u0027d a kerbal instead of IVA. We were pretty high up, so I thought I might try to catch him in my cargo bay. Long story short, I failed, and decided to let nature take it\u0027s course. But it didn\u0027t. It appears that in 1.0.2, a kerbal\u0027s terminal velocity is sometimes slow enough for them to safely land in water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ran multiple tests and they all had similar results, first at lower altitudes, then went higher after each test. They all survived no matter how high they went. Heck, if you could attach a heat shield to a kerbal, I wonder if they could safely return from orbit without parachutes or engines!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience, people.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T02:59:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe a MOOSE-like system could be made?
