All of my giant apollo rockets are around the height of the VAB and I\u0027ve encountered this bug quite a few times. I think I even asked you about it before you\u0027d seen it yourself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure it\u0027s just the VAB because I\u0027ve seen plenty of videos of people docking parts together in orbit to make huge spacestations without problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suspicion is that it\u0027s caused by the fact the game saves every time you make a change to the ship...... to allow the \u0022undo change\u0022 shortcut key to work. When we build mega-ships the craft files get really long, and I don\u0027t think the auto-save thingy can\u0027t keep up. I think it\u0027s the reason there\u0027s a slight hang when you make big changes, eg.... adding 8 big boosters at the same time, and sometimes it overloads and screws up the file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I think it happens with different part counts because not all parts are equal. A basic part like a girder doesn\u0027t do much, so doesn\u0027t take up many lines in the craft file. A more complex part like an engine or fuel tank has multiple function states, multiple tweakables, so takes up much more room in the craft file. Many of your biggest craft use lots of basic parts, which would explain why you\u0027ve handled such high part counts in the past. I\u0027ve had this bug appear before 2000 parts before, but my crafts tend to use a lot less structural parts and are mostly made of boosters, so it\u0027s possible using those parts is what causes it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen another bug with the autosave. Sometimes if you use it to revert a change on a very large ship, it\u0027ll go and revert like 5 changes. This seems like proof that the autosave thing isn\u0027t funtioning properly, so I suspect it\u0027s malfunctioning in other ways as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I might try some tests to see if I can reproduce the bug under controlled conditions. I doubt it\u0027s high priority for the devs to go looking for bugs that only happen to giant spaceships, but if we could figure out a way of easily reproducing it they might be able to do something about it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-15T18:03:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI learned recently that docked ships don\u0027t get saved as a single ship, but as a conglomeration of \u0022docked ships\u0022 which are very similar to normal ships except that they\u0027re... uh, docked. It\u0027s a little weird.

I can make this about 25,000 meters. But how much do you pull up? To 45 degrees? Keep it horizontal, but boost really hard? Vertical and correct later?
