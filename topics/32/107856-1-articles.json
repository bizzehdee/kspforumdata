There is no reason you should be punished for something you could not possibly prevent, and thus it is completely reasonable to fix the mistake the game made.

If your best friend has told you they hate cheese and tomatoes, are you going to take them off your burger because they say so? I hope your answer would be something along the lines of \u0022No, go get your own @#!% burger...\u0022 and then set your heart on enjoying what you have.\n\nKSP is the same way... it is your copy of the game on your computer and it is there for your amusement.
