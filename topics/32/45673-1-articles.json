Not too long ago, either. I think there was a discussion about it a few months ago as to how they might go about making it...I kind of thought they could make a simple 2D KSP app or something, but most people seemed to want just the vehicle assembly building on a phone or tablet to take with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome people thought it was a terrible idea, but a lot of people liked the idea. I\u0027m on the fence about it...simply \u0027cause it wouldn\u0027t benefit me at all(no smartphone or tablet here).
