That\u0027s more a trademark issue than copyright (\u0022I drew this Jeb myself, it\u0027s not a copy). Trademark violations can be interpreted as \u0022brand abandonment\u0022 by the IP owner if not fought, and can be used in court against them. This is why large companies \u0022have to\u0022 defend their trademarks aggressively (NFL telling a church league for grammar school kids they can\u0027t use NFL team names comes to mind. I\u0027m not saying that was necessary but that\u0027s the reasoning behind such behavior). Remember T2 hasn\u0027t just paid Squad to sell copies of the game.

I know that to play games with an EULA, I\u0027m presumed to have agreed to the EULA. If I disagree with the EULA for whatever reason, I know what I\u0027m supposed to do is \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E play the game, and walk away entirely. I don\u0027t have the option to reject the EULA and still play the game. Even if the EULA is completely illegal, that still isn\u0027t an option - I would have to legally challenge the EULA in court for amendments to be made to make it legal, and then still ultimately accept it or reject the game in its entirety.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s the point where this all comes apart. If I play the game without accepting the terms, I\u0027m acting immorally because I know I don\u0027t have that option.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOf course I have to reconcile my sense of moral rectitude with my general laziness... so I should technically read EULAs (which I almost never do) and agree to them all whole-heartedly (which I obviously can\u0027t) before playing.... but who can be bothered? But that does mean I am compromised to some extent - I can\u0027t pretend that I know I\u0027ve behaved properly and that I\u0027m on the right side of all this. So I can\u0027t rely on the moral highground to save me if the legal waters start to rise, I just have to keep hoping they don\u0027t.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOr I could start reading all my EULAs, and see you next Christmas? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI disagree. The point of an EULA is to afford a non IP-owner a capacity to make use of copyrighted material. International and many different national level laws make it quite clear what that amounts to: don\u0027t steal the IP owners property.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the IP owner defines \u0022stealing\u0022 from them as \u0022continuing to use the product you paid for despite our claiming you have to stop using it simply because we say so\u0022 that flies in the face of several hundreds years of property law and general common law. They will do it because they can get away with it. In order to stop doing it, they need to be challenged. But as I\u0027ve said repeatedly, it is ILLEGAL and it merely waits to be challenged in court. You cannot sell someone something and then changes the terms of sale after the transaction is complete. The fact that the \u0022something\u0022 was software makes no difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nADDIT: Oh lord, this article . . . While it does make the fair, and accurate point that there are many legal grey areas, the article itself (if not the \u0022legal expert\u0022 they consulted) have got at least one thing wrong as far as I can tell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#333435;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nFor gamers, what this ultimately boils down to is that when they purchase a game, they don\u0027t really own it. As Jas explains, \u0022services are essentially just a benefit provided on certain terms and don\u0027t involve you owning anything\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#333435;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nInstead, gamers purchase a license which gives them the right to use that software provided they agree to and comply with the terms stipulated in the End User License Agreement (EULA) - that thing you have to click through before you\u0027re allowed to play. The problem with this is while publishers treat games as services, gamers generally treat games as goods, and it\u0027s entirely logical that they do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGamers have NEVER owned their games. The product/service distinction is irrelevant to this point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBook owners do not \u0022own\u0022 the stories that are created by the unique combination of ink stains on paper sandwiched within the covers of the book. Record owners do not \u0022own\u0022 the songs created by the unique combination of peaks and valleys etched into the vinyl on the records. Game DVD owners do not \u0022own\u0022 the games created by the software that is represented by the\u00A0microscopic etching on the plastic disks. Game downloaders who own hardware on which software was stored which creates a game, also do not \u0022own\u0022 the game that is encoded on their hardware. But they DO own the hardware and arguably also the software, but they do not own the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI own (as I\u0027m sure many of us do) MANY physical media copies. I OWN THEM. No one else owns them. No one else has any legal right to them. The law is absolutely crystal clear on this point, there is NO DEBATE. Sony, MCI, Matrix, EA, and all the other various entities who sold these media to retailers who then sold them to me have absolutely ZERO legal rights to those DVDs/CDs/vinyls or books.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is essential that this point be absolutely clear to everyone and that we are all in agreement on it. When one makes a purchase for anything, one OWNS that thing. That thing might be \u0022sitting in this seat from 20:00 to 22:00 while the orchestra plays,\u0022 or it might be \u0022sitting in this seat here while this aircraft travels from L.A. to Honolulu,\u0022 or it might be \u0022possession of a piece of physical media like a book, a DVD, a CD, a vinyl, an 8-track,\u0022 whatever. It might also be internet-based access to a database/downloading/installing application sufficient to download and install a functioning copy of a particular piece of software onto one\u0027s own hardware. Often this latter example will be highly constrained, meaning that: the software one is paying to download and install might only be compatible with a narrow range of hardwares, and/or dependent on a certain narrow set of operating systems and/or require other third party software to function fully.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe key analogy here is that: once a person has downloaded a piece of software to their own hardware, they OWN that software. This is not the same thing as \u0022owning the game\u0022 or \u0022owing the IP\u0022 as I explain below, but it absolutely MUST mean that the person who legally acquired that download OWNS the software; any other interpretation would lead quite simply to anarchy and revolution, even IF the game\u0027s publishers/IP owners/their legal counsel would wish to claim otherwise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only caveat I could imagine holding up in court is if the EULA had to be agreed to BEFORE the transaction. This is never done, and so the standards of ownership which have prevailed for the past several hundred years of commercial distribution of copyrighted material are the standards which will be applied by any sane court of law. To date, I don\u0027t think it has been challenged and it may never be challenged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow here are\u00A0the parts that generate\u00A0confusion, arguably unnecessary confusion:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. On many of those physical media objects we possess, are copies of intellectual property.. Those might be music, literature, games, movies, visual arts, etc. Despite OWNING the media on which they exist, NONE OF US own those intellectual properties and we NEVER HAVE. This is a point which the article is either confusing or just plain getting wrong. I do not own \u0022Houses of the Holy\u0022 even though I OWN a record with that \u0022album\u0022 of music impressed on it. The \u0022lack of ownership of the games\u0022 is nothing new, it was ALWAYS the case and has always been the case for hundreds of years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Software, fundamentally, are logical and mathematical expressions which regulate electrical states on hardware. Any given piece of software can take multiple different forms depending on how it was created, but the fundamental form which all software must have at some point in its life cycle is \u0022machine code,\u0022 the binary code which directly controls the electrical states on hardware and thus creates the experience of any given computer application or operating system. In much the same way the author /publisher/IP owner of a book or an album of music OWNS the story/music the developers/publishers/parent company/IP Owners OWN the game. They always have and they always will. What they do not own is my hard drive, just as the owner of Grapes of Wrath doesn\u0027t own the book the retailer sold me. Once the software which is the media for that IP is on my hardware, I own it (the software, not the IP). If I agreed to an EULA BEFORE purchase which states that I will relinquish ownership after X period of time, then of course I am bound to do so. But if I agree to a EULA stating as much AFTER I have already paid for the product, then my interpretation is that the writer of the EULA has made an illegal imposition on my property. If they seek to impose their interpretation of property law onto my hardware then they are going to have to take me to court. They won\u0027t however, because they know they will lose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nADDIT#2: but there is one additional \u0022complication\u0022 that deserves to be acknowledged, and that is the issue of \u0022software as a service\u0022 versus a \u0022product.\u0022 It is a legitimate distinction, but the distinction is ultimately not dependent either on the medium of distribution, nor claims made by the distributor which run counter to the long-standing standards of commerce and property.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are many \u0022games\u0022 which absolutely ARE services, not \u0022products\u0022 and it is perfectly legal and legitimate for the IP owners to describe them that way, and to treat them legally that way. For some service based games (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E Online is one), the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://community.eveonline.com/support/download/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eclient-side package\u003C/a\u003E (the software and all its supporting files and documentation) is readily available to anyone for free (you probably have to create an account but not pay for a subscription); this is of course not the case for many service based games, but I will focus on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E because the fact the client-side package is \u0022free\u0022 serves to demonstrate the actual nature of a \u0022service based game.\u0022 In the case of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E Online, this download is\u00A0built\u00A0in such a way that, any \u0022functionality\u0022 a user might be able to gain with ONLY the client side package is minimal and falls well below the threshold of \u0022full functionality\u0022 or \u0022full service.\u0022\u00A0\u00A0In order to gain full service, the publisher/IP Owner of the game\u00A0REQUIRE that users connect these client packages to an authorized server using credentials which are paid for on a subscription basis.

People don\u2019t have to be bitten to know to stay out of your yard, there\u2019s a deterrence factor. Even if the EULA is totally unenforceable, when Joe Sixpack sees a 44 page license agreement he might think twice about pirating your stuff, and that\u2019s the goal. \u00A0If EULAs were ironclad, there would be no need for DRM... any violation of the license agreement would result in swift punishment for the offender. \u00A0The thing is more often than not, copyright holders are unable to meet the burden of showing actual damages and the cases are dismissed with the offender getting a stern talking to. \u00A0So, the industries\u00A0have\u00A0taken other steps to protect their IP. \u00A0After losing time and again, or getting minuscule awards not worth the trial expense, RIAA and MPAA pretty much gave up suing small-one offenders and started going after P2P services. \u00A0When that didn\u2019t work, they went dirty and started seeding P2P services with viruses. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/184845-mechbfp/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022184845\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/184845-mechbfp/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@MechBFP\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0said above... ultimately it comes down the the judge and his or her interpretation of the law. \u00A0EULAs are cheap to write and cost almost nothing to attach to your IP or product, so why not do it? \u00A0If it discourages \u00A050% of potential pirates, then you\u2019ve gotten your money\u2019s worth out of it. And if you do catch someone distributing your stuff, usually a cease and decist letter will do the trick without getting the courts involved, which companies are kind of reluctant to do for PR reasons. It looks bad when you sue your clients, as the RIAA found out. People were stealing music like crazy at the end of the 90s and RIAA unleashed the lawyers. After they ended up in court against a string\u00A0of teenage girls and one elderly grandmother (who had the misfortune of owning the IP address that some nefarious P2P activity was traced to), \u00A0the RIAA ended up becoming one of the biggest villains of the decade.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, in the end, I would conclude this sermon by saying you should just do the right thing, pay for your stuff and don\u2019t sweat the legal intricacies of \u201Cif I play KSP on my back porch and my neighbor looks at my screen, did I violate the EULA?!\u201D \u00A0TT can write all they want in their EULA. \u00A0If you think they\u2019re monitoring your game use against your will, or intruding into your system because their EULA says so, then I would say learn how to work your firewall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheif Operations Director","CreatedById":183218,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-09T18:58:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe EULA and privacy policy literally say that they can take our bank information and personal information such as First and Last name and physical location on the planet. so it is to much for me.
