This behavior did occur in .90, but was less noticeable under the stock aero of the time. It is an artifact of squad\u0027s layering approach to code. Note that it doesn\u0027t happen when you lock the SAS to heading hold rather than prograde or any other locked position.\n\nI believe that dampening was applied to heading hold back when they were eliminating the shake for space stations, which was before they added the autopilot features. It looks like the dampening isn\u0027t being applied to other SAS settings, those that did not exist back when dampening was implemented.\n\nImho the continued presence of this bug is a significant development/management issue."},{"CreatedByName":"anarkhon","CreatedById":22469,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T17:09:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E is there some sort of solution for this yet? without completely disabling gimbals and severly handicapping our rockets?\n\nback in the old days before we have SaS,im using the \u0022spin\u0022 technic,equip your rocket some spin thrusters - they stabilize your craft very well"},{"CreatedByName":"Enorats","CreatedById":141841,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T17:10:27Z","Content":"Granted, I used to play with NEAR/FAR.. but I\u0027m not having any problems at all with rockets. They don\u0027t feel any different at all, even from stock. A little smaller (compared to stock) maybe, but that\u0027s it. Stock aero let us do some really silly things, like turning a rocket on its side in atmosphere. I generally leave my rockets totally alone until my Ap is 50-60km, then begin my gravity turn by slowly turning to 90 degrees. I try to reach 90 degrees around the same time I hit my target Ap, then kill the engines until I drift far enough to begin a circularization burn.
