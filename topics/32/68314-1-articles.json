Also I think my linking module could be better designed. I brought it up in two bits so it looked a bit more sensible on the launch pad, but that means it has a docking port link in the middle. I\u0027ll try it with a link that\u0027s not assembled in space. Some struts from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E mod placed in EVA between the asteroids might also help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this is a great idea. Or an asteroid chain. I tried this with a simple linking mechanism with claws at both ends, too. The thought was to link several asteroids and then mine them all at once. However, after the third asteroid linked, the \u0022wobbles\u0022 appeared, and the arrangement violently resonantes until it rips itself apart. And since we can\u0027t attach more than one claw from the same craft, there was no way to make it stable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe physics engine (Unity) and/or how KSP interacts with Unity limits some of the design possibilities. With that said, it works great for simpler designs, or forces us to develop creative solutions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-01-06T11:13:42Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2020 11:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 6, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Gargamel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixed Buried Post\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeiss Ikon","CreatedById":174016,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-01T19:39:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223721804\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002268314\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221577542019\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022200912\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ScrapIron\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 12/28/2019 at 9:06 AM, ScrapIron said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd since we can\u0027t attach more than one claw from the same craft, there was no way to make it stable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI beg to differ.\u00A0 My stock career, which ran from 1.3.1 to 1.6.1 (abandoned when I installed Realism Overhaul) had an experiment with asteroid \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E that was stabilized to the rock with three KLAW attachments on the same craft.\u00A0 Took me several attempts to get all three to catch, but once I got the third one on, everything was absolutely stable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis doesn\u0027t work very well for pushing the rock, mind you -- any engines on the three-point attached craft will have only their gimbal range to compensate for misalignment with the composite \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E -- but if you want to ensure that your drill stays in position to actually extract ore from the rock, it works quite well -- or did in, IIRC, 1.4.1, anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-02T11:21:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223723486\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002268314\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221577907556\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022174016\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zeiss Ikon\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, Zeiss Ikon said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis doesn\u0027t work very well for pushing the rock, mind you\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have the Breaking Ground DLC, then you can use robotics parts to adjust the alignment of your craft to the asteroid.
