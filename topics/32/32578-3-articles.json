What part of \u0022little green men\u0022 makes you think this is a realistic game? Using WASDQE to control your craft is incredibly clunky and imprecise. I have landed on kerbin\u0027s moons countless times without mechjeb autopilot, but I\u0027ve also done it about the same amount with mechjeb. No one is dimminishing your achievements by doing the same thing with mechjeb as you did without it. I personally have never used hyperedit and don\u0027t plan on it, and I have used the debug menu to test craft and new engines. I don\u0027t build without clipping on because the parts don\u0027t fit together as they are supposed too and trying to put a ship together when parts don\u0027t behave properly is frustrating. But, I\u0027ve never cheated once in this game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have cheated on this game before(I thought the other game was sexy) I feel horrible about it now, and I don\u0027t know how I\u0027m gonna tell KSP about it. Maybe one of you awesome KSP puritsts can help me with my little problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-12T22:16:24Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2013 10:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Djhcc26\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Jedi Master","CreatedById":57348,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T22:18:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot on m main save.
