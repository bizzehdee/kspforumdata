Also, when you go into time-warp mode, the game doesn\u0027t *really* use Newtonian gravity from a celestial body to pull on the ship anymore, it instead just uses Kepler\u0027s ellipse formulas to decide where along the orbit path the vessel would be at time=t.\u00A0 To do that in the stock game model requires that the body you are orbiting be your sphere of influence center point.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo that answers the first kind of \u0022why\u0022.\u00A0 As to the second kind of \u0022why\u0022, now I have to speculate about what was in the dev\u0027s heads.\u00A0 But I\u0027ll do that.\u00A0 I just want to throw the caveat that at this point I\u0027m trying to read their minds and this is not definitive:\u00A0 \u00A0 So here goes: To do gravity with asteroids using the stock system, those asteroids would all have to be modeled as tiny planets with their own little spheres of influence.\u00A0 The sphere of influence model really breaks down at that point, as you have to be SUPER close to the asteroid before it\u0027s gravity is strong enough to treat it like its own little pocket reference frame that ignores perturbations from the sun.\u00A0 I suspect they didn\u0027t bother because it\u0027s an organizational mess to have that many asteroids being modeled as planetary bodies instead of as vessels, especially when for the smaller ones their spheres of influence wouldn\u0027t even be above their ground altitude.\u00A0 Imagine if it treated them as planets what the map view would look like with all those little orbit lines.\u00A0 I think before it becomes even possible to do it well, the game would first have to leave behind the sphere of influence model and use an N-body model like Principia mod does.\u00A0 And a change like that is *massive* and breaks some other parts of how the game is meant to be simple for players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-04-15T17:17:15Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2021 05:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Dunbaratu\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeadJohn","CreatedById":201293,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-15T17:17:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing weird about it.
