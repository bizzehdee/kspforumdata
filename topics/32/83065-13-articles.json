What\u0027s the difference between using KIDS and not using KIDS? Because even without it your TWR does increase as you burn fuel and get lighter. When using KIDS the TWR raises much faster. And that\u0027s the only difference I can see between using KIDS and not... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason why I ask is because how such a feature ( isp governing thrust ) changes the gameplay by adding in more variables. With KIDS you cannot rely on a static TWR on the launch pad to get all your rockets to orbit. With KIDS your starting TWR needs to be much lower and if your using SRBs you gotta limit their throttle by over 75% and they STILL over accelerate my crafts not long after launch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027m not looking for a \u0022how to play with KIDS\u0022 explaination.
