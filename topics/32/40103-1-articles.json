I figured that since they have 6 axes of control, it would be perfect for controlling rotation and translation with one device. I was looking at the SpaceNavigator, as it seems like its compact and affordable (though I\u0027d like one with a few buttons, those are rather pricey) and just wanted to see if anyone here had recommendations on which product to get or tips on setting it up. My biggest concern is making sure that it will be compatible and that I will have variable sensitivity of control (not just mapping WASD and IJKL to each axis, but actually having more analogue control).

It has 3 axes on the stick including twist, a throttle, slider, and two rotary dials on the throttle for a total of 7 axes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
