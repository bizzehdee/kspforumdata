And I have to say, that I am really impressed by the improved stability. I literally have not had a single crash - memory related or otherwise - in that entire time, even after playing for several hours (touch wood!). And my PC is 7 years old! Admittedly, I probably have fewer mods installed than before, but not by many (still all the visual enhancements etc). I\u0027ve also noticed a huge improvement in FPS: in 1.2.2 I\u0027d often see the FPS drop to maybe 10FPS or lower when doing EVAs on the surface. But in 1.6.0 I\u0027m amazed to see it holds up at around 30FPS, even with similar ship builds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo whatever you did, it worked, and I\u0027m darn grateful.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:lol:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_laugh.png\u0022 title=\u0022:lol:\u0022\u003E\u00A0 It really was worth it, and I think I speak on behalf of my fellow Kerbonauts when I say we appreciate it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: my only caveat here is that I have noticed considerable lag, frame rate drop, when placing or using manoevre nodes. I don\u0027t know if this is the game itself, or one of the mods causing it, however. I just don\u0027t recall ManNodes being this laggy in 1.2.2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-03-28T20:56:26Z\u0022 title=\u002203/28/2019 08:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 28, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by TimKerbin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eclarification\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
