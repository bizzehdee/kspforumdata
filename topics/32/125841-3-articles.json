That\u0026#39;s a bit cheaper than going by Eve, which will cost you about 5500-6100 or so depending on how elegant you are. Both methods result in capture burns of less than 2000, however, which is the important thing, so you can actually stop there before you leave Moho\u0026#39;s tiny SOI :). Also, having both methods gives you more flexibility in when you can leave Kerbin, either when you have a transfer window to Eve or once a year when Kerbin\u0026#39;s lined up with Moho\u0026#39;s nodes on the Ap side. Either way, however, it\u0026#39;s going to be a long trip, like about a year or more, due to having to make several orbits of the sun before you can meet Moho in a convenient place.

I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not done yet, but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll post an album here when I am. So far, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s looking like I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll manage capture at Moho about 3.2 km/s all told from LKO. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not sure how much more getting to LMO will cost from there, but I imagine only a few hundred m/s. I give a more detailed explanation, with instructions that less experienced Kerbal wranglers can hopefully follow, below:[/COLOR][/FONT]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=3][COLOR=#000000] [/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT][FONT=\u0022Arial\u0022][COLOR=#000000]STOP READING NOW IF YOU DON\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2T WANT SPOILERS. Even if you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t end up doing the long, later, part, I think the initial approach will still save you several hundred m/s vs. ejecting straight to Moho from Kerbin, even if you do it at the nodal point as suggested upthread. [/COLOR][/FONT]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=3][COLOR=#000000] [/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT][FONT=\u0022Arial\u0022][COLOR=#000000]What I found was that if you eject for Eve from near its descending node with Kerbin, with Eve at a tighter phase angle (like -25deg vs. the -57 for a standard Hohman transfer), for about 1150 m/s you can set up an encounter about 2/3 of the way around Eve\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s orbit from where you eject, i.e. later than for a Hohman transfer. As it turns out, that spot is almost exactly at the ascending node between Eve and Moho, which you can easily identify by looking at the orbital map. You\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll want to launch from the KSC about halfway between sunrise and noon and shoot for an orbit that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s inclined about 22.5deg southwards from there. When you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re done, the highest latitude of that orbit should be near the sunrise terminator. When you eject retrograde from that orbit at Eve\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s descending node, you end up pretty close to its orbital plane. It doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have to be perfect, so long as you can place your ascending node close to the intersect with small subsequent corrections. Anyway, from that Eve encounter I was able to eject to an orbit that goes just outside of Eve\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s and intersects Moho\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s on the opposite side, with a tilt of only about 0.5deg relative to Moho\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s. From solar Ap a few days after Eve ejection, the remaining dV to complete the plane correction for me was only around 80m/s, but maybe a better navigator could work it out to eject dead-on into Moho\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s orbital plane.[/COLOR][/FONT]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=3][COLOR=#000000] [/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT][FONT=\u0022Arial\u0022][COLOR=#000000]So with that maneuver you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve already shaved off a lot of dV from the more conventional way, getting to a significantly lower orbit than direct Kerbin-Moho transfer for 500m/s less dV, and furthermore getting 6.5deg of the 7deg plane correction for free, but then it gets even more interesting. With a series of carefully calculated burns, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s then possible to set up a succession of Moho encounters to gradually walk down a ladder of ever-lower resonant orbits. [/COLOR][/FONT]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=3] [/SIZE][/FONT][FONT=\u0022Arial\u0022]Since the encounter indicators at Moho are all squirrely, this required some calculation. To get my first Moho encounter, I advanced the clock from my plane change correction to the next time Moho was at the intersect point. From there, you know Moho will return to that spot at t\u002B102.6d, 205.2d, 307.8d, etc. You then place a node right at the intersect. If you add the time to this node to the period of your initial Moho-tangent orbit, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll generate a similar series of return times to that spot for your ship. You then just need to do a little bit of math to figure out how much you need to change (lower if at all possible) your orbital period to make one of your return times line up with one of Moho\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s. This itself will not be a resonant orbit, because your initial approach changes the calculation, but from there out you will be shooting for them. In my case, I came in on an orbit that was a little lower than 2:1 resonant with Moho\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s, and I had to lower my orbital period about 12 days to get a re-encounter 3 orbits later. I then basically tugged retrograde on that maneuver node until clicking on the orbital path behind my ship indicated the right period, resultimg in a ~200m/s burn. I then advanced my ship the first 2 orbits and did an additional ~25m/s correction to set up the actual encounter using the indicators. From there, you set up your encounter to get as close to Moho\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s surface as possible from the outside. For me this lowered my initial orbit almost exactly to a 5:3 resonant one, requiring me to boost only a small amount retrograde to get another encounter 3 orbits later. This in turn lowered me to somewhere above a 3:2 orbit, with yet another relatively small retrograde correction to set up the next slowing encounter. And so on down the energy shells: 5:3, 3:2, 3:4, 4:5, and finally 9:8. Lather, rinse repeat. I got too tired to continue when I reached the final 9:8 orbit last night, but I expect from the ~2000m/s speed I had at the Pe of my previous (5:4) encounter that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll only need to burn for maybe 600 m/s to get captured and 200-300 more to get to a low orbit. When I finally do, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll post the results in an album. Working this out has been just the most excellent tutorial in orbital mechanics for me, and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m sure I can do quite a bit better than this if I work everything out just right.
