I mentioned that I\u0027m a developer, because the specific point that I was being asked about (client communication) is something that is common to all development, but is very different from most other fields.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been on the other side of this (with individual clients and companies instead of communities), and I know that sometimes it\u0027s better for Dev to simply \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E communicate or say something until they have a good plan in place. One thing you really don\u0027t want if you\u0027re developing anything is letting the client (or in this case community) drive the dev cycle, but if you expose a void of information, the client will always fill it with something. It\u0027s often better to not mention the void of information until you have your own plan on how to fill it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this case, I think that this whole resource thing would actually be received a lot differently from the community if it wasn\u0027t paired with the announcement of multiplayer as a core mechanic. This has come off to many users as, \u0022The thing we said we wouldn\u0027t do because it was impossible is part of our scope and always has been, and the thing that we said we would do and gave detailed outlines for is no longer in scope because we didn\u0027t like how it worked\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, they are both entirely valid things to happen, but juxtaposed it sort of sets everyone off, and makes it seem like SQUAD doesn\u0027t know what they\u0027re doing (they know what they\u0027re doing). It probably should have been something like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Multiplayer is something that we\u0027ve always wanted to put into the game, but for the longest time we didn\u0027t know if it would be possible \u003Cem\u003Ewithin our development cycle\u003C/em\u003E. Now that we\u0027re further into alpha, it\u0027s clear that our scope can handle multiplayer, which is a feature we feel will strongly improve the experience of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022When it comes to the resource system that we outlined a while ago, we haven\u0027t talked about it since because we don\u0027t have anything to say. Resource mining, like other \u0027end-game\u0027 content, will be tackled once we have all of the core development to a state we\u0027re happy with. There\u0027s lots of things that we can do to make the core gameplay more enjoyable first, and that\u0027s a better use of our time for the immediate future. Resource mining was one concept of what end-game might look like, among many others, so once we feel comfortable getting into hard scoping of that content we\u0027ll revisit it and see what makes sense with what we\u0027ve already built. That might not include resource mining, we don\u0027t know. We don\u0027t want to restrict ourselves by scoping a part of the game we aren\u0027t ready to scope yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The important thing is that whatever the end-game content ends up looking like, it\u0027s fun and it fits with the rest of the game. Right now we want to finish off the career mode and polish what we have before pressing on. We\u0027ll talk more about what end-game looks like once we\u0027re closer to the end of development.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuch a statement is true (strictly speaking) even if they\u0027ve already internally ruled out resource mining, and is something people can accept a lot better. Plus it would set people up for the eventual \u0022we threw out resource mining\u0022 by setting up the expectations people have, wrapping \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E of those suggestions and features into \u0022end-game content\u0022 which will be talked about closer to the end of dev. It also avoids committing the dev team one way or the other to a scoping session that honestly might change (yet again) by the time they are actually working on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, development is all about delivering a product that your customer is happy with... but if you don\u0027t know how to manage customer expectations gracefully, it doesn\u0027t matter how awesome your product is. Look at Spore. Maxis and EA managed the expectations on that development cycle very poorly, and then rushed to try and meet some moving goalposts. And then failed at it completely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut on its own, without any context, Spore is an entertaining game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just not what people expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManaging expectations is what actually separates \u0022good\u0022 developers and companies. You under promise, you over deliver. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESQUAD isn\u0027t doing terrible at that, but their product is much better than people think it is, and that\u0027s because they\u0027re communicating too much or too little (as I said I\u0027m still not sure which). They are the ones that have taken the initiative to build an alpha community to provide feedback, and in that context I\u0027d personally like more information about the overall vision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut goodness, if we\u0027re all having these kinds of arguments, this must be a good game. There\u0027s no way that I\u0027d even contemplate these kinds of discussions over most games, and that\u0027s because the product that SQUAD has delivered so far has exceeded my expectations.
