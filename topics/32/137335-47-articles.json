Whatever I think of that \u003Cs\u003Efact, it\u0027s still a fact\u003C/s\u003E situation, it is what it is. Since Squad haven\u0027t changed it, perhaps it suits them the way it is for reasons (I\u0027m no expert, but I can imagine contractual obligations to distributors being one such reason). However bad it is, it clearly isn\u0027t bad enough to cause you (and others) to disassociate yourself from the game (if it was, you wouldn\u0027t be posting here) - that being the case it doesn\u0027t seem like there\u0027s a commercial incentive for Squad to do anything about it either.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEither way, it\u0027s really not my place or intention to defend Squad\u0027s choices up to this point, or those for the future, but the number of whiney 1.1-bug-related posts going on around this forum give a pretty sorry impression of how much the dev team\u0027s efforts are appreciated, and as I\u0027ve pointed out the state of the game at release was probably not in their own hands alone, and the \u003Cstrong\u003Enecessary fixes have already been promised\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Eare in development right now\u003C/strong\u003E.

However, I also don\u0027t think that sort of feedback properly belongs here in this thread.

For the time being, I think that allowing disappointment with the current state of the released game (which at the end of the day is the same release with mostly the same problems (Linux users excepted) for all of us) to translate into \u0027keys of fury\u0027 isn\u0027t likely to yield anything that a little patience and calm wouldn\u0027t yield anyway.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIndeed, the best and really only possible thing you can do that -might- yield better results, is to express your personal experiences directly to Squad and the devs in as calm and accurate way as you can, be that through bug reports for experiences of the game itself, or by writing a letter to the company controllers expressing your experiences as a customer. Making a lot of smoke and noise on the forums is just a way to make smoke and noise on the forums.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4v","CreatedById":67965,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-29T20:17:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222604618\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022137335\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464396367\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002297386\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Padishar\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 28/5/2016 at 9:46 PM, Padishar said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are certainly things that need to change and you would be mistaken if you think that Squad aren\u0027t well aware of it. \u00A0If you aren\u0027t going to, at least, suggest what those things might be then, again, I suggest you simply save the wear on your keyboard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChange isn\u0027t going to come if we all stay quiet and nice, Squad being aware of the issue doesn\u0027t mean that they will do something about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-29T23:08:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222607041\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022137335\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464553056\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002267965\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022m4v\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, m4v said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChange isn\u0027t going to come if we all stay quiet and nice, Squad being aware of the issue doesn\u0027t mean that they will do something about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhilst this is naturally true, sometimes the reasons for \u0027not doing anything about it\u0027 are out of squads direct control (Unity issues etc) or often just plain difficult to fix for various other reasons. \u00A0We don\u0027t work there so are, quite rightly, not aware of the details of anything unless they choose to share it with us. \u00A0Yes, in hindsight, they do appear to have made some \u0027errors of judgement\u0027, but we were not privy to the circumstances, choices, discussions and all the reasons that led to those particular decisions being made so maybe what we have is what they saw as the best compromise given the options available. \u00A0Sometimes you have to choose between several bad options because a good one just isn\u0027t available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not a case of \u0027staying quiet and Nice\u0027 and not making them aware of issues, it\u0027s a case of being sensible and as helpful as possible when we do point stuff out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003E\u00A0maybe not the best analogy, but if two children want something from you and one just whines and whinges constantly, but the other asks politely and listens to explanations why they can\u0027t have it \u0027right now\u0027 I know which one I am most likely to listen to and be prepared to help.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4v","CreatedById":67965,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-29T23:56:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222607277\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022137335\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464563284\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022130621\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pandaman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n36 minutes ago, pandaman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhilst this is naturally true, sometimes the reasons for \u0027not doing anything about it\u0027 are out of squads direct control (Unity issues etc) or often just plain difficult to fix for various other reasons.
