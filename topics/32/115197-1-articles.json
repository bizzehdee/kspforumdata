So I\u0027ll post them up and invite others to do the same, to see if we can form some sort of consensus that Squad might find useful in tweaking the system.\n\nNOTE: I won\u0027t discuss the costs MOST stuff (building upgrades, part entry costs, etc.) or the difficulty sliders for rewards/penalties. Those are things that are matters of personal taste and can be tweaked in many ways. I\u0027m more interested in the underlying mechanics of the system as a whole.\n\n**1. Kerbal Recruiting/Hiring, Classes, Skills, and Experience**\n\nI know Squad claims to be doing some work along these lines for 1.1 and that thought scares me. I really do NOT like anything at all about the current class system and what little I\u0027ve heard about what Squad\u0027s got in mind make me expect it will make what I consider an inherently flawed system and make it wose. I would prefer to see it totally scrapped and replaced with something I think would be a lot better. I wrote up my ideas in detail [in this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122533-Improving-Kerbal-Classes-Experience-and-Recruitment).\n\nBut regardless of all that, what I would really like most of all is for the game (and mods) to NOT reference class names (i.e., pilot, engineer, scientist) but instead reference the skill name (repair, science, SAS for now, whatever new skills come along later as well). It is possible at present to create your own classes of Kerbals with multiple skills, or give all skills to the existing 3 classes. But because most functions look at the class name, this does little good. Sure, you can make it so every Kerbal can fix rover wheels but a \u0022pilot\u0022 with science and repair skills can\u0027t reset Goo experiments or build stuff with KIS because he\u0027s a \u0022pilot\u0022, not a \u0022scientist\u0022 or \u0022engineer\u0022. I find this quite annoying.\n\nAlso, no matter how the rest of Kerbal systems end up, the whole way of recruiting Kerbals needs to be redone. The hiring cost is just ridiculous (soon approaching the price of a Jool mothership), for which you get a totally unskilled Kerbal. Even worse, you have no control over the class and stats of the applicants, which is bothersome if you need an engineer but none have applied, and this is exacerbated by the inability to dismiss applicants you don\u0027t want so that better ones might show up later.\n\nIf I have to pay for Kerbals, then I want control over the applicants. I should be able to dismiss unsuitable candidates without penalty, same as with contracts. I should be able to hang up a sign saying \u0022Now hiring engineers\u0022 and have only engineer candidates appear. And 0-star Kerbals should always be dirt cheap---I should only have to shell out vast sums for Kerbals that already have several stars.\n\n**2. Tech Tree**\n\nThis has gotten even sillier since 1.0, largely because all the parts you need to make a rocket of a certain size have been dispersed hither and yon. This takes away the freedom to pursue specific paths concentrating on certain things at the expense of others. Now you\u0027re forced into a \u0022broad front\u0022 strategy of having to get all (or most) nodes on the same teir before moving on, simply because 1 key part is on a node with a bunch of stuff you don\u0027t care about at the moment. The result is more grindiness because you\u0027ve increased the number of nodes needed per rocket size. So I\u0027dd rearrange some of this so that rocket stuff (like fairings and heatshields) are with other rocket stuff, airplane stuff is with airplane stuff, and rover stuff is with rover stuff (and closer to the front, too---see below).\n\nI would also change the starter set of parts and what\u0027s available on the 1st few nodes. Instead of starting with goo, I\u0027d start with thermometers and barometers (which go back to the 1700s, way before rocketry). You\u0027d also start with the ability to make simple rovers (cars also predate rockets) so you could get the KSC biomes early on when they actually mean something, without needing a silly jet-propelled wingless airplane to do them. Next few nodes would let you make very simple airplanes for the survey contracts in the vicinity of KSC (planes also predate spacecraft). Only after this wold you get the ability to build rockets and the tree would fork at this point into rocket and more advanced airplane branches.\n\n**3. Contracts**\n\nThese definitely need a pass that makes them fit in better with what the player\u0027s capabilities are at the moment, how much is a fitting reward, and not spamming low-ball contracts once the player has moved on to bigger and better things. Also, having some use for the stations and bases would be nice. There are a number of good examples of contract pack mods that address these issues so I won\u0027t go too much into details there.\n\nThe big thing to me, however, is the way 1.0 took most of the science out of contracts. OT1H, I can see this as the player needing to do business-stuff (tourism, launch services) for money to fund his own research program, but OTOH this turns doing the tech tree into a \u0022scavenger hunt\u0022 for part blueprints hidden on Mun. Seriously, what\u0027s the connection between observing Goo on Mun and learning how to build a bigger rocket? To me, it seems you learn just as much about rockets by moving tourists and launching satellites as you do carrying a Goo container to Mun, so why not get fairly significant science rewards for such chores? Or at least make that an option.\n\n**4. Mobile Processing Lab**\n\nPrior to 1.0, the MPL was a very useful thing because it alone had the ability to reset experiments like Goo. Combined with its unique ability to hold multiple copies of the same experiment from the same place, and you had a key part of a major science-pillaging expedition. You could put an MPL in orbit with a bunch of fuel and have it refuel and reset a lander that hit all the biomes. Then bring the MPL home with a clean sweep of all the science in each biome (thanks to multiple copies). This was an expensive, complicated, time-consuming mission, but the rewards were worth it.\n\nNow, however, any 0-star scientist Kerbal can reset experiments on EVA, so all you need to pillage an entire moon is 1 lander with a scientist and enough fuel to hit some number of biomes and return. You don\u0027t get quite all the science this way due to the lander pod\u0027s inability to hold multiple copies, but this is made up for in cheapness and simplicity. No docking required. No huge lifter needed for the MPL and all the fuel. Less fuel required because you can go from biome to biome without returning to the MPL in between. No need to land the MPL back on Kerbin. As a result, the MPL is largely useless.\n\nYes, the MPL now has the ability to create extra science. However, just a single Minmus surface sample is all it can handle at 1 time, and with a 1- or 2-star scientist aboard (the best you can get within Kerbin\u0027s SOI), it will take about a year of gametime to convert that into science. That\u0027s ridiculously slow compared to the speed with which you can get way more science just picking it up off the ground, so that by the time the MPL is finally done with it, you could well be done with the tech tree already. You\u0027ll at least miss many transfer windows waiting on it. Not to mention your best scientist is tied up for the duration, when he\u0027d probably give you more benefit buffing science returns on conventional missions, and buying a new scientist and training him up to the same level is quite expensive. Also, if you play with life support, you have to keep him fed all that time.\n\nSo all in all, I think the MPL is about useless in 1.x because of EVA experiment resets and also because its new feature\u0027s timescale is so far off from that of conventional science-grabbing missions to Mun and Minmus. I think either some limit needs to be imposed on EVA experiment resets or the MPL\u0027s data-to-science conversion rate needs to be dramatically increased, or both."},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T13:33:31Z","Content":"Thats exactly what I think about the contracts.

Why am I making basic rockets when my kerbals haven\u0027t even mastered craft with propellers. \n\nIf I had a perfect dream of an extended career mode it would be something like this:\n\nStarting off with basic manned ground probes for basic science exploration in and around KSC then allow you to pick a branch between advanced ground probes (still manned) that allow for further and faster travel for surveying further afield, or look towards flight. First flight aspects would be debatable of course. I wouldn\u0027t say no to hot air balloons leading into gliders \u003E prop planes \u003E jet engines and so on. \n\nThey could even make the tech tree two fold. Give you the option of buying tech that is of a similar nature for a higher price (both science and money) or for a reduced cost, give you a tech tree specific to what you are wanting to achieve. Be it low/high altitude craft or rocketry. \n\nThe Kerbal pricing is certainly a sore point. I believe they may have gone in this direction due to the lack of any real wage system, so the cost increases as it is one off. Maybe if they gave the Kerbals wages, they could do away with the otherwise silly system. Kerbals could be hired for X a week, with skill levels changing the base price. Then add risk bonuses on for first flight tests, space bonuses that increase the longer a kerbal is not within Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. This would give you more to think about with money than just hiking up the price per hire. \n\nSo far with contracts I haven\u0027t really had anything pop up yet that would be outside of my current tech abilities. So it\u0027s hard to really say what I do and don\u0027t like there. \n\nOne thing I would really like to see added though, is the ability to put something in the cargo hold and have a Kerbal EVA to strap it down so it can be returned to Kerbin without having to use the Klaw to return it home."},{"CreatedByName":"micha","CreatedById":113840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T14:49:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E **1. Kerbal Recruiting/Hiring, Classes, Skills, and Experience**\n\nPretty much fully agree with what you\u0027ve written here, and most of what\u0027s in the linked thread.\n\nThe current Kerbal management system is not that great. As well as what you\u0027ve written I just wanted to highlight the following point:\n\nApart from the early game being difficult (due to lack of multi-Kerbal capsules), the mid-game is difficult because the Engineer can\u0027t level up enough to perform basic repairs, which your early Mun/Minmus missions are likely to require without going to Duna.\n\nIf not a complete overhaul as you suggest, at the very least the experience system needs to be changed so that people can grind away in the Kerbin SOI to get enough XP for Level 3. Just like you can either grind low-value Science in Kerbin to unlock nodes, or go on a far more lucrative mission further away. However, I would argue that repeating an activity yields progressively less XP each time until eventually the payoffs are too low to bother with. Classic RPG mechanism.\n\nXP gain should also be somewhat linked to the skills. So every Kerbal gains XP for being on a mission, but Pilots get bonus XP for piloting, Scientists for performing science, and engineers for repairing things or transferring resources when docked etc. This might be a bit difficult to implement though.\n\nAlso, I would restrict the multi-classing (skilling) of Kerbals somewhat. I think Kerbals should still be primarily Pilot/Engineer/Scientiest/\u003Cwhatever\u003E, in which (set of skills) they can progress all the way to the top, but would still be able to progress somewhat in the other disciplines. Otherwise you just end up with people having Kerbals maxxed out in all skills and being able to do everything. IMHO there should still be a benefit to bringing multiple Kerbals on a mission.\u003C/whatever\u003E\n\n\u003E \n\u003E **2. Tech Tree**\n\nLargely agree with what you wrote here, except that rockets actually predate planes. Ok, not manned rockets, but the Chinese already used rockets in warfare over a thousand years ago. Also, I don\u0027t like planes that much. It\u0027s K**S**P - Spaaaaaaace!!! - after all. \n\nI do agree that the tech-tree needs a major revamp to more logically isolate the technologies into functions so that you can build rockets (or planes, or rovers) based on tech primarily in their part of the tech tree. So instead of a \u0022historically accurate\u0022 or \u0022tech accurate\u0022 version of the tech-tree, I\u0027d prefer to see one in which the various streams are more separated, perhaps with players being able to choose very early on whether to initially go for planes or rockets. The game could easily do it by giving you an initial node and 1 Science Point which you can use to unlock either the rover, plane, or rocket starting node.\n\nThe current tech-tree also rather weirdly gives you a lot of tech before you get the tech needed to actually use that - such as the Rockomax adapter before you get Rockomax parts. If nothing else, at least that needs fixing!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E **3. Contracts**\n\nNot entirely sure what you\u0027re proposing here.\n\nThe current contracts DOES need an overhaul. The descriptions still read like placeholders, and the timing of various contracts are very weird. Tourist-contracts after you launch your first rocket?\n\nDuna contracts before you\u0027ve reached the Mun?\n\netc.\n\nApart from that I do like the nerfing of science from contracts - it\u0027s easy enough to get science as it is.\n\nPerhaps a better question in reply to your point is: \u0022Should Science be the currency to unlock the Tech Tree?\u0022 But if not for the Tech Tree, what other uses are there for it? In the Real World, it\u0027s mostly the actual end result of why we go to space. Sure, there are HEAPS of real-world spin-offs in terms of technical progress, and some of the science we gather is useful to drive progress en masse, but on the whole, what is the point of knowing the Lunar regolith\u0027s composition? It\u0027s knowledge for knowledge\u0027s sake, which isn\u0027t a bad thing.\n\nSo in-game, perhaps it could be turned into the high-score?\n\nSo if not Science for the Tech Tree, what else? Funds is the obvious one, but it\u0027s already used pretty much everywhere in the game. So add another currency, Tech Points, which you get for technical-related stuff (launching and recovering vehicles, parts-testing, etc). Might add unnecessary complexity though.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E **4. Mobile Processing Lab**\n\nNot entirely sure how to fix the MPL, but I largely agree. It made some sense that you need a Lab to reset certain experiments. OTOH there is a need to have long-running uses for orbital stations which the new MPL kinda fulfills. Although I prefer the mod approaches of having long-running experiments.\n\nEven if Scientists should continue to be able to reset instruments - they only be able to do so on Lv1 or 2. Engineers can\u0027t do anything interesting until Lv2 - but this really goes back to Point 1 above."},{"CreatedByName":"Dilli","CreatedById":142986,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T15:03:06Z","Content":"**Kerbal Recruiting/Hiring, Classes, Skills, and Experience**\n\n1.

I can\u0027t agree more. Personally I think they need to get rid of the \u0022nodes\u0022 and[unlock each part in a related tree](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99521-Tech-tree-and-parts-final-polish) individually but at the very least they need to group like-sized parts in one or two \u0022columns\u0022 of the tree. The plane parts are all over the place. It\u0027s really easy, Mk1 in the first two columns, Mk2 in the second two columns, Mk3 in the last column. The same for rocket sizes, but the only 1.25 probe core is locked way at the end of the tree for some reason.\n\n3. I\u0027ve said it before, I\u0027ll say it again.

I like the idea of more RPG elements added to Kerbal skills... but some of that can conflict with the game balance of wishing you had X, that drives you to need every one you can get.

After that, rescues are the only way to fly ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) I think it would be cool if the MPL could level up Kerbals out in the field. I wouldn\u0027t mind a class retraining option, if it was very expensive to keep it from being an easy way out. If career got to the point where you could have everything you want with little effort, I think it would be too much like sandbox-with-contracts. (That can be achieved with new game setup options: increase rewards for funds/science/rep, decrease penalties.)\n\n2. I agree that tech tree plays out in a \u0022broad front,\u0022 with few exceptions. I ignored air parts for a while, skipped ahead one level to get a \u0022cool part\u0022 when I could, but it\u0027s all needed eventually. Many forum threads have rewritten the tech tree, and there\u0027s a few overhaul mods out there. I don\u0027t know if I want rover wheels earlier; the game encourages silly contraptions, I think that\u0027s part of the charm. I found things to do with the 2.5m decoupler, before I had tanks and engines to go with it.\n\n3. tater has written extensively about contracts along these lines. I think removing science from contracts was a necessary balance change, even though it creates the scenario of looking for blueprints on the Mun. I think it\u0027s good that the game now pushes us farther out for science... and I \u0022made that worse\u0022 for my own career game, by nerfing science rewards. Which leads neatly into:\n\n4.

This certainly runs into your expense concerns, but I\u0027m doing fine with Funds due to getting paid to rescue most of my staff instead of hiring, and running tourists around Kerbin\u0027s moons. (And no life support.) \n\nEach MPL can be loaded with the same experiments. Even after you\u0027ve recovered experiments on Kerbin, (one reason to delay this) you could obtain those same reports and experiments all over again, just to load those into a new MPL. Every occasion I timewarp nearly two weeks for Mimimus round trips, I can download bonus Science from the MPL\u0027s."},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T16:07:02Z","Content":"Some of my thoughts:\n\n1) I like the idea of science as a high score.\n\n2) If I were doing the tech tree from the start, I would have two tech trees. One would be \u0022science\u0022, where early experiments on Kerbin unlock new experiments for other surfaces, and experiments done in space unlock new experiments for space. The other tree would be for tech. It should be more focused, like all the 1.25 fuel tanks being unlocked together, etc.\n\nThe tech tree now is not really a tech tree, it\u0027s really just a way to drive mission grinding. It\u0027s more oriented toward restricting you to find crazy Rube Goldberg designs than providing any roleplay kind of effect. For instance, early on all you get is the really stubby 1.25m tank, so you have to stack a whole bunch of them -- right when you also have a 30-part limit on your rockets. By the time you have likely paid for an upgraded VAB and now have a 255-part limit, you get the bigger tanks anyway.\n\n3) You can tell skills and experience are an afterthought. I like the Elder Scrolls approach of leveling up by repeatedly doing. Kerbals should gain science experience by doing science. They should get pilot experience by piloting. They should get repair experience by going on EVA and repairing. It\u0027s silly that they get experience just by flying past the Mun, for instance, but they only get it once. A pilot gets the same experience for being in the pilot seat for 10 Mun landings versus sitting back in a Hitchhiker for one Mun landing.\n\nI like the idea of cross-trained Kerbals, but there should be something that differentiates them. Maybe they can all learn everything (slowly!) but some start with a base of science, others with a base of piloting, etc. And maybe for each mission you designate the role of each Kerbal -- for this mission Jeb will be the pilot and Bob will be the science specialist, so Jeb gets experience points from this mission in piloting and Bob in science. Next mission it could be the other way around. Let the player decide on his own to create specialists because it\u0027s more efficient to train up specific Kerbals for specific jobs, or decide that the flexibility of cross-training is more important.\n\nA Mk1 capsule has one slot, which must be tagged as a pilot for that mission. A Mk1-2 must have one Kerbal tagged as a pilot for the mission, but the other two could be tagged as either pilot or engineer or tourist. The MPL has slots only for science specialists. Etc. You could do a lot with something like this.\n\n4) Speaking of the MPL, there maybe should be a 1/2-size MPL. It would seat 1. It would be idea for being on a lander, and you would do time-based science but you would have to do it on location. It would have it\u0027s own dedicated experiments that would require it to be in place. Something like that. the current 2-person lab could be specialized for orbital use, and could further refine the science brought to it by a lander science module. It could also do specialized orbital science experiments. Goo and thermometers and such could still be added to ships that don\u0027t have a science lab, but you should get a lot less science from them.\n\nIf science ends up being the high score, then the end game might be to have permanent science bases running all over the system."},{"CreatedByName":"Yemo","CreatedById":114412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T16:26:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve been playing with career mode a lot recently, trying to come to grips with the various changes since 1.0, and have formed some opinions.
