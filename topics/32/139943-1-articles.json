I do play career a lot, and the reason I haven\u0027t visited Dres, Jool, or Eeloo/the outer planets (OPM mod)... is time and the transfer windows. I don\u0027t like timewarping doing nothing in career when there\u0027s other stuff I could be doing... so... my eve mission is just arriving now, my moho mission just got back, my dres mission is nearly there, my jool missions are still on the way (the probes are nearly there, the kerbals just left kerbin and will take a while), my Duna mission is awaiting the return window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only planet I\u0027ve been to and back from\u003Cstrong\u003E(Edit: in this career save)\u003C/strong\u003E is moho.. because its the shortest, and the transfer window happens the most often.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo me, the main thing that puts me off from launching or completing interplanetary missions (outside of sandbox), is the transfer window.
