So... I put 4 kerbals on board and headed to the launchpad. To my surprise, every time the rovers land the 3 I\u0027m not controlling take off at full speed when the chutes cut upon impact with the ground. It\u0027s pretty hilarious as I can follow them around for a while. The kerbals inside seem to have no regard for their safety and one by one they all drive to their deaths. Even more amusing they all take off in reverse. I can put the brakes on before separation to avoid this calamity, but I\u0027m curious if anyone else has experienced similar behavior?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-09T06:13:18Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2013 06:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ultra86\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr. Scruffy","CreatedById":38540,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T08:34:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei demand a video! ;D\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RawChicken","CreatedById":57199,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T09:01:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had something similar happening in a Duna drop off i did.
