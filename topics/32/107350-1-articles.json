Part of the issue seems to be Squad has taken a lot of players spoiled to a certain method of play outside of their comfort zone. Something I actually don\u0027t see as an issue, except for the plethora of complaints that have spawned because of it. Every time Squad has changed the rules to a significant bit, the game always feels fresh to me, with new challenges. By your thinking you would prefer it go back to the old way, just with more new parts to play with. That isn\u0027t going to happen, at least the former bit. It\u0027s a brave new world in KSP, and you can either make the effort to discard everything you have learned so as to take on the new, or you can try something else. Sitting their complaining about you not liking your new version that got served to you is doing nothing but annoying everyone else at the table.\n\nI read through a lot of forum posts after 1.0.2 came out, claiming there were a lot of problems with it. Then I booted up KSP and gave it a whirl with a few rockets, and found none of those issues present. I didn\u0027t even have to retry a launch to do something different. Heck, I even took the Kerbal X up, and I found myself actually pulling off a more efficient launch to the point I think a Munar landing and return is now possible with that crazy craft (where before you had to try real hard to manage only a Munar landing)\n\nYes, there are some glitches and bugs that could be addressed.

No. At least, not as far as your limited detailed post actually presents."},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T10:59:48Z","Content":"Most complaints are from those trying to play the sim using .090 skills using .090 designs.

I don\u0027t desing my SSTOs to go to any place except LKO, or laythe.\n\nThats why I have that unconventional design: I want to carry large payloads to LKO, at which point I can continue to the destination without the wings and rapiers, and dead weight from empty fuel tanks used to get to LKO.\n\nIf the payload is larger than a MK 3 pay, what do you do? stick it in a fairing.\n\nOk, so you have a fairing, with a front and/or rear attachment point... how does one get that on a spaceplane? just sticking a SSTO in front of it or behind it would be horribly imbalanced... so the SSTO has to be built around it.\n\nIts a general layout I\u0027ve been using for a long time (back since .23 at least)\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117535-No-more-SSTO-s?p=1881501\u0026viewfull=1#post1881501](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117535-No-more-SSTO-s?p=1881501\u0026viewfull=1#post1881501)\n\nThis one worked in 1.0:\n\n![11032221_10103550674651363_2148940416804389397_o.jpg](https://scontent-fra.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/t31.0-8/s720x720/11032221_10103550674651363_2148940416804389397_o.jpg)\n\n- but if you follow this thread;\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116729-Stock-Payload-Fraction-Challenge-1-0-2-Edition?p=1881728\u0026viewfull=1#post1881728](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116729-Stock-Payload-Fraction-Challenge-1-0-2-Edition?p=1881728\u0026viewfull=1#post1881728)\n\nthere were some serious heating issues that depended on the payload\u0027s heat sink capacity.\n\nMy new SSTO - why wouldn\u0027t it work? It is a bit flimsy, and without the payload to strut to, its really flimsy... but luckily when the payload is gone... so should its fuel, and its very light with lots of wing area, so it can come in slowly, and if you put it down gently, everything is fine.\n\nI\u0027d like something longer made of one piece instead of multiple FL-T800s... but the mk3 parts as on my 1.0 cargo SSTO are awefully heavy and wide.\n\nrkman - yea, reentry heating does seem a bit irrelevant now... I assume that\u0027s what you are talking about.\n\nIn 1.0 my designs seemed to be limited by being able to get up to speed while climbing fast enough to avoid burning up\n\nIn 1.02, it seems to be limited by simply drag - just slapping a few more rapiers on a plane makes it work with no issues\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T18:08:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 06:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm**"}]}
