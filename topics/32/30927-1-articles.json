Scott Manley doesn\u0027t help you? In which way do his videos not help? Anyways, to take off, you simply launch vertically until you reach around 10 km, then pitch over to about 45 degrees, keeping an eye on your time to apoapsis: if it decreases, pitch back up to closer to 90 degrees. The most efficient launches have you follow the prograde vector the whole time. Landing is essentially the opposite: follow the retrograde vector, and attempt to kill both your vertical and lateral velocities before you touch down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T17:52:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are tons of tutorials in the Drawing Board (link in my sig) that might help you out quite a bit.
