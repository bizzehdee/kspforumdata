A few months ago HarvesteR announced that any KSP expansions will be free for anyone that bought the game before April 1st (or something along these lines). I bought the game from the KSP store last year (in 2012). Since the game is available on Steam I thought seriously to transfer it to my Steam account, but if I do transfer it now will this change my purchase date to the Steam transfer date? If this happens I\u0027m worried that I won\u0027t be getting the free KSP expansions. Is this a legit worry or should I go ahead and transfer the game to Steam?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso mods, I love playing KSP with mods but if I transfer am I going to be able to install mods and if its possible, how?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would appreciate your response, it will be extremely helpful \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robbii6","CreatedById":69855,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-13T11:04:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhen you say expansions do you mean updates?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheRabbit","CreatedById":58249,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-13T11:04:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo install mods you right click and click on properties then go to your local files, and then install them like you used to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pursuedtank","CreatedById":50078,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-13T11:04:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know about the first part of your question, but I would imagine that if you did transfer then you would still be entitled to a free expansion that might be released.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding your second question, you would still be able to use mods just as you can now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-13T12:00:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESteam doesn\u0027t record a purchase date, that\u0027s the problem.
