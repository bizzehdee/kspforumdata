In all honesty, I doubt that the existence of a Kerbal space program with lots of willing volunteers and (seemingly) unlimited funds says anything about their government at all. What it does say is that, at this point in time, space exploration is a Priority for the Kerbals. We can safely rule out nationalistic competition or conflict, since there are no weapons in the official game (and no plans to introduce any). This leaves us to consider non-nationalistic reasons why the Kerbals would seek to conquer space. To quote Carl Sagan:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESince, in the long run, every planetary civilization will be endangered by impacts from space, every surviving civilization is obliged to become spacefaring--not because of exploratory or romantic zeal, but for the most practical reason imaginable: staying alive.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESooner or later, even with no Space Race, no international conflict, no nationalistic posturing, the Kerbals will come to this realization.

Any government and economy can do this, so long as they recognize the need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd even if they don\u0027t, I expect even the most utopian Kerbal society will engage in space exploration to keep parts of its society busy. Scientists and engineers will have ideas they want to see developed, and every society will have its misfits, its people who just don\u0027t conform to the social standard. Space exploration is one way to keep such people busy, because the alternative is to let them become so disaffected with society as a whole that they would start plotting its downfall. Give the misfit and malcontents a constructive outlet for their energies, and the Kerbals gain new knowledge of the universe, an insurance policy against cosmic disasters and increased peace and stability at home.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
