KerbalStuff was great, but I guess SQUAD was lobbying for it to be shut down, because it affected the profitability of mods. People use it because it was free, simple to use, and if wasn\u0027t terribly insistent on profits. Now that the descendant of KerbalStuff, SpaceDock, is up and running, SQUAD now insists that all mods be posted to the Cursforge repository. Join the rebellion and like this if you prefer space dock.
