Also, if the orbit is elliptical, there will still be tidal flexing of the moon even if it\u0027s tidally locked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you have a situation like Jupiter, the tidally-locked moons receive quite a lot of tidal heating because the other moons mess with each others\u0027 orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is important in the case of Ike is that Duna is ALSO tidally locked to Ike, so the only tidal heating effect that you\u0027ll get in this case is because of the tiny eccentricity of Ike\u0027s orbit (discounting the effects other planets have on the Duna/Ike system). So I would expect very little tidal heating of Ike.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lincourtl","CreatedById":72218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T01:48:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIke\u0027s core is made of pure evil.
