I\u0027ve been working on some really good designs and i finally created the perfect all planet 3 man pod craft to do the job. This craft is able to land on Eve. Parachute landing will set us down nice and easy also good when Eve\u0027s thick atmosphere is helping too \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna- Mars planet. It is also capable of doing to same thing on Duna and would also be much easier and using of less fuel. Since Duna has less gravity. IM not sure how it will work on the new lava planet Moho? but we will see when 0.17 comes out. This craft has 6 tanks and 6 airospike engines to do the trick every time! I have tested this spacecraft over and over again and it does it perfect every single time! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I believe this craft is capable of Returning The 3 Brave Kerbals back to Kerbin.

Most of your fuel will be going to fighting gravity for a good part of the ascent. If you feed the six ascent tanks into the center tank and add that engine, you get an initial TWR of 1.2, which stands a better chance of to getting orbit, but I still doubt you\u0027ll have enough delta-V to get back to Kerbin, especially considering there should be more drag due to the thicker atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-01T17:28:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll add that just putting yourself on an escape trajectory won\u0027t be enough to get you back to Kerbin.
