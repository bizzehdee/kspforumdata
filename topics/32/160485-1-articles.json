It\u0027s based on\u00A0\u0022The Origins of Us\u0022, and I\u0027m focusing on the formation of the solar system, Earth, and how asteroids and other astronomical phenomena enabled life on Earth.. However, I don\u0027t have many ideas, and I don\u0027t really know how I\u0027m going to inform my audience (class) about the information and facts through such a method. I\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0filmed my first scene, where the Kerbals fly to the Mun and find that the samples are incredibly similar to those found on Kerbin. However, U don\u0027t know about what should happen after that. I\u0027m thinking of a mission to Laythe. But, again, I don\u0027t know how to make it informative without it being too vague. So, I need help on ideas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I need Kerbal voices: anyone know how to make those?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-11T07:17:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis might not be the correct forum for this topic...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...but Kerbal voices are simple to make: they speak Spanish, with the recording reversed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-11T22:19:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIMHO that question would be better placed at Science \u0026amp; Spaceflight sub-forum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure what is the information you want to pass (TBH that life subject is not really in my Nerdar, I prefer things like big gas explosions and rocks floating around).

Nothing against KSP, but Space Engine is designed to allow you to set up planetary and solar system scenarios and watch them play out. Instead of using KSP\u0027s fictional solar system, you can use more realistic models from our solar system.

Scenes can be Kerbals\u00A0visiting various planets/asteroids\u00A0and talking about the formation of these objects and their influence in our existence. You can show how Earth is in the \u0022Goldilocks\u0022 just right orbit around the Sun, and show off Mars and Venus to point out what happens if a planet is just a little too close or a little too far in relation to the Sun.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you think that mods would make it too complicated, you can do the same kind of thing as if the Kerbals are exploring their fictional system and wondering where they came from.
