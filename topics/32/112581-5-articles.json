I\u0027ve read the Argentine law regarding digital contracts a while ago and it states both parties must use a digital signature - the law then defines it, and it\u0027s basically a cryptographic digital id for the specific physical person - which means, in my layman understanding of the law, that no EULA can be considered valid under Argentine law because clicking a digital button doesn\u0027t equal to signing a contract.\n\nAnd even more, I don\u0027t think there is any country in the world where every single person is allowed to sign contracts. If a minor purchases a game, clicks to agree with the EULA and then breaks it, how many countries would allow the software company to sue a minor for breaking a contract he isn\u0027t legally allowed to agree to in the first place?"},{"CreatedByName":"Rosco P.
