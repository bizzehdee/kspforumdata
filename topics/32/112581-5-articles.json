Cases are decided solely by a panel of judges. Also greatly limits liability (no filing suit for a billion dollars in damages if your CPU melts playing KSP for example, the law would have listed the maximum amount which would likely be the cost of replacement of the computer plus court fees). Also, no (at least in the Netherlands) lawyers working on commission, taking a percentage of your settlement. Lawyers are by law required to work on an hourly fee and nothing else (so if the court decides you get 5000 Euro in compensation, YOU get 5000 Euro, not your lawyer 4800 and you 200 like is the norm in the US).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course no silly cases where companies are found liable for massive damages on very shaky grounds just because the jury members didn\u0027t want to reduce their own chances of getting similar payouts when it\u0027s their term to sue someone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Caelib","CreatedById":59329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T11:56:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETo be fair, it could just be standard boilerplate EULA print, but it does kind of run against the grain of current KSP SOP.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
