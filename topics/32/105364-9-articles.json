Usually wiggling your mouse some to get the code to place it again will sort it out (sometimes it takes a few tries), but man...what a pain in the neck, especially if you don\u0027t notice it happened until after you\u0027ve made additional changes to your design.\n\nYeah - I\u0027ve been bitten by that one many times. I\u0027m surprised it made it into 0.26 even; Harv SAID he redid symmetry (and we have a whole bunch of new modes to show for it), but yet this durned bug persists :/\n\nIt\u0027s especially nasty when an SRB ends up attaching itself to both sides of a radial decoupler, meaning the other one is inside the core booster\u0027s tank....\n\n\u003E \n\u003E And yes, agreed, not being able to place maneuver nodes for unknown reasons in a released game really isn\u0027t reasonable. We\u0027re all used to interface bugs like this and the one above, and know how to work around them, but for a new player, that is likely struggling to understand concepts like maneuver nodes and part symmetry to begin with, that stuff is just plain broken.\n\nAgreed 100%.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E When in the VAB, the floor paint vanishes when viewed from above.\n\nIt sounds like it\u0027s a transparently textured polygon floating above the actual floor rather than part of it (z-fighting issue?). Easy fix is to simply apply it to the floor..although the floor might be using some sort of repeating texture or such.\n\n(some have noted in the past that it does visibly float above the floor at certain angles...)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not planning on reading all 20\u002B pages if this has already been mentioned but this is one that has been bugging me (pun intended) ever since stock cargo bays were introduced.\n\u003E OX-STAT Photovoltaic Panels inside a fairing or closed cargo bay should not generate power.\n\nSolar panels work by taking in bay particles, which are generated through either explosions (like in the sun) or cargo bays. Of course, Michael Bay movies produce enormous levels of said particles, thus solar powered devices are especially useful in a theater during their showing... but that\u0027s kinda beside the point. Anyhow, panels in bays, due to the bay particles, should ALWAYS produce power, even when in a planet\u0027s shadow.\n\n(just kiddin\u0027. I think it\u0027s nuts too...although I\u0027ve been abusing the heck out of it for S\u0026G. I also thought that the game was supposed to account for that already?)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 100% chance.\n\nExcellent news! As much as I love Pol, I ain\u0027t goin\u0027 there until someone ELSE confirms that the invisible walls are gone.

I have applied the fix for that. One thing I have noticed is the Ablator value never seems to change. So far I only have the 1.25m one, and the number stays locked on 200, even after a nice hot re-entry from 135km up, falling straight down.\n\nAnother thing that\u0027s really annoying me at the moment is there are some parts listed in multiple branches of the Tech Tree (and also multiple times in the same branch). This means that you can use them when building a ship. But when you go to launch said ship, you get a message saying you are trying to use parts that are not available yet. The Structural Fuselage is one for sure. It\u0027s listed in General Construction, and also in Advanced Construction. I\u0027ve unlocked General, but not Advanced, so it won\u0027t let me use it.
