They\u0027re mining equipment, they\u0027re big, unwieldy and heavy. They\u0027re not something that could fit on a tiny rover, for example. So I would understand if it\u0027s just the one size. That said, I do like choice and Kethane handled the two drill sizes well - the smaller was still fairly large. I dunno, really.. I can\u0027t say I\u0027d prefer 1 size because I want choice and I can\u0027t say I want choice because it\u0027ll seem silly if I could fit an entire ISRU facility on a Rovemate, you know?"},{"CreatedByName":"Vorg","CreatedById":74652,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T10:25:40Z","Content":"I don\u0027t really care for the scan lines.
