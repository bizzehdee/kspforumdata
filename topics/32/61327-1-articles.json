So far my theory is that the 5 pyramids represent Jool\u0027s Moons. I am not sure what the rectangular stones represent. However, focusing on the 5 pyramids, they grow increasingly smaller, largest in the center to the smallest; the farthest. During high noon, the shadow of the innermost (largest) casts its shadow upon the next one, the second largest, so on and so forth to the smallest (see picture(s) below).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022a\u0026gt;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I thought when they cast their shadows upon the others behind the preceding pyramid, I thought what if it represents the moons lining up and eclipsing each other?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn this thought of the moons lining up to eclipse each other, I also observed the orbital paths and every moon seems to relatively be on the same orbital plane, except for Bop and Pol, which have slightly more inclined orbits. HOWEVER, they both intersect as a single point which also intersects the orbital planes of all the other moons of Jool. My theory is that if an all moon eclipse were to occur, it would during a maximum of twice (or 4, depending on if the moons eclipse in front of or behind Jool) every Jovian year, as there are two points where the orbital plane intersection points could line up with the sun to do this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;a href=\u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/1VPBgjB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/1VPBgjB\u003C/a\u003E\u0022\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1VPBgjB.png\u0022 title=\u0022Hosted by imgur.com\u0022/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFocusing again on the pyramids, my possible theory is that the central one represents Laythe, and each successive pyramid represents each successively farther moon of Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;a href=\u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ULhBHND\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/ULhBHND\u003C/a\u003E\u0022\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ULhBHND.png\u0022 title=\u0022Hosted by imgur.com\u0022/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother worthy note on the stone henge is that when viewed from a certain angle, all the pyramid peaks line up and form a line, except for the second one from the center (could represent Vall, the moon where the henge lies). The second pyramid is slightly shorter (image below) than the imaginary line running through each pyramid\u0027s peaks. The second pyramid is highlighted in red:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;a href=\u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/KiBGoU9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/KiBGoU9\u003C/a\u003E\u0022\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KiBGoU9.png\u0022 title=\u0022Hosted by imgur.com\u0022/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more note: Another way of ordering the stonehedges is in order of size in relation to the sizes of Jool\u0027s moons. If they are ordered like this (closest moon to the sun to the farthest), in eclipsed form, the largest (Tylo) casts its shadow upon the second largest (Laythe) and so on. Thus, the order the moons line up goes as follows: Tylo, Laythe, Vall, Bop, Pol, as seen in this image below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022a\u0026gt;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what do you guys think, and what are some of your theories?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-28T00:36:43Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2014 12:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SpenSpaceCorp\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"User Unrelated","CreatedById":74021,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T00:23:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really have no idea, but I never knew that existed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand now I want to go there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wooks","CreatedById":101499,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T00:29:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*puts thinking tinfoil hat on* hmmm...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T00:30:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFYI Vallhenge was set up before the 5th moon of Jool (Pol) was added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I did notice was that if you stand near the little pyramid and line up your view with the largest one, you do see Tylo and the sun in a sync with each other when time warping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of my old theories was that if you put a Kerbal on each rectangle, something might happen, but it didn\u0027t:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i448.photobucket.com/albums/qq203/Richy_yvl/screenshot202.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot202.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooked kind of cool though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mobjack","CreatedById":99078,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T00:32:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe center pyramid could be Jool while the 8 pillars in a circle represent Vall\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T00:41:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a huge sundial.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpenSpaceCorp","CreatedById":98977,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T00:43:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s a huge sundial.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt tells the beings who made it when snack time is XD\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rainbow-Dashie","CreatedById":76160,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T00:59:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know, therefore Aliens (humans?).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"liweih","CreatedById":62796,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T01:17:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould you post the location on map mode with an image link?

The Joolian sidereal year is 11.37 Kerbal years, with the synodic year slightly less than that (haven\u0027t calculated it precisely). Since the orbital periods of Vall and Tylo are synchronized in a ratio of 2:1, every 11 (Kerbal) years or so there would be a Kerbol / Tylo alignment with Jool at opposition from both, and a possible eclipse, visible from the monument\u0027s location on Vall. There are 11 cuboid obelisks surrounding the pyramid sight line. My guess is that the number of cuboid obelisks represents the number of Kerbal years between Kerbol / Tylo / Jool alignments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t yet found the patience to warp ahead to witness this event firsthand.
