They could fit in the ~300MB I got left\u0022 (to 3.5GB, not to the installed RAM, I have 12GB (please give me 64Bit-KSP)). Turns out, they don\u0027t really. On the first try, KSP simply crashed when I tried to load a previously created vessel in the VAB. But on the second try it worked...kind of. After loading, 3 of four walls and the floor of the VAB were missing, like the engineers kicked them out to make room for the vessel (which actually was only like 11 parts with about 2 stock orange tanks in total size).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) has this happend to anyone else?

Well, I was being funny this morning when I wrote that. I was expecting something more along the lines of \u0022take your Linux and...\u0022. I think what you mean by \u0022inline-install\u0022 is using a virtual machine? No reason why it shouldn\u0027t work. I\u0027m not sure how steam does the install but you can navi to the folder where its installed and see if there is a file called KSP.x86_64. If so, copy the KSP folder (whole thing) to a linux box and run that file instead of KSP.exe. Should work from a VM. I don\u0027t much like steam so I can\u0027t be sure how the install process works for this game, sorry, I\u0027ve always downloaded directly from the ksp website.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a little trouble getting it to run on Debian, but I imagine that *buntu images will have everything you need from the start. If not, the ubuntu forums are probably the easiest way to start understanding linux until you can put in some hours on the command line. Ubuntu was able to finally keep me from crawling back to windows (Last time I installed linux was in 2002 until I got hooked again a year or so ago). If you have nvidia for a graphics adapter you will probably also need to install bumblebee and put a symbolic link from /usr/bin or write a command line shortcut so you don\u0027t have to type the whole thing every time you want to run a game, unless nvidia finally released their drivers for linux. (I imagine ubuntu will be the first to put them into their standard distro when they are released, the rest of us will have to use modprobe)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to your OP, you might try without EPL. I have not tried that one yet and it may be conflicting with another mod. Kethane I never had much trouble with, but I swear sometimes I think it does cause some instability with my game. I have 10x as many problems after I install RemoteTech, so you may try without that one as well as Mechjeb. Just remove them one at a time and see what happens. If you can find one that\u0027s causing conflicts with which other one you can pick between the two.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vulkan","CreatedById":83177,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T22:02:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck the versions of EPL and Kethane.

I only did it once by accident, but in my current situation, it seems to be my best option, as it doesn\u0027t need a separate partition but gets more direct hardware access then from a VM. Steam does install only the files for the current platform. The store page tells you, which platforms are available, and linux is there. What I\u0027m interested in is whether that \u0022steam-linux\u0022 version includes the 64Bit build...I guess I will install and see what I get. I\u0027m actually more or less capable of dealing with command line stuff, as I\u0027m spending most of my worktime in Bash and Emacs. But I agree about ubuntu being a more accessible distro then debian.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think my mod problems are because of conflicts. I got both Kethane and EPL from their forum threads, so the Versions should be compatible. The main problem seems to be the memory usage - without them, I\u0027m already at about 3.2GB. At least that\u0027s what I saw before installing and removing them. Now I\u0027m (again without those two) at about 3.5GB (Uh-oh). My other mods: Actions on the Fly, AIES, AviationLights, B9 (stripped down, I just like the big lights), Quantum Struts, Crew Manifest, Deadly Reentry, Docking Strut, EnhancedNavBall, FAR, Fusebox, FusTek, HOME, Proc.
