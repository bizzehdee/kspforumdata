That is 5 points per body, times the number of bodies there are (including the moons). Also if you wanted to model them even modestly correctly, some are stable and some are unstable points. I don\u0027t think you could accurately model the unstable points...well, not by \u0022cheating\u0022 them in. You could possibly model in the stable L points, by creating a gavity point with very low gravity and SOI. Downside is, I don\u0027t think you\u0027d still have even remotely close to an accurate model, as you\u0027d be influenced by the current SOI gravity well significantly more than you would...and then BAM you enter the small SOI of the L point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think they\u0027d have to go to an n-body gravity system to model any of them with even remote accuracy and I don\u0027t know that it adds all that much to the game compared to the current system. Not that it isn\u0027t possible or have some perks, but the current single body gravity system is rather straight forward and works for the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot that I haven\u0027t thought how fun it would be to park a station at the L3/4/5 points (L1 and 2 being unstable and possibly not being able to be modeled accurately within the game).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rpayne88","CreatedById":58336,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T18:08:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sojourner\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sojourner\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOK, we all know that Lagrange points in the real world are a result of N-body physics.

If they were implemented in the game, you would also have to take into account the subtle affect on your orbit due to every object in the game. Meaning your LKO station would be slightly affected by Elloo. That means several million calculations per second for your processor. In other words, it would KILL your CPU. To remedy this, Squad had made it so it is only possible to be affected by one SOI at a time. This makes L points impossible in KSP. Undoubtedly, Squad would add L points if the math involved could be easily preformed by most computers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T18:20:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA small gravity well has a completely different profile than a lagrange point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA gravity well like a planet or a moon generates (and the ones we use in KSP) have the same profile as a whirlpool. It gets progressively stronger as you get closer to the center. A Lagrange point has a shape more resembling a bowl (for L4 and L5) or a saddle (for the others). Having a tiny gravity well is more akin to a black hole. Your ship is going to do some fancy maneuvering if it gets anywhere near the center of the well. Squad would have to reprogram the entire SoI engine to get this working.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaiier","CreatedById":22833,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T18:24:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThreads like these are filled with three kinds of people:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

(its impossible to add them at some points due soi interferences. and of course to add them all at all moons), which leads to more demanding pcs for similar ingame performane, just to have an interstellar highway that pretty much will nobody use due inherent slowness and required use of ions to make any sense.
