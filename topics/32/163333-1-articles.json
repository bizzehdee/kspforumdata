Several months ago Squad began working with Blitzworks for the new version of the port, and work is ongoing. There is no release date at this time as Squad does not typically announce dates before the work is complete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo elaborate just a bit, the version that is available on the USA store is widely considered buggy/broken to the point of unusable/unenjoyable. There are multiple issues, but the largest one is nearly universal save game corruption requiring a totally new save file after only a few hours of gameplay. If I remember correctly, Flying Tiger Entertainment and Squad did attempt to patch that version, but never seemed able to fix the most major of bugs. In its current state it seems as though everyone is better off not being able to purchase it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, with Blitzworks and help from an additional QA team, Squad has been saying work is progressing well and they\u0027re very happy with how things are going so far. They\u0027re taking their time for this version, and given the mess that they\u0027re trying to move away from it seems like the right decision.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe KSP Weekly that comes out on Fridays in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/forum/66-the-daily-kerbal/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EThe Daily Kerbal\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0usually has some news regarding the current state of the console version.
