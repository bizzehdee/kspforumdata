I don\u0027t need all that storage (I\u0027ll cop to having about 150GB on the laptop drive though, but I could easily clean about 100GB of that off). I\u0027d leave the 32GB cache drive in there and set things up so it would be two partitions of 120GB and 32GB (pre-formating of course). I may even set it up so the 32GB would be solely OS. Its fairly slow writes on the cache drive from what I have seen of the specs, only about 85MB/sec, but reads are in the 500MB/sec range. Then do all apps and everything else installed on the 120GB SSD.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
