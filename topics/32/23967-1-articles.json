One is to lower the object so that it is almost touching the floor of the SPH/VAB. That gives you a good visual for the height of the wheels. The other way is to move your wheels up and down until you find a corner on the part that they are connecting to, a spot where the object switches from horiztonal to vertical suddenly, or at least where it changes angle dramatically when you move it a tiny fraction on the screen. If you keep your camera at the same position and place your other wheels in the same way (along the same corner, that is) then they should all be the same height.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
