The painting depicts the completed space station. Earth is used as the image\u0027s backdrop with the Moon and Mars off in the distance. Freedom was to be a permanently crewed orbiting base to be completed in the mid 1990s. It was to have a crew of four. Freedom was an attempt at international cooperation that attempted to incorporate the technological and economic assistance of the United States, Canada, Japan and nine European nations. The image shows four pressurized modules (three laboratories and a habitat module) and six large solar arrays which were expected to generate 56,000 watts of electricity for both scientific experiments and the daily operation of the station. Space Station Freedom never came to fruition. Instead, in 1993, the original partners, as well as Russia, pooled their resources to create the International Space Station.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-10T22:11:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMars is obviously heading towards the earth and the space shuttle is delivering the \u0022Magical Weapon\u0022 we\u0027re going to use to blow it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can see the headline now\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022NASA Rocket Accidentally knocks Mars out of orbit, WE\u0027RE ALL GOING TO DIE!!!
