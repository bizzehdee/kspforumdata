I have KSP1 on my laptop and enjoy it, but my laptop is pretty old and on its last legs. I can\u0027t afford a new one right now so I\u0027m curious about its performance on xbox. Does it run well, are the controls decent, is there keyboard/mouse support, etc. Any thoughts or opinions would be appreciated!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakete","CreatedById":208801,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-10T22:46:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have a decent pc, go for the pc version.

It\u0027s a bit sad, but not a dealbreaker for me personally as the base game is definitley good enough to stand on its own legs and still be an absolutly \u003Cem\u003Estellar\u003C/em\u003E game (pun intended).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) we are missing content from the latest update.

Most of the console community is hopeless and just think that the updates will never come out. We may be stuck on 1.10 forever, as the team wont even tell us if these updates still exist, and they\u0027re refusing to answer any questions. This means that, until the situation changes, we dont have essential features like EVA construction or ground anchors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP console is still really good, the community really deserves the updates tho.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
