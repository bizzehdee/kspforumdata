Then when you land, even if you bounce a little, the RCS/ASAS will attempt to keep you upright. I find it generally works fine on most/all landings that are less than 10m/sec vertical and less than 4-6m/sec horizontal velocity and relatively flat. Add in much of a slope and it generally doesn\u0027t matter how slow you are going. Tipsville.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing the same is also pretty good for killing horizontal velocity or manuevering over the surface. You get down near the surface, engage ASAS/RCS and then use the RCS system for horizontal thrusting to building up some sideways speed and then kill it before landing. It is how I generally get within a couple of hundred meters of my other landers. Of course you also need to be tweaking the main engine occasionally to keep at a hover (easier the lower the gravity as as your fuel will last a lot longer).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething I find that helps is adding in lights from one of the mods. Especially on the night side. In general though even daylight side you can see the lights on the ground somewhat. It helps you judge the real altitude better so you know when you are really close based on the spread of the lights.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TerranCmdr","CreatedById":23552,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-01T19:56:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have RCS you could also try thrusting into the ground when you touch down. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"draeath","CreatedById":25709,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-01T20:00:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConsider keeping your lander wide and short.
