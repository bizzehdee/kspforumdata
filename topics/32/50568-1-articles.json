Also when your orbit is really close to circular it should just say that its circular at a number rounded to the nearest meter and drop the Ap and Pe designations. The same way when you pick a target for orbit intercept using the nodes when you get really close to it there is no longer 2 points of intersection just one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phunk","CreatedById":77377,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T19:26:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is it\u0027s giving the Ap and Pe of the control part on your ship, not the CoM of the ship as a whole.
