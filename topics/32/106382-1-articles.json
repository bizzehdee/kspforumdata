It was a lot of fun and I was pretty happy with myself since it was the chance to set up another science lab chugging away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, before going to bed I decided I should transmit all my lab data from my various science labs. I switched vessels to one in orbit around kerbin, saw that it had 300 or so science built up and so I started uploading it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then while I was waiting for this to happen the camera flipped, I was suddenly no longer in orbit but headed down. After a WFT moment (this station has NO ENGINES) I started trying to figure out what was happening. My Nav ball shows no increase in velocity but in the map view I see my orbit is becoming more elliptical second by second as though I had a small engine thrusting me away from Kerbin. Now my nice circular 125km orbit is stretched out to 240km and my station and all its kerbals are on a path down to disaster. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd its getting worse, if I let the game run the AP just keeps going up by a few meters every second and I\u0027m locked to that spacecraft since I keep being told I cannot switch while under acceleration. Remember, this craft has no engines, and RCS and SAS are turned off, the only way out is to revert or quite the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a version of the Kraken?
