None of the things that have been discussed increase the level of complexity of play within KSP (save adding an Engineer-style information panel maybe, which a lot of people want). They do, however, fix behind-the-scenes inaccuracies. Even FAR can be used without the data analysis tools (I do it all the time); look at NEAR, for instance, which is basically just a rewritten, more forgiving FAR without the \u0022confusing\u0022 tools. NEAR is a good example of what a stock aero overhaul could look like. It\u0027s accessible and not intimidating in the slightest.\u003Cp\u003EE: ferram4 puts it even better than I did.

I personally don\u0027t mind having increased complexity in the game, and being a person who played old flight sims like F22 Lightning, combat sims like Operation Flashpoint and ARMA I certainly have the patience to master it. However I also have to put myself in the shoes of the new players and I can see that this only serves to make a massive learning gap for them.

Back when I played the alpha game it didn\u0027t have timewarp, and the devs wanted reasonable orbit times into LKO, which was the main reason why the planets are scaled the way they are. They all also have disproportionate densities given their size to have higher gravities. Taking 15 minutes to reach low orbit gets tedious fast. I don\u0027t know if you are implying people are too stupid to know that Kerbin is smaller and that going into orbit is different in real life. Regardless, there is a mod available for people who are curious to know what it\u0027s like to deal with Earth-like launches and even that requires custom rescaled rocket parts to play with.

As long as it\u0027s kept as a simple class of fuel like Xenon, liquid fuel/oxidizer or RCS then I\u0027m more receptive to the idea. I just had a look at Real Fuels v7.3, and I\u0027m more receptive to the thrust changing as ISP changes and the tech levels for the engines. These have more to do with the current fuels affecting the behavior of the engines rather than adding more fuel types though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m jumping into the thread relatively late so I went thinking thread has stayed on topic according to the OP\u0027s post, which is inclusive of the aerodynamics debate you are having the past few pages. But I don\u0027t have an opinion yet on the aerodynamics. I\u0027ve given FAR a try before, but found it unintuitive that my aircraft breaks up in moments upon leaving the runway by gently pitching up. Aerodynamics in KSP feels like you are flying your craft vaguely in a water-like substance, but at the same time FAR doesn\u0027t feel intuitive or realistic.

Did you take off at anything above 100 m/s? Yes? Then you were going faster than every single real life plane ever on a takeoff roll. Go and watch planes take off at an airport and the fastest you will find is ~80 m/s, with many taking off at slower speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is actually a problem of scenery; there\u0027s never any proper-sized trees or anything near the runway to provide a sense of scale. No one has any appreciation for the fact that 340 m/s is the speed of sound at sea level, and that getting up to even half of that and pulling back on an overloaded craft is enough to destroy it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople already understand that putting something on the outside of a fast-moving sportscar can lead to that something being destroyed by aerodynamic forces if it isn\u0027t designed for them.

DRE under FAR actually makes reentries easier, apparently. He even made several spaceplane reentries before scaling it back, all without the Ablative Shielding resource that DRE provides. Scott Manley is pretty much just any other video game player, albeit with a lot of knowledge that he likes to share (which is awesome, I really enjoy his channel).
