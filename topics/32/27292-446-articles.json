Earlier I was talking about the V3-SD (larger version) and how I had worked out the bugs. Well, I didn\u0027t. I crashed it after its first orbital test and two pilots lost their lives. NOW I have tweaked the balance a little and it seems to be working fine. I sent it out with a suborbital hop to refuel the smaller SSTO and then cruised back at ~25km and 1500-1700m/s before dropping back down to land at KSC. Everything went about as smoothly as I could ask for, and now I have to bring back the smaller one.

I have to run some tests with full fuel and a payload but I think if I turn off the RAPIERs and run the Turbojets a little longer on the ascent, I can gain about another 3km and a few hundred m/s before having to turn off anything that breathes air. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis should be enough to get us back home...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2014-10-1601-45-00-92.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2014-10-1601-45-00-92.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck everyone, hope this questionably balanced hunk of junk doesn\u0027t end up being the death of my most experienced pilot (Aleny).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2014-10-1920-01-28-93.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2014-10-1920-01-28-93.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you smell something burning?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2014-10-1920-18-35-02.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2014-10-1920-18-35-02.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-20T05:18:04Z\u0022 title=\u002210/20/2014 05:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Duke23\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Levelord","CreatedById":57711,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-20T06:20:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlaced a nice little science station and crew rest quarters in orbit around Laythe.

I thought it was a piloting error at that point. I did get it stable again, but wasted too much fuel, so it just barely didn\u0027t make it to orbit (periapsis at about 50 km above sea level).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird attempt: Since I thought, the second failure had just been caused by a piloting error, I simply retried, and found out, that it was indeed a design flaw (center of drag too far on the front). Didn\u0027t bother to stabilize it, and simply deployed the parachutes...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the fourth attempt using a revised design made it to orbit easily, I completely missed the height at which I should have tested an engine while in flight. So, just two out of three part tests were done during that mission. Afterwards, another part testing design, which was just going to the upper atmosphere, did succeed in the previously missed engine test and an additional part testing contract, but crashed, since it had too little drag to slow down enough for a safe deployment of the parachute...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least placing the first two communication satellites at Minmus worked well. It did take a little longer than planned, since I used OX-Stat panels (haven\u0027t unlocked the more advanced ones yet) and didn\u0027t care much about the satellites orientation while adjusting the orbit, leading to the sad situation, that I missed a maneuver node because just at that moment the satellite ran out of power (although it has more than 7000 units of charge storage - antennas eat a lot...). But, anyhow, about a week later than planned they are now well aligned, and have a proper orientation so that there will always be enough solar panels exposed to sunlight (except when the sats are behind Minmus, but that\u0027s what the 7000 charge units are for). Next, I\u0027ll send up the third and last of them, then I\u0027ll return to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, this time with the freshly unlocked seismometer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-20T12:59:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESpent the weekend farting around with planes and getting used to NavUtilities.
