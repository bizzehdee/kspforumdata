So, decide what the purpose of the base will be and then plunk the proper parts down there. Given that science is currently underrepresented in KSP, you don\u0027t need anything more than a Hitchhiker can or 2 with some antennae bolted on to call it a base. Essentially, a \u0022base\u0022 is just a place to park Kerbals until (or if) you ever feel like bringing them home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, Kethane is another story. Kethane\u0027s purpose is to make fuel so rockets can keep flying. Thus, it\u0027s pointless to mess with it within the Kerbin system (except to learn the mechanics)--only do it for real elsewhere. And remember, bases themselves don\u0027t need it, only rockets and airplanes do, so you only need Kethane if you\u0027re sending out stuff that can\u0027t get home without refueling, or need to refuel ships flying around in a distant system for extended periods of time. Or if you\u0027re building ships elsewhere (in which case you need more than just Kethane).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027ve established a need, then you need to plan your Kethane operation around supplying that need. If you\u0027re just passing through, then it\u0027s generally better to get the Kethane from the moon with the least gravity and refine it into fuel in orbit than it is to have the whole operation on the surface. OTOH, any permanent installation that you\u0027ll be visiting frequently, or which serves as a hub for exploration ships/airplanes, should have the full suite of Kethane parts. Or you could be doing both, starting colonies that themselves produce their own Kethane and fuel, planting the seeds with a mothership that\u0027s just passing through and getting its Kethane from the low-gravity moon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SaturnVee","CreatedById":78862,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T07:27:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4nqOaxl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224nqOaxl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to Mun One, here is a group picture from Expedition 1.
