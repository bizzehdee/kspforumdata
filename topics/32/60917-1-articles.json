No wobbles, no flexing, no nothing. Just straight flying all the way to the Mun and back. HOW!? lol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo bring along some backstory:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027ve been trying to do for the last couple of weeks is to try and replicate Apollo 11, from the Saturn V to the L.E.M. So far I\u0027ve seen varied success in one or two areas. One try might be the best lander I\u0027ve done, one try might be the best CSM, etc etc. Never have I managed to really combine everything into one single Apollo 11 replica. My Saturn V\u0027s in particular have been huge failures, with the most successful ones only managing to lift a very, very, VERY stripped down CSM. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, tonight, through a storm of smoothies and a fresh influx of new mods, I\u0027ve done it! I finally managed to build a fully functional Apollo 11-like rocket. (Replica doesn\u0027t apply, as I changed certain things, either for practicality or aesthetics, or both) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt hasn\u0027t lifted off yet, though through testing the various stages, I\u0027m certain that the mission will be successful when the time comes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, here it is!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/V1mWAkt.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022V1mWAkt.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, as I said, this is indeed the most structurally sound rocket I\u0027ve ever made, even despite the fact that everything else I\u0027ve ever put together that reached this scale (the escape tower reaches into the VAB cieling) usually falls apart on the Launch Pad, even with clamps in place. All in all I\u0027m fairly excited, because it has the delta v and general usability to still reach its stage goals, even if I fly it manually. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this great success, it will definitely necessitate a Mission Report.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrutsGalore","CreatedById":101453,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T07:27:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022G\u0022 data-cite=\u0022G\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eand a fresh influx of new mods\u0027 date=\u0027 I\u0027ve done it![/quote\u0027]\u003Cp\u003Ebasically answered your own question, bra\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T07:29:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, not really, because the only new mods I got today were the ALCOR module and proc fairings.
