First thing to go wrong was the SAS stay on node was left on to follow retrograde during the launch off of Eve, causing a revert since I could not recall if I had saved or not. Second try I dumped the transfer stage back into Kerbin due to a fat finger hitting the space bar. And today the Kraken ate my map mode and I could not go back to ship view, or any other vessel for the matter. I know the craft can get there, provided the pilot doesn\u0027t make a goof up, and it should in theory be able to leave as long as I do not land at sea level. In a bit of happier news I got stuff to make apple pie, not sure how that is related to KSP but I am just putting that out there LOL \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kowgan","CreatedById":116874,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T22:42:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, one of my satellites took this breathtaking (at least for me) picture of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SF9hu4B.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SF9hu4B.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDamn.
