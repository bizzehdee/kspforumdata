I didn\u0027t know I could just get out of my capsule on the launch pad, take a soil sample and EVA report, and immediately end the mission to get a few starter points. And so on.

No, I still don\u0027t feel it\u0027s possible to get completely stuck, per se, but the current system has a few awkward consequences that this discussion brought to mind. The way I see it, the current setup has three problems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1\u0026gt; With only one \u0022currency\u0022, all techs on the same tier are equally hard to acquire. That means that if one tech is just plain better than its contemporaries, it\u0027d be a bad choice to take anything else first; experienced players might have a good eye for this, but a new player might take a tech full of gear he doesn\u0027t need without realizing how much more difficult he\u0027s making things. This is most noticeable when a tech simply adds a refinement of the previous tech\u0027s items, like adding a fuel tank twice as large as the previous one; sure, it\u0027s nice to have the bigger tank, but it doesn\u0027t help you do anything the previous tech couldn\u0027t accomplish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; The multiple-biome system encourages a brute-force playstyle, where you go out of your way to land a full suite of instruments at each biome\u0027s location even if the experience is completely the same as your previous ten flights. (Most notable on the Mun, where most of the biomes correspond to nearly identical craters.) This also forces you to continually return to old locations as you unlock new science instruments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3\u0026gt; It really hurts spaceplanes. Right now there\u0027s nothing you can do with a spaceplane that a rocket can\u0027t accomplish, or at least nothing that the game awards science points for. So, spending ANY points on techs providing wings, jet engines, intakes, etc. is a waste of points since you could instead be using those points to increase the capabilities of your rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I tried to think up a possible solution. Basically, they need to add a second \u0022currency\u0022 that ties into the tech tree; it wouldn\u0027t be enough to just make us pay for the parts we use in cash (which has its own severe drawbacks), I think they need to split up the research points into multiple categories. For instance, imagine splitting everything into Science Points (from experiments, crew reports, EVAs), Engineering Points (points for mission types and for using new parts for the first time), or Achievement Points (one-time awards for doing notable things like in-space dockings or your first sample return). Then make each tech cost different numbers of SP and EP depending on its content, with techs providing refinements of previous parts requiring mostly EP while techs adding entirely new types of things mostly SP. (AP could be a \u0022wild card\u0022 currency that can be spent as either type.) With that sort of thing, you wouldn\u0027t fall into the traps we\u0027re seeing in the current system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust my opinion, of course.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drunken Hobo","CreatedById":52000,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T01:52:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve not tested it thoroughly, although I did notice that when I pressed \u0022stop transmission\u0022 on the Communotron dish, it seemed to reduce the amount of science I got from when I next ran the experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that is the case (I may have misread in-game) then it\u0027d be possible to completely bork up the science by going to every Kerbin, Mun \u0026amp; Minmus biome with every experiment available, starting a transmission then stopping it several times until the science value reaches 0.
