I\u0027m talking here about DLC=expansion, not DLC=cut content which is a bad market practice. For my the best policy is that of Paradox Development - every now and then they release some DLCc (some are minor esthethic ones, some are big and game changing) but every time they release also a free patch improving the game substantially.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022El wonso\u0022 data-cite=\u0022El wonso\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd not everyone is a huge fan of space exploration.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy play KSP than? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, it\u0027s not a thread about DLCs.

At the moment, KSP space programmes are very much about \u0027footprints and flags\u0027. Unless you really enjoy driving around on a planet for hours on end (which I have done to be fair!), there\u0027s not much to do once you land anywhere. Resources don\u0027t really add much to that. They can certainly make it easier by letting you set up fuel depots without shipping the fuel all the way from Kerbin. It would also be fun to have a few more things to drop onto a planet. However, none of this is \u003Cem\u003Enecessary\u003C/em\u003E. It\u0027s perfectly possible to get anywhere in KSP using stock parts and a vanilla game. In other words, at the moment, resources are a nice-to-have feature - not having resources isn\u0027t hindering the core \u0027footprints and flags\u0027 part of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I have resources, I want to be able to \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E stuff with them other than refuelling ships. I want to build bases (build in place rather than dropping modules in from orbit) and keep them supplied with materials harvested in-situ. I want to mine and process metals on the Mun, manufacture basic structural parts and send them back into LKO. On-orbit construction to turn those parts into an orbital habitat, shipyard or whatever. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut all of this goes way beyond the current scope of the game. It would be fantastic to see it all in the release version but I don\u0027t think its very likely given the amount of time and effort it would take. Maybe a limited resource system (maybe a slightly more involved version of Kethane) at release and then an expansion pack with a much bigger and better resource system - and all the other stuff I was talking about too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T14:56:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, i want resources very much - and for the same reasons KSK mentioned.

Then crew management system tied with budget and reputation system. And we\u0027ll get more science tweaks and biomes for planets\\moons with every update.
