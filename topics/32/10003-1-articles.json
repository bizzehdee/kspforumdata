I\\\u0027m the man behind the company (Named Extra-Terrestrial Astronautics (E-TA)) and accomplish/fail these missions all while creating a story to it on this blog\n\n[http://etamissionlog.tumblr.com/](https://etamissionlog.tumblr.com/)\n\nYou can follow it and get updates whenever the heck I manage to complete missions and such. I\\\u0027m probably going to go for a \u0027Semi\u0027-real time blog. Meaning you won\\\u0027t see \n\nKSC: We need you to retrieve a command pod from the Mun\n\n\\*30 minutes later\\*\n\nE-TA: Done!\n\nHowever I\\\u0027m clearly not going to simulate the months/years of rocket craft development/testing \u003E\\_\u003E\n\nSo perhaps expect updates betweeen twice a day at most, and maybe one every few days (assuming I can be that active) for missions.\n\n\u0027Now wait one darn-tootin second there Tex. This belongs in RolePlaying!\u0027\n\nPerhaps. I wasn\\\u0027t too sure myself. I\\\u0027m creating a fictional company, not a Nation and I don\\\u0027t have any particular interest in making it interact with other fictional companies/nations developed on these forums.\n\nReally this is just something I\\\u0027m doing for myself/fun.\n\nIf a mod thinks it should be moved, let it be done, but personally I don\\\u0027t exactly see this as RolePlaying in the sense that the designated forums for RP was made for."}]}
