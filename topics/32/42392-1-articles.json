First, I sent a satellite into orbit around Kerbin, the Mun and Minmus. That was pretty standard, so It\u0027s not worth going into detail on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut today, I wanted to land a rover on the Mun. I had tried before, but was not successful, especially since I\u0027m rubbish at building the actual rovers. So, I ended up with a plate on top of the biggest battery with wheels and solar panels. On my first attempt, I crashed, so I redesigned some things and successfully landed! But then I realized there was something on top of my rover that I couldn\u0027t get rid of. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a stack decoupler (that let my sky crane fly away using seperatrons) and an ASAS (can\u0027t remember what it\u0027s called now) making it hard to drive around. So then I drove around for a bit and got flipped. Then I realized that those parts now provide torque! So basically, unless I break something I can use the rover and flip it as much as I want! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo anyway, next I\u0027m going to try and accomplish what I tried without success last time: Building a Mun base!
