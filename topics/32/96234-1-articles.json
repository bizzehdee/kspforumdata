We\u0027ve already seen visual and aural improvements in the way of new parts, textures, pyrotechnics and space center building iterations; I think the music could be expanded in a similar fashion and involves little additional coding; only someone at Squad willing to listen to and legally acquire the additional tunes. Perhaps Squad could even hold a forum contest to which members could contribute their own appropriate music, or links to appropriate royalty free music by others. New KSP music could be introduced to the game from this pool of winners in a similar way as was done with the KSP company logo/ flag artwork.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EHow do you feel about such a thing?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Treldon","CreatedById":128860,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T15:32:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome more music would be nice.
