It seems to be dragging my system down to a halt with several craft in orbit, and having all of them nearby. I can barely run the game as it is, and for the first time, I saw the time indicator running red instead of yellow or green. It is quite frustrating to say the least."},{"CreatedByName":"boxman","CreatedById":61559,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T00:53:12Z","Content":"I dont know of any way to reduce the render distance, but what kind of system do you have??\n\nIf it is a desktop system, you could simply get a really cheap GPU like for example the 750ti which should remove all bottlenecks caused by your GPU when it comes to KSP."},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T00:56:20Z","Content":"Once in orbit I\u0027m pretty sure that the draw distance is still 2.2km, it\u0027s just been increased while in the atmo since 1.0.
