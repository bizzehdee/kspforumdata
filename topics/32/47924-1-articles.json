It more or less worked, but with a few problems. Since I only had the 1 man lander can, the delta-V was way too high (predictably) so the aim had to be pretty perfect. With my landing location (-0.68,110.58), I had to get the craft between 5-10 degree East towards 90 degree heading. I forgot the moon is not a perfect sphere heheh.
