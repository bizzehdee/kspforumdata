An orbit is defined by two factors - ship energy (kinetic \u002B potential) and eccentricity. To land on Gilly, you need to gain very specific energy and eccentricity, both of which correspond to Gilly\u0027s orbit. And to spend least fuel on giving your ship that energy, you need to use all available tricks of orbital mechanics - such as Oberth effect or the knowledge that change of an orbital parameter is best done from the opposite side of the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you burn straight up, you\u0027re raising your apoapsis from a place which is way away from periapsis. That means you lose on Oberth effect because your ship is flying slowly and gravity is slowing it down further and that reduces the kinetic energy gain (Oberth effect) from your fuel. If you circularize first, not only you have lifted your periapsis from apoapsis with relative little energy lost on maneuver inefficiencies, but you can then continue lifting your apoapsis towards Gilly from the best place to do such maneuver - from periapsis. All of the energy your ship has when it is in orbit is conserved and you only add to it to lift it towards Gilly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EdFred","CreatedById":108599,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-08T12:43:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust for esses and gees last night, I took my Eve craft and tested.
