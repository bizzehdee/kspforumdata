I\u0027m kinda new to the forum, but I\u0027ve really been enjoying KSP and I had a question about 1.0. From my understanding, Squad will not be releasing a version of 1.0 for 64bit users. I looked at my system and it says I am using 64bit. So after they update I will not be able to play 1.0? Sorry for the seemingly silly question, I just wanted to clear that up... I searched through the forums and that seems to be the consensus, please tell me I\u0027m wrong...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceTiger","CreatedById":133800,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T16:41:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E32bit applications are able to run under 64bit windows.
