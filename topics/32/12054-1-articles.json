Today I will share my experiments with wings - and their apparent unconcern for the laws of physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWings generate lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, yes, that\\\u0027s obvious - but the thing is, they appear to constantly generate lift while moving, which becomes apparent in large catastrophic failures or when observing wings which have splashed down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this in mind, I sought out the mad projects I could use wings in - and today, I have achieved my goal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake a look at this ungainly craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11846144/Wingmobile.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Wingmobile.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11846144/2012-06-04_00002.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222012-06-04_00002.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUgly, isn\\\u0027t it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, the special thing about this particular craft is that it does not require engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy simply elevating the flaps, I can cause this craft, while on the ground, to accelerate up to 80m/s. Turning the rudder yields another 20m/s, until it flips from the centrifugal force.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is very good news for you explorers out there - fuel is now easily conservable. You only need the engines for ocean-hopping or mountain-climbing, as most of the smaller hills and plains are readily traversable in my magnificent machine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Emove wings = more lift. more wings also = more lift.

It can take off at around 20m/s, and glides 50 meters for every one it drops. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ll leave judgement of these things to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you would be so kind, please share your own knowledge and experiences with wings below.
