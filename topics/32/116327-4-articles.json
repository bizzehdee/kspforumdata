(50 shades).\n\nThere\u0027s multiple choices here really, because: \n\nCheating could be an introduction to modding, messing around with the part values is considered cheating but on the other hand, its also modding. Where do you draw the line on what is either? \n\n*^Must it be a concious choice, an act of randomness, a specific line of design or act of god?*\n\nIt could be a clear concious choice you personally make, not playing the game like everyone dictates you should. \n\nIn the end, when you shove the thought-concept of \u0027cheating\u0027 back and forward, it comes down to you personally decide what cheating really is. There is no definitive answer, as what everybody else is trying to force down your throat is just their own personal opinion and not a definitive answer (*This is a definitive answer:*  1x2=2 / 2x1=2 / 1\u002B1=2 / 4:2=2)\n\n(Think of it as a matter of self-discipline rather then exterior-force discipline) \n\nAir-hogging could be considered cheating but on the other hand, utilizing it in experimentation of SSTO\u0027s is not cheating as you are experimenting. \n\nExcessive strutting could also be considered cheating but on the other hand, ask Whackjob.\n\nIts all a matter of perspective, which means unless multiple people are involved in the same game you are currently playing, there will never be an answer.\n\nThe question of \u0027cheating\u0027 is philosophical, which has been placed in game of science, with little green men.\n\nOccam\u0027s Razor anyone?

It works great, but it always feels a bit of an easy way out to use the already unrealistic reaction wheels in such an unrealistic way. ....\n\nSo, a common mistake people make when jumping a vehicle IRL is to release the throttle once they leave the ground, whereupon they suddenly pitch forward and land hard on the front (in a manner most unkind the front axle and driver!).\n\nYou want to keep the revs up while airborne because.....the gyroscopic force of the spinning engine and wheels helps keep the vehicle steady in flight! \n\n(I used to jump quad-bikes in my more foolish days, learnt this the hard way!)\n\nThen there is the Lit Motors C1 untippable bike/car thing that stays upright with a set of 3 gyros.

The reaction wheels minimize the use of other (more interesting) control systems like RCS, and while I suspect Squad did this to decrease the initial learning curve, it in turn creates a spike at one of the more difficult parts of learning the game, which is first docking.\n\nIMO, learning that you have limited maneuvering capability in vacuum early on is a fairly trivial bump in the difficulty progression that would help introduce players to the use of RCS. Instead, that\u0027s postponed until later once they decide they want to attempt docking, when they already have a huge hump to get over in terms of difficulty. So, instead of learning things like balancing thrusters gradually in general play, it\u0027s all dumped on the player at once during what is likely the most difficult portion of learning to play the game.\n\nPersonally, I think that using RCS more and thus having limited maneuvering capability also makes for a more interesting game overall as you have to keep in mind the efficiency of your maneuvers rather than simply performing them willy nilly. I rarely play stock these days, but when I do (generally right after a new release), I know that the reaction wheels are one of the things that bug me the most."},{"CreatedByName":"ChickenNugger429","CreatedById":147779,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T21:38:20Z","Content":"I believe they should be heavily nerfed. I feel \u0022dirty\u0022 whenever I use them. They are extremely overpowered and render RCS useless for most of my missions that don\u0027t require docking manoeuvres. I feel that they could be nerfed by cutting down the amount of torque they provide, and increasing the amount of electricity they require. I think it cuts out much needed challenge in the game, that as long as I have a few dinky solar panels strapped on my several ton craft I can spin it to hell without using much electricity. To compensate for this, I see it fit that there\u0027s an implementation of more RCS nozzles/systems. Also, in relation to attitude control, it would be great to see thrust vectoring added to some of the SRBs."},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T21:47:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Its only cheating if you have someone to cheat against.\n\nBut that\u0027s simply wrong.
