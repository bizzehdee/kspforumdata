Me and a lot of my friends have gotten to the point where we have gotten to every planet, made colonies on each planet, played the DMP mod and had Kerbal Wars, etc. We are out of ideas and starting to lose interest in the game. I know there is a infinite amount of things to do and I know i\u0027m not the only one looking to make new goals and making new memories.

You just gave me an idea actually, doing all of that from IVA. With a few mods such as [Docking Port Alignment Indicator](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43901-1-0-x-Docking-Port-Alignment-Indicator-%28Version-6-2-Updated-05-04-2015%29) and [RasterPropMonitor](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117471-1-0-RasterPropMonitor-still-putting-the-A-in-IVA) it would make it very possible and TONS of fun! I\u0027d also recommend those mods even if you don\u0027t plan on going into IVA much it still makes a hell of a lot cooler for when you do!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Right now, on semi-hiatus waiting for unity 5 (more for the 64-bits than anything else really), I am trying to unlock most of the tech tree without going to Mun.\n\u003E So far with Kerbin/Minmus, I have 2/3rd unlocked with another minus mission in progress.
