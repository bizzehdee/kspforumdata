My ultimate goal for this career is to create a massive ring station based on some of my earlier attempts in previous versions. I am expecting that the station in its entirety will cost at least 100 million units. This means I will be needing to place a science station on each body full of science, so those science points can be turned into Kash units via one of the administration strategies.\u003Cp\u003EThis also means I\u0027ll have to do a pile of those rescue contracts to pick up enough scientists to man all the labs; they\u0027re kind of expensive to hire.
