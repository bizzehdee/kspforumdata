It says \u0022on any computer running a validly licensed copy of the operating system for which the Licensed Application was designed\u0022. It then lists some **examples** of valid operating systems (that\u0027s what \u0022e.g.\u0022 means). It does not say those are the only operating systems you can use. Notice that Windows 8 and Windows 10 aren\u0027t included in the examples either.\n\nIf you have a version of KSP designed to run on Linux, and you have a valid copy of Linux (which is easy because it\u0027s free), then it\u0027s explicitly saying you\u0027re permitted to use it. I suppose running the Windows version of KSP under Wine or Bootcamp or stuff like that might be a bit of a grey area, but I can\u0027t imagine that ever being a problem. Their download page has Windows, Mac, and Linux versions of the game, so they have a \u0022Licensed Application\u0022 designed for Linux. That clause, therefore, gives you the right to run that application under Linux.\n\nAs for the rest of it, it sounds like boilerplate that they\u0027ll likely never enforce because it\u0027s clearly not the way they want people to use their product. I suspect they might actually revise it if the lawyers/beancounters allow it. Technically, however, it does seem to prohibit multiple installs as well as modifications.\n\nFinally, as for \u0022Deported\u0022, I\u0027m guessing the real answer to why they set up the company in this fashion might have something to do with tax laws in various countries.\n\nBottom line: I wouldn\u0027t worry about it."},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T18:53:51Z","Content":"So, looking back at the EULA in November 2014 it appears to mention a different company holding the rights:\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20141120002610/https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/eula.php](https://web.archive.org/web/20141120002610/https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/eula.php)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Electro Chango S.A. de C.V.\u0027s End-User License Agreement (\u0022EULA\u0022) is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity) and Electro Chango S.A. de C.V. for the Electro Chango S.A. de C.V. software product(s) identified above\n\nEdit: ninjaed"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T18:55:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If it\u0027s a tax haven thing, Squad may not feel \u0022comfortable\u0022 discussing this.
