For a modular space station I\u0027m wary of using smaller docking ports for stations. If I\u0027m building an early-game station with the science lab and don\u0027t have Sr ports yet I\u0027ll make it a monolithic station, Skylab/Salyut style, with the smaller docking ports used for visiting ships and possible ancillary modules.

It\u0027s not even worth using the small convert-o-tron in orbit because it takes 5 kg of ore to make 1 kg of propellant (whereas the big convert-o-tron turns 1 kg ore into 1 kg propellant), except in the niche case that you\u0027ve grabbed an asteroid and taken it to your station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is with the stock parts of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MisterKerman","CreatedById":189407,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-13T13:55:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically my formula is make a small \u0022train\u0022 of 2.5m components.
