For realism\u0027s sake, I didn\u0027t want to send kerbals on a one-way trip, and I refused to send a single kerbal in a 1-man capsule and without a hab module. That was just too unrealistic. The mass requirement with available launchers required a two-launch architecture. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe more efficient mission would be a KOR (Kerbin Orbit Rendezvous) architecture, where the two ships dock in Kerbin orbit. This would save mass (only one NERVA engine and hab module would be required), but interplanetary transfers of docked ships is problematic with the current level of docking mods. With our limited docking and refueling capabilities, the best mission architecture I could come up with was DOR (Duna Orbit Rendezvous).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 3 kerbals with sufficient supplies and life support, meaning a hab module had to be available for each trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Landing 2 kerbals on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Use one of the hab modules to serve as a permanent Duna surface outpost for future missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- one lander ship and one return ship (although both spacecraft were identical for redundancy and safety).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- two rendez-vous activities at Duna, one on arrival for refueling the return ship with remaining fuel from the lander ship, and the other to transfer crew after returning from the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the two identical ships, Dragon-Duna RV.

You can see the NERVA engine, the hab module, which is designed to be detached and left on the surface of Duna, and the Dragon lander and service module. On the front, there is an Erkle docking ring for the two Duna rendez-vous sequences. The lander ship was flown by Jeb Kerman and Bob Kerman who would land on Duna. The return ship was flown by Bill Kerman, who was to remain in Duna orbit unless a contingency mission forced him to go down and rescue the others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img839/6960/screenshot49v.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot49v.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe dirst Duna rendez-vous went well, but it would have been easier if we hadn\u0027t forgot to add an ORDA computer for attitude control. A lot of RCS fuel was spent to rendez-vous because the ships were both quite heavy. However, the essential objective of transferring all the remaining fuel from the Lander ship to the Return ship was achieved, which bought us our ticket home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img688/8146/screenshot50v.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot50v.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter jettisonning the NERVA engine and the (now empty) tank from the lander ship, we deorbited and started our descent. This was a bit hairy. Parachutes turned out to be useless as they only partially opened near the ground, so we had to dump the hab module to maintain our thrust/weight ratio.

Two of them in fact , for a total of four ships. The program used two types of vessel , the \u0022Dark Star\u0022 lander and the \u0022Columbiad\u0022 class transfer vehicle. The \u0022Dark Star\u0022 is a all-chemical vessel intended to support one crew member only for a maximum of 100 days (any longer and it is assumed the poor kerbal inside will go nuts). What it lacks in crew comfort it makes up for in reliability and endurance. Dark Stars I \u0026amp; II were successfully used to land and return from the Mun and Minmus using stock parts and I got quite used to handling these little craft. Thus when the time came to go to Duna I was loathe to replace them and decided instead to merely add a second craft to the mission profile. The \u0022Columbiad\u0022 Is about as simple as Interplanetary craft come , but boasting a 3 man-capsule compared to the Dark Stars single seat. More importantly it is powered by the NERVA engine , allowing a feasible return trip in about 270 days. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first double mission was intended to be a \u0022Dry run\u0022 for a full Duna landing , targeting instead the small moon Ike. This first mission again used stock parts exclusively , lining up the Phase and pro-grade angles entirely by eye. Though I successfully managed to get both vehicles into transfer orbits this lack of precision meant that more fuel then I would like had to be spent on adjustments mid-flight. This in turn meant that after Dark Star III had successfully landed on the surface (see attached picture) it could only manage an orbit of 10,000m or so , far below the intended meeting at 50k\u002B. Fortuitously I had completely underestimated the efficiency of the NERVA rig , and ultimately Columbiad I had more than sufficient fuel to match orbit and transfer the heroic Lolin Kerman. Again , given my human imprecision the closest meeting of the two craft was more than 7000 metres , and there were several anxious moments during the long flight between the two. The ride home was uneventful in comparison , but did allow me to make my first ever Interplanetary-aero-braking manoeuvre. Following this succesfull trial I decided to proceed to the full Duna mission , but with one key addition. I added mecha-jeb modules to both craft to allow for much more precise timing of burns , and to save the F5 button that had been so harshly treated during the Ike Excursion \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway , after a standard insertion Dark star IV was parked in a low orbit over Duna whilst Columbiad II was allowed to swing around on a very wide orbit far outside that of Ike. The lander was manually brought to the ground close to the border with the northern polar region , and after after several scary moments my brave kerman walked his first steps upon another world. Alas his little tin-pot lander had few supplies so he was permitted only a day on the surface before returning to a 60km orbit. Mecha-jeb came in very usefull here as its ascent auto-pilot allowed for Inclination matching that of the orbiting Columbiad II , saving the later a considerable amount of fuel. On day 99 Columbiad II was brought into the lower obit , and using the much more precise orbital data provided by mecha-jeb I got it to within 1000m before transferring the landing party. Though much of the return fuel had to be used on re-aquiring the orbital plane the return trip was again succesfull. I didnt have to quick-load once during the second mission , something for which I was very glad. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway , here is a shot of Dark Star III on Ike.
