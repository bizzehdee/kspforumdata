I\u0027ve been running the technical preview on an extra laptop for awhile and all the games I tried (including KSP) worked without issue (once the graphics drivers got updated anyways)."},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T18:22:59Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been running KSP for the last eight months or so on the Technical Preview of Windows 10 and experienced no problems.

If you are running Windows 7 or 8 and kept it up to date there is a tool already installed (on the system tray for Win7) that will analyze your PC and tell you if it is compatible. My brother is on an old PC and his CPU was not compatible and it told him that. Windows Media Center will be uninstalled, it is not compatible, a bit disappointing for me as I use it\u0027s PVR functionality but there are alternatives though.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s going to be a huge download, and some of things MS have been saying about the licence are a bit worrying.

If you are running Windows 8 it\u0027s highly unlikely. At it\u0027s core, Windows 10 is Windows 8.1 with a better GUI and a few minor improvements.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Having control doesn\u0027t stop somebody being stupid, but how can Microsoft knew what I need to be working on today?\n\nControl of what?"}]}
