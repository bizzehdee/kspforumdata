Used the prototype as a permanent ground marker at the KSC - my flag continued to sink into the quicksand immediately surrounding the KSC. Didn\u0027t have enough juice to fly on Kerbin, so I just rolled it off the pad. I\u0027m sure the taxpayers were a bit nervous about that, what with it rolling over and over on the top of an RTG...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally got the Castle Zulu Mun mission for the Doing it Apollo Style Challenge off the ground. As I\u0027d thought, I\u0027d forgotten to re-strut the LEM to the third stage when I changed it to account for the dangling rovers. Fixed that, added my fairing panels...and definitely needed that third stage just for orbit. I was sure the whole thing was going to come crashing down when the second stage lit but she held together and eventually picked up orbital velocity. At this point the mission is in Munar orbit and I\u0027m searching for the Armstrong Memorial. I know the coordinates, I just don\u0027t think my orbit is overflying it. Descent stage didn\u0027t work the way I thought it would; makes me wonder if the 24-77 engine got tweaked for 0.21. Eight of them should definitely be outputting more thrust than a single LV-909, and yet they hardly did anything when I lit them up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Obsidian","CreatedById":21041,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T13:38:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYesterday was designing my Mun base on the ground, now I\u0027ve got to get the parts docked and set up in orbit so I can land the beast.
