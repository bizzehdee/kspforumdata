One thing in need is to scan the objects I\u0027m going to so I can get Kethane to refuel my lander. I launched a bunch of probes to the planets, moons, dwarf planets, I\u0027m going too. My scanner for Eeloo was the most resent. I don\u0027t experience lag around objects that don\u0027t have an ocean, I guess Eeloo is a special case. While I was scanning at 1000X time acceleration I had a noticeable frame rate drop, the video becoming very choppy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESummery: Frame rate around Eeloo drops while I\u0027m at 1000X time acceleration or higher. I have Kethane scanners and MecJeb on a relatively small probe, less than 100 parts. I have around 20 active flights.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joshington","CreatedById":73509,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T00:03:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure that\u0027s normal if your warping very fast close to a planet.
