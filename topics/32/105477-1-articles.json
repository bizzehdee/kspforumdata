It costs a lot of funds to hire new kerbals, but you can add new kerbals to your space progam for free by doing rescue missions. The profession of the rescued kerbal is probably random, I\u0027m not sure. I just rescued a kerbal from orbit around Minmus and he was a scientist, he even gained xp upon returning to Kerbin! When you consider that every additional kerbal costs more funds to hire than the previous one, this can be a real fund saver.\n\nAlso, it looks like you can do more science experiments in space. I was able to use the thermometer \u0022in space high above\u0022 and the barometer both \u0022high\u0022 and \u0022near\u0022 space.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T02:19:17Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 02:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kelderek**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bedwyr","CreatedById":104239,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T02:18:12Z","Content":"Corollary then: Hire most of the astrokerbonauts you want \\*before\\* going on your rescue mission as you\u0027ll escape increased marginal costs.
