For KSP in particular launches are cool the first couple times but get prety samey after that. Unless the youtuber is filling the space with other commentary thats interesting its often better to either accelerate the video or do a simple cut to orbit. Obviously if there is something particularly interesting about the launch its worth showing but the routene launch of your 33rd com satellite that\u0027s identical to the last 32 probably isnt worth showing beyond a cliff-noted version.
