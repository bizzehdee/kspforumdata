I began checking for mod updates on Friday afternoon; nine of my mods had yet to be updated for 1.0.5. Unfortunately, one of those was KER, so switching over was a no go. I\u0026#39;ll be checking those remaining nine as the week progresses. Meanwhile, I\u0026#39;m still in 1.0.2.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFriday I switched from my career save over to my litterbox save and designed a target vehicle. I\u0026#39;ve been meaning to see for some time if the [I]Magpie 7[/I] spaceplane would be capable of doing its intended job - namely, to haul ore down from orbit. Launch of the target vehicle (appropriately named [I]Agena 7[/I] - look up your history of the Gemini program) was a success and the test flight took place on Saturday. It would be accurate to say that the Magpie has \u0022relaxed stability\u0022, but aside from pitch-up tendencies with the airbrakes deployed the craft was controllable, and it performed a successful launch, rendezvous, docking, re-entry and landing with the target payload aboard. I think I can tone down its spoilers (right now they\u0026#39;re set to full deflection; a lesser deflection may be adequate) and I do need to remember to set TAC to keep its nose full of fuel at all times, but other than that the plane is good to go.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI also worked with my [I]Albatross 7[/I] heavy refueling plane design over the weekend, moving its center of mass aft to compensate for a too stable profile. The craft is still too stable; on those instances where I could get it off the runway (damn thing had a tendency to just fly apart for no reason whatsoever), it would go into an unrecoverable dive - no matter what altitude I leveled out at. I\u0026#39;m considering scrapping the existing design altogether at this point and starting from scratch; right now it\u0026#39;s not capable of delivering much besides a good headache every time I try to fly the stupid thing...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;ll be heading back to my career save sometime in the very near future, if for no other reason than to do the actual [I]Magpie[/I] mission. I am considering whether or not I could use the plane to make ore deliveries [I]from[/I] the surface at this point - if there\u0026#39;d be any utility in doing that or not as opposed to just bringing up gas or not.
