It\u0027s just dated and all-around crap (in comparison to other projects like Bullet) since it hasn\u0027t really been expanded upon all that much, except to support more modern hardware. It feels like Adobe Flash, where it never really got buffed up after release because of its initial grand reception, and now the devs are just sitting back and raking in the royalties thanks to the lack of competition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, just like Adobe, they (nVidia) are now so deep in their complacency that others are now coming out of the woodwork to produce the improvements and refinements to the idea that they didn\u0027t feel motivated to stay on top of. With any luck, PhysX will eventually be relegated to just another first-comer story who was left completely behind. At least, that\u0027s how I\u0027d like to see it happen, because honestly, with something that has such broad and positive implications, I find it saddening that a company wouldn\u0027t try to expand their reach by working out a deal with AMD and other video card developers instead of doggedly focusing on supporting only their own hardware, let alone at least try to keep the public interest focused on them by staying ahead of the game (so to speak) in terms of physics emulation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems like since PhysX\u0027s release, most -if not all- of the improvements have been coming from OTHER (third-party) developers, and that\u0027s just sad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-26T21:02:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jfx\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jfx\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETheres always someone on this forum telling you how he gets \u0022perfectly fine\u0022 performance on his toaster.
