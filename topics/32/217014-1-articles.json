I have rewritten the following questions in response.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.Is refueling (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E) recommended? For Tylo, my lander will carry a small surface base with them. This base will have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E with the intent to fill up the lander so it has more fuel to rendezvous with the station after it gets into orbit. Refueling makes things easier on fuel but they take up a lot of space-what should I do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.Multiple landers? Or just one, all-purpose plane-LEM crossover? The current mission plan has 4 landing craft-1 small lander for Pol, Bop, and Vall; a (very) large lander for Tylo; and 2 planes for Laythe. I\u0027ve seen both done (one lander vs. multiple) so what should I go with? Which is generally simpler?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.Where should the mother ship orbit? My plan is to leave it orbiting somewhere while the landers do their stuff, but I\u0027m not sure where. For the smaller moons, (Pol and Bop) the small lander will have enough fuel to rendezvous if the mother ship is orbiting Jool, but the Tylo lander (and probably the Laythe planes) will not. Should I leave it orbiting just one of the moons, (i.e. Laythe because of its decently sized, but not too large gravity well) and have the landers meet up with it? Or should the mother ship orbit whatever moon the lander is currently at?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope it\u0027s not too much trouble to answer these questions! Hopefully the mission will proceed as planned, becoming a mission report!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-05-09T19:33:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2023 07:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by chimera industries\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fulgur","CreatedById":195204,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-03T20:40:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022152333\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed7614870617\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/172495-the-ultimate-jool-5-challenge-continued/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:195px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe official challenge definition is above, which includes all of your points I think!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt has to be 1 ship leaving Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E.
