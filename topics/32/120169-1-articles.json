For example the leerjet cockpit wont work for fighters anymore, lucky for me i never use frontally mounted cockpits anyways (rear cockpits look cooler/sci-fyi and tend to protect the pilot from incoming flak much more and even if the entire craft is destroyed, there is usually a cockpit left). Overall i probably will still not use the MK1 and MK2 front cockpits so that change has no effect on me really. As for engines, i welcome ANY changes to jets appearance wise, the stock ones arent that bad (the basic jet actually looks decent, turbojet is garbage though), but they could use an overhaul. And who doesnt like the new jet they are adding for ME-262 replicas or really any German WW2 jet (i think its even called a \u0022jumo\u0022 after the jumo-004 used in the 262s). As for the massive jet, it wont see any use for me as virtually every one of my airplanes are designed to go into space, somewhere where a low altitude jet is worthless. Its something i might mess with for jet propelled tanks, but in general very limited useage for that thing unless you are actually into conventional airplane designs like 747s or whatnot (which my sci-fi star-fighters are not).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally the only thing im dissapointed in is that (from what ive heard and understand) the lag with higher part counts isnt going to be improved in any meaningful way (its not going to allow us to have 1000 parts loaded without massive lag like before), so this part kinda sucks. Maybe im wrong on this, but i dont have high hopes that super high part count ships will be doable, guess im still gonna stick to making super part count efficient (but not super well armored) capital ships, and stick to minimalistic ground bases too, with tanks that also have under 100 parts each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, given how 1.0 increased lag across the board (especially in atmo), you cant really get any worse at this point (and if it does, i can always stick to 1.04 as a last resort, 0.90 has better performance, but the new aero is too good to give up for less lag with capital ships).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-05T16:12:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022panzer1b\u0022 data-cite=\u0022panzer1b\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, given how 1.0 increased lag across the board (especially in atmo), you \u003Cstrong\u003Ecant really get any worse\u003C/strong\u003E at this point (and if it does, i can always stick to 1.04 as a last resort, 0.90 has better performance, but the new aero is too good to give up for less lag with capital ships).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA fellow named Murphy dropped off a letter for you.
