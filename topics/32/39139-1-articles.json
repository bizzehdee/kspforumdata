Given that it is often more efficient to stage quickly rather than have high delta-v stages (especially in asparagus set-ups) using mainsails can actually be more efficient as the engine contributes less to the overall mass of the stage. Very efficient launchers such as the Nova use mainsails for the asparagus boosters and T30s/T45s for the central stack to make the most out of this behaviour.

Your optimal speed at low altitude, when you are going vertically, is the terminal velocity at that altitude: the faster you go, the less you lose to gravity [linearly so], but the more you lose to drag [quadratically so], thus the optimal speed is where gravity = drag. So you need a TWR of about 2 on average: one for gravity, one for drag. Any more thrust than that, and you should throttle back to save fuel. Or, even better, drop an engine so you no longer need to haul it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter you start turning, the optimal speed is still a matter of discussion, but again, you generally want to have as little engine mass as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T19:31:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find the Skipper to be an excellent short-range interplanetary engine; it gets a decent fuel economy and the burn times aren\u0027t painful like you get from nuclear engines.

The engines themselves have weight, and that weight detracts from your delta-V. For the same setup with the same engines with the same Specific Impulse (what Isp stands for), fewer engines will generate more delta-V, but less thrust. This is why the small radials can be more efficient than a LV-N: The LV-N is really freaking heavy (2.5 tons if I recall).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other thing to keep in mind is that Isp isn\u0027t static: It changes as you climb. The two values specified for our engines are \u0027at 1 atm\u0027 (Sealevel pressure), and \u0027In Vacuum\u0027. It ramps smoothly between the two as the pressure changes...and the pressure decreases logarithmically as you climb.

It really doesn\u0027t take much altitude before your engines are closer to the \u0027vacuum\u0027 efficiency than the \u0027Atmosphere\u0027 efficiency...which is also lower on the mainsails and the skippers than the smaller engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I\u0027ve had up to 7 engines on the bottom of an orange tank before.
