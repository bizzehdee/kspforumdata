I nailed the landings, 2 for 2 on my first pass. I had one reload due to being lazy (too much retro burn over Minimus tweaked my orbit horribly), but no disasters. I had a staging issue on the first trip (Mun) that was corrected for the Minumus run, but did not require a revert. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo all in all: yay!
