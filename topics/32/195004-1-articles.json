Probe cores besides the Stayputnik, Rove-Mate, and OKTO2 do also have built-in reaction wheels, but they are kind of anemic compared to what the manned pods have got. As for why the ones in the manned pods are so much more powerful, I don\u0027t know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-24T08:33:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost command parts have built-in reaction wheels (except the RoveMate, QBE and OKTO2 probe cores which have none and possibly the stayputnik too, I haven\u2019t used it in a long time) but probes generally have really feeble ones compared to pods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdding extra reaction wheels will help you control your rockets, but only if you have enough power to run them- built in batteries won\u2019t last long and you\u2019ll need a way to recharge them if you want any kind of long-term use out of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
