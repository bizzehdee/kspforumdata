So you only get the processing buff once per experiment. \n\nI don\u0027t really understand the continuous research yet. It starts at 0 sci/day and just sticks at that. However, once you have processed an experiment on board then it goes up. You can\u0027t process an experiment more than once as I said above but you can take multiple experiments along and each of these being processed in the lab adds to the lab\u0027s sci/day. \n\nSo to make a station that will be generating a lot of science it seems you need to take a lot of experiments and process them in the lab. I seem to remember them saying it would decay over time, so maybe you have to take up and dock a new bunch of experiments occasionally, which makes some vague sense.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T23:46:14Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 11:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Foxster**"},{"CreatedByName":"klingolf","CreatedById":134999,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T01:52:33Z","Content":"Bu what do you do with this data, then?

It\u0027s fully intended that you can even stuff experiments you have already returned to Kerbin into the lab and get even more science.\n\nAlso, stuffing sciece into the lab will not affect its science payout for regular transmitting/returning in any way. You can always do both just fine."}]}
