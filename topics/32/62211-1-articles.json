As long as the payload is reasonably shaped and between 50% and 100% of the nominal capacity of the lifter, the rocket should be oblivious of whatever it\u0027s carrying, get the payload into orbit, and then deorbit itself. Sometimes that\u0027s not possible, but it\u0027s a good thing to aim for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen designing a new lifter rocket, I start by building a dummy payload with mass as close to the nominal capacity as possible. Then I add something like this under the payload:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/jltsiren/stuff/rocket_brain.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rocket_brain.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022brain\u0022 of the rocket includes a decoupler for separating the payload, a probe core for controlling the rocket after separation, reaction wheels, batteries, and solar panels. I usually add MechJeb as well, as it greatly speeds up the design process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I start fooling around with fuel tanks, engines, and boosters, until the numbers look right. The total delta-v of the rocket should be at least 4300 m/s in atmosphere and 4750 m/s in vacuum. TWR should be between 1.5 and 2.0 at liftoff, stay above 1.4 all the time, and not get above 3.0 during the first couple of minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause engines are tall and heavy, I usually don\u0027t do vertical staging, but aim for a single-stage lifter with 2-4 boosters instead. If the boosters use liquid fuel, I usually add fuel lines from them to the core lifter for some extra delta-v. As I prefer using a small number of powerful engines over a larger number of smaller engines, the core lifter usually has a Skipper or a Mainsail, while the boosters can use Skippers, Mainsails, or LV-T30s. Larger lifters may have some radial engines near the bottom of the core for some additional thrust, or at the top to improve stability. If top engines are used, they must be gimbal locked, as SAS can\u0027t use thrust vectoring properly above the center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a final touch, I add struts and launch stability enhancers, until the rocket feels solid enough.

You need to design it from the top down. First, decide where you want to go. This will tell you what you want the rocket to do, and you can look up the \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv figures for the mission. Then create your payload. If you\u0027re going to have it land on Minmus for instance you\u0027ll notice you don\u0027t need a lot of thrust to have a TWR \u0026gt;2 nor will you need a lot of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv in the lander itself, so you can make do with LT-5 Micro Struts. It\u0027ll also need a probe core, solar panels, and a battery. Maybe even lights. Then you design the stage that will perform the transfer burn. Then you design the stage that will get that out of the upper atmosphere. Then you design the biggest stage that will get it all off the surface. Once you\u0027ve done it enough, it\u0027s entirely possible for complete mission architecture to appear in your mind fully-formed in a flash of inspiration, or to come to you in dreams. Be especially sure to check your dream-math while awake. Speaking of, some sort of flight computer is indispensable for designing your rocket in the VAB. You can\u0027t do rocket science by intuition. I don\u0027t calculate TWR and \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv manually every time I place a new part, MechJeb does that. I monitor its data to ensure the construction is proceeding to plan. I can also notice if there is a problem in staging that will end in tears if not corrected.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyHook","CreatedById":31496,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T11:17:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooking to the past for inspiration has helped me a great deal.

Seems like it\u0027ll take some time to get the hang of it so I might only get serious in summer when my Uni studies are done. I\u0027ll have to stick to simple games like BF4 until I have the time to invest in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InterCity","CreatedById":98462,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T14:10:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStep 1: Create payload (that thing on top of the rocket that is supposed to get away from Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 2: Add struts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 4: Add stack decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 5: Pick one to four most efficient engines possible (Usually nuke or KW rocketry\u0027s SPS), and attach it under the payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 6: Add fuel tanks above the engine as long as your TWR is higher than 1,00.
