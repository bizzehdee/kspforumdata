My second launch had a crew of one kerbal and was over-engineered as it later transcribed. Upon reaching LKO I realised I had enough fuel to attempt a free return around the Mun. When I arrived there I decided to enter Munar orbit. Still there was fuel so the only thing for it was to attempt a landing. I crash landed (I had not equipped the rocket with landing legs) but the kerbal walked away. He became unresponsive after an accident on the surface involving the rocket debris and I thought he was dead. So I uninstalled the demo, purchased and downloaded the full version (0.19). I will never know for certain, what was his name and was he dead or just temporarily unconscious?
