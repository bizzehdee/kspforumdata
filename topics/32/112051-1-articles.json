Someone beat me to the star multipliers but I was just going to update the wiki to say that the baseline ore production rate for a drill is 0.05*concentration, but since I\u0027m no veteran, I wanted to check that you all agree with my figure before I do. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T22:20:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just pictured someone landing a little mining rig on the wiki and drilling into it to extract wiki-ore...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MathmoRichard","CreatedById":113752,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T22:35:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022parameciumkid\u0022 data-cite=\u0022parameciumkid\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI just pictured someone landing a little mining rig on the wiki and drilling into it to extract wiki-ore...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan I get science for that? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T23:29:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo if ore concentration in the area is 6%, you can expect an automated drill to get .003 ore/second?
