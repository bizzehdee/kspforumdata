I need some more help, but think it\u0027s probably best to move the discussion over here (@moderator: please move this to somewhere more appropriate if there is somewhere). I\u0027ve had a good look around the forums and have only found cursory references to Dvorak so far... if indeed there is ongoing discussion and I\u0027ve just been unable to find it, I\u0027d very much appreciate a link to it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecap:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI use a Dvorak keyboard layout, not a Sholes (\u0027QWERTY\u0027) one.

Perhaps the only viable option is to plug in a USB Sholes layout keyboard to play KSP, but I\u0027d rather not resort to that as I\u0027ve used a two-keyboard setup in the past to get around this issue in other applications -- and it has never been satisfactory.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121130-KSP-and-Dvorak?p=1936065\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1936065\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121130-KSP-and-Dvorak?p=1936065\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1936065\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThanks to Endersmens\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121130-KSP-and-Dvorak?p=1936065\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1936065\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E, I now know how to reset KSP to the default bindings settings (which is a relatively simple matter of deleting -- or renaming -- the settings.cfg file in the root KSP directory). Not an ideal solution for non-computer literate folk, and perhaps when I find the \u0027[official] Wishlist thread\u0027 I\u0027ll post in there requesting a \u0027Reset bindings to default\u0027 option within the KSP interface itself.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027d like to do is experiment with setting the key bindings so that KSP will work on the Dvorak layout I use every day -- but do so in a way that would allow me to save all those settings so that I can reapply them to the default at a later date, should this become necessary (for instance, on a complete reinstall). Because not only is it not a small job, it\u0027s also quite error-p r o n e*. Not to mention mission-critical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are at least a couple of other KSP Dvorak users out there... and my work could even be of use to them, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at the settings.cfg file it may simply be a case of saving the block of text from \u0027PITCH_DOWN\u0027 to the \u0027}\u0027 before \u0027TRACKIR\u0027 (1347 lines), and pasting that over the top of the similar block in a new settings.cfg file. I\u0027d prefer a better solution (if there is one) as the copy-paste technique could lead to unexpected results if the format of that section were to change in the future (as, indeed, it may have done due to the \u0027Completely revised Input Mapping system\u0027 implemented as of v1.0.0).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne major concern I have is the possibility of breaking something due to unexpected collisions of key assignments. There\u0027s clearly a lot of overloading of key functions in the default key mappings (ie, the same key does something different depending upon what mode you\u0027re in, such as the spacebar separating stages in the \u0027Staging\u0027 mode, but toggling between rotation and linear control modes in \u0027Docking\u0027 mode), and I wonder whether this itself would tend to render any attempt at the kind of major remapping exercise I\u0027m contemplating so fraught with potential pitfalls as to make it futile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I\u0027m at it, I think I may also be tempted to move some of the key assignments around. I\u0027m not keen on the proximity of some of the keys in the default placement. For instance, the movement keys (WASD) are too close for my liking to THROTTLE_CUTOFF and RCS_TOGGLE, which, if hit accidentally, can have bad results. As just one example, I want to move THROTTLE_CUTOFF (default \u0027X\u0027) to \u0027Keypad0\u0027. Assuming that re-laying the keys in a strict one-to-one correspondence to change from Sholes to Dvorak is itself a viable project, would it be a \u0027bridge too far\u0027 to try to move other stuff around? (One obvious impact would be that it might render my revised layout of less use to others... though I could do it in two stages).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood grief, so many words.

I like the layered design.

The four keys \u0027W\u0027, \u0027A\u0027, \u0027S\u0027 and \u0027D\u0027 are commonly hard-coded as the keys for up, left, down and right respectively. This is fine with a QWERTY layout, as these four keys lie together in positions that correspond with the respective directions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i167.photobucket.com/albums/u128/snafubucket/games/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/WASD_zpsdfvlcpem.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WASD_zpsdfvlcpem.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, on a Dvorak keyboard layout, the placement of those four keys is not particularly useful for movement purposes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i167.photobucket.com/albums/u128/snafubucket/games/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/WASD-Dvorak_zpstdtfkvtd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WASD-Dvorak_zpstdtfkvtd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Left\u0027 and \u0027right\u0027 are still ok, relatively speaking, but \u0027down\u0027 has become \u0027up\u0027, and vice versa. Also, these keys are a bit too far away from each other to be of much use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs DMagic and Keith_Bones have pointed out, if one has both Sholes and Dvorak layouts configured in Windows, one can toggle between them using \u0027Windows Key \u002B Space\u0027. This works after a fashion, but for a newcomer like me who still has to learn which key does what in KSP, it\u0027s a pain in the posterior. Bear in mind that I\u0027m using a keyboard on which the keys are laid out according to the Dvorak layout, not QWERTY. So if I have Windows set to \u0027QWERTY\u0027 mode, the keytops don\u0027t do what they say on the tin. The game will be telling me to press (for instance) \u0027X\u0027 for \u0027Throttle Cut-off\u0027; but if I do press the key labelled \u0027X\u0027 I\u0027ll actually be telling the game to (ironically) apply the brakes -- the wheel brakes, that is! On a Dvorak layout, the key I really need to press for \u0027Throttle Cut-off\u0027 is \u0027Q\u0027, \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E \u0027X\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point is that if the game \u0027understands\u0027 the layout I\u0027m using -- which it can do, if I redefine the keys appropriately -- then there\u0027s no confusion at all. Instead of telling me to press \u0027X\u0027, it will actually tell me to press \u0027Q\u0027, and everything is fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve made quite a bit of progress on this.
