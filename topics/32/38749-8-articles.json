Squad already has our money, keeping existing players happy and giving us more toys is less of a priority than making a finished game that they can sell to more people. The type who come into the game and ask \u0022how do I enable the career option\u0022 or \u0022I finished the tutorial, what am I supposed to do now in this game?\u0022 Career mode, although not all of the existing players will even want to play in that way (depending how it\u0027s implemented), is mandatory for a complete game. Giving existing players resources won\u0027t make us so much happier that word of mouth will sell more copies of the game than it does right now, honestly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOptimization, better aerodynamics (and associated other broken physics like intake and jet mechanics, fuel flow rate changing in atmosphere instead of engine thrust, etc) and more places to visit are polish, they give the game credibility and more things to do (or a better experience, in the case of optimization) but aren\u0027t core new gameplay features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember that as of yet, we have absolutely no idea what Squad has in mind for career mode. There are a million ways they could do it and have it work in the game, and it\u0027s something they must get right for career mode to be fun, interesting, and accessible for a wide range of player styles and abilities. This is what they should and will spend most of their time on for the next few updates - the implementation might not be all that hard or take that long, but they need to get the conceptual gameplay design right. They have ideas and they\u0027ve done some behind-the-scenes work on underlying systems like progress tracking and basic crew management (not exactly behind-the-scenes, but it also doesn\u0027t really do much gameplay-wise right now), but if they\u0027re any further than barely started on the core of career mode they haven\u0027t shared it with us yet. This will likely go through several iterations putting in the pieces over the next few updates, with plenty of feedback from the playerbase and revisions over time, I\u0027m sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t to say that career mode and resources are mutually exclusive however. Judging by the responses to this poll and popularity of mods like Kethane, many existing players would find a resource-collection base-establishing gameplay mode entertaining once we\u0027ve mastered the basics of orbit and interplanetary travel. This might be what the end-game of career mode could look like. But for the first few updates where career mode takes shape, they shouldn\u0027t start with the end-game if the early and middle stages of career mode work entirely differently.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-03T09:43:50Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2013 09:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tavert\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BarryDennen12","CreatedById":50869,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T10:13:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not crazy about any of that stuff - I just want see-through windows on the pods.
