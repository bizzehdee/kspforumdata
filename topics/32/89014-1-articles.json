I want to say it was 0.8 but I don\u0027t really know. Heck I was terrible back then and when they finally added the Mun I had almost no concept of orbits and transfers so I had no idea how to get there.

Somehow it made it to orbit and I managed to land on the moon on the wings. It mun injections were difficult these days because there were no maneuver nodes. The rule of thumb was \u0022if you see the moon rise at the horizon, throttle up until your AP matches the Mun\u0027s orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the tower. Any remember the tower? Sometimes the rockets grew so big you would smash them the the tower on lift-off. So you had to move the rocket a bit to the side in the VAB. And it came out of the VAB rotated by 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 (which they fixed lately with 0.25 or 0.25). Somewhen I attached decouplers, these very big decouplers (we had no other back then), to my first stage engine because they kept exploding due to the weight above them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, these times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;/oldManVoice\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMun orbit was a beautiful view the first time you saw it. Seeing the Kerbin rise above the horizon like Apollo 8 did gave me chills. I lifted my thumb, closed one eye and erased Kerbin. I was alone. The planet it started from, so vast and big, was gone. The only sign of civilisation was a tiny capsule orbiting a rock in the blackness of space. That moment I felt very very small.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xub313","CreatedById":57408,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-01T07:48:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMan, I wish I kept my screenshots and stuff from 0.17.
