In theory as long as the dynamic pressure is low enough the force on parachutes should be extremely low. I can see \u00A0that if you open parachutes before PE you could theoretically have too much dynamic pressure \u00A0as the orbit decays and speed increases as you get closer to kerbin and into denser atmosphere. My big problem are parachutes on duna. With 20 times less atmospheric pressure at the surface you should be able to open parachutes when you\u0027re going \u00A0Square root of 20 times faster yes it gets more complicated when you are going supersonic but I couldn\u0027t imagine it\u0027s that much of a difference\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-08T18:43:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell i think there is a minimum pressure/airflow required for the parachute to open...
