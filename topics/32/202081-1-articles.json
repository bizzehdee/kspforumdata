One of the last contracts I took was establishing a surface base on Duna. It was your typical \u201CCapacity for 9 Kerbals, Stable for 10 seconds, etc\u201D. There was a couple of other criteria. I have a similar base on Minmus and the Mun, but obviously the distance to, and landing on Duna makes it significantly more difficult. So I modify my current surface station and booster and take a couple hours planning and executing the mission. Everything worked pretty well with only a few fairly minor hiccups.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0So, I land on Duna. Everything looks great. And I see\u00A0the contract doesn\u2019t complete for some reason. \u00A0I look a little closer and realize that I don\u2019t have the right docking port on the station. I have a few docking ports on\u00A0the station, just not the right one as part of\u00A0the contract criteria. I consider getting an engineer to just mount the correct docking port, but I realize one of\u00A0the other criteria for the contract is that the station be complete on launch, which I assume will prevent that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Well that sucks lol. I imagine I am far from the only one who has done this though?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Rylant\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dientus","CreatedById":209823,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-29T17:21:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, maybe, possibly, I might have done that once or twice...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t done it since the addition of engineers being able to attach things.

One of the few welcome bugs in KSP (if you consider it that).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTBH I\u2019d have Alt-F12\u2019d that one at the first sign of trouble as you have multiple ports on and realistically if the port type was so important, wouldn\u2019t the Co have checked the designs or even looked at it pre-launch? Why would they wait till you got all the way to Duna before deciding?
