What I neglected was that this ship spent it\u0027s entire operational 0.24 and earlier history operating on Minmus in super low gravity, and that a ship with half the thrust and twice the weight of my regular Munar landers would need a considerable burn time to not crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was decided during descent that killing both vertical and horizontal velocity in time to land was a fantasy, and the ship was reoriented for a full vertical burn.
