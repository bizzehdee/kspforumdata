In fact, in some designs they simply do not work the way you would expect due to aero drag overcoming their power, or due to parts clipping into each other and \u0022sticking\u0022 to each other while rotating away from your main vessel (I tested this with full size Flea SRBs as separators and even they didn\u0027t work in FAR. the stickiness was too great).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake a tip from the Russians: mount your first stage boosters with a slight angle inwards: use the decoupler itself to rotate a few degrees inwards.. doing it with the tank alone will not work.\u00A0When the boosters fall away, they will rotate around their center of mass, which is way down near the bottom of your boosters when the fuel tanks are empty. If you rotate them inwards a few degrees, a normal decoupler will provide enough force to rotate them away, and their rotation will never get near your spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will lose a small amount of delta V, but in your first stage boosters, this likely doesn\u0027t amount to too much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor stages that are separated high up in the atmosphere, this isn\u0027t as much of a concern, and sepatrons will work just as you expect, but you can use this technique there as well to avoid the additional part count.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis technique used in stock KSP will also help avoid your boosters impacting each other on the way down, if you would like to use a recovery mod to save cash.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7uppG9XE00VbVJPeXYwckpQaTQ/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBasic Example of inwards rotation\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe example is not elegant, but it shows the principle. :-) This design is very simple, and is spec\u0027d to cheaply take a full\u00A0orange tank into orbit at 80km with 500\u002B m/s to spare (using FAR). It succeeds in stock KSP without the fairings with 1000 m/s to spare. This was intended at a Munar or Minmus orbital refueler. It has loads of RCS as well. To use it as a Munar/Minmus refueler in FAR, you can add a few solids to increase the delta V left after orbital insertion. Mainsails and Poodles for the entire thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe shown craft game has FAR, StockBugFix\u00A0and Procedural Fairings installed so that you can fire your rockets while they are protected by a boat-tail. If you don\u0027t have those mods installed, don\u0027t use fairings like this.. they will not work! The engines will not activate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPOST NOTE: Yes, I do know there are other ways of achieving this (with different nose cones, etc) but this is one technique that I haven\u0027t seen getting much attention, and it has saved me a lot of hassle in early games! Also, in FAR, your boosters, if ejected in a low enough atmosphere with enough speed, will have a good chance of self destructing regardless of how you tweak it. To avoid that, you have to use more advanced nose cones, add back in sepatrons to keep the stage upright after separation, and use any other technique you can to keep them upright until they slow down enough not to get destroyed by aero forces. But they will still not touch your main spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-01T01:31:35Z\u0022 title=\u002202/01/2016 01:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Dr.LoveJoy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etitle change\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-01T00:05:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA screenshot would add a lot of clarity to what I suspect is a good post \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr.LoveJoy","CreatedById":147729,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-01T00:36:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is one in the link. :-) I suspect I do not have enough status here to post images as the \u0022Insert Other Media\u0027 button tells me I do not have access.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-01T00:37:18Z\u0022 title=\u002202/01/2016 12:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Dr.LoveJoy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-01T00:36:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou don\u0027t need to mount the boosters with an angle to achieve aerodynamic separation, you just need to have the decoupler attached to the booster above its empty CoM and when you stage the decoupler will give the booster a kick so they peel outwards like flower petals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAerodynamic separation works fine for something like two or four boosters around the core.

Also, using FAR changes things. In stock KSP, this isn\u0027t needed at all in my example design, but using FAR, and after putting in the boat-tail fairings, I needed a way to keep the ends away from the middle more definitively. I then realized there were probably a lot of people who may have made designs where their booster stages collided too rapidly due to other reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have significant overhang on the bottom, with FAR the vessel will shield the bottom from aero but not the top, so the rotation rate will be much faster than you would expect and the boosters end up colliding, even if you balance the center of mass. Once they collide, they can \u0022stick\u0022, which creates other cascade effects. Especially in my case, where the craft is just over supersonic when the first boosters separate.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMounting them with a slight angle inwards avoids all the potential problems associated with this. It moves the center of mass away from the vessel a bit so the rotation angle is subtended beyond the crafts trajectory.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: By the way, all of this is so you can use the stock parts and so on with FAR more easily. If you had added needle tanks and/or fairings up high, the boosters would separate out and down, and you wouldn\u0027t need this method. Clearly, there is a great deal to talk about with regards to separating boosters well, but I wanted to add this as a very simple trick to getting a design the otherwise works well to work better without having to redesign from scratch.:-) It\u0027s also a way to keep part count down, since you don\u0027t need to include sepatrons if you don\u0027t want to.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-01T01:19:23Z\u0022 title=\u002202/01/2016 01:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Dr.LoveJoy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eclarification\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fourfa","CreatedById":151713,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-01T01:04:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222388176\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022131130\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221454284801\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022147729\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dr.LoveJoy\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Dr.LoveJoy said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will lose a small amount of delta V, but in your first stage boosters, this likely doesn\u0027t amount to too much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI assume you mean due to the cosine loss of slightly off-angle engines? \u00A0You can angle them back to straight if you like - the \u0022F\u0022 key while using the rotation widget (\u00223\u0022 key in the VAB/SPH) will help a lot. \u00A0But cosine loss really is negligible under a few degrees anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-01T01:21:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it worth adding [FAR] to the thread title?\u00A0 It sounds like the problem you\u0027re trying to solve is mainly a FAR one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m just running stock aero, and have never had any trouble with radial boosters hitting the central core of the ship.\u00A0 Just mount the decouplers above the CoM of the boosters, and they peel away nicely, just as \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/24430-temstar/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002224430\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/24430-temstar/\u0022\u003E@Temstar\u003C/a\u003E pointed out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this is a technique that\u0027s needed mainly because of FAR, would be handy to label it explicitly as such to avoid confusion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr.LoveJoy","CreatedById":147729,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-01T01:33:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222388263\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022131130\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221454289709\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022125662\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snark\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 minutes ago, Snark said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this is a technique that\u0027s needed mainly because of FAR, would be handy to label it explicitly as such to avoid confusion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!

However since this thing is supposed to be able to get to very high or elliptical orbits to do rendezvous, I wanted to maximize delta V after orbital injection. In the end, I did rotate the engines to point straight down, which improved things. However I lost the side benefit of less sensitivity to angular perturbation. Which was ok in this one, but in another incarnation I was lofting a very unwieldy payload that had a tendency to oscillate, so I had to put them back to their original angle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-01T01:45:04Z\u0022 title=\u002202/01/2016 01:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Dr.LoveJoy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-01T01:49:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother method I\u0027ve seen for safe booster separation is centrifugal separation.
