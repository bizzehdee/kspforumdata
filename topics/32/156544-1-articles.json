I\u0027ve been playing KSP for a while.\u00A0 Nearly three years of active playing, around two years of being active on the forums.\u00A0 So I\u0027ve got a pretty good handle on what\u0027s out there and which mods are available to do what.\u00A0 So it\u0027s highly unlikely that I\u0027ll get midway through a career and discover something shiny that I \u0022should have had from the start\u0022:\u00A0 if it were that important, I would have already known about it and used it from the get-go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond... I don\u0027t know how other folks approach careers, but for me:\u00A0 whenever I start a career, I go into it already having a very definite idea in mind what the \u0022story arc\u0022 will be for the career.\u00A0 I decide in advance which major career-defining mods I\u0027ll be using.\u00A0 Will it have life support, or not?\u00A0 Will it be in the stock solar system, or a modded one?\u00A0 And, if the latter, which one (OPM, New Horizons, Galileo\u0027s Planet Pack)?\u00A0 Will I run \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E?\u00A0 Extraplanetary Launchpads?\u00A0 And so forth. In addition to deciding ahead of time which gameplay-defining mods I\u0027ll run, I also have an idea in my head of the \u0022plot of the novel\u0022:\u00A0 what\u0027s the big, majestic goal of the career?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s really important, because \u003Cstrong\u003EI want to know in advance what \u0022done\u0022 looks like for that career.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 That\u0027s probably the single most important decision I make before I start.\u00A0 I set a goal that determines what \u0022done\u0022 is, and I work towards that.\u00A0 That way, \u003Cstrong\u003EI know when I\u0027m done\u003C/strong\u003E and it\u0027s time to end the career and move on to a new one.\u00A0 \u0022Done\u0022 may be something different for different careers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample of a typical career plan in spoiler:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv

(so there are lots of nice juicy planets with plenty of moons out on the outer limits of the solar system) and Extraplanetary Launchpads (so I can build ships off-Kerbin).\u00A0 I might define my story arc (\u003Cem\u003Ebefore I start the career\u003C/em\u003E) like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nPreliminary goal:\u00A0 Build a base on Minmus, as early as possible (i.e. as soon as I have the bare minimum tech needed), which is capable of building and launching its own ships.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBuild a single big \u0022mothership\u0022 mission and send it to the outer solar system with \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eall\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of my kerbals aboard, abandoning the base.\u00A0 No more launches from Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCompletely explore Sarnus, Urlum, and Neidon, with all their moons,\u00A0 The mothership can build exploration vessels, and even replacements for itself, along the way.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen it\u0027s all done, bring them triumphantly home with a mega-load of science.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDone!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s just one example of a possible career plan.\u00A0 Every time I start a new career, I try to mix things up (different combination of mods, different story arc) in some original fashion that I haven\u0027t played before-- that\u0027s what keeps KSP fresh for me, so that I\u0027m not tired of playing it even after three years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... how does that inoculate me against Constant Career Restart Syndrome?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I think it helps in a couple of ways:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, whenever I\u0027m playing a career, I\u0027m doing so \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewith a definite gameplay style and goal in mind\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 By analogy with, say, shopping, my career is like going into the store \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ewith a shopping list\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E, and the goal of \u0022get into the store, grab everything on my list, and get out, as efficiently as possible.\u0022\u00A0 What I\u0027m \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Enot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E doing is just browsing and window shopping and looking at all the shiny objects.\u00A0 I\u0027m \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Esearching\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, not \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ebrowsing\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Therefore, I\u0027m unlikely to get distracted by something I see along the way.\u00A0 If I happen to see some especially shiny new toy I hadn\u0027t been aware of, I don\u0027t abandon my shopping trip-- I just make a note of it and decide I\u0027ll take a look at it the next time I visit the store.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, and perhaps even more importantly:\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003EI always know I\u0027ll be finishing my current career reasonably soon\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 That\u0027s because I decide, before starting, what the \u0022done\u0022 condition is; I know what goal I\u0027m working towards.\u00A0 The career isn\u0027t open-ended; it has a finite lifespan, decided in advance.\u00A0 I know that I\u0027m going to be accomplishing the goal and \u0022winning\u0022 in a bounded time period.\u00A0 Depending on how ambitious this particular career is, it might be a month, it might be two months, it might be longer-- but it\u0027s not just going to go on and on indefinitely.\u00A0 So, since I \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eknow\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E that it\u0027s going to end in a reasonable time frame, that means I have less temptation to abandon it if I discover something shiny.\u00A0 \u0022Oh, look at that!\u00A0 That\u0027s cool, I could totally use that as the linchpin of a career!\u00A0 Okay, I\u0027ll make a note of it, and I\u0027ll work it into the game plan for my \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Enext\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E career.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the only time I\u0027ve ever abandoned a career is when I discover that my plan is a lot less fun than I expected, and that I\u0027m not enjoying it-- i.e. I made a mistake when I planned things out.\u00A0 Example in spoiler:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, I had a career that I decided was going to be full-bore MKS/OKS, with TAC Life Support and Extraplanetary Launchpads, with the goal of building a fully self-sustaining mothership that could explore the whole system.\u00A0 It sounded good \u0022on paper\u0022.\u00A0 Neat!\u00A0 Complex logistics!\u00A0 Keeping track of lots of things, to feed my OCD!\u00A0 What fun it will be, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I didn\u0027t bargain for, though, is that it turned out that MKS/OKS really wasn\u0027t my cup of tea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI chose it because of the complex logistics (which I thought would be a fun challenge), but it ended up being much less fun for me than I expected.\u00A0 \u0022Hey, why am I not enjoying this?\u0022\u00A0 I finally realized that it was because MKS/OKS changes KSP into a very different sort of game entirely, where it\u0027s almost entirely about resource management and logistics \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Einstead of flying rocket ships\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Since \u0022flying rocket ships\u0022 is what KSP is all \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eabout\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E for me, that\u0027s why it became un-fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Not that there\u0027s anything wrong with MKS/OKS itself-- it does what it sets out to do, very well.\u00A0 It\u0027s just that it\u0027s really not my thing, and I didn\u0027t realize that until I started playing it and got halfway into a career.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs soon as I realized \u0022I\u0027m not enjoying this\u0022, and the reason why, it became clear that the problem was unfixable because the very thing that was sapping my enjoyment was the exact thing that was the centerpiece of the whole career-- that was the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Epoint\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I abandoned that career immediately, without a backward glance, and rolled a new one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat happens pretty rarely, though-- I\u0027m a fairly careful person, and if I\u0027m putting together a career out of new elements I haven\u0027t used before, I generally do a fair amount of research in advance, so that I have a good idea how much fun it\u0027ll be for me.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022
