Real aircraft and rockets tend to have lots and lots of flight instruments, and they\u0027re not just there for funsies. [here](http://www.aopa.org/-/media/Images/AOPA/Pilot/1402p/cessna2.jpg) is the cockpit of a [cessna 180](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cessna.180a.g-btsm.arp.jpg), which is a pretty simple aircraft.\n\u003E \n\u003E In KSP we have a navball that\u0027s meant to provide most of the information. You\u0027ll also be using the altimeter, and throttle indicator now and then, and more advanced players might look at their vertical velocity and g-meter once in a while. That\u0027s not sufficient instrumentation if you want to go a long way down the realism path, \n\u003E \n\u003E We\u0027re already pushing the limits of the instrumentation we have with 1.0.2 physics. A \u0022pretty standard\u0022 rocket will want to flip if it\u0027s very slightly away from prograde when passing through mach 1. You can add fins to correct for this, but \u0022real\u0022 rockets don\u0027t all have fins. The best you can do in KSP (if you want to fly it manually) is \u0022try to keep it pointing prograde\u0022. But the navball doesn\u0027t provide information at a high enough resolution for you to know that you are a fraction of a degree away from porgrade, which means you can\u0027t fly it \u0022manually\u0022 with the available instrumentation. \n\u003E \n\u003E Is that bad? Well, only if we want KSP to be a game where you can fly your rocket manually with the instrumentation available. If we don\u0027t want that... ie, if we want a realistic simulator, we\u0027ll probably need to add a lot more realistic instrumentation, and maybe have all our launches be computer controlled. But is that still KSP, or have we just remade orbiter at that point?\n\u003E \n\u003E This already happens in KSP by the way... people who go with mods that add realism also tend to have more realistic instrumentation (FAR is the obvious example). It seems to me that this is the right way to do things: the basic game should be, well, \u0022basic\u0022. Simplified instrumentation, simplified controls, and along with that an appropriately simplified flight model. If you then want to press that towards a simulation, go with mods that add these features. it makes a lot less sense for the devs to spend a huge amount of time making a high fidelity simulator, and then have players download mods to simplify all of that.\n\nAll fair points, However...\n\nI\u0027m not advocating a plethora of \u0022realistic instrumentation\u0022. I am advocating that the aero and space flight physics FRAMEWORK should be consistent. If there needs to be a relative feedback loop with buffering implemented in the existing stock control GUI then fine. If a player wants to load a mod to gain extended control features, fine.\n\nIts the physics framework which needs to be consistent and believable."},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T09:16:12Z","Content":"I\u0027ve only skimmed this thread and I\u0027m sure this has been mentioned; isn\u0027t this going to be a problem for challenges? \n\nI know we\u0027ve already had the option to enable things like infinite fuel, hack gravity etc which would be cheating in a challenge, but even from a set of pictures it\u0027s not hard to tell when someone has infinite fuel on. Tweaks to the aero model will be much harder to spot and could mean the difference between completing a challenge or not. \n\nSo what I propose is that if you do make a change to any of the physics related settings and anything else that effects game-play, but **not** things like toggling aero-forces markers, entry heat bars etc, then a little icon should appear in the corner of the screen. The icon will be an indicator to challenge judges that the physics settings are not stock and (as a useful feature for the user) clicking the icon will restore settings to default.

So each craft could actually have it\u0027s own set of physics rules. If you go to launch a craft and it has different physics settings then it should popup a message saying \u0022this craft would like to make the following changes to physics.....Do you want to accept these changes?\u0022. That way folk can still share craft that require different physics rules without having to laboriously document all their changes and if you do download a craft with altered physics you can either choose to use it\u0027s physics settings or carry on with how you have it set (stock or otherwise).\n\n(and if craft files did contain physics setting info, I\u0027d make that info available on craft pages on KerbalX.com)"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T09:39:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I am advocating that the aero and space flight physics FRAMEWORK should be consistent.\n\nAbsolutely, I think everyone can agree with this.

Some people want to build only planes and others want to build rockets. For example I would lose interest in SSTO -phase. I like to do something like mankind\u0027s current and near future space exploration. Plan missions with very tight dv budgets and build huge staged rockets to lift manned and unmanned probes to destinations. Piloting is not so fun. More piloting intensive SSTO phase would be too routine business after building of working plane. And somebody else thinks visa versa.\n\nLarger problem is SQUADs tendency to make physical things too easy. Current dv to orbit is too low relative to ISPs of engines because it does not need real staging. Deadly re-entry effects are ridiculously weak. Re-entry should be hard and dangerous thing which needs planning and compromises. It is OK, if they retain possibility to change things through modding or editing files.\n\nIt seems that SQUAD have intended their game to versatile audience through relatively free modding of everything. In that sense I would say, that they should not lock physical parameters from modders and maybe they can also give straight control to parameters through debug menu.
