During the beta days I had no problems with restarting and letting my saves go because it was understood to me that it was a developing game in its beta stage, things are going to be tweaked. Since its official release I just want to sit down and have a long, proper and thorough playthrough. Unfortunately this isn\u0027t possible because the development of the aerodynamics is schizophrenic and indecisive, with changes not only dramatically affecting craft design, but also massively changing flight profiles each time (at least in the case for SSTOs and small rockets).\n\nThis comes from a guy who had no problems migrating/adapting to FAR and DRE in 0.9, but I feel the (v1.0\u002B) stock aero is the middle child; It\u0027s not as forgiving/fun/wacky as the 0.9 aero, but it\u0027s neither realistic like FAR. 1.02 keeps the low altitude soupyness of 0.9 while not effectively voxelizing crafts like in FAR. \n\nWith every update 1.0, 1.01, 1.02, I have to be put back through kindergarten again because the aero behaves differently each time. It discourages me from investing any amount of time in this game at the moment because of potential updates around the corner that will put me back at square one before I even get halfway through with the game. So mastering 1.02 may still mean that you\u0027ve wasted your time if 1.03 rolls around changing everything yet again. At the moment I have to put the game down until SQUAD **decides permanently** what sort of atmosphere they want.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T04:29:04Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 04:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Levelord**"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T04:56:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 1.02 keeps the low altitude soupyness of 0.9\n\n[https://vid.me/EKbm](https://vid.me/EKbm) \n\nI think anybody who has this weird idea that 1.0.2 somehow reintroduced the \u0022soupmosphere\u0022 needs to actually play 1.0.2.
