The ONLY reason a space plane becomes useful is when you can carry a payload with it into orbit. When you cannot carry a payload into orbit with a craft it is functionally useless. This is not just useless to me, but to all concerned. So, to say it again: Squad really does need to give the MK 3 cargo bays with the new MK 3 plane parts or not bother at all. Oh, and to FURTHER quash your statement that it is only useless to ME, space plane parts to me, seeing as the planes I make fly about as well as the Spruce Goose after a termite attack, they are ALL useless unless I make something like Das Valdez did with his Majesty class ship.

That is a step in the wrong direction is what that is. It would be akin to you going to an eatery of your choice, and one day getting a meal with say, a large beverage, then going back say, a week later, getting that SAME meal, only this time, they say, sorry, you get a SMALL beverage. See, to me, that is not cool. What ever DOES happen will happen, and nothing YOU or I or ANYONE can say here on this thread or any like it, will change that. BUT, and here is the key, I do not now, nor in any post prior or future, require you to agree with me on this or anything. Just see my point, that is all I can ask, all I can hope for. I however would LOVE some clarity from the devs on this, as, I feel like we are starting to go in circles, kinda like an ourorboros. Look, I THINK they should hold off the MK3 styled SPP parts until they can give us matching cargo bays, YOU think: let them give us what they got now. We have differing idiologies sure enough, and we are in different camps. Lets part now and meet back when they give us the update or preferably MORE information on what it is that we are IN FACT getting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T07:16:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith a bit of patience we will see all the shiny Mk.
