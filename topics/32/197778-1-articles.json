Unfortunately it causes a problem where they get stuck in the game. Because of external things that the youtubers left out of their videos or mission choices that might not be actually the best or the use of mods. People sometimes ask for my help with KSP crafts and I can tell you a lot of the things that the troubling crafts all have in common is that they have a trait in the style of a youtuber.\u00A0 One time there was this person who didn\u0027t understand how to make an Eve lander and basically just copied Matt\u0027s design, made a few tweaks, and try to fly it thinking that since they built it they can fly it successfully. Now, if you ever have done an Eve Crew mission you would know that you would have to fly the craft in such a way to make it successful and your piloting skills are what matters at the end of the day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is that without the creativity you can\u0027t learn rocket science or discover new ways to make a mission better. It\u0027s how the skilled ksp players are made. When you find your own style. the bigger problem is that while the producers of the content have gone through the\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Edesign loop\u003C/strong\u003E, the people building on top of it didn\u0027t. Causing frustration of \u0022it should work because [insert name here] made it work.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbably the worst thing that comes out of this is that they don\u0027t build on personal experience and feed on others. Causing some questions that could have been answered just if they tested it, they would have found out. Most of the stuff I learned came from experiments I made and little tests. I cannot stress enough \u003Cstrong\u003Et\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehe best learning system is the testing system\u003C/strong\u003E.

However when it comes to relying on youtubers for info on how to play the game that entire problem is a failure in KSP itself, it has nothing to do with the youtubers. There\u0027s good reason that KSP2 will have a smart help system to ensure this doesn\u0027t happen again, I was very happy to find out the devs had arrived at the same solution I did: the game understands what\u0027s currently happening and tries to guide the player with only the thing they\u0027re currently trying to accomplish - instead of wrapping things up in long and boring tutorials stuck \u0022outside\u0022 in the main menu, the game will try to only \u0022spoil\u0022 a single thing that a player gets stuck on to get them moving again and encourage the player to overcome as many things as possible on their own. I really can\u0027t see the point of getting into the good and bad of KSP1 youtubers, I\u0027ve been following Matt Lowne for years and I feel sorry for him having to repeatedly try to appease viewers who don\u0027t even understand how to do the most basic things in the game while he still tries to keep us long time followers entertained by doing something more creative than super basic almost tutorial level historic mission replicas we\u0027re sick and tired of seeing over and over. As for which youtuber becomes popular or not that is also not something that can be blamed on them, some players have a certain personality and make a certain type of content and that appeals to a certain type of viewer, nobody should ever get to just go and bash another youtuber for having \u0022lower quality but more views\u0022 - if a video just isn\u0027t getting popular despite \u0022quality\u0022 then it just isn\u0027t reaching the target audience that actually wants that exact type of quality, or that audience is simply much smaller.\u00A0Many of the biggest youtubers in the world produce absolute garbage but they manage to *entertain* and that\u0027s all they need to accomplish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-29T05:45:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThread closed by \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
