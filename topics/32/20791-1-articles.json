I\u0027ve played KSP for around 3 months, and I never made it to the Mun. About a week ago, I finally had a craft capable of getting to the Mun. I fully understand how to get to planets now, and I haven\u0027t ever landed properly in the scenarios, so it was a huge accomplishment when I was able to fix the problem of my lander toppling over, though nothing was damaged. All the Youtube vids came to my head, and I did the Landing gear trick and flipped my craft into the air, being able to reland, perfectly. Bill stepped off the One-man capsule and had a great time using up all his Jetpack fuel looking for stuff, though nothing interesting was found in the huge crater. I don\u0027t have enough fuel to get back, so I think my next mission will be a rescue by Bob and Jeb.
