Now everything was going fine, I landed perfectly and my little Kerbal stepped out to greet the white ice with a smile on his face. When he hit the ground though things got weird, the screen went black and the altitude went racing up until all the numbers were six! I had to relog onto the game, and on my return my Kerbal was dead and my lander was out past Minmus...in pieces...going 21,000 m/s away from the planet.
