Devs said they want reentry to be possible without heatshield from LKO if done with the correct profile. \n\nIMO, balancing reentry is more about balancing part heat tolerance and heat system than aero, having in mind not real life performance or tolerances, but the final result and gameplay they want (heatshields needed for hard aerobraking or steep reentry profiles).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Scott Manley pointed out something that was going to affect **gameplay**.

That problem is still there.\n\nThe bit about how much drag parts face is mostly just whining (since partdatabase is generated by the game instead of being fixed values). The real problem is that KSP\u0027s parts aren\u0027t calculated for a given atmosphere and hence squad gets weirdness when trying to convert to an actual aero.\n\nSee, those generated values take a look at the model to create a simplistic cubic representation and apply further drag tweaks from the part.cfg; but since KSP only modeled LIKE something, instead of calculated it, introducing realistic drag creates chaos. ***The pods being designed LIKE real pods***, but not calculated to fall at a specific terminal velocity hence requiring a specific mass / cross-sectional-area ratio... don\u0027t fall right. ***The nose cones being designed LIKE nose cones***, but not with a specific differential-cross-sectional-area in mind to help obtain a specific speed, don\u0027t operate correctly.\n\nSquad\u0027s tweaking of aero rather than fixing parts is exasperating problems that the \u0022rule of cool\u0022 created.\n\n\\*To explain a little more directly. Pods are a combination of a nose-cone and a flat surface. Due to the pods being designed \u0022like but not actually\u0022 you have to make certain the flat surface has enough drag to slow down to a specific terminal velocity while the \u0022nose\u0022 cuts likely more arbitrary bit of drag. These tweaks are likely done in code and create \u0022weirdness\u0022 like noses not losing enough drag in order to get more drag to the pod\u0027s base and sides.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T01:38:45Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 01:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fel**"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T01:32:18Z","Content":"Mu singles out Scott in his comments, but he also said \u0022a lot of the streamers.\u0022 The un-named others probably weren\u0027t explaining their difficulties, as well as Scott did. \n\n[Twitch video archive, available here (link)](http://www.twitch.tv/ksptv/v/4795515).
