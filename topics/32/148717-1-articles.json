Your kerbals are the most valuable part of your space program so it\u0027s best to keep them safe.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMake a standardized series of lifters for various payload masses, test them until you can be sure that they\u0027re reliable (ideally using cheap, uncrewed payloads for the test launches), and then save them as subassemblies. This way you can be reasonably confident that your launches are going to work.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nActually, test everything that is going to be crewed. The main reason space programs in real life are so expensive is because all the technology has to be tested extensively before it can be used for the actual mission. Test all of your crewed technology (within funding constraints of course).\u00A0For a Mun or Minmus mission you\u0027re probably going to be fine (assuming you\u0027re quite experienced), but for something like a Jool 5 mission (for example) you should definitely test your major landers before sending crew in them, because the last thing you want is to crash into the surface of Tylo at 500m/s\u00A0because your descent module ran out of fuel. You should also test your launch escape systems on launch vehicles before attempting a crewed launch.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFinally, it\u0027s very helpful to have probe cores on everything.
