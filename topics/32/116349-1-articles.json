Having it be level would be nice, but I think it\u0027s less important than smooth, flat, and large. You can scout out large islands in map view, and probably send an airbreathing scout jet to get a closer look. After you\u0027ve picked a location for a base, next mission would be to send a stationary mining\u002Brefining rig, and a rover with fuel tanks and a claw to transfer the fuel. Make sure the mining rig can house a Kerbal; skilled engineers can really speed the whole process up. Then I would send a SSTO fuel tanker airplane so that you can send fuel up to orbit. Next, an orbital fuel station to hold all this delicious fuel and make it easy to get to. Lastly, I\u0027d send a science lab just because, and anything else you think you\u0027d might want. If you don\u0027t want to spend huge amounts of Space-o\u0027s building rockets to transfer out to Jool, you could make a nuclear-powered tug that flies back \u0022empty\u0022, picks up the next base module, and flies out to Jool after refueling."},{"CreatedByName":"colmo","CreatedById":25950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T21:50:42Z","Content":"Kerbal Konstructs allows the placement of runways and buildings in-game.

Make airstrip from large plates, or rectangular wing segments. Airplane on Laythe will need somewhat ~100 meters of runway to make easy landing. It is well within VAB building space.

A flat stretch of land that\u0027s as long as you\u0027re willing to look for, preferably near the equator, though if you don\u0027t want to spend ages searching there are the ice caps. As mentioned it\u0027s OK if it has an overall slope as long as there aren\u0027t lots of small bumps. Then I\u0027d mark that out with some simple, low-part-count markers. Probe core, light, RTG, that\u0027s it.\n\nThen place some infrastructure nearby, but watch the part count.
