Especially for a ground base. The orbital station ones are okay if you\u0027re going there anyway. You just have to dock for a few seconds, then move on your way. In your situation, think I\u0027d check my quicksaves and either do it again or scrap the whole thing. If you go for it, you\u0027ll need to be prepared, though. Even if you land next to your base, you\u0027ll still need wheels on the module, or a rover to maneuver it around to get connected (barring mods, of course).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhatever you end up doing, a quick piece of advice that won\u0027t really help right now, but certainly will in the future; whenever they ask for a facility supporting a certain number of Kerbals, you don\u0027t actually need that many Kerbals. You don\u0027t need any at all, in fact. If you have a cupola and a hitcher, than that supports 5 Kerbals. Put a probecore on it and connect it and you\u0027ll complete the contract. The key to contracts like that is to give them the absolute bare minimum that they ask for. That way you maximize your profits. And, of course, stacking contracts whenever possible is always helpful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-20T16:56:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223222209\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022167640\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221511008943\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022174016\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zeiss Ikon\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 11/18/2017 at 4:42 AM, Zeiss Ikon said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMight be because it really came about in relation to Asteroid Day, which was originally a mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo. The claw came around \u003Cs\u003Ebetween 0.23\u00A0and 0.24\u003C/s\u003E in 0.23.5 with the SLS parts, the ARM update, \u003Cs\u003E(can\u0027t remember, so long ago) \u003C/s\u003Eand was always part of the base game.
