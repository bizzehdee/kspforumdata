The first stage is reaching a feature complete stage, then you have to get rid of all the remaining bugs and polish up the design for final release (and eliminate bugs created in the process of polishing it up.) In it\u0027s current state, KSP still is not feature complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally once a piece of software is feature complete, major release version go a lot faster. I\u0027m not sure if you followed the Mozilla project, and how they went from a release every 6-12 months to a release every month when they went from alpha state to beta state. This is generally the case with all software. There are of course a lot of minor revisions in the development branch when a piece of software isn\u0027t feature complete, but they tend not to be released for public use because new features mean new bugs, and thus they require testing first\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll 0.19 means is that there have been 19 major releases.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-20T18:14:43Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2013 06:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Ruedii\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadd more details.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T20:39:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are different conventions but in most cases don\u0027t even try to see it as a decimal number;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne good convention which a lot of people follow is well documented here \u003Ca href=\u0022http://semver.org/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://semver.org/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebasically the numbers are MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Major version X (X.y.z | X \u0026gt; 0) MUST be incremented if any backwards incompatible changes are introduced to the public API.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Minor version Y (x.Y.z | x \u0026gt; 0) MUST be incremented if new, backwards compatible functionality is introduced to the public API\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Patch version Z (x.y.Z | x \u0026gt; 0) MUST be incremented if only backwards compatible bug fixes are introduced. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut I don\u0027t think Squad is following that convention, they like many developers are prob. following their own in house system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nats","CreatedById":58316,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T20:55:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the only thing that reflects the amount of development this game has got to come is the fact its being labelled as still being in Alpha stage which means its not yet \u0027feature complete\u0027.
