After bringing the intersect down to 1.1km, I noticed I could actually see the station and that I wasn\u0027t moving that fast relative to it. So, after some course corrections using the rockets, I was 20m away from my equivalent of the Skylab/Tiangong/Salyut/Whatever the heck ya wanna call it. Anyway, I activated RCS, toggled the docking port and moved in on one of it\u0027s 5 docking ports. It was actually easier than I thought; I simply pushed the SSTO\u0027s port into the port of the station and BAM! First docking complete!
