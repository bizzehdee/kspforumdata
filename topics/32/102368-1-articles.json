Another one I quite like is \u0022**hardware assisted landing**\u0022. And in a similarly themed old thread I found a couple. \u0022**Chokingbird**\u0022 = an SSTO spaceplane flaming out in high atmo. \u0022**Wet noodle**, a dangerously floppy rocket. \u0022**Literally get out and push**\u0022, which isn\u0027t really a slang term but is fun all the same.\n\nI was going to add lithobraking to the list, as a kind of accompaniment to HSL, but then I realized that lithobraking IS something real space programs use. Kraken is also kind of like our way of saying \u0022gremlins in the engine\u0022. So yeah, what other fun terms has the community thought up? Or... what humorous real world slang do space programs use that feel appropriately kerbal.\n\nEDIT:\n\nCorrected typo.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-21T03:27:57Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2015 03:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PTNLemay**"},{"CreatedByName":"federicoaa","CreatedById":94879,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T03:22:37Z","Content":"I think is lithobraking, from brake, not break ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"PTNLemay","CreatedById":30142,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T03:27:06Z","Content":"You are indeed correct... edited."},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T04:44:23Z","Content":"Huh!
