I didn\u0027t really need it (at all), but I wanted to play with the new features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I thought it did: Takes 40 reputation or your commitment equivalent every time you launch your ship\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I did not realize it does: Every single R\u0026amp;D purchase counts as a discount event.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had just come back from a long Duna mission and had 3,300 science to spend so I went to town purchasing all my unlocks (Hard mode). When I went to launch my next ship, I saw that my bar went from NEARLY FULL BLUE to NEARLY FULL RED. Instantly, just like that. Luckily, I had a quick save just before my Duna ship came back (I modified Hard mode to allow quick loads for game crash events and unforeseen events such as these).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy repeating, I was able to verify it is indeed the R\u0026amp;D purchases that completely destroyed my reputation. What is worse, is that the reputation bar DOES NOT UPDATE while you are in the science building, so you cannot see that you are bleeding rep like crazy while buying your unlocks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion this needs to be changed. With how the science unlock mechanic works, this strategy is completely useless unless the rep loss is removed from R\u0026amp;D purchases.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T15:36:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t even realize at first that it was \u003Cem\u003Eevery time I spent money!!\u003C/em\u003E RIP .25 hard-mode career attempt 1.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cmdr.

It also renders any Reputation-to-X option completely and utterly valueless, since you\u0027ll have to basically spend all of your reputation to sacrifice all future reputation... which you will then be unable to recover because all reputation will be converted into something else. For science and funds, that\u0027s no big deal, but for reputation, the only way to get high-reputation-rewarding contracts... is to have high reputation.

Strategies are for helping you achieve long-term goals and should only be changed once you\u0027ve met those goals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, a big income is always vital but you only need science while you still have parts to unlock. Rep just affects the rewards of contracts; otherwise is there to convert to science and/or cash. So early in the game, you might want to convert rep into money and/or science. But once you\u0027ve got the tree unlocked, you should change to convert science into cash and/or rep. At each stage, whether you do 1 or the other conversions or both, and your commitment levels, will depend on your playstyle, difficulty settings, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I find early on that converting 50% of my rep, in the form of 30-40% to science and 10-20% to cash keeps me comfortably in the black and noticeably speeds research, while still letting my rep grow enough to make contracts worth doing. Once the tree\u0027s unlocked, I switch to strategies that convert about 80% of my science to cash and rep (usually 30-50 ratio) until such times as my rep is maxed out, then I leave rep alone and convert 80% of science to cash. I keep a 20% science nestegg just in case I get a new mod that has higher tech trees.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T13:13:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI used it a lot once I unlocked the parts I wanted to do my first couple of landings on minmus.
