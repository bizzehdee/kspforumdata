This is spot on. I think that recently, they have been forgetting why people like KSP (and full disclosure, I wasn\u0027t around here until .23, but I like KSP for the same reasons that everyone else does) and acting like \u0022fun\u0022 and more realism are mutually exclusive. They aren\u0027t. I think that most of the community would like having the game be very realistic, more so than it is now. I\u0027m not saying include RSS or RO in the game, but players shouldn\u0027t have to install mods to get \u003Cem\u003Ebasic realism features\u003C/em\u003E like life support, proper aerodynamics, or reentry heat damage (for example, there are obviously many more). Yes, they would make the game harder, but not in any way different than having a proper physics simulation in space does. And I agree, this added difficulty would make the game more rewarding. If people don\u0027t like some new realism feature (and there will definitely be people who won\u0027t like more realism, that\u0027s kind of unavoidable), mods can take it back out. I think that it is better having the base game realistic (to a degree) and then letting people mod it into either something similar to what it is now, or into a total hardcore RSS and RO game (or some middle ground that is more middle ground-ish than what ideally we would have with the base game). Oh, and on the topic of the thead, yes, if when the aerodynamics model is done (\u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E did they not bring in ferram4??? It would have made their jobs easier and given people an aerodynamics model that was either \u003Cem\u003Ealready accepted \u003C/em\u003Eby the community, or an aerodynamics model that was made by someone who\u0027s skill is not doubted by the community. Win-win-win. More time to spend on other features, better aerodynamics, happier community) it is backwards compatible with old designs, great. But don\u0027t let that influence the quality of the model.

Just look at the rest of the game as it already is. Within reason, space flight works like it should. It\u0027s realistic. It\u0027s physics. Does this prove difficult for new players? Sure. Does it prevent you from flying around the solar system willy nilly? Yep. But that has never stopped people from having fun.

Yes. But it\u0027s already in a state that people dislike, and those people have gotten along just fine with mods. Mods are one of KSP\u0027s brightest jewels. They support all kinds of functionality that most players don\u0027t care for. If you want unrealistic aerodynamics, \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u0027s totally okay\u003C/em\u003E!
