From the launch pad, is the whole kerbal solar system 1 large single scene with a LOD system on top of it? Or do we have seemless scene transitions between the surface of individual bodies, and then space being its own scene?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, its a curiosity, would be interesting to know how it works and how its managed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
