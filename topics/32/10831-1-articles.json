As I had plenty of fuel, I made a very slow descent, and landed at under 1m/s (Approximately 0.4m/s). However, even this landing speed was apparently too much for the attachment points we have in this game, and three of my outer engines broke off on landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems to me that this is just a tad too weak...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T20:32:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve had better luck landing on engines when I have struts going from somewhere above down to the engine bell, it seems to help, but I haven\\\u0027t tested this on Min yet, just Mun and Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sting_auer","CreatedById":11073,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T20:48:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\\\u0027t seem to be taking the mass of the vehicle into account.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven at really, really slow speeds like that, your ships still takes a lot of force when the impact because it has so much mass and inertia.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T20:58:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIts always been a problem with the larger engines, the small engine is much more robust and is also just small enough for lander legs to work, which is what you are supposed to use for landing! You dont need large engines for landing on the M\u00C3\u00BCn, but you do need them for lifting off from Kerbin, how you reconcile these two truths is your business. ;D\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
