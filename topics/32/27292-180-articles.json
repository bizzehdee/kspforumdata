It went to the Mun under full working load and established rough equatorial orbit then dropped the lander onto a spot I thought I hadn\u0027t been yet. Turns out that I had, and I had some extra fuel (in the Storm, not the lander) so I made a rendezvous and refilled the lander\u0027s tanks then took the whole thing to an orbit maybe 20 degrees off the poles. I was then able to set the lander down in a nice big crater that I knew for sure I hadn\u0027t been to, and make the trip worthwhile by bringing home some science. Good thing I remembered to get the data back to the cockpit via EVA because I spent too much time on the surface playing around with the lander and had to jettison the main tanks and go to the \u0022oh crap\u0022 stage, which didn\u0027t have RCS. So it\u0027s a good thing I took the docking bot with me because I had to retrieve the command pod and bring it back to the Storm.

So now I have it\u0027s successor which hasn\u0027t been properly named yet (it\u0027s operating under the name KSS Storm MK II at the moment). Its core went up in one piece and weighs in at just over 70 tons which as it turns out is right around where my current lifter maxes out with a couple modifications to accommodate the new ship\u0027s long engines, and I had to burn the nukes a bit to finish circularizing. The main differences in this ship are removal of one large fuel tank (just plain not needed for what I\u0027m using it for at the moment), a hitchhiker container, and better looks IMO. Its maiden voyage will be to bring a tractor rover to the Mun to be dropped for my future base there. It was also supposed to take the first two base modules as well, a hitchhiker and a fuel tank for the rover that can be seen in the background, but due to technical oversights on the size of docking port used on the side tanks it will have to come back for them and tow them like the rover instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReady for action\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2014-01-0720-56-44-18.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2014-01-0720-56-44-18.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see from the picture above (if you remember my others, at least) there was a slight mishap at my tanker station.

Got the 360 unit fuel tank down alright (5.1t, this is the one I was worried about). Then I go to bring down the living quarters (4.6t) and everything is going fine until the last, I dunno, 50m? It was so close but it was like the Mun just decided to suck the whole ship down at the last second and I couldn\u0027t overpower the gravity for some reason. Hit the ground somewhere around 20-30m/s at full throttle, after being at ~5m/s just seconds earlier. Kirbus, the pilot, survived with only minor damage to his lander but Kurt was in the hitchhiker container which vaporized on impact. The only way I can even rationalize this is if Kurt weighed about a ton. I did the exact same thing each time: Drop off, rendezvous with transfer ship and top off the tanks, head back. I can\u0027t even blame the Kraken for this one, I thought it was a glitch so I tried again two more times with similar results and then just accepted it.

Sounds pretty complicated but i am just having problems getting enough delta V to get the station up there, i think i will probable build it modularly so i can make it in space rather than send it all up at once. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"oggylt","CreatedById":57214,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T17:44:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI invented (well.., I never saw them i bet someone already did that) my own launch claps, since engines kept breaking off, So i am proud of this one \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/F3Vzj0H.png\u0022 alt=\u0022F3Vzj0H.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/E16ugAY.png\u0022 alt=\u0022E16ugAY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zimmy99","CreatedById":97203,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T22:21:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdded the pod from the habitat pack to my minmus space station \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.

I found out the living quarters were unbalanced which apparently didn\u0027t make much difference until I was closer to the Mun. So I quickly redesigned it and sent it out on a one-way transfer probe PLUS a slightly redesigned \u0022Mun Dropper\u0022 with extra torque for those larger slightly unbalanced modules. This one went down so smoothly I thought something was wrong. So now I have two almost identical sky cranes at the Mun, one on the surface (at the moment) and one docked to the Storm in orbit. If I have enough fuel left over I\u0027m gonna just leave one there, probably the less controllable one since it would only be used to escape to a transfer ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2014-01-0823-32-41-18.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2014-01-0823-32-41-18.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking this crap together was easier than it was on Kerbin.
