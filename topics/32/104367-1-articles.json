Aaaaaand.. it appears that they will not separate as halves or quarters but like this instead:\n\n ![c4Jub1i.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/c4Jub1i.jpg)\n\nNow, I am shocked by this. Considering that this is not how fairings release at all IRL. Also nobody who spent time and effort making stock part fairings has ever made them release this way.. And nor has any mod had fairings release like this.\n\n If this is true it is a terrible decision by Squad. They need to tell us if this is the case or not.\n\n I for one cannot believe they could make something so crappy. \n\nDoes anyone have any new info on this??\n\nMJ"},{"CreatedByName":"Torham234","CreatedById":58574,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T10:21:54Z","Content":"I think I remember them mentioning you can choose and select at which seam the fairings fall apart.

Fairing *panels* aren\u0027t independent parts, they\u0027re sub-objects of the fairing until you deploy them. A fairing that is 10 sections high and divided into 4 sides would have 40 panels, yes. How many objects this will produce on deployment depends on how they group together (that\u0027s next up on my to-do list actually).\n\u003E As for how the broken-off bits behave after deployment, they are handled as solar panel pieces or engine fairings.
