First, the orbital plane of most hot Jupiters have a very large tilt when compared to the rotation of their star, and half of those are actually retrograde orbits. But, they are also tidally locked. It seems that planets in KSP always rotate in the same direction, so when I give it a retrograde orbit, it rotates regardless of whether the tidal locking flag is true. I decided that it was more important to be tidally locked than have a retrograde orbit (which doesn\u0027t really make sense anyway), so it has a conventional orbit. Anyone know how, in Kopernicus, to reverse the direction of spin?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other problem is that the moment a spacecraft touches the atmosphere, this happens:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/vM6tcS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm1.staticflickr.com/424/19544655668_dfd9804f8b_z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002219544655668_dfd9804f8b_z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything instantly overheats and explodes!

Yes it\u0027s overkill for a Mun lander, but I play science sandbox so I can design my own missions and build whatever I want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP%202015-07-14%2001-20-23-42.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP%202015-07-14%2001-20-23-42.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I cobbled together a crappy rocket rover (looked very similar to the one I posted a few pages back, unfortunately for me) and sent it off in a funkified looking custom rocket with an inverted fairing (courtesy of Procedural Fairings). It was a case of the right tool for the job and a little bat-crap craziness. The idea was to land it upright on its three engines, then use the RCS to slowly tip it over on its side so the rover could drop straight down a few feet onto its wheels. It worked beautifully but I don\u0027t have a shot of this particular rover being released:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP%202015-07-14%2017-38-08-90.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP%202015-07-14%2017-38-08-90.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t seem to have a pic of the rover itself either because it was short lived, I took it for a spin outside of the crater I was hanging around in and crashed it. Actually, I crashed it several times if you count the quicksaves but the first few times were because I was trying to fly it to my destination and land on the wheels, which I\u0027ve done successfully with other designs like my second one. I let the last crash stand because it was pure chance / destiny and I\u0027m trying to cut back on the quickloads to roleplay through the disasters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I sent a second one, to get myself back to my ship since I was somewhere around 60km away when I crashed! This one was based off my old designs that actually did pretty darn well for the tech level involved during the first few Mun landings of a new save. But I crashed the lifter that brought it there due to a screw up on my part... I had the navigation assist set to hold retrograde but I burned too long and started going back up so it started flipping slowly end over end, I panicked and by the time I had something resembling control over it I was too close to the surface. Luck was on my side; not only had I had left the fairing on until landing, but it crashed on the correct side for release. The fairing and the rover survived unharmed so I just shrugged it off since cautiously tipping over the whole thing was one less step I had to do at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdited to add: I almost forgot -- my luck continued because oddly enough, the landing site for the second rover was close to... without going into detail, a certain point of interest on the surface that I was planning to send a more advanced ScanSat to find later. I was able to spot it on the descent and visit it in the new rover to plant a flag. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP%202015-07-15%2001-49-36-06.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP%202015-07-15%2001-49-36-06.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter getting back to my ship I decided I had enough fuel to hop over to another crater and do some surveying. Only problem is I was low on fuel in the main landing stage (it was only \u003Cem\u003Edesigned\u003C/em\u003E to land once, and carried extra fuel for any precision maneuvering I wanted to do afterwards). So I took off and dropped the three outer tanks, and managed to land in close enough to a flat spot for the SAS to hold still sitting on the engine while I hopped out and grabbed a soil sample. Then it was time to blast off again, I managed to burn up the rest of the fuel in that tank somehow by the time I was on an escape trajectory from Mun. So I was left with the final stage and only a little maneuvering to do to get back home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP%202015-07-15%2015-50-53-91.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP%202015-07-15%2015-50-53-91.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt actually went better than planned since I was able to make the third biome stop before heading home. I was really nervous about coming back home because this design was largely untested in the first place and I was counting on doing a few passes of aerobraking to burn off my excess speed and not become a giant ball of melted steel on the ground. I had wanted to put a heat shield below this last engine that \u0022could\u0022 be jettisoned if the need arose, because I never planned on actually using the final stage anyway, but I didn\u0027t for some reason. I also decided to not decouple the last tank and expose the heat shield I did have, because I thought I might try to change my trajectory after the first couple passes. But not being sure of the atmosphere in 1.0\u002B, I dipped lower than I probably should have and everything miraculously turned out okay. There was no other pass, my apo lowered and lowered until finally I was hitting dirt one way or the other. I seemed to be red hot in the 15-30km range for ages biting my nails. Some of my external components got close to overheating and the solar panels didn\u0027t make it since apparently you can\u0027t retract that type anymore. After I finally threw my chute I breathed a sigh of relief and decoupled the last tank, touching down softly in the grasslands. The pilot got a stern slap on the wrist for crashing the first rover and holding up the mission, but it was soon forgotten once the new science data started to pour in.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-16T05:31:00Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2015 05:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Duke23\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elowiny","CreatedById":117659,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T07:19:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JetJaguar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JetJaguar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI decided to try my hand at planet-making with Kopernicus.

It\u0027s a little less than half the mass of Jool, but because of the heat of the Sun, it\u0027s puffed up to a 50% larger diameter. The texture is something I came up with by playing around with noise in Gimp. The black clouds are because hot Jupiters are expected to be as black as coal from sodium vapor in their atmospheres. The big yellow spot is because Kepler 7b has been found to have a reflective surface tidally locked to it\u0027s star, likely due to clouds made of vaporized iron and silicates (i.e. rocks). I didn\u0027t know what color that would be, so I guessed.

First, the orbital plane of most hot Jupiters have a very large tilt when compared to the rotation of their star, and half of those are actually retrograde orbits. But, they are also tidally locked. It seems that planets in KSP always rotate in the same direction, so when I give it a retrograde orbit, it rotates regardless of whether the tidal locking flag is true. I decided that it was more important to be tidally locked than have a retrograde orbit (which doesn\u0027t really make sense anyway), so it has a conventional orbit. Anyone know how, in Kopernicus, to reverse the direction of spin?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other problem is that the moment a spacecraft touches the atmosphere, this happens:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://farm1.staticflickr.com/424/19544655668_dfd9804f8b_z.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://farm1.staticflickr.com/424/19544655668_dfd9804f8b_z.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything instantly overheats and explodes!

I\u0027m no artist, but I\u0027m happy with how it came out. It looks like a demonic eyeball, always staring at the Sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve run into a couple of problems. First, the orbital plane of most hot Jupiters have a very large tilt when compared to the rotation of their star, and half of those are actually retrograde orbits. But, they are also tidally locked. It seems that planets in KSP always rotate in the same direction, so when I give it a retrograde orbit, it rotates regardless of whether the tidal locking flag is true. I decided that it was more important to be tidally locked than have a retrograde orbit (which doesn\u0027t really make sense anyway), so it has a conventional orbit. Anyone know how, in Kopernicus, to reverse the direction of spin?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other problem is that the moment a spacecraft touches the atmosphere, this happens:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://farm1.staticflickr.com/424/19544655668_dfd9804f8b_z.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://farm1.staticflickr.com/424/19544655668_dfd9804f8b_z.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything instantly overheats and explodes! I think the answer lies in the temperature and pressure curves, but I don\u0027t understand how those work and I haven\u0027t found any decent documentation for that yet (suggestions?). Then again, it\u0027s so close to the Sun that vehicles in orbit are already a toasty 900\u002B K.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably an easy way to have it be tidally locked if the \u0027tidallock=true\u0027 isn\u0027t cooperating is to have the rotation speed be the same as it\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
