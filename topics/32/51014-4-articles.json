Basically figure out what you want it to look like and what it\u0027s primary purpose is. After that try to find good places to split it up where size and weight won\u0027t be an issue. (Important part): Find a lifter and interplanetary drive system that works and base your station design criteria on that. Then you know it will get to orbit and get to the other planet, you just need to make sure it doesn\u0027t fall apart before that. Then decide on an altitude and off you go.

You are going to have to either watch the altimeter and the navball like a hawk or just stay in map view a lot. Your first flight should be the shakedown. Don\u0027t expect to go to space that day. you are going to want to fly as high as you can with a very small angle of attack. Your job is to figure out when flame out is going to occur. After you figure it out, you need to plan to be almost level about 1000-2000 meters under that if possible but still behind the apoapsis of the arc. Basically you are going to want to park there and build up speed, all the while just barely increasing your altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of three things can happen depending on the design of your ship. You will either break escape velocity (always good) and the apoapsis will go higher while you are staying level. You will flame out, or you will run out of jet fuel. For each of these there is a solution and you can very easily still go to space. Here is how I\u0027ve found to best handle each issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReaching Escape Velocity: My favorite. Basically lift your nose to about 10 or 15 degrees on the navball and start slowly throttling down your jet engine. It seems counter intuitive but you can prevent flame outs and still use all that lovely DeltaV the jets make if you turn them down. Usually past 30k you want the thrust to be roughly 75-80%. past 35k and you want to be around 35-45% thrust. When you finally see the tell tale sign of imminent burnout (the plane lurches to one side slightly) very quickly toggle to your rocket engine and shutdown the jets and close the air intakes. It\u0027s totally possible to get a 70km or more orbit just by jet power alone. After the burnout and switch to rockets it\u0027s more or less using the rockets as maintenance to maintain the apoapsis until you are high enough out of the atmosphere that drag is no longer a concern.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlame Out: Don\u0027t panic. If you flame out hard and you start to spin throttle down and toggle to your rockets. If you can accomplish this before your space plane has totally slipped around you are doing awesome. Try to reorient yourself so you are facing forward, toggle the jet engines back to on and slowly begin throttle up. Just be gentle with it and you should be able to recover and still go to space...albeit you may need to grab some wet wipes if your kerbal was eating sammiches at the time. If you do end up starting into an uncontrollable spin, all is not lost. If you are having difficulty regaining control of your plane you may need to drop altitude and speed. If you packed enough fuel you may be able to make a second attempt, just try to remember the circumstances of the flame out. Was the angle of attack high, was I at full throttle, what was my altitude, and what did my air intake readout state. Use that data and try to skirt the edge of that flame out condition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunning out of Go Juice: Moar FUEL!! No seriously, if you are running out of fuel then you may need to either change your orbital ascent profile, or alter the design of your ship to accommodate more go juice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a final thought. The more air intakes you have, the happier you will be.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aven17","CreatedById":67014,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-30T21:05:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPowered landings.
