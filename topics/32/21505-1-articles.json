I\u0027ve tried using the \u0027natural\u0027 setting with ISA MapSat but I\u0027d very much like the actual textures. I have the ones from Kerbin, the Mun and Minmus (from the wiki pages) but they\u0027re the only ones there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CkGordon","CreatedById":51332,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-06T16:49:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could try getting the grayscale with MapSat and artificially coloring it in photoshop or a similar program. That\u0027s what NASA used to do. Not sure if there\u0027s a way to just extract the texture from the game tho. Maybe try asking whoever put the textures on the wiki or try the kerbin geographical society or whatever its called here on the forums they\u0027d probably know. Good luck and I look forward to seeing your results! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
