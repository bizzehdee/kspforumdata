This is not that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI performed a test a moment ago that required low speed and very low altitude, so it was very inexpensive. Because of this, I also tried something for my own amusement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe test was to activate ([run test] worked so I didn\u0027t need to do it through staging] the Hammer SRB in a specific altitude and speed bracket. So I went Mk1 command pod, Hammer SRB (removed all fuel in the VAB of course), decoupler, smallest first tier liquid fuel tank, and Reliant engine, and of course topped off with a parachute. Now the EXTRA that I did for my own purposes was to attach a radial chute to the fuel tank \u002B engine assembly, to deploy at the moment of separation. Also I placed the first gen landing struts at the bottom of the SRB so I could recover it intact, because the chute at top of command pod would have just barely not slowed me down enough for the SRB not to wreck on contact with ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell everything worked out as I had hoped, being such a small and easy thing. However... The liquid tank \u002B engine assembly, though the chute fired fine and it came to rest on the ground with no damage, was not recoverable when I went back to the space center.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s no way to recover parts that come to rest peacefully, even right at your facility, once they leave your primary vehicle?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-03T01:09:16Z\u0022 title=\u002212/03/2015 01:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jros83\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ignath","CreatedById":77210,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-03T01:11:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222305434\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126899\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449104795\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022118956\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jros83\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, jros83 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s no way to recover parts that come to rest peacefully, even right at your facility, once they leave your primary vehicle?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe you need a control device of some sort (HECS, OCTO core, etc...) attached to the stuff you want to recover\u00A0if you disconnect it from your primary vehicle, otherwise it\u0027s considered junk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-03T01:12:29Z\u0022 title=\u002212/03/2015 01:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ignath\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-03T01:23:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you switch to the Tracking Station and enable the display of \u0022debris\u0022 (aka, uncontrolled things)?
