It turned well in orbit considering its size with thrusters, and I still have hope of giving it new life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt really is simpler than it looks. I have a center core that is an RCS tank, an Octo2 probe core, two truss sections, and a jumbo docking clamp on top to attach the payload (full orange tank is only one of my launches - I\u0027ve assembled huge space stations one launch at a time). Around the core are 4 orange tanks each with 4 RAPIER engines. Around each tank are 6 turbojet engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I learned today is to remove all the excess ram air units. I had them everywhere to take advantage of the old aero system. Once in orbit it looked like it was covered with blue eyes - hence the Ezekial name. The ram air looks better now but kind of ruined the effect of this ship\u0027s cool look. Anyway, removing all but one ram air per engine allowed me to make it to 90k Ap but ran out of fuel before raising Pe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I am not understanding is in VAB, the vessel shows stage 1 having 10k Dv. That should be way more than enough even with a huge payload.

What I recall is because of the type engines in gives SLT in Mechjeb. I think it was 8.something. My thought is the turbo engines shutting down at 26k or so, is working the RAPIERS too hard early on. They make up for it later as it was at 2.2k/ms when it ran out of fuel. In older versions the last of the turbos flamed at 50k. So I need to find a little more oomph between 26 and 50k.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Franklin","CreatedById":89718,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T21:49:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Shirt\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Shirt\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlas, with the new aero and the knerfed engines, it only climbed to 50k as it ran out of fuel.
