It turned well in orbit considering its size with thrusters, and I still have hope of giving it new life.\n\nIt really is simpler than it looks. I have a center core that is an RCS tank, an Octo2 probe core, two truss sections, and a jumbo docking clamp on top to attach the payload (full orange tank is only one of my launches - I\u0027ve assembled huge space stations one launch at a time). Around the core are 4 orange tanks each with 4 RAPIER engines. Around each tank are 6 turbojet engines.\n\nWhat I learned today is to remove all the excess ram air units. I had them everywhere to take advantage of the old aero system. Once in orbit it looked like it was covered with blue eyes - hence the Ezekial name. The ram air looks better now but kind of ruined the effect of this ship\u0027s cool look. Anyway, removing all but one ram air per engine allowed me to make it to 90k Ap but ran out of fuel before raising Pe. \n\nWhat I am not understanding is in VAB, the vessel shows stage 1 having 10k Dv. That should be way more than enough even with a huge payload. Really not sure what is happening."},{"CreatedByName":"Rainbowtrout","CreatedById":60253,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T20:29:01Z","Content":"It looks amazing.

My thought is the turbo engines shutting down at 26k or so, is working the RAPIERS too hard early on. They make up for it later as it was at 2.2k/ms when it ran out of fuel. In older versions the last of the turbos flamed at 50k. So I need to find a little more oomph between 26 and 50k."},{"CreatedByName":"Franklin","CreatedById":89718,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T21:49:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Alas, with the new aero and the knerfed engines, it only climbed to 50k as it ran out of fuel.

After a few fits I realized it is no different than getting your favorite guys stuck on Dres. Then having to figure out how to go get them with a new crew you never heard and don\u0027t want to use. With some effort you and the crew finally succeed. Then you are grateful the rescue wasn\u0027t headed for Eve - this time."}]}
