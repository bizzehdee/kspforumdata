They\u0027re not just big dumb warehouses. The tracking center alone has to involve a massing computing facility. And obviously, the R\u0026amp;D center itself is a big science lab where you use science to learn how to learn more science. So just like you unlock a tech tree node before paying money for the part that\u0027s in it, thematically it would make perfect sense to say, for example, that you have to unlock tech tree nodes that allow for building upgrades first before paying for them. Making a technological complex containing labs, computer consoles, electronic networks, environmental training facilities, etc, involves a lot more than just paying a contractor to build a building. It\u0027s what the building is *filled* with that matters, and that\u0027s a lot of stuff built using science knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo go ahead and make an argument that for gameplay you don\u0027t like spending science on building techs, but story-wise and theme-wise it fits. Maybe an argument can be made that it\u0027s not a good idea for the game, but not because of any realism issues with it. It\u0027s perfectly realistic to say you can\u0027t make a fancier mission control center if you don\u0027t have better electronics yet, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the balance problem, I think it\u0027s really just caused by the fact that BOTH funds and science got new ways to obtain them, with more contracts that generate them, but only ONE of them now has more stuff to spend it on. You get a lot more funds for missions than you used to in 0.25, but this is more than offset by having to spend them on some very expensive new items. Whereas for science, you get more science for missions than you used to in 0.25, but this was NOT accompanied by a similar new place to sink those points into. The tech tree is still the same as 0.25.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis gives rise to the problem of gaining science points that you\u0027re not allowed to spend because they come in faster than the Funds to upgrade the building does. This is the part that feels like a grind - because you\u0027re sitting on points you can\u0027t use, and you\u0027re just running the same missions over and over until you have enough money to unlock the use of those points, thereby finally opening up more interesting NEW missions to try instead of trying the same old ones again and again. Getting new missions is directly connected to getting new tech. If your tech is capped out, you\u0027re not getting new types of mission showing up either - just more of the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it\u0027s just as much a problem of \u0022too much science now\u0022 as it is a problem of \u0022not enough funds now\u0022. Add something to sink those science points into just like there\u0027s something new to sink the funds points into, and I think the two would be brought back into balance. Simply making the tech tree wider (not deeper, wider) would do it. Having to learn the tech for a building upgrade would be just one idea for how to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-18T16:00:54Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2014 04:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SickSix","CreatedById":119303,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T15:56:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlaying in normal here.

You\u0027d be better off spending your research elsewhere, which leads to the next point...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- For a short time, I was feeling a bit stuck. I didn\u0027t feel like I could build a Mun mission in under 30 parts, and I was pretty far away from having airplanes to do more of the survey missions. Part testing rarely paid well. But as soon as I unlocked the magical combo of probe core, battery, and solar panel, \u003Cstrong\u003Esatellite launch contracts\u003C/strong\u003E started showing up to save the day with their large payouts. It\u0027s cool how these contracts create an actual use for probes, other than role-playing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Something that I think could be an improvement would be for mission control to tease you with contracts that you can\u0027t actually take yet, like showing greyed-out satellite contracts before you have the necessary parts unlocked. First, that would give you some indication of what you should be researching. Second, it would be a nice carrot-on-a-stick, something to look forward to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The 30 part limit in the starting VAB is harsh, but some smart research choices can help give you more wiggle room. In particular, getting larger fuel tanks and engines allows you to do more with less parts. I was able to do my first Mun landing with just 30 parts by using the 2.5m tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- R\u0026amp;D upgrade does seem too expensive.

But then the first upgrade to 255 parts and 140 tons makes it the complete opposite - you can do pretty much anything with that. Maybe there should be an intermediate upgrade level, like 100 parts and 70 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I think in general, buildings cost too much and rockets are too cheap. Other than some of the early part testing, most contracts pay out far more than what the launch costs, so I never feel strapped for cash while building. It feels like 80% of my money goes toward facility upgrades, and I think it would be better if it was more of a 50/50 split.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Overall difficulty of hard mode seems good for me so far.

But when I was more excited to get to orbit last night than I have been in three years of playing, I thought to myself \u0022Ah ha, I see what you did there Squad.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Heck, I remember my first time in orbit when you knew you were in orbit because for 20 minute (or however long the orbital period was) the horizontal velocity meter hovered around 0, last night wasn\u0027t *that* hard)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"odhal","CreatedById":132428,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T17:05:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo here are my thoughts on the difficulty of the beta, as a pretty seasoned player. The biggest thing is that, for the first time ever, the game actually HAS difficulty. You can\u0027t breeze through the tech tree in a handful of missions anymore, because you have to upgrade your buildings first, specifically the R\u0026amp;D center. The R\u0026amp;D upgrade costs are so high that you\u0027ll end up upgrading your other buildings along the way, too. This gives the game a reasonable feeling of progression, which it never had in previous releases. The limitations of the VAB/SPH and launchpad/runway also force you to make well designed missions if you want to delay upgrades to those buildings. So overall the upgradable facilities surprised me with how much they improved gameplay. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s bothering me right now is the cost of the R\u0026amp;D upgrade, along with the typical contract reward. Based on the average contracts I\u0027ve been accepting so far, it\u0027s going to take about 100 contracts to earn the $6 million to complete the upgrades of the R\u0026amp;D center, maybe 50 assuming the average reward goes up and I complete a lot of \u0022Explore\u0022 contracts. That\u0027s still a huge number of randomly generated, ultimately meaningless missions. As a side note, you can technically earn money through strategies, but $9 per rep and $10 per science are extremely low yields compared to the money earned from contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The biggest area where the game is still lacking is the contracts. The devs were hoping to repeat the success of implementing \u0022Spaceplans Plus\u0022 when they integrated \u0022Fine Print\u0022 into .90\u0027s contract system, however it still feels the same to me. I\u0027ve done a handful of each new mission type on my way to the first R\u0026amp;D upgrade, and it\u0027s not that they\u0027ve gotten old already. It\u0027s just that I doubt it would be fun to grind the necessary number of them to upgrade the facility again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEver since they were released, contracts have felt woefully underdeveloped. The randomly generated text description of each contract is the perfect metaphor for contracts in general. When I read contract descriptions, I imagine the devs saying, \u0022This is total garbage nonsense that we put not much effort into but you\u0027ll like it because ROCKETS and EXPLOSIONS and KERBALS and SCIENCE.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I\u0027m saying is that, if career mode seems too hard to players who are veterans and know what they\u0027re doing, it\u0027s because they just don\u0027t want to complete 50 to 100 of these meaningless contracts. Fine print is an improvement, but randomly generated contracts still feel completely arbitrary and the new contract types eventually get boring just like the previous types. If there were some kind of narrative built into the contract system, that might help. Currently it\u0027s \u0022explore here, then here, now here,\u0022 and that\u0027s just another aspect of contracts that reeks of lack of effort to me. Before I get too deep into this rant, the game as a whole has made leaps and bounds. The only reason the contract system looks so bad now is because everything else is pretty good. IMO for players who know what they\u0027re doing, boring contracts are the main thing making career currently feel hard and/or grindy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a final thought, for newer players the game needs to do a better job of teaching them. I think it would be very difficult and frustrating to start as a new player with all Level 1 facilities. This is another area where adding a story to the game could help, by providing an early tutorial of sorts. I know \u0022the game already has a tutorial\u0022 but even if people actually used that, the initial difficulty of career mode probably merits its own set of explanations to newer players.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pirke","CreatedById":77207,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T17:44:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m playing on hard with FAR, DRE and real chutes, and I\u0027m loving the challenge!
