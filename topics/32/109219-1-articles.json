I designed my lifter, got everything prepped and eventually got it into LKO, but my ship wiggled around so much that I was way off equatorial orbit. I tried to correct it, but ran out of everything including RCS. \n\nHuge fail...but I still had a space station in LKO!\n\nSo I sent up a ship to refuel it...huge success, this was my first time docking two ships together! I was able to get the thing two thirds of the way filled with fuel AND fully fill the RCS systems. TIME TO GO TO THE MUN!!!\n\nSo I flew the thing to the moon, got my intercept set up and executed. But I didn\u0027t have enough fuel to make an Orbit! \u0022Ruh Roh!!! USE THE RCS!!!\u0022\n\nUsed up all my RCS and managed to get into an orbit with a Periapsis of 7k and an Apo of 1.6 Million at a crazy crazy non equatorial orbit... Technically...mission accomplished...BUT NO! SEND THE MUNAR PROBE REFUELER!!!\n\nManaged to match orbit and Dock a refueling ship with an engineer to fix some broken solar panels (Thought you could...apparently not), but accidentally hit space bar and detached my engines... But I did refuel the RCS Systems!\n\nEnd result, Munar Orbiter Alpha is in a stable circular orbit of 30k...but still not a totally normal equatorial orbit. totally out of RCS AND no engines, probably need 200 more dV to finish getting things perfect...\n\nDo you guys think I should send ANOTHER ship to join the party? ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"timsfitz","CreatedById":104387,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T17:14:30Z","Content":"It\u0027s good enough."},{"CreatedByName":"SDEngineer","CreatedById":101148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T17:19:32Z","Content":"\u003E Managed to match orbit and Dock a refueling ship with an engineer to fix some broken solar panels (Thought you could...apparently not), but accidentally hit space bar and detached my engines...\n\n\u003Calt\u003E\u002BL is your friend - always lock your staging when you don\u0027t expect to be doing any soon.\u003C/alt\u003E\n\nFun story though.
