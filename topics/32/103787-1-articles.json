I really enjoy the freedom to do whatever i want with this game (unlike the ohh so many linear games developed recently that have very little replayeability).\n\nAnyways, while i own it on steam (and use steam for updates), ive copied the exe/files to another HDD and i play it offline and dont even boot that ram-hog of a steam.
