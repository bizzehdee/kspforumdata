I applied the fix to the heatshields, so my pods don\u0027t flip out. \n\nIn 0.90, one of my favorite missions was to rescue idiotic kerbals who somehow got themselves into orbit without ships. It was fun and an easy way to make some money. The same applies for 1.0, with the added bonus that you don\u0027t have to pay to get the crew!\n\nBut there is a problem. In 1.0 they are all in a pod (or so far what I have seen), and it seems to stays up there. I like to keep LKO debris free, and this stuff isn\u0027t even debris! I don\u0027t know if this stuff stays there permanently, but I assume it does (I stopped for the night soon after the 4 rescues I did). So, how do people deal with this? I could probably de-orbit it when my career is further progressed.\n\nAnyone else finding these pods annoying or have good ways of dealing with it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T00:41:26Z","Content":"Just blow it to kingdom come once you EVA the kerbal to your ship with the \u0022terminate\u0022 button in the Tracking Station."},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T00:42:08Z","Content":"Once you have taken control of the pods, you can terminate them from the tracking station.\n\nOtherwise, it will stay there forever.\n\nI\u0027ve gotten one of the rescue missions to spawn the kerbal in a science lab, though.
