It was fun and an easy way to make some money. The same applies for 1.0, with the added bonus that you don\u0027t have to pay to get the crew!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there is a problem. In 1.0 they are all in a pod (or so far what I have seen), and it seems to stays up there. I like to keep LKO debris free, and this stuff isn\u0027t even debris! I don\u0027t know if this stuff stays there permanently, but I assume it does (I stopped for the night soon after the 4 rescues I did). So, how do people deal with this?
