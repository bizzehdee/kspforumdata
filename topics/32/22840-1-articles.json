I have heard through you tube that vanilla is out and that you can mine fuel from this update but I can\u0027t figure out how to so I think I misunderstood. So does this make kethane fuel obsolete? And this leads me to My next question does kethane work in the .19 update? Also can someone please explain just what the vanilla update is.
