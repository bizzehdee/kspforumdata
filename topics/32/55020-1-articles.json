We were prompted to research any topic we wanted, so long as it was related to math. Naturally I chose something KSP related, and since we need an expert consultant, I thought you guys would be perfect for the job. Essentially, I will be using 3 equations (Delta-V, Hohmann maneuver and TWR ratio) to calculate the parameters for a very efficient (for my standards at least) rocket in Kerbal Space Program. This rocket will put a small lander on the Mun, nothing too fancy but enough to demonstrate the mathematics involved. I have some questions that I\u0027m required to ask, and I\u0027ve attached the link to the document outlining the whole project. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Are there any ways that you use mathematics on a daily basis?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.
