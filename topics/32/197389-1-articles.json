This is what gives me pleasure. (I have so much to look forward to ) I do not consider myself intelligent, but I have an engineering background of which this game appeals to me. I have an interest in computers, back to the C64! ,\u00A0 programs and hardware, but no depth to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason for this post is this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like many , many users here, have a dependency for the mods that this \u0022game\u0022\u00A0 needs to be a fully functioning product. And maybe some modders need this platform to hone their skills on, and so we have a win win situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe title \u0022 there\u0027s never enough\u0022\u00A0\u00A0 is because there is no dedication to the modders post as far as i have seen, furthermore a modders post is constantly bombarded with requests, questions and any amount of other quieries and requirements for other mods required plus dependencies and any amount of queries pertaining to it. And yes there are likes...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy point:\u00A0 do you think a \u0022sticky\u0022 for\u00A0 \u0022praise to modders\u0022 \u00A0\u00A0 is appropiate, would a forum wide \u0022pat on the back\u0022 be a good thing ? or am I just a ranting 62 year old living in a \u0022mod\u0022ern\u00A0 world !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks for reading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S this is no game, it\u0027s part of my life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kernel Kraken","CreatedById":181383,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-09T21:33:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHehe,\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223865672\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022197389\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221602269419\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002273642\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022glibbo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, glibbo said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u0022mod\u0022ern\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut in all seriousness, you have a point.
