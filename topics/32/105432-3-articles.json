You basically typed \u0022KSP FORUMZ SUX REDDIT AWESOME\u0022 and then insulted the community here.\n\u003E Look, it\u0027s literally the day of a major release forced through an ill-thought out deadline. Once the program is hotfixed, which I\u0027m sure it will be, everything will calm down. Until then, if you can\u0027t handle the heat here, go read reddit or something. This is nothing new. Acting like everyone here is terrible and complaining or whatever is just creating more work for the mods.\n\nIf thats the case then I just want to say that I don\u0027t have an issue with this forum. I like this forum and the people here. I just feel like it has gotten more negative. I don\u0027t want to hate on anyone and I don\u0027t want it to seem like the reddit for the game is the only place someone should be going. I am seriously sorry if the way I wrote my posts contributed to more negativity on the board. Wasn\u0027t my intent. The game has issues the same way anything has issues and calling this 1.0 has lead to a lot of heated discussion. I seriously didn\u0027t mean to upset anybody."},{"CreatedByName":"Rosco P.

In all that time there hasn\u0027t been an official roadmap or feature list the game will have. In the absence of such a thing people will start making their own assumptions of \u0022what i KSP?\u0022, how 1.0 is going to be like. The more players you have and the more time you go before 1.0, the more people would have \u0022guessed wrong\u0022. So at the end, you simply have more people that disagree with you, simply probability.\n\nI for once, when I joined I was told we wouldn\u0027t have resources, then I was told we would, like a gazillion of them in fact, then we were told we wouldn\u0027t at least not the one previously shown, then we were told we were getting resource... Now, through all that time I made my mind and \u0022guessed\u0022 what the devs were thinking... only to find out that I guessed wrong.
