Kerbin is about 1/1200th the size of Earth (a radius about 10.5 times smaller than Earth\u0027s) but has about 1/110th the mass. These ratios give it the exact same surface gravity as Earth, 9.81 m/s^2. (It\u0027s not exactly a 1/10 ratio; the Earth\u0027s mean radius is 6371km, and Kerbin is 600km. But you can call it that and not be too far off) Unfortunately, this gives it about eleven times the density of Earth, a little over 50 kg/m^3, which is more than twice the density of the densest metals. In other words, it\u0027s physically impossible unless the core of the planet is made of degenerate matter from an exploded neutron star or something.

Yes, there\u0027s less mass between you and the center of mass if you move toward the poles, but there\u0027s also less distance, so the force is the same. If the forces differed, then all of the world\u0027s water would flow \u0022downhill\u0022 towards the spot that had higher gravity.
