I know there are some others attempting a similar mod with biomes added, but I have yet to try them. If you want it to work in career mode you will need to tweek some code, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://en.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1om2i8/how_to_integrate_mods_into_career_mode/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis article explains how\u003C/a\u003E. Don\u0027t let it scare you, it\u0027s quite easy to do. This mod will allow you to scan a planet (with a properly equipped vessel) and will reveal \u0022rough\u0022 locations for anomalies. The map will give you coordinates of these locations, but unfortunately there is no visual in your map view so without a means to locate coordinates on a planet, it\u0027s of no use to you to know the coordinates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) As my sarcasm machine was turned up high a few posts ago, there really is no \u0022stock\u0022 tools to allow you to find your position in the universe, at least not until AFTER you\u0027ve landed. But even then, it\u0027s basically useless data as the average player can\u0027t do anything with the coordinates as you have nothing to use it with. You can\u0027t easily tell which way is up or North from your current position, if you want to go to coordinates X,Y on planet Z it\u0027s a total shot in the dark as there\u0027s no HUD to guide you that I\u0027ve found. I\u0027m hopeful that one day the dev\u0027s will see the error in their ways and finally install some \u0022basic\u0022 navigation tools as part of the core program. Until then, you\u0027ll need a mod to fill this gap in utilities, of which I recommend \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/12384-PART-0-23-5-Anatid-Robotics-MuMech-MechJeb-Autopilot-v2-2-1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMechjeb\u003C/a\u003E, I typically use the latest build in development which you can find \u003Ca href=\u0022http://jenkins.mumech.com/job/MechJeb2/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. Equipping your ship with MJ will allow you to enter landing coordinates which will actually throw a big red X on the planet of where that site is. Finally, a visual tool that will allow you to see a particular location you can actually see and fly/drive to while in map mode. MJ has many other features, such as autopilot, but at least you\u0027re free to fly as you please with the luxury of basic navigational tools available to you as well as several advanced ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck on your Easter egg hunts, and don\u0027t forget to bring your camera!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
