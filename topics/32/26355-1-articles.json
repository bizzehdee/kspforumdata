I took Jeb out of the command pod of the station and let him hanging on the ladder, then put Rodlock out of the orbiter and took him to the station\u0027s command pod. As soon as he touched Jeb, the game stopped for a moment and BAM! The station was spinning and broke apart \u0027cuz of the extremely high G forces. Checked out the map, and turned out I was on a suborbital trajectory. Fortunately, my orbiter had enough space for Jeb and Rodlock, so I quickly transfered both into it, throttled up away from the spinning pieces of debris, and came in for a good landing on the desert. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two other guys at the station died horribly but, hey!
