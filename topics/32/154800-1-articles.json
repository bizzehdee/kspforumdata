I drove it up a slight incline, tail end still on the flat terrain, \u0022nose\u0022 climbing up the slope. I parked it there, went elsewhere, came back. The train was perfectly straight, disregarding ground curvature; the nose part was dug deep under the surface and would be ejected explosively.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Avoid fork structures with heavy prongs and light base. Tricouplers etc are a total bane - you may attach three engines to a tricoupler, but attach three tanks and you have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Rapid unplanned disassembly\u0022\u003ERUD\u003C/abbr\u003E \u003Cem\u003Eguaranteed\u003C/em\u003E. Attach tanks to a big, heavy tank, and make sure they are dry before the tank is, and you\u0027re fine. Also strutting the parts directly attached to multicoupler \u0022to grandparent\u0022 helps.

Sliding may be a bit of a problem, and landing legs love to introduce vibrations... (my Gilly base would all enter a wild oscillation and fly away until I found a single overloaded landing leg that was doing it, at a far end of a long branch of the base... as the engineer detached the offending leg, it sprung away so hard it was halfway to Moho when I last killed it on my debris termination spree..)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso when applying autostrut make pretty damn sure the parts you\u0027re applying it are unstressed - no strain bending them from their default relative orientation. Loading craft with autostrut applied when the parts are out of alignment... usually is not disastrous. Just likes to snap connections, break the base in half, and so on. A breakage quite repairable but burdensome especially if both pieces are waaay heavy. But otherwise don\u0027t shy from autostrut. It can really help base stability a LOT.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
