So spaceplanes isn\u0027t the best option anymore...\n\nSSTOs lost much of a reason to exist after 1.0.1 anyways, given that they were already borderline pointless when it comes down to payload fraction, and they were borderline impossible to make super lightweight as well (my sci-fy styles carrier fighters still work, but i used to be able to do a laythe roundtrip in 1.0, now i need to dump the entire ion gear just to get into orbit, and whats the point when you need to refuel 24/7). I usually liked to create SSTOs that were below 20t, with 1.0 it was feaseable, you could even bring a few weapons too and not have that bad a drag penalty, now its pretty much impossible to get anything fun to SSTO.\n\nTLDR: 1.0 was in my opinion the most fun and enjoyeable of all atmospheres. Im not necessarily saying it was the most realistic atmo, but it sure was alot of fun to fly in it (and SSTOs were tough to make, but could actually get into orbit and even farther out if needed). While i cant say what is more realistic (ive played some flight sims but no replica like craft actually behave like the ones from flight sims anyways regardless of game version), i can say 1.0 was the best from a fun and feel perspective (\u002B fw190 replica with a rapier in teh back going mach 4 at sea level was fun!)."},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T15:53:37Z","Content":"I agree with red iron crown... 1.0.2 seems more gentle and forgiving with delicate maneuver yielding like for like payoffs in dV savings.
