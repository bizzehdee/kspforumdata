Remember the [URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/139478-Sea-Car-4\u0022]Sea Car 4[/URL]? It was a prototype for my entry into the Deep Diver Challenge. It was unbalanced and sunk. With someone in it. [COLOR=#696969]They\u0026#39;re[/COLOR] still [COLOR=#696969]there[/COLOR] in [COLOR=#696969]their[/COLOR] sub :D. Then there was the Sea Car 4B. It was more balanced than the 4, but it explodes every time I use the transfer capsule thing. Thankfully the only person inside the 4b got into the pod connected to the ore tanks before everything else fell off the sub. It was my entry into the challenge.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway, I built a new one. The Sea Car 5 is a new and improved submarine. It features balanced mass, verified by the SPH\u0026#39;s very own centre-of-mass detector. It has eight RTGs. It can theoretically fit 5 kerbals! One condition, though. If you don\u0026#39;t fill the ore tanks, it isn\u0026#39;t a sub.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI discovered this by riding it into the water. Then I checked the tanks and voila. Dangit. XD\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/8MA1whm.png[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt actually goes really fast on the water. Top speed was 40.1m/s, or 144.36 kilometres an hour. Highway speeds, or more.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI decided to take it to the Island Airbase. Trip took 19 minutes ingame but I had phys warp on for most of the time so for me it was a shorter wait.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/A7RLGg2.png[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere it is, cruising about 3/8 of the way there.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/gPmicUA.png[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\nApproaching the island.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI had to drive up a cliff. Like a 45-degree angle. It got up to 8 or so m/s on the slope. Then it got up onto flattish land and started going 12m/s. I tried to brake and this happened.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/JaLw7Ag.png[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaybe they can \u0022borrow\u0022 some of the old parts in one of the buildings and attach some old, 0.90-year-old, rusted, dented, on-fire rocket engine to their pod and fly back to KSC. Actually, you know what, they won\u0026#39;t be able to do that. :D\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-26T03:55:52Z\u0022 title=\u002211/26/2015 03:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Findthepin1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T04:59:48Z","Content":"\nFull points for proper grammar ;)\u003Cbr\u003E\nRepresent!\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T06:50:31Z","Content":"\nVery interesting!
