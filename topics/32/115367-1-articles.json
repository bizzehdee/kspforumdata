The LV-N has enough fuel for 5.3 minutes of burn time according to Kerbal Engineer, and only needs 2 minutes to reach a class A asteroid. There it can harvest 300 units of ore and drunkenly stumble it\u0027s way back to an orbital processing plant. \n\nAlternatively, I may stick a radial parachute on it\u0027s back and try to recover the ore for funds.\n\nHowever, looking at the pictures again, I forgot to add the orbital scanner for its mouth / mandibles"}]}
