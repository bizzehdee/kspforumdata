Well it\u0027d be two things. First off, building the ships is a big part of the game, if you could make that a team effort that\u0027d be brilliant just in and of itself. But secondly, and I would argue more importantly, KSP is a very hard game. It has a big learning curve and there is a hell of a lot to take in. I\u0027ve sunk about fifty hours into this game since getting it and I completed my first Mun landing and return tonight, and I\u0027d still be trying to make that happen if I hadn\u0027t been able to talk to a friend who has had the game longer and get some pointers. Some sort of system for closer cooperation, for teaching, exchanging ideas, demonstrating how things work, that\u0027d be brilliant. You can go so much further in this game with a little guidance than you can with just blind experimentation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ant1nam3","CreatedById":61723,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T03:17:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhy? whats wrong with multiplayer\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OdinYggd","CreatedById":26917,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T03:30:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy earlier post on page 1 details the biggest technical barriers with multiplayer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as griefing goes, these servers would be required to use some type of system to restrict who can login for multiple reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne is you won\u0027t be able to put more than maybe 3-4 people on a server at a time without enormous computing power because of the sheer amount of math involved in simultaneously calculating the physics for four vessels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other is to control griefing. You\u0027ll only want to do this with people you know well, that aren\u0027t going to grief you in ways that mess you up any more than docking practical jokes onto your station that you can easily dispose of. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the status of the thread goes, while multiplayer does score quite high on the do not suggest list, as long as people discuss it in a civilized manner covering the advantages and drawbacks as well as technical details and possible implementation techniques, I see no reason for this thread to be closed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscussions with the modding community have resulted in nearly all of the operational details of how a KSP multiplayer should behave, including solutions for warp control and docking. But without the ability to control multiple vessels in the flight scene with no more than a few milliseconds delay, it just can\u0027t be built yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHe most popular warp approach though is to use a lowest common denominator system as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone requests warp. Everyone then has 15 seconds to press abort warp or accept warp. If someone is doing a time-sensitive operation, they can abort the warp at this time and it cannot be requested again for 2 minutes real time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf nobody presses abort warp, after 15 seconds for afk players to time out or everyone pressing accept, the players who hit accept warp are then taken to a screen where they can enter how long to warp with shortcut keys to warp to pending events such as a maneuver node or SOI change and maximum available warp rate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarp is then determined by the lowest common denominators of warp speed and warp duration, with all players warping together. After a warp has taken place, the game must wait 2 minutes real time before warp can be requested again so that people can check their vessel positions or adjust maneuvers accordingly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor delegating control of docked vessels, one popular strategy is to embed an ownership tag into the docking clamps. Then a given module when docked is designated from docking clamp to docking clamp or end of tree, and the right click menu allows the current owner to transfer ownership to other players. You can only operate a docking clamp that is mated to a clamp with your name on it, but can dock onto any open port. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt really is just a matter of lack of API in the game engine, and programming effort to put together everything that would be required.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-28T03:33:01Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2013 03:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by OdinYggd\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laphtiya","CreatedById":61211,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T14:38:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BossSquirrelz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BossSquirrelz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m gonna take a step back and ask: why does KSP need multiplayer?
