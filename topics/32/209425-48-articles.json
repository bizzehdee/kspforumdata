I normally just fire up a virtual machine for testing since I occasionally like to play with viruses I find on other people\u0027s computers. Trying to find out what all they affect, ways around any lockouts it imposes, alternate methods of removal, repairing the system to a usable state after a particularly nasty one, that sort of thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was just in November / December of last year that I bought this RAM kit, maybe it was a Black Friday thing? I remember buying a few parts around that time. You\u0027re right though, I had forgotten that DDR3 has been around a while and it\u0027s \u0022about that time\u0022. Pretty sure even the normal price for that kit was around $75 at the time now that I think about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Warning, computer rant unavoidable]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to keep this computer a while but it\u0027s irritating me again. My system freeze just happened again for the first time in a while, and it turns out it\u0027s not KSP specific because this time it was during Skyrim (not related to my KSP ctds, those are gone and seem to have been caused by loading too much into memory by chance while already being close to the 32bit limit). After a hard restart I turned on all my monitoring software and loaded the game back up and NOTHING in this entire computer is getting above 55 degrees with Skyrim, RAM usage was well below the 32bit limit and VRAM usage was about 1.5gb. No overclocks, no viruses, PSU is overkill, and all my drivers are up to date except Realtek HD audio because it won\u0027t let me for some reason. This wouldn\u0027t irritate me near as much if I could just figure out what\u0027s causing it so I can replace / fix it! No error logs because the whole system locks up (but the monitors stay on and keep displaying the last frame, oddly enough). I think I\u0027m going to run a full test on the RAM while I\u0027m asleep to eliminate that and if it comes up clean I\u0027m probably going to reinstall the OS. I have already tried reseating the RAM and the graphics card. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould have just done the fresh install when I put in the SSD to be safe but I wanted it right then. If that doesn\u0027t help I guess I\u0027ll break down and buy a new motherboard, something in the Asus 990 series. Currently running an MSI 970a-g46 and I have never really trusted this thing to properly handle my FX-4350. Thing is, I was using less than 50% of the processor at the time so I don\u0027t see why it\u0027d be overloading the VRMs or anything. I like fixing things but I can\u0027t fix that which I can\u0027t diagnose... Really hoped to put off upgrading the mobo but I might pull my hair out if I don\u0027t try it, and I lose enough of that in the shower every morning. But if you (or anyone) has another idea feel free to throw it out there. I wonder if my old graphics card messed something up in the motherboard, I can\u0027t remember if it ever did this before it. I had a Radeon 270x Gaming Edition literally catch on fire about a week after I bought it... It looked pretty cool while it was doing it though, and I have to give it credit for the fact that I was \u003Cem\u003Estill playing Skyrim\u003C/em\u003E while it was on fire. I heard the sizzle and thought I was near a torch, then I saw flames in my computer case through the plexiglass and pulled the plug. I didn\u0027t worry about it too much at the time because it was as far away from anything except a case fan as possible and only managed to singe the nylon netting off one of my PSU wires, but it could have damaged something internal I guess. Crazy stuff. /rant\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-18T16:18:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf something has been burning you will need to treat everything attached as suspect. Things generally do not just blow up randomly without a reason. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinding a fault is always a process of elimination. Start with the usual suspects and work your way down the list from there. Hard drives, software and GPU\u0027s break down relatively often and are easily (temporarily) exchanged or circumvented. CPU\u0027s almost never break without abuse and motherboards seem pretty sturdy too, while RAM and PSU\u0027s are somewhere in between. Of course, your system has had a beating with that card going up, so no guarantees. Putting high voltage on a CPU will kill it almost immediately, or leaves it working but damaged. You can get some pretty weird stuff when things get damaged. Ideally you are able to replicate the problem easily as this makes testing a whole lot easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would start with the things easily and cheaply done:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Eliminate any peripheral devices and internal devices not needed. Only attach your keyboard, mouse and monitor and remove anything non-essential: internal drives, card readers et cetera. The idea is to run the system as bare as possible to see whether the problem is in the core components. Of course, return anything that is on non-standard settings (overclock for example) to its default. Recheck, or better, reattach all needed cables to confirm they are correctly attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you have got an old HDD lying around, try to install the OS on there and see whether you still have the problem. A fresh installation on the SSD will exclude software faults, but not the hardware of the SSD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Test your RAM overnight with MEMtest. As a seperate test, take one stick out, see whether the problem persists, then switch sticks and do the same. If at all possible temporarily test with RAM from a system that is know to work without incident. After that you can test\u0060with one stick to adhere to the bare bones strategy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Swap out the GPU for another one, any one that will fit, or use the IGP and see whether the problem persists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- See if you know anyway that will let you swap out his PSU for a day. Did I see you mention you have a decent A-brand PSU? That is a prerequisite for a problem free system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you still have problems at that point you might want to take a look at the motherboard and CPU. If you worry about the VRM\u0027s or other components, you could either clock down your system or put airflow directly on it. If the problem disappears, something funky is going on there. Beyond that it gets hard to test things without actually swapping out the motherboard and CPU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith some logic and a methodical approach you should be able to identify the source of the problem \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I have collected a stack of old parts just for these purposes over the years, it is very useful to have some stuff to swap and test with and for example an old GPU typically costs hardly anything at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Duke23\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Duke23\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EInteresting, I had run across a program for sandboxing but I never really used it.

I have tried different configurations trying to pinpoint it but not much luck so far. I\u0027ll continue and use some of the suggestions you gave. Of note:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-my PSU is a Corsair Builder series CX 750, it should be more than capable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-problem persists between hard drive and SSD with the same install.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-seems to happen more often when I\u0027m gaming with two monitors connected as opposed to one, but it\u0027s usually several days apart so it\u0027s hard to tell. I can\u0027t replicate the problem other than start up a game and wait (for days). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-the graphics card was a manufacturer defect. I ran a Radeon 260x OC for a couple months before and my GTX-760 ever since with no problems, at least nothing like that. The Radeon cards have their own set of issues in general... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I did the Windows memory test last night and it showed nothing wrong. I was going to use a third party program on my flash drive but something happened to that drive and it needs to be reloaded. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I have run SFC and it also came up with nothing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem is most of the spare parts I have laying around are older because that\u0027s mostly what I still work on for friends, sadly. Athlon64s, P4s and Core2Duos, DDR / DDR2 RAM, IDE hard drives, etc. I do still have the 260x though as a backup. For what it\u0027s worth I disconnected my DVD burner when I installed the SSD because I thought it came with a cable and didn\u0027t buy one \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E I have a gut feeling this is a problem with the motherboard but I need to confirm that somehow. It happens sometimes within 12 hours and sometimes waits a week or so. Seems to be mostly when gaming, very rarely when watching a movie or converting a video, never just idling or browsing the web which makes it harder to test for with any certainty. (\u0022it\u0027s working, but did I wait long enough to be sure?\u0022 lol).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing with this motherboard is that it doesn\u0027t have the best track record (the model, not mine.) from what I understand it wasn\u0027t originally made to run any 125w processor, they changed something in the revision model to allow it but warned strongly against any overclock to the cpu whatsoever if you\u0027re running an FX-4350/8350. That to me makes it questionable but at the time it was a great price, I wanted the thing up and running ASAP, and I planned to upgrade several components within the year anyway, that being one of them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain thanks for the tips, I\u0027ll take it under advisement and continue my search. I still want to replace this motherboard even if it\u0027s not the problem, so I can do a teensy weensy overclock \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re very right about the VM too, pretty much anything other than using file managers and word processors is annoying.

It won\u0027t let me over provision now even after a forced TRIM so I did it manually in disk manager and it tells me I have just a bit less space than recommended that I can shrink. I guess this could be solved by doing the secured erase, something I couldn\u0027t really do easily with a non working partition earlier. Something I did do was take the time to go into the registry and BIOS to enable AHCI. I didn\u0027t think it would make much difference but I saw notable gains in the benchmarks for the SSD and, well, inconsistency on the internal HDD. It changes every time while the SSD stays about the same (I read that it could make a small difference with them as well). Now that I think of it, I wonder if AHCI being disabled is the reason it couldn\u0027t install? lol. I should really think these things through, but I guess half the fun is trial and error.

If you\u0027re 100% sure you\u0027re not ever going to overclock, I\u0027d personally go with a cheaper mobo, the non K processor if it\u0027s cheaper, use the stock CPU heat sink (If I\u0027m not mistaken that CPU does come with one -- hey, get those pointy sticks away from me!) and use the cash you saved to get a GTX-760 or better. I also agree that you don\u0027t need the 750w PSU, I\u0027m sure you\u0027d be fine with a 500 or 600 and even that is giving you a fair bit of wiggle room. Unless you do start running more than one GPU, which I wouldn\u0027t recommend anyway for gaming. But I can\u0027t say anything really because I have the CX-750 as well; I got a deal on it and I figure it\u0027s never a bad thing to have more power than you need, just be aware for budget\u0027s sake. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also skip the sound card for now since most motherboards these days seem to be more than adequate for normal use. It might not be studio quality but you can always upgrade later if necessary. I have that same HDD and it\u0027s solid but I\u0027m also partial to the 250gb Samsung 840 Evo SSD I just bought, it blows any HDD out of the water so you might want to pick one up in addition to the HDD if it\u0027s feasible for your budget. Even if you\u0027re going to wait a good little while to overclock (I like to keep my options open) I\u0027d still use the stock heat sink for now but still get the K processor and the good mobo of course, and when you\u0027re ready to experiment go for a liquid cooling system. But that\u0027s me. There\u0027s nothing to be scared of with overclocking you just have to do a little research, use common sense, and watch your temps and overall stability. In most cases if you screw it up bad enough the computer will just shut down and you start over with lower settings no harm done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of the GTX-760, Camacha if you\u0027re reading this I\u0027m crossing my fingers that I just fixed my problem. I was coming up with nothing for a while and then I had a freeze with KSP, Skyrim, and Netflix each running alone within a couple days, so next thing on the list was to look closer at the GPU. I ran Display Driver Uninstaller (the successor to Driver Sweeper? Some sources say Driver Fusion is) and you were right, I still had some residual R9 stuff hanging around. I used it to uninstall EVERYTHING and I\u0027m going to put it through its paces in the next few days and see what happens. I know I just recommended the 760 but I can\u0027t blame the card for my own negligence and even with the crashes (assuming it was GPU related) I\u0027m happier with it than I was with the R7-260x OC and the R9-270x Gaming put together.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-24T20:14:17Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2014 08:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Duke23\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RogueMason","CreatedById":45069,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-24T10:28:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright, thanks guys, I think I\u0027ve got an idea of where to go from here \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"impwarhamer","CreatedById":80499,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-24T21:37:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey guys, about 6 months ago I decided to upgrade from my old laptop to a proper desktop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did a hole bunch of research and asked advise from my friends on what to do, but in the end i decided to purchase what looked like a fairly good deal pre-built instead of building one myself since I get very nervous doing that sort of thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I have since been recommending this computer to other people as i think it\u0027s quite good value, but it would be nice to see what some of you more experienced people would think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the link: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cyberpower-Desktop-Processor-Graphics-Windows/dp/B00C72IR5O/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1384290906\u0026amp;sr=8-2\u0026amp;keywords=cyberpower\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Cyberpower-Desktop-Processor-Graphics-Windows/dp/B00C72IR5O/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1384290906\u0026amp;sr=8-2\u0026amp;keywords=cyberpower\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess i just want to know if it was in fact a good deal and if i should be recommending it since i don\u0027t know that much about hardware\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-24T23:12:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RogueMason\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RogueMason\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEverything else remains the same as in the last post I made.

Typically, these kinds of systems give you decent equipment in places they can and need to advertise, but go with the bare minimum in all other places. So you get, for instance, a very simple motherboard and a fairly weak PSU. This means that any type of upgrade in the future will be more expensive than usual, as you do not only need to upgrade the part itself, you also need to upgrade the parts it relies on. That being said, it is a non-K chip, so that means no overclocking and which is typically another way of working the budget. The video card will play KSP nicely, but is not a monster. If what this system can do is everything you will ever need it is fine, but if you want the option of upgrading you will need to do some homework. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe getting someone to build your system for a small fee is an idea?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elthy","CreatedById":63317,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T11:31:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilding a PC is like Lego, with instructions even a child can do it.
