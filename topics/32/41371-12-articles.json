This would serve two purposes. First, it would mimic real-life consequences where you have to rethink, relearn and reevaluate your designs, effectively setting you back a few years - a step back technologically. Second, it would serve as a way to adjust difficulty (or ambitions) for players that have (apparently) progressed too far too quickly without really understanding the necessary requirements or by taking too many risks. Killing crew is not a sign of a skillful player - and science level should be based on skill, not luck.
