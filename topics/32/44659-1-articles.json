But I can spare some time to answer with my 2 cents;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a landing and return flight, Duna is much easier. With eve you need to plan for the extremely dV hungry atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Duna your challenge is aerobraking - the thin atmosphere makes it hard. If you don\u0027t want to waste time, just use retro burns. I used parachutes and I smashed about 5 times into mountains, very hard to find the sweet spot (I\u0027m using FAR aerodynamics realism mod).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour Duna lander should have 2-3x more fuel than a Lunar lander. (depends what is your strategy) Alot of fuel will be used for braking your descent and parachutes have poor performance on Duna; Use a lander with a low center of gravity (I made that mistake). And finally, beware of sandworms!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: Moon slingshot is overrated. I\u0027m pretty sure you can benefit more from a heavier planet and transferring from there just above the atmosphere. Plan your maneuver by moving it along the orbit to find the optimal spot. Your goal is not only to escape the planet but intercept another planet by increase/decrease of orbital speed around the star. Correct me if I\u0027m wrong though at the very least it makes it easier to plan a maneuver... As with everything, the timing is essential - waiting for Duna to be at the correct angle - you might have to wait several days so enter an eleptical orbit 121km - 900km so you can fast-forward\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eref: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.skyrender.net/lp/ksp/system_map.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.skyrender.net/lp/ksp/system_map.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-02T01:40:26Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2013 01:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by loknar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T01:33:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDuna aerocapture can be helpful, and is actually pretty fun because you have to dip so low, but a Duna transfer \u002B capture requires so little delta-V (even when using a suboptimal window) that it\u0027s not at all required.
