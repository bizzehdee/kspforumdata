It\u0027s actually made asteroid capture missions much more fun compared to how they were before, and a tug like that can keep operating indefinitely, fetching asteroids back to LKO without ever needing extra fuel brought up to it.\n\nThis is my current ISRU \u002B LV-N astro-tug [http://kerbalx.com/katateochi/AstroHopperMKII](http://kerbalx.com/katateochi/AstroHopperMKII)"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T13:41:02Z","Content":"I think you may need to review your math a bit.

The large ore can does have a better empty mass percentage than the Mk2 fuselage.\n\nStill, that little bit of efficiency (less than 6%) would be quickly gobbled by the 4 tons of ISRU module and any support modules. You need about 33 tanks to break even! At that point, you won\u0027t be able process ore fast enough to meet engine demands.\n\nThis is only useful if your mission calls for the ISRU to begin with. That\u0027s limited to SSTA, asteroid redirect, and other infrastructure independent vessels."}]}
