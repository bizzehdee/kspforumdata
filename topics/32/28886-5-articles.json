Asparagus is one of the most efficient staging methods when considering delta-v, mass and TWR. TWR (or TMR) was left out of this consideration on purpose. In any onion or asparagus staging that preserves centre of thrust and mass, two fuel tanks need to be dropped at each stage. In serial staging only the dead\u00A0weight of one near empty fuel tank needs to be dragged along until each separation, thus making it slightly more efficient in terms of delta-v.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, asparagus staging is the same as serial staging - the only difference is you save on engine mass with asparagus, assuming you have a TWR (TMR) goal of some kind.\u00A0 If you do have a TWR goal (say in a lifter that puts things in orbit from KSC), your ship will have to have enough engines to lift the current stage and ALL the stages above it in a serial stage design, but an asparagus will only need to have enough engines to lift the CURRENT stage (plus some tiny fraction of the payload), greatly reducing \u003Cem\u003Eengine\u003C/em\u003E mass required.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd, let\u0027s be honest, there\u0027s always SOME floor to TWR/TMR you wouldn\u0027t want to cross.\u00A0 Ships in that are landing have to have a TWR larger than 1 (it doesn\u0027t have to be a lot larger - but it does have to be \u0026gt;1.0 by touchdown or else you\u0027ll have to rely on lithobraking), obviously, as do ships launching from a planet, but even ships in orbit face constraints.\u00A0 Oberth isn\u0027t a friend for a real life ion drive.\u00A0 Even in KSP, periapsis kicking can only take you so far.\u00A0 You only have about 1h30m when crossing Moho\u0027s SOI.\u00A0 And if you got your TWR/TMR low enough, eventually the phantom forces that exist in ships would be too great for your engines to overcome, and you\u0027ll find that you can get to where you want quicker by turning your engine off and letting those phantom forces carry you (and they may very well be opposite to your line of thrust.\u00A0 Probably opposite, in fact.\u00A0 Murphy is quite mean)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222501060\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002228886\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460068514\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133850\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wumpus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2016-04-07 at 6:35 PM, wumpus said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore 1.0, traditional onion made zero sense. \u00A0By \u0022traditional onion\u0022 I mean drawing from multiple fuel tanks (more than one pair) and feeding multiple engines. \u00A0You would always get more delta-v (and higher TWR) by grouping the engines together and dropping each pair of fuel tanks as drop tanks, and then finally dropping all the engines along with the final pair of drop tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUhh, what?\u00A0 While a drop tank ship with a single terrier would have more delta-v than the same ship with terriers attached to each tank, but I really doubt that a poodle ship could do the same (a poodle being roughly the same as four and change terriers.
