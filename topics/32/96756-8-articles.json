So there\u0027s your \u0022easy\u0022 level of difficulty. The \u0022medium\u0022 level would be the new aero coming out. And then there\u0027s FAR for your \u0022hard\u0022 level. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake one system that can be modded up or down.

Even before I tried DRE I always played as if heat was a factor. Even if your not with some lolcraft do you just let it tumble wildly or fly into an atmosphere prograde?
