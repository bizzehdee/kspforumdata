You could play it where Kerbal death is not permanent or you could play your career in a \u0022hardcore\u0022 mode.

It would make us have to send propes in places of capsules as the rockets have a tendency to explode.

They could implement it in so many different ways. I think it just adds something to the game. And I\u0027d like to see it as a mode, so you are not forced to play it that way, but I\u0027ve really enjoyed the permadeath in other games.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T15:29:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis should be under the suggestions forum really, but I think it\u0027s a good idea for career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iamaphazael","CreatedById":49843,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T15:35:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI also expect that perma-death will be a base feature of career mode. Since Kerbals will eventually have skills that will improve over time, it makes sense that if you kill one, you should lose all the work you\u0027ve put into it. Since there is only a finite number of names available, they could handle duplicate names by appending suffixes (so when you kill Ferlorf Kerman, you eventually get his son Ferlorf Kerman Jr., then Ferlorf Kerman III, etc). Or, they could let duplicate names happen and just reset the stats.
