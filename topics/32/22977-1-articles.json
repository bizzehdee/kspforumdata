He was rather displeased that Kerbal Space Program lets you get away with ignoring aerodynamics, and just slapping MOAR BOOSTERS onto something (like my rover with its big \u0022heat shield\u0022 plate) and pushing it into space. For the record, he was not complaining about my mission in particular, just in the lack of proper aerodynamics in KSP. The offending image is shown below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/09tp60D.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002209tp60D.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first thought was, \u0022What must this guy think of the monstrosities used to loft those huge rovers with the giant wheels?\u0022 My second thought was, \u0022Don\u0027t I at least get points for bothering to include a \u0022heat shield\u0022 in anticipation of the time when we will all face the perils of deadly reentry heat?\u0022 My belated third thought was, \u0022Well...he has a point..... so how do we go about fixing it?\u0022 I wanted the wide wheelbase for the Fido so that it would be very stable and safe for kerbals to drive at high speeds across alien landscapes (because...you KNOW they are going to). So how could I get my wide rover into a smaller living space? By folding it! NASA does this sort of thing all the time. But how to unfold a folded rover? I used the cool Damned Robotics mod. Specifically, the \u0022door hinge\u0022 part from that mod pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is my folded Fido rover with its \u0022heat shield,\u0022 sky crane lander, and token nose cone. I didn\u0027t actually make an aerodynamic shroud for the thing (you can just picture that running from the base of the nose cone to the heat shield. And you can picture the heat shield as nice and round with an ablative coating (instead of something I kludged together from plate structural parts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LUEQBgb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LUEQBgb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst lets get rid of the nose cone. A decoupler and two sepatrons take care of that. You can picture the aerodynamic shroud that you were picturing splitting in half and blowing away, too (you didn\u0027t know this thread would involve all this reader participation, did you?). One of the sepatrons is canted sideways by one tick to make sure the nose cone gets out of the way of the rest of the vehicle (it crashed about 500 meters away).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7fNa2Fc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227fNa2Fc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe animated GIF below shows the two sides of the Fido unfolding. I have this action of the hinges controlled by the 0 key (Damned Robotics\u0027s little control panel lets you specify what keys to use for a hinge or group of hinges in the VAB). The rover actually appears on the launch pad unfolded, so I needed to fold it up before showing it off or launching it (using the 7 and 9 keys).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NwsuRhM.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022NwsuRhM.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, four more hinges are called into action with the 8 key to swing out the wheel mounting plates.

So the sides of the rover can only be partly deployed under the operating sky crane. Below you can see the sky crane hovering the Fido over the KSC during a test flight. Sure, you could mount the sky crane engines further out to prevent this, but I wanted a sky crane that would fit inside the imaginary aerodynamic shroud, and which would also be protected by the heat shield during reentry. So I\u0027ll live with this partial-deployment limitation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TYlCJEM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TYlCJEM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the next picture, I\u0027ve dropped the heat shield so I can set the Fido down with the sky crane. I also deployed the wheel mounting end plates fully before dropping the heat shield.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jOy13il.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jOy13il.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the Fido is set down in its partially-deployed condition, and the sky crane has flown off, the side pieces of the Fido can be deployed the rest of the way. Note that you do not have to deploy the sides completely: If you are going to be driving over some rough terrain, you can dial in a higher ground clearance (at the expense of a little narrower wheelbase).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w7Pn4ei.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022w7Pn4ei.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are two pictures of the fully-unfolded Folding Fido. I was worried that the hinges might not be very strong and the whole thing would just flop to the ground, but the hinges are quite sturdy. You can see them flexing a little when the rover hits bumps, but I was pleased with how well they held the rover in its shape. The Fido is very stable and corners well at speeds of 23 m/s (with its ASAS on). Hmmm...I should have deployed the ladder (it\u0027s in the nose of the capsule). And I see that I forgot to remove two of the solar panels from the center plate on the right side (where they would be susceptible to damage by the engine blast...I removed the two on the left side). The Fido has four RTGs and two of the Z-500 battery banks, so it can drive some distance even in the dark (but would need to stop and rest occasionally). The Fido has a couple strategically placed small I-beam pieces on the underside to protect the more fragile parts if the rover gets bonked on the bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6YxVMju.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226YxVMju.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qvI0g7x.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022qvI0g7x.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow we see the Folding Fido payload on top of a unnecessarily powerful booster that could probably send it most anywhere in the Kerbin solar system with its nuclear transfer stage. I\u0027ve already folded up the rover so you can picture the nice aerodynamic shroud enclosing it. Go ahead. Picture it. Smooth. Nice curves.

All parts of the Fido and its sky crane lander are protected by the heat shield (as long as you keep the heat shield pointed in the retrograde direction). You don\u0027t get the blazing white-hotness of an Eve entry, but the heat shield is working well. You can imagine the smell of charred ablative material now if you are still playing along.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PbTMYNK.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PbTMYNK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Xtcs96f.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Xtcs96f.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow: dropping the heat shield.

Its sky crane is ridiculously overpowered for Minmus... when I separated it after landing the rover, the sky crane spent many minutes thrusting at low power, very slowly tumbling, and it couldn\u0027t seem to decide if it wanted to end up in a high orbit around Kerbin, or escape into Kerbol orbit. In the end, it escaped. The Fido worked fine...and I could make it hop upward quite a ways just my partially folding in its wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FRYabSd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FRYabSd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made some modifications to the Fido to make the sky crane/heat shield/nose cone arrangement a little more compact and a bit lighter. Below is the modified version folded and unfolded. I also have the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.mindspring.com/~sportrocketry/ksp/foldingfido.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E.craft file\u003C/a\u003E for the payload posted. It requires the Damed Robotics Door Hinge part, and that requires that the MechJeb dll file be installed. The Fido has the hinges set to use the 7 key to fold in the wheel end plates (fold these in until the wheels are close together...it will be a greater than 90 degree fold), and the 8 key to unfold the wheel end plates. The sides of the Fido are folded down with the 9 key (fold them in 90 degrees), and unfolded with the 0 key. You may not want to unfold the sides completely if you want better ground clearance (especially if you want to drive using physical time warp...the hinged Fido deforms downward MUCH more under high time warp than the unhinged Fido KE it\u0027s based on). Using 4x time warp will bottom out the Fido even if you have a lot of ground clearance set.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MpNDKl9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022MpNDKl9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/R0ypjRg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022R0ypjRg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made the heat shield less dish-shaped.

Again, only partially deploying the sides can help, but 4x time warp is too much for this rover even then.

The interface of the Web page for making the fairings was pretty straightforward, but it took me a couple iterations to get the fairing the correct size (and even then it wasn\u0027t perfect because I had to mount it a little lower than I intended, since the base piece had to go BELOW the coupler for the second stage...otherwise it produces no thrust; I found this out the embarrassing hard way). Also, the fairing is a bit larger than necessary (and covers the heat shield that is also a bit larger than necessary... but that was lucky since everything was able to still fit after I needed to position the fairing a bit lower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zFxa3ot.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zFxa3ot.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere weren\u0027t any instructions available (since the instructions were just a link to a KSP Forum thread that had evaporated in the recent Great Forum Wipeout). I dropped the .dll file and parts folders for the fairing in the appropriate KSP folders and the parts showed up in my Structural tab... but couldn\u0027t figure out how to mount the fairings on the rocket. After several stumbles, I finally noticed the 2-meter base piece that was also now in with the Structural parts, and I was able to connect everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is the rocket on the launch pad as it first appears. You\u0027ll notice that the Fido\u0027s wheels (which have not been folded yet) stick out through the thankfully insubstantial fairing. I used the 7 and 9 keys to fold up the wheels. I could zoom in a get a clipped view inside the fairing to see that the wheels were folded in the correct position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xoXQv4l.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xoXQv4l.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is a picture of the liftoff. The rocket looks a lot like a Rocket Propelled Grenade...but it DOES look more aerodynamic. I guess I should have added nose cones to the tops of the boosters instead of leaving them embarrassingly flat. Of course, the fairing is there for aesthetic reasons only; it does not reduce drag in the current version of the program (and it does add weight). But it\u0027s there to be pretty. Admire it. Go ahead and complement it on its looks; fairings like to have their self confidence bolstered, too, you know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sYvIwcp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sYvIwcp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket I\u0027m using is my Reusable Rocket that has all of its parts recovered at the KSC. Below we see the side boosters dropping off at 18,000 meters, and then the sustainer can start a belated gravity turn. This is not an efficient trajectory, but fuel is cheap compared to rocket hardware. (Yes, I know those boosters will despawn before they land, but if you were to follow them down they do indeed land safely on KSC property).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mjIptYE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mjIptYE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the initial turnover was complete and the rocket was above most of the atmosphere (at around 45,000 meters), I jettisoned the fairing. As you can see in the image sequence below, the separation leaves a bit to be desired. The fairing halves don\u0027t blow away far enough, and they go scraping down the side of the rocket. Luckily the interaction with these ghostly parts has no negative effect on the rocket (other than maybe sending a chill down its spine). The departure of the fairing also reveals the upper stage that will boost the Fido to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, which was covered by the lower part of the fairing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/f7S7fWG.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022f7S7fWG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the rocket has achieved a stable 120-km orbit and the sustainer separates. (The sustainer will go on to retro fire and return to a landing at the KSC; this mission has left plenty of fuel in the sustainer\u0027s tanks that it will be able to do a landing on its rocket flame and not need its parachutes.) Meanwhile, the Poodle engine of the upper stage will push the Fido off to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yYYu0Iw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yYYu0Iw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere we see the upper stage firing again to put the Fido into M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar orbit (\u0022M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar orbit insertion? Moi?\u0022). I did the burn somewhat early just for the photo op of having Kerbin in the background. I presume NASA does not necessarily time their orbital burns specifically to allow for good pictures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iCNACyW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022iCNACyW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the far side of the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn was illuminated, I decided to land near the mouth of the big canyon that juts off the large Mare on that side. The upper stage engine was fired one last time to do the initial deorbit burn (so that it would crash), and then the Fido and sky crane separated. Below we see the Fido coming in along the canyon. The heat shield (useless over the airless M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn) has been jettisoned and can be seen heading off for its own impact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6AOssRL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226AOssRL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next picture shows the Fido just after touchdown as the separated sky crane heads back up under very low thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0ouBoI5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220ouBoI5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the Fido is off to explore the canyon! Driving is certainly easier on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn than on Minmus. I was surprised at how hilly the terrain was outside the entrance of the canyon (I couldn\u0027t even see the mouth of the canyon from the landing site because of intervening ridges). Note that this version of the Folding Fido has two single-kerbal capsules, but this was an unkerballed mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mPBiXqZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mPBiXqZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter I was driving along for a few minutes, I heard the (rather obnoxious) noise of the little 24-77 engines of the sky crane. Uh oh...it was coming back in for impact, and was close enough to hear (not that you should be able to hear it on the airless M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn... but there\u0027s no uses screaming about that, since nobody will hear that in Space either). I zoomed out and panned around, and I was able to snap the picture below of the sky crane impacting over half a kilometer away. The Fido is the little thing in the center of the picture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uP4F926.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022uP4F926.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was generally driving along at about 22 m/s... slower uphill, faster downhill. I jacked up the chassis a little so that I could safely use 2x time warp while driving. Note that you aren\u0027t offered the option of using physical time warp on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn as you are on Kerbin or Eve, but you can force physical time warp by pressing the Alt and \u0026gt; keys. After several minutes of driving, I topped the last ridge and got a clear view of the canyon. I was a bit disappointed that I didn\u0027t see Scott Manley\u0027s M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn truck coming along hauling his moonbase structures to their new location...but you can\u0027t have everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DlWPaM4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DlWPaM4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.mindspring.com/~sportrocketry/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBrotoro\u0027s KSP Web Pages.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThatBum","CreatedById":57405,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T07:00:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome.
