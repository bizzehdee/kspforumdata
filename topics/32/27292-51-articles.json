Picketers camped outside the gates, as eggs and other rotten fruit was lobbed at executives and flight engineers alike. Babies were left abandoned in the streets! Really, it was horrible. It wasn\u0027t long before MI:KSC released an official statement that a rescue operation was underway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter making sure that the fuel lines were \u003Cem\u003Eactually\u003C/em\u003E attached this time, Bill Kerman set out solo a newer, modified version of the Munar Mission Package. The experimental Mechanical Jebediah Unit (or MechJeb, as it is well known amongst the flight engineers who built it) was attached to allow for the lander to land remotely, freeing up both seats in the ascent stage for Bob and Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/C8UxPFi.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022C8UxPFi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the technology was still experimental, Mission Control decided it would be smart to include a live pilot who is high on courage and low on stupidity to monitor its performance and take over manual control if necessary. If MechJeb botched the landing, Bill would have to take over remotely from the CM. This required an interesting contingency: because the mission planners had decided to explore Beggar\u0027s Canyon - inconveniently placed on the far side of the Mun - the lander could not be controlled remotely from mission control in the event something went wrong. In order to make sure Bill had the most time possible to react to anything that went wrong, the lander performed some brief maneuvers to place it just on the cusp of the CM\u0027s horizon. At the next passover, MechJeb took control and landed the ship perfectly. How perfectly?

I picked the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn as a nice close target to practice on. My first mission, Lunokkerbal-1 was an abject failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The crack design team decided to start from plans provided by the lowest bid contractor, who predictably failed to provide documentation for the design. The Kerbals designing the launcher failed to realize that the lander/rover design included a mounting truss block on the bottom of the rover and decided to improvise. They mounted a separation on top of the lander and inverted it, then mounted the whole contraption on top of a basic asparagus staged rocket - two sets of two boosters, one set feeding the second, with the second set feeding the somewhat larger core, with a small second stage on top of that. Simple and effective. Unfortunately, the combination of assembly errors in the VAB and confusion among the ground controllers from the upside down lander led to a suborbital trajectory and a rain of flaming debris about halfway around Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELunokkerbal-2 fared much better, at least at first. First off, the assembly crew must have gotten a good lunch during the off-shift, because they noticed that handy mounting strut block under the rover. So after it was uprighted properly and reattached to the booster, the controller crew confusion was prevented. Next, the earlier assembly errors were corrected (gotta remember to pay close attention to the placement of the correct Separatrons in the right places in the staging sequence). Rebuilt and improved, it was time to head to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn! Launching at the near-optimal phase angle, the mission looked great through the trans-M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn injection burn. Once we got into the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn\u0027s sphere of influence, things went south. An orbital insertion burn was planned but when it came time to maneuver to the prier attitude and burn, nothing happened. After much wailing, gnashing of teeth, and scratching of little green heads, it was observed that despite being well-provisioned with solar panels, neither the lander nor the rover were equipped with batteries. The entire outbound leg of the trajectory was facing almost directly away from the sun. D\u0027oh! So Lunokkerbal-2 is now looping around the Kerbin system in a highly-elliptical orbit. Barring a possible future collision with the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn some months or years hence, that\u0027s where it will remain, a hazard to navigation and a monument to oversight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELunokkerbal-3 corrected this flaw, and with gusto. The rover, the lander AND the upper stage of the booster were provisioned with battery packs, and an auxiliary articulated solar array was installed on the upper stage for the outbound leg of the voyage to ensure that the batteries remained fully charged throughout the voyage. Launch, orbital insertion and trans-M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar injection were carried out without a hitch. However, in their rush to correct previous errors and finally get an autonomous rover on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, the ground crew missed the optimal launch window but tried to brute force it anyway. This resulted in an empty upper stage combined with a trajectory that had a fairly low periapsis over the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn but on an escape trajectory rather than a stable orbit. In for a penny, in for a Kerbuck ... the ground crew decided to try anyway. The dumped the empty stage and tried to kill over 1,000 m/s of horizontal velocity and about 8,000 meters of altitude with just the four small lander engines. This did not end well; the remains of Lunokkerbal-3 are scattered over a 1,500 meter peak on the lip of a crater somewhere. Back to the VAB!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engineers tried the prevent this error in the only way they know how: brute force. The size of the booster fuel tanks was doubled. The core stage was increased in length by 50%. The fuel capacity of the upper stage was doubled as well. This time, the stars aligned and Lunokkerbal-4 made it into a nice stable low-M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar orbit with plenty of fuel to spare. Anxious to get their new toy on the ground, the controllers killed most of the horizontal velocity with the booster stage (still well-provisioned with fuel for the task) and began a descent from about 8,000 meters. The lander stage ran out of fuel maybe 20 meters above the ground but landed safely in the low gravity. Staging the now-empty lander was anticlimactic; lacking any fuel to fly away, the lander just sort of fell off the back of the lander, like the shell of a dead insect. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks a little sad there, but our rover is FINALLY on the ground, safe and sound, ready to explore the region for suitable crewed landing sites!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1342.photobucket.com/albums/o777/LameLefty/screenshot45_zps936172e5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot45_zps936172e5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elen Sila","CreatedById":72902,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T03:13:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPerformed a 760-m/s capture burn using only atmospheric drag (no engine thrust), managing to get within only a few kilometers of my desired trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s13.postimg.org/9isimu15j/2013_08_02_00016.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013_08_02_00016.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cesarcurado","CreatedById":60073,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T03:24:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESent Jeb on a one-way trip to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe sacrificed himself for the good of setting a flag, what a brave kerbonaut... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHis home is now a \u0022MK1 Cockpit\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, forget \u0022one-way trip\u0022, I will probably make a rescue mission, after all, Jeb is Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UkGOUwb.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UkGOUwb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VdkRsSw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VdkRsSw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uhZs8y6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022uhZs8y6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T03:26:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI put up the core of the Horizon refueling station in a separate save as I build infrastructure for my attempt at a grand tour mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-03T03:26:55Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2013 03:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Captain Sierra\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RexKramer","CreatedById":76862,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T05:57:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had Jeb test the limits of how long a space suit can keep a guy alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe had been on Mun for a while, I was going to bring him home.
