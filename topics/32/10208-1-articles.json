Land/parachute a craft somewhere to use as a target. I parachute command modules down, since Kerbals are cheaper than real targets.\n\n2. Launch the plane, .craft file attached.\n\n3. Fly to target, flies like a truck with the bombs on, treat it as such.\n\n4. Press \u0027G\u0027 to \u0027arm\u0027 the bombs, this just extends the lander legs for visual effect. Also the lander legs do explode, adding to the power.\n\n5. When close to the target, press the \u0027space bar\u0027 to release.\n\n6. Swivel the camera to watch the bang.\n\n7. Enjoy flying the plane now the bombs are gone.\n\nNotes:\n\nThis plane has an ASAS module, so make use of it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-30T13:31:19Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2012 01:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Rich**"},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-06T00:31:03Z","Content":"This is really cool.

Only had hits a few times, and they were on the Launch Tower because it has a purple attitude indicator on the navball. Level bombing is a real pain and doing it ingame gives me an appreciation for how accurately the real air forces did it before computers. I usually dive-bomb, but that has its own dangers because pulling up in the lagspike for loading up the craft you\\\u0027re bombing can cause backflips or no response at all."},{"CreatedByName":"Rich","CreatedById":17874,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-06T11:50:29Z","Content":"Modified original post with instructions and .craft file.
