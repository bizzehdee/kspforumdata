Windows simply uses too much ram. In this case \u0026gt; 2GB. it basically turns 4GB into 2Gb, 8GB into 6GB, and so on. Of course having a windows system with only 4GB is silly, you would have \u0026lt;2GB of effective RAM! On my linux install on by laptop (which has 4GB) The system uses around 500-600 MB of RAM, however on the mac side of the laptop, I can\u0027t run more than one or two programs at a time without suffering significant downsides. (The laptop is from 2011 however). The problem is that Windows and OSX use too much of the system resources. An OS should be out of the way, and use minimal resources. Those should be the number 1 concerns when building an OS. People use computers for the applications, the operating system should not be using precious resources that do not help the user and only get in the way of the applications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/rant]\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think its just my pc.

I did use quite a lot of mods at one stage and I\u0027ve never crashed from the RAM limit. I never used big visual mods or high graphics settings though. I never understood the point. Mods adding little details like clouds and light from distant planets I can understand, but improving parts and ground textures? Forget it. Then again, I do still play on my PS2. Sometimes I even play PS1 games. They would make even KSP\u0027s minimum graphics settings look good. Heck, there\u0027s even a (functioning) Nintendo Gameboy in a drawer somewhere.
