This was way back in the day (probably 0.21 or thereabouts) and I was still practicing my precision landings trying to land by the Armstrong Memorial, so I burned up a lot more fuel on descent than I planned to. Ended up not having enough left in my lander to even make it back to a low orbit barely above the surface features of the Mun. So I waited for my CSM to orbit around by the landing site, eyeballing it, and launched the lander into a sub-orbital arc that passed through the orbit of the CSM. I then switched to the CSM and pulled off a rendezvous and docking with the lander just before it reached its apogee and began its suicide descent back to the Mun. Used the fuel and the engine of the CSM to then boost both craft back into a safe Mun orbit about 7km above the surface. And I did it all on the first try, no save-scumming. Felt so awesome, I was happy the rest of the day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-17T12:32:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy proudest moment in KSP is when I learned there is a search function in the forums so I didn\u0027t have to start a new thread just because I wanted my name as the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
