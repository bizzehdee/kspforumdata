Like an upgrade from R\u0026D gives you a 15% additional protection on certain parts."},{"CreatedByName":"Nothalogh","CreatedById":139345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T03:33:53Z","Content":"Right, it\u0027s like the kerbals have no such thing as Titanium, Inconel, and other such scientastically magical materials.\n\nThe new wings survive Hypersonic flight just fine, but most of the legacy parts are made out of toilet paper.\n\nThe new Hypersonic intake is barely that, and the Turboramjets need a mode switch control."}]}
