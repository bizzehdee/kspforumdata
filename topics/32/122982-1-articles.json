Not worth it unless it is for extending operations. It would be more efficient to make a specific money making vessel for mining on the pad. I wonder how much you could make per mining operation on the pad at each level. Maybe it would be a good way to make money and level pilots. You could put on a science bay and do science while you mine or something. And see how much xp you get per pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-16T00:09:15Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2015 12:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
