It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s that time again, here with the general plan for 0.26\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut before that, let\u0027s talk about the 0.25 plan. As I explained in the previous version, we were showing you what we were trying to get into the game, I am happy to say we succeeded in most of this except for these two things. Call this a mea culpa. Or the best laid plans of Max and men. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Experience - We got the coding done on this part, the system is functional, Kerbals can log where they go and all that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 but we found the aspect of having to pay Kerbals per mission turned them from enthusiastic volunteers to mercenaries. Thus we decided to sit on the feature til we came up with a better approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMK3 Overhaul - We got the models done! We got most of the code done\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 but the scale of the overhaul didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t feel right. Going up a tier should feel like a sufficiently large upgrade, and as such it should have more options open up for you. Being as Porkjet was fantastic about adapting SP\u002B, we figured we could go even further next time around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever - we have a general plan to stick to, features to deliver on and motivational whipping sessions to hand out, so let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s talk about what\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s coming in update 0.26!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEditor overhaul - Boy has this one been a long time coming. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re improving part sorting, adding 3d widgets to make building way easier and overall make it a more pleasant, reliable experience. No more fiddling to get things to fit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Experience - We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re using the created experience tracking system to give Kerbals traits. These traits will level up as they partake in missions and accomplish goals, increasing the unique passive bonuses each Kerbal will be generated with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtra Contracts - We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re adding a couple new contract types. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re also integrating the related mod \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Fine Print\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 to stock. S\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2really good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBiomes Everywhere - Revising all of the old ones and adding new ones to every single planet and moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMK3 Overhaul - We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to be working with Porkjet to get as much of this as we can for 25. The general scope for this one dwarfs the content in SP\u002B, so we hope you can understand this one will take time. Attempts to clone Porkjet have so far been unsuccessful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpgradable buildings - The last big feature missing from career mode and the reason why our art team has been chained to their desks for months now. Every building is getting a tech progression path which will slowly unlock all of their current capacities and some new ones. Take your space center from an amateur project to a world class space center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/312-The-Grand-0-26-Plan\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/312-The-Grand-0-26-Plan\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking good!
