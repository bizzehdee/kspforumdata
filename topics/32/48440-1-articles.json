I imagine that there is going to be some unique flavor text that provides science depending on what sort of experiments are done where.

It should be handled similarly to how the anomalies are handled on the wiki.

I have said elsewhere that I think a kind of museum building that houses all of the data you have discovered about the different places in the solar system should be added later on. I think of something like the museum in\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/1n78hta6SxI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E.

I\u0027ve tried looking at the anomalies page and it provides way too little info to be of use in finding the anomalies. If I want to find anomalies I have to use youtube videos and hope they show the map view once they have arrived... My point is it was useless and I had to seek other means of finding the info I needed... the location marked on a map... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if such a thing were to exist... the anomalies page is not at all what I\u0027d want it to be like.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T04:25:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I\u0027d rather replace the green goo.

We know there are a certain number of instruments and that you get different results in different contexts. I assume the combination of those two lists--instruments and contexts--yields something like all possible unique observations by instrument. It would be fun to try to complete the list (even in sandbox mode) or to complete it for a given planet or satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
