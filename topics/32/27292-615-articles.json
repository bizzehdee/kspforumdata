A somewhat overoptimistic and incautious approach to Duna almost resulted in disaster when the edge of Ike\u0027s SOI was clipped, and a burn happened in the wrong place pointing in the wrong direction and durned near threw my probe out of the Duna system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily, my probe was so over-engineered (erm.. due to slapdash design, not intent!) that Mission Control was able to get it into a highly elliptical orbit about Duna, then deliberately use Ike to imrpove the orbit and get back some of the dV used to prevent the provbe going into Kerbol orbit. Happily, this resulted in a better inclined orbit than was expected, and the service module was easily able to alter the orbit to an 87 degree inclination near circular orbit at just below 200km. The orbiter probe, Duna Surveyor, was then uncoupled from the rest of the craft, and both radar and photographic mapping of Duna\u0027s surface began. The lander, Duna-Explorer-1, was then placed into a slightly lower orbit, to avoid potential collision with Duna Surveyor, and Duna-Explorer also started radar mapping the surface of Duna. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the entire planet has been mapped, a landing site will be chosen for Duna Explorer 1, and a landing attempted.
