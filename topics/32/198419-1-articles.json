Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E crew shuttle that works exceptional on Kerbin, a couple CTOL demilitarized fighter jets for escort/surveying (ok, really cause who doesn\u0027t want fighter jets in space), and a V/CTOL cargo transport to transport supplies between islands/bases.\u00A0 This has about 30 min \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and

looking around on the Kerbal Maps website for a good location: one that has a fairly flat slope, low inclination, and decent proximity to other islands/biomes.\u00A0 This will support both an airbase and support vehicles as well as a spaceport for heavy orbital cargo missions, and serve as an infrastructure hub for auxiliary bases around Laythe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI came up with the area around the co-ordinates 5\u00B0 N, 187\u00B0 E, since it looks like a low slope area of decent length from the survey data provided at\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://ksp.deringenieur.net/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Maps\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0 The desired terrain also runs in the E-W direction which is optimal for re-entry.\u00A0 Has anyone else attempted this who can provide input?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I want to mention that since there are a few different islands nearby, I\u0027m planning on using one of the fighter jets to so some

map, I don\u0027t know if there\u0027s a much better area than the one you picked out, but a possible alternate location could be the peninsula between the two\u00A0bays at 1deg N, 192deg E, which is much smaller, but closer to the equator while still being relatively large and flat. Brotoro built is base on that site in his old \u0022Long Term on Laythe\u0022 series, so if you look that up, you can check out what it looks like on the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
