How much Time zones we are covering here? I don\u0027t know. At least it is a lot! It\u0027s hard to find a specific item back at the KSPTV stream. KSPTV is for me a weird stream because I almost never can watch \u0022live\u0022. I have a different timezone, and there for; it middle in the night, or very, very early or something. My problem with Twitch is, is so focused to watch it live. To watch it right there, right now. With the live chat and all. You guys need to figure something out for the people who aren\u0027t live to have the same broadcast experience as the people who are live. If i DO find a specific stream back, as I said before -not easy to find- than I have a stream with multiple questions, explanations, interaction or whatever to the people who where their live right on the spot without a chat or anything on screen. The old setting was easy. Mondaynight, and Friday night. If you missed it, you could find it easily back. This, some sort of 24 hours live stream is a good thought, but you guys forgetting the time differents.
