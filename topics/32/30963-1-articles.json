Got up there just fine. Looked at his fuel gauge, waves a cheery farewell to the space center and promptly plots a free return orbit round the mun at an altitude of approx 6k or so at PE. While scoping out the scenery, he spots an arch on the east side of a large crater in a somewhat smaller crater shaped somewhat like a teardrop. Naturally, not quite believing it, he rubbed his eyes and looked again, yep still there. Dang, forgot the camera.. Couldn\u0027t wait to get back into radio range to report this amazing find, but low and behold, along the north edge of another large crater (and this is the one I am familiar with) he spots another. A 2fer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Upon returning to kerbin and reporting these amazing things to the space center, which they listened to with some skepticism, they decided to launch a few probes to shut him up about it. Probes are currently in route.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Upshot is, has anyone else ever run across a second arch on the mun? Is it just an occasional glitch?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"paleorob","CreatedById":60059,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T18:47:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThese things and more wonders await you on the surface of Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rryy","CreatedById":57357,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T18:47:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are actually \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FFFFFF;\u0022\u003Ethree\u003C/span\u003E different Mun arches on the Mun, and they are not glitches.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-02T18:47:57Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2013 06:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by rryy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EHid the number to prevent spoilers.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Procyon","CreatedById":57510,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T18:48:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI did not know that..
