Also, for those considering purchasing the game, we will maintain this promise for all purchases made until the end of this month (April, 2013).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease don\u0027t fill the thread with \u0022speculation\u0022.

It keeps track of damn near everything else, and at the very least they\u0027d have your credit card transaction on file. Also, given Squad\u0027s plans for in-game Spaceport integration, I would imagine they\u0027ll set it up so that you can also purchase any DLC or expansions through the same interface. Since at that point they\u0027re already connecting to their own servers, if seems logical to me that they will, at the same time, check your eligibility through Steam as well as their own stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, keep in mind, Squad is basically just a bunch of gamers.
