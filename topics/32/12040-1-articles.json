It\\\u0027ll take off, barely, on its two standard airbreathing engines, then once I\\\u0027m over water I\\\u0027ll kick on my four ramjets. At 10km up, I\\\u0027ll shut off my jets, running only on rams. Using this configuration I can fly for... a long time, probably even do a circumnavigation if I\\\u0027m careful, at heights of up to 16km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, there\\\u0027s my problem. See, this is supposed to be a *space*plane, so I want to go to space. I ripped out a couple of my jet fuel modules, replaced them with stock rocket fuel and the gimballing engine, and hooked it up. 16km up, doing about 400 m/s... good. Rocket ignition!... which leads to horrible over-lift, or something, and me spinning wildly out of control after I hit about 500 m/s. Usually, this ends with me desperately trying to pull out of an uncontrolled spin as I plummet back to Kerbin, half the time succeeding, half the time dying horribly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat can I do to make my craft more stable at.. what is it, exactly? High elevations? I did put RCS on it... High speeds? Is it just because it\\\u0027s so freaking heavy? As a side note, is there any way to manually turn off rocket engines the way you can airbreathing ones? Thanks guys!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G Addict","CreatedById":2730,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-03T22:03:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor shutting off rocket engines, try disabling flow of fuel through the tank the rocket is mounted on. I think that should work, though by the looks of it shutting off the rockets in this manner will also kill the jets. The reason you\\\u0027re getting stability issues is because rocket engines are very heavy compared to jets and your control surfaces aren\\\u0027t enough in the extremely thin atmosphere to steer the plane, which is made worse by the rockets burning far back from the centre of gravity. You should be good if you put stupid numbers of RCS thrusters on the plane but I don\\\u0027t like that solution. Try going easy with the throttle on the rockets until you\\\u0027re out of the atmosphere - IIRC it\\\u0027s more efficient to go relatively slowly in the atmosphere, then punch it once you\\\u0027re out anyway, plus the lower speeds will stop air resistance messing with your trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr_Orion","CreatedById":22245,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-03T22:03:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry using a lower throttle when you ignite the rockets, maybe 1/2 throttle or so.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ydoow","CreatedById":10165,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-03T23:28:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMeh, I don\\\u0027t like spaceplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy problem is that my payload, a 2 liquid tank rocket with gimballing can\\\u0027t pull it\\\u0027s heading above the horizon, and slowly slips back down to the sea...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver-lift is interesting though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe air is really thin, so definitely depend on gimballing rocketry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it is the wings, you could try shedding them, or put the rocket engines above the center-of-gravity on the plane, so it will push the nose down on ignition.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"E.

Steering with delicate dabs on fine setting (capslock toggles this and the pitch and yaw markers turn blue to indicate it is active) can help avoid oversteer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf trim is zero and you are still pitching up then you either have excess drag, maybe on top or possibly a bit on top and more at the front causing any deviation to be magnified, (or you could have wings too far forwards or a wing part at an angle or have the rockets below the center of mass.) In your case imho the canards are quite far forwards and you need to try to bring them back as far as you can. If the plane wont lift off without them forwards then you can try bringing the main wings forwards a bit and move the canards back as far as you can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a time between ignition and 30,000m altitude where the ships can be very tricky to steer, but after 40km it is all rocket and you can begin to ignore aerodynamics entirely. However I think the wings on yours are above the line of rocket thrust and in rocket mode their mass and that of the fins will tend to tip your ship upwards very slightly in rocket mode but you should be able to counter that with manual control. If you can fit an ASAS on there it will help a lot. I find its very tricky to fly in KSP without an ASAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimho\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
