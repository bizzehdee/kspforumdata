KSP drag increases with speed until you break Mach 1, then it tapers off. Maybe your plane was barely able to break the 380 barrier before, and the chutes add enough drag\u002Bmass to prevent those faster speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not uncommon to build a plane that can\u0027t go much past 380, then remove or rearrange parts or reduce mass and then the plane can go far past 380. KSP planes rarely have a top speed in the 400-499 range. This drag quirk causes KSP planes to be either stuck below 400 or they can reach 500\u002B.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTips for KSP drag and supersonic flight:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTry a 3 to 5 degree angle of incidence for your wings with the \u00223\u0022 rotate tool in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E. That will help the wings generate lift and let the higher drag parts remain more level for less total drag as you reach supersonic speed.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPress F12 during flight to toggle red drag arrows. That will give you a rough idea of the relative drag of parts. It\u0027s not perfect, though, because the arrows from a very draggy nose part might be hidden inside the main fuselage.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe alt-F12 debug window lets you turn on the aero GUI to show more detailed drag numbers.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jeancallisti","CreatedById":94406,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-03T18:05:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mahnarch","CreatedById":114432,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-11T01:36:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you tried... a whole lotta floorin\u0027?!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022kRS9pJt02glxUPY9HJ4sy3UGkgc=.gif\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002275.00\u0022 height=\u0022360\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022 src=\u0022https://frinkiac.com/video/S09E25/kRS9pJt02glxUPY9HJ4sy3UGkgc=.gif\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-13T11:06:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes the same thing happen with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
