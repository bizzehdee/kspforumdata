Probably fine though; it IS green outside.\n\nJeb: That it is. \\*steps outside, air escapes, everybody asphyxiates\\*\n\nA reading of zero is still a reading.."},{"CreatedByName":"Caelib","CreatedById":59329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T12:59:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Actually you couldn\u0027t use the PresMat in space *at all* before.
