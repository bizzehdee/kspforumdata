My friend mentioned that if you purchase through the site they have older versions available and it\u0027s DRM free. So I went ahead and bought a copy on the KSP Store today too. There\u0027s only download links for 0.19.1 and 0.20.2. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E Is there a way to get a copy of 0.18.3? There\u0027s some space ship designs/mods from that version I\u0027d like to play with.
