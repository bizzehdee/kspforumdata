You shoud go with at least six cores, otherwise you will have to upgrade again in the near future. I would look for a Ryzen 1600/2600 (or better) on a B450/X470, those should be available quite cheap while still offering a significant upgrade in performance. This should be bundled with 16GB DDR4 Ram, idealy with 3000MHz or more (although you may need to use it at a lower speed with Ryzen 1000/2000). The best thing: You can later upgrade that CPU again for a 3000 or 5000 series CPU without changing the motherboard by just updating the BIOS. If you are lucky you may be able to find a used Ryzen 3600 within your budget, go for it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"paul_c","CreatedById":208135,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-09T21:07:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe case may be okay - depends how big it is and whether it has fitment for standard size, eg 80/92/120/140mm fans.
