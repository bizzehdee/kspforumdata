Terrain in the game is created from basic heightmaps which, while convenient, makes it impossible to add any kind of overhang without adding some way to represent them on a heightmap. Even if you do find a way to deform the terrain mesh to create them, Unity\u0027s terrain systems probably gets some performance enhancements by assuming that there are no overhangs in the terrain. Creating overhangs could cause some interesting bugs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jonasrosland","CreatedById":140857,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T22:36:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps by modifying something like the arc on Mun and put it on top of the planets plane?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T22:52:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jonasrosland\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jonasrosland\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPerhaps by modifying something like the arc on Mun and put it on top of the planets plane?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s what I mean by \u0027surface features\u0027.
