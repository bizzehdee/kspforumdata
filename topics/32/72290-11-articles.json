That\u0027s not the fault of the mods, it\u0027s more the fault of KSP (or possibly Unity). Text files are big and slow to parse compared to other more compressed/compiled methods, but text files is what we have. They do have the advantage of being user readable and editable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETextures are also very large and the game loads all of them \u0022up front\u0022 rather than on demand. It doesn\u0027t use thumbnail pictures in the VAB or SPH, the parts UI is actual renderings so all the parts have to be loaded up front rather then when they actually get put on a craft. This of course makes the loading slow because of all the work that needs to be done. It would be nice to have a more \u0022load active parts\u0022 functionality, maybe someday Squad will work on that. You don\u0027t want to load completely on demand because that would cause lots of apparent \u0022lag\u0022 but you could load only the parts in active flights when the game is loaded and then load on demand when new parts are put on crafts in VAB and SPH. That would be the ideal method, but again parts would have to have thumbnails added to them for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo back to the orignal question, no 64 bits will have nothing to do with the game load time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-25T15:04:41Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2014 03:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Jedi Master","CreatedById":57348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T15:19:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, at least I\u0027ll be able to get those mods I\u0027ve been to scared to get before. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T15:22:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Jedi Master\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The Jedi Master\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, at least I\u0027ll be able to get those mods I\u0027ve been to scared to get before. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo need to be scared of them, just don\u0027t go overboard on them, especially the larger parts packs.
