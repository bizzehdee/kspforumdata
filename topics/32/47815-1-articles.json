Now if you notice his avatar is gone, his custom community manager tag is gone and is replaced with Junior Rocket Scientist. I miss something? Does this mean Capt\u0027n is no longer the Community Manager? I checked the announcements section and there appears to be nothing stating any change. Here is me hoping he is not going to be like Damion.... This dude has been in the community for some time, would be kinda sad if he left.
