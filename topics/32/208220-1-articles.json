That is take the existing components and test them (i.e. engine in a test stand to obtain performance data, test launch escape systems, component arrangements and effects, etc.), starting with rudimentary engines (a V2 parallel), working through basic engineering and science progressing through to Kerbin orbit and science collection... I think you can continue with the path I am considering...Vikerbal, Kerssini, Kerbal Horizons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this a pipe dream?

Personally I don\u0027t have much ideas to give you, but maybe you should look into Aerospikes?

I believe with OhScrap you have to test parts (engine, parachute, antenna, etc) to increase their efficiency from 0 to somewhat over 50%, while with DangIt you start with 100% and the parts will slowly degrade so you have to repair them later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen of course you can still look for various (for example historical) tech tree mods as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheKrakenHerder","CreatedById":211017,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-27T07:00:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds like what you\u2019re looking for is Real Solar System, coupled with Realism Overhaul and RP-1.
