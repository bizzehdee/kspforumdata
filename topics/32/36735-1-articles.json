I pointed out that everywhere where we find liquid water we also find life. While H2O is not uncommon, the liquid form has only been found on Earth. Evidence suggests that it may have once existed on Mars, and there is a chance that it exists below the surface of other moons, but so far, it has not been found elsewhere. \u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think there\u0027s more than a chance, We\u0027ve got good evidience of water under the icy of \u003Ca href=\u0022http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/16nov_europa/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEuropa\u003C/a\u003E, and \u003Ca href=\u0022http://news.discovery.com/space/water-ice-confirmed-on-saturns-moon-enceladus.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEnceladus\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022stupid_chris\u0022 data-cite=\u0022stupid_chris\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWater is only a component to life.

But I will agree that water doesn\u0027t garentee life, now free oxygen? Unless you have EXTREME conditions it means life. Oxygen is far too reactive to just wait, it will bond with anything it can find. The only way you find a world with free oxygen is if it\u0027s being replenished.

Volcanoes primarily emit water vapor, carbon dioxide, and smaller amounts of sulfur dioxide and even smaller amounts of other gases. Laythe won\u0027t keep water vapor in its atmosphere as a gas (it will condense out into the oceans). You will get a small amount of oxygen from the photodissociation of a little water vapor, but not as much as you find on Laythe (all but a small fraction...maybe 2%...of Earth\u0027s oxygen comes from photosynthesis).
