In the SPH if you have a plane with wings that have engines and say elevators attached as sub-components and you remove and re-attach the wing using mirror symmetry, all of the symmetry for the sub-parts will be messed up usually defaulting to radial for some reason. Sometimes the settings for elevators will not be mirrored left-to-right causing the craft to go out of control, and if you have hot keys programmed the symmetry for that will be messed up as well - so if you have a hot key to toggle engines only the left (or right) ones will be activated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has been happening since before 1.0, but has not been addressed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJR\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
