High-end workstations had more, but they were too expensive for my budget. 32 GB would have been nice, because the nodes of the computer cluster I used back then also had 32 GB, and being able to run tests locally really speeds up development. Since then, computer clusters have gone on, while desktops have stagnated. In the cluster I\u0027m currently using, most nodes have 256 GB of memory, which I can\u0027t really match with any reasonable workstation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T14:03:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022*Aqua*\u0022 data-cite=\u0022*Aqua*\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E8 GB\u003Cp\u003ELooking at the results so far I\u0027m surprised that 16 GB seems to be very common.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESteam hardware survey in july \u002715 (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESource\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELess than 512 MB 0.01%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E512 Mb to 999 MB 0.17%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 GB 1.68%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2 GB 8.65%\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3 GB 12.27%\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4 GB 21.48%\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5 GB 1.33%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6 GB 5.73%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7 GB 2.56%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E8 GB 31.07%\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9 GB 0.07%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10 GB 0.31%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11 GB 0.14%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E12 GB and higher 14.51%\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost important RAM sizes marked by me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EWhile KSP isn\u0027t a super-flashy AAA title, it does demand a competent graphics card and benefits from a high-end CPU.
