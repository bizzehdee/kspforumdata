One of the requirements is to have a resource converter on the base. Yet in testing (and previous experience) the 1.25 meter ISRU doesn\u0027t count for some reason. This is a problem because 1. The 2.5 meter ISRU is bigger than I want. 2. I have a nice setup in which the 1.25m fits inside of a cargo bay for the planetary base mod so aesthetics would be bad (this is going to go on YouTube) 3. The 2.5m is bigger. 4. The contract doesn\u0027t specify which converter it wants anywhere. So this raises a question. If I fulfill all of the requirements, except the ISRU one, then should I just complete the contract via alt \u002B f12 or would that be wrong? I just want to see some other peoples opinions and ideas on the subject.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jetski","CreatedById":119969,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-07T15:38:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOption 1: Decline the contract, as you cannot complete it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOption 2: Clever engineering, make a way to bring the ISRU, even as a dead useless payload\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOption 3: Wait for 1.1 to drop as\u00A0they have fixed\u00A0the bug where small ISRU doesn\u0027t count\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOption 4: Cheat lol\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOption 5: Tweakscale ISRU down to 1.25.
