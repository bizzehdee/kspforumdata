Multiplayer just adds to the features already in the game without requiring an entire, game-changing set of gameplay dynamics. Resources can\u0027t do that without totally changing the way players interact with the game. \u003Cp\u003EYou see, what originally attracted me to this game was the fact that there \u003Cem\u003Ewere\u003C/em\u003E no resources in the game and that I could just go into the VAB and build a massive rocket with no regards for economic feasibility, health, or safety concerns, and (semi)realistically launch it into space. I mean, the way I understood that resources were to be implemented was that there was a finite number of resource X or resource Y or resource Z and you had to more or less \u0022craft\u0022 them together to create resource Q so that you could build rocket part W. Everyone\u0027s so scared of KSP becoming the next Minecraft, I don\u0027t see why we\u0027re so sad to see resources more or less be scrapped. It\u0027s Kerbal \u003Cem\u003ESpace\u003C/em\u003E Program, not Kerbal \u003Cem\u003EMining\u003C/em\u003E Program. I don\u0027t know, it\u0027s about creating and managing a space program, even in career mode. Space programs, as far as I know, do not have their own mining divisions. You don\u0027t ask SpaceX to go out and mine its aircraft grade Aluminum out of the ground. No, they buy it in its more or less \u0022completed\u0022 form and shape it to form the parts they need. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can always just slap together rockets in sandbox.
