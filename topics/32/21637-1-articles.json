If a crew holding part does not have an internal mesh, the game uses the default interiors, which are the plain interiors you see currently. For example, the mk3 spaceplane capsule and the Crewtank mod both have the same three-man default interior, because neither have an IVA mesh yet. The mk2 cockpit uses the default 1-man interior.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"royalkingofgames","CreatedById":23658,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-08T06:46:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eapparently when i made a thread about this c7 only made mk2-3 placeholders so 0.17 could be released quiker\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"royalkingofgames","CreatedById":23658,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-08T06:48:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/22321-mk-2-cockpit-andother-cockpit-related-suggestions\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/22321-mk-2-cockpit-andother-cockpit-related-suggestions\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pingonaut","CreatedById":15723,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-08T08:06:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022royalkingofgames\u0022 data-cite=\u0022royalkingofgames\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/22321-mk-2-cockpit-andother-cockpit-related-suggestions\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/22321-mk-2-cockpit-andother-cockpit-related-suggestions\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s been said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the replies, looking forward for the IVAs to be added!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theflyingfish","CreatedById":17741,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-08T19:41:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you go into the KSP game folder, go into Internals, then into Spaces, you can see files for the Mk1 Cockpit, the Mk1 Pod, and the 3-man pod.
