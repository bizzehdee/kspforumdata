The new aero model is worlds ahead of the old one, the thermal mechanics have added new and interesting challenges, stock fairings are well implemented (confetti aside, hopefully that gets fixed), ISRU gives new options for mission profiles. There\u0027s still work to be done but the game is much better than it has ever been."},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T12:05:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ISRU gives new options for mission profiles.\n\nI especially love the ISRU\u0027s simplistic module configuration, which leaves it open for new custom resource implementation. Also changing the ratios to be proper."}]}
