Not a plan, but the only thing that keeps KSP interesting for me. What I do is I build a minimalist launch craft and send something to orbit, while writing down the cost and keeping it within budget. Nothing else I do other than that is fun anymore. I\u0027ve two saves, one where I don\u0027t care what I do, kill kerbals, destroy the world, etcetera\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eetcetera, and another where I have a permadeath type thing where I follow a strict budget (I\u0027d link if I could find it). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately I\u0027ve never gone farther that a hyperbolic orbit around Laythe. Or any closer than a couple million meters of separation with an Eve intercept. I wish I could go to Eeloo, and I\u0027ve always tried, but I\u0027ve found that getting into orbit was a drag. Or an atmospheric drag I should say. I\u0027ve built all of my rockets to be aerodynamic, in the hopes that KSP will one day have a realistic aerodynamics system (no, I don\u0027t Ferrams(?) Aerospace Research). Until then, very few of my rockets on my non-permadeath save are small. In fact, I don\u0027t think any of them are. It\u0027s always \u0022build up\u0022 or \u0022build out\u0022 but never \u0022build small.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suck at KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd CapriSun is awesome.
