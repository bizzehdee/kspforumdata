The launch time is about 8 min (MET Elapsed) ... so probably 16 min due to how slow my computer is. Air resistance can actually destroy the ship (even going a few m/s over).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, having to put together a 3,000Mg behemoth that takes ages to launch (although, I do feel that the launch feels a bit more spectacular)... not to mention that I ran out of room in the VAB several times and had to scale down a bit... for a mun landing... it does seem excessive for a game.
