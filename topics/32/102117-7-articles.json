Truthfully, I\u0027ve never been a big fan of sandbox games because I\u0027ve found that without some guidance or direction it can be difficult to think of new things to do. KSP (even with career mode) is an amazing sandbox game because it lines up for you so many accomplishments without really trying. For example, you start by getting into orbit, then the Mun, then Minmus, then other planets like Duna, Eve, etc. Then trying to land on those planets and return safely. Not to mention things like space stations, refueling stations, etc.\n\nAnd correct me if I\u0027m wrong, but wasn\u0027t KSP recently the top 10 most played game on Steam?

The one that will get heavily scrutinized and, for the first time, be considered a \u0022completed game\u0022 in the public\u0027s minds.\n\n**I don\u0027t know** ***why*** **they did this.** It seems as if there\u0027s more going on here than a mere \u0022Okay, we\u0027ve decided that KSP is good enough for sale.\u0022 (Although I\u0027m not going to go into conspiracy theories... they\u0027re not very becoming ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) )\n\nThat does strike me as strange, though.\n\nAt any rate, I think that 1.0 could have all of the features that the devs desire... as long as there are a number of previous versions. If they decide to go straight into 1.0 (which they apparently have), then it might be best to restrict the changes to what I said on my earlier post.\n\nDoes anyone know why they seem to be rushing through the development process? (Sorry, some people might have covered this already, but I\u0027m afflicted with a classic case of \u0022I Should Be Writing a Paper Right Now, so I Don\u0027t Have the Time to Look.\u0022)\n\n-Upsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"SickSix","CreatedById":119303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T17:48:02Z","Content":"After reading some other threads, 1.0 needs to include new advanced gimbal rocket engines we can use to make real shuttles.

Basically looking at the current feature list we need to look at our work in general and consider working on polish, bugfixing and balance in certain areas of the game instead of some of the new features we\u0027re working in. Going specific instead of going wide. We don\u0027t plan on stopping work at 1.0 at all, so we\u0027re maybe better off leaving some stuff for 1.1 and getting to work on the specifics of what can make the existing stuff in the game truly shine.\n\u003E We\u0027ve decided that the next release will be 1.0 because it accomplishes the goals we\u0027ve set up with the development of KSP from the very beginning, my question to you is whether you\u0027d prefer we try and add more features, or focus more on things like the aero overhaul, bugfixing and balance?\n\nThe way I see it you have 2 problems with a release. \n\n1. Those of us who have been playing a while and want to see more new features. We dislike the bugs but have learned to put up with them. \n\n2. Those who haven\u0027t bought the game which will be necessary to keep the company and the game afloat, because let\u0027s face it, we are no longer earning you money. Pure business there.\n\nThe problem here is that with 1.0 release, it needs to be flawless and fun at the same time. 1.0 means you are subjected to all the video game reviewers out there and if it doesn\u0027t work right without bugs you will be roasted to a crisp and may never recover. So, that said, in the interest of keeping the game going, bugs MUST be nearly gone before an official release and there definitely can not be any big ones. So, my opinion, work on the bugs, this thing has to be flawless or your going to be the next SimCity and nobody here wants that.\n\nThere is however one other scenario. There are a large number of people that buy games because they are pretty. Screenshots and videos for advertising prove this. While KSP is already very pretty, there is one proven way to make the screenshots infinitely more beautiful... CLOUDS! We need clouds. They have been proven by mods, for those with lower end computers you can have an option to not load the textures at startup, we need clouds. Nothing else, while I would like a lot more beautification I do not want to push it because of the above reasons and clouds will make the largest improvement.\n\n![891F8E44F372E6956B7AED527AE3347AED9BFB01](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/36352020317209117/891F8E44F372E6956B7AED527AE3347AED9BFB01/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-17T18:06:51Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2015 06:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"Amihan","CreatedById":111531,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T17:54:01Z","Content":"Just returned from the Steam review pages.

Bug fixes\n\n2. Polish and atmosphere\n\n3. Aerodynamic overhaul\n\nResources are, to me anyway, a complete non-issue. You could release those as DLC later as far as I\u0027m concerned. Female Kerbals are good, and easily introduced, but by no means critical. \n\nYou have to squash the bugs. We\u0027ve all been putting up with them because we\u0027ve all been aware that the game is in development. Once you call it 1.0 you\u0027re saying, \u0022This game isn\u0027t in development anymore.\u0022 Look at how many releases from major game developers have been savaged in the press because they were buggy on release. Why does Squad think that this won\u0027t happen to them?\n\nSame with the graphics. A lot of the graphics in the stock game look like placeholders. Again, we\u0027ve all been putting up with that because the game is in development. Reviewers and buyers aren\u0027t going to put up with that from a game that isn\u0027t in development anymore. Dress up your textures and make them consistent. IVAs for everything. Fix the water. Add some clouds. Maybe even add some weather. I might even point out that nobody is going to believe that Kerbals developed spaceflight without ever building a single structure on their planet except for their space center. I can\u0027t really speak to the sound quality, since I\u0027m mostly deaf, but I\u0027m sure the comments others have made are spot on. \n\nAnd the aerodynamics (including reentry effects). Right now, they\u0027re just embarrassing. You\u0027re fixing them, and that\u0027s good. However, you somehow imagine that you\u0027re going to get them 100% right, final release quality, zero bugs, on the first try, with no beta testing. It\u0027s a bit cheeky, don\u0027t you think? I really think you guys need a 0.91 release. \n\nMy $0.02, take it for what it\u0027s worth.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-17T18:58:45Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2015 06:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheSaint**\n  \nAdded some thoughts."},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T18:22:59Z","Content":"I will say this about 1.0.

To summarise my view on the matter, I would say:\n\nFeatures I think need to be in 1.0:\n\n1) bug fixes and polish. There are plenty of bugs in 0.90 that need sorting out, and things like tutorials and IVAs still missing. I would include balancing existing parts and the tech tree in this.\n\n2) aerodynamics. This change will make a big difference to gameplay, and will likely make craft that work today not work in future. It is important to make sure that craft that work in 1.0 continue to work in 1.x.\n\n3) re-entry. A core function of spaceflight, and something that if introduced later risks breaking people\u0027s save games, not something we want to see after 1.0.\n\nFeatures discussed for 1.0 that can safely be pushed back:\n\n1) in situ resource mining. The core game is building and flying space missions. Resource mining is a great idea, but isn\u0027t essential to the core game, and would work well as a new feature for a future update. I imagine the mechanics associated with this feature risk bringing in lots of bugs and will need a fair degree of QA and testing. Perhaps better to leave it for a future update\n\n2) delta V and engineering reports. Sure, it would be nice to have this information, and to have a \u0022checklist\u0022 when you build your spacecraft, but to be honest the game as it works now is \u0022good enough\u0022, and I would have no great upset if we had to wait for this polish.\n\nThe radical suggestion:\n\nIf you want to remove scope from 1.0, I suggest you entirely pull the Mk3 spaceplane parts from the game. Perhaps have a \u0022custom\u0022 option to \u0022use experimental parts\u0022 or something so that you can use them as they are in 0.90. Here\u0027s why:\n\nMk3 parts as they are need a lot of attention. The fuel tanks are not balanced. The cockpit and crew tanks need IVAs. The current wing sections and undercarriage are undersized and very difficult to use with these parts. The current jet engines are really too small, and you need 6 or 8 engines to get them to work. This is really kludgy. To make Mk3 parts useful in the way that Mk2 parts are, we need bigger wing sections, bigger undercarriage, better engine and air intake options, perhaps re-worked fuel flow mechanics, ideally wet-wings or other more radical parts (like thick wing sections that can incorporate engines and intakes in the leading and trailing edge segments to mimic engines burried in the wing root). Realistically to get Mk3 sized spaceplanes to work with the degree of intuitive construction and ease of flight. I think the whole Mk3 space plane building experience is at a level below that of other aspects of the game. Having a dedicated 1.x release of \u0022new bigger planes\u0022, with these parts done well, with the full range of functionality would probably lead to a better 1.0 experience than having the current somewhat incomplete state of affairs.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-17T18:35:16Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2015 06:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rcp27**\n  \ntypos"},{"CreatedByName":"Paul Kingtiger","CreatedById":57455,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T18:44:21Z","Content":"Polish is more important than wide scope.\n\nPlayers and reviewers are going to jump over bugs, so a smaller feature set which is well polished will make a better impression than incomplete features.\n\nThese can be left for 1.1"}]}
