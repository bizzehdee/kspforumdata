That\u0027s what \u0022better\u0022 means in the game dev world.

It\u0027s been pitched as a WIP, and I think people expect things to change in such a state. No one is proposing anything remotely as detailed as Orbiter. The things talked about are: an actual atmosphere (and aerodynamics), reentry with some possible consequence (vs none now), some corrections to math (Isp issue no one would notice much), and possibly some sort of life support (LS units consumed per guy, per day with a stock per CM). That\u0027s it. The last is a slightly scaled up Kerbin/solar system also proposed to balance the likely effects of an actual atmosphere---to make the game behave nearly as it does right now for existing players, basically (by definition a change you\u0027d hardly notice, and soon forget).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E1 foot shot by decreasing its accessibility to the masses, the other by never being more than \u0022Orbiter Lite\u0022 and thus alienating realism-mongers such as yourself. IOW, going from a large customer base to zero customer base. The masses would be turned off and the realism-mongers would go play orbiter. Bottom line is, you don\u0027t mess with what works, as has been shown over and over in the industry. Many, many games have yielded to pressure from folks like you and added stuff that made significant changes to gameplay, with the result that popularity plummeted and so the franchise died.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunny, I can think of many more counter examples. What games lost players because of too much realism? Are there any games that are actually too realistic? The Silent Hunter games are almost universally played modded, because they are dreck without mods (far too unrealistic to be interesting to anyone). Ditto AoE, etc. Il-2 was decently realistic, and virtually all players were for improvements to that, not asking to dumb it down. How about Pirates of the Burning Sea?

We are using computers, we don;t have to do that ourselves, we have a UI that allows us to pick an action, and we don\u0027t need to know all the nuts and bolts. Forming an orbit with maneuver nodes, for example. If the math changes a few percent behind the scenes, no one will ever know from the \u0022difficulty\u0022 of doing it, it\u0027ll just change the best design choices.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the thing, realism in the sense that all the \u0022realism\u0022 people are asking for is almost entirely realistic physics outcomes within the regime the game encompasses. That\u0027s it. The game need not encompass everything and try to be Orbiter, but what it does try to do, get the physics right.
