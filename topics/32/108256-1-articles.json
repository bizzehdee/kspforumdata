The first one, I\u0027d planned out a perfect aerobraking reentry into Kerbin from Mun orbit, told it to warp me to my final burn just after leaving Mun orbit. The timeskip then didn\u0027t pause when the mun caught back up with me in it\u0027s orbit, did a recapture into a crash trajectory, and then ate me, all at 1000x timeskip. None of this had been indicated until it was too late to save the mission, and the timeskip didn\u0027t drop back down to a usable timeframe (presumably because it was warping me to my next node).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second time I lost a mission to this, I\u0027d just completed my burn for orbital insertion into a low Mun flyby, with a circularization burn planned out. Told it to warp me to that node, then remembered there was some \u0027high in space\u0027 science I wanted to grab on my way out, so I hit escape. Suddenly, without any burns involved at all, I\u0027m now no longer on anywhere near the same trajectory. Instead of being into an orbital insertion for a 22km orbit around the Mun, I\u0027m now at an apo of 8 million km above Kerbin... and the game still says I have a node burn into a circular 22km orbit, even though my actual trajectory won\u0027t go anywhere near it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else experiencing this, or do I just need to reinstall.
