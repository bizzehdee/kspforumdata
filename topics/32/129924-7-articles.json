You will be able to get propelium all over than rock!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Kereze: A small rocky moon orbiting very close to the rings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Dool: A sort of mix between Eve and Laythe, but instead of purple, it\u0027s a dark brown-red color, like 0.17 Moho\u0027s color.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Bluto: Replacement for Eeloo when it becomes a moon. It is dark blue in color, with lots of terrain variation, and 3 moons, one of them about half the size of Bluto.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Derg: Charon analog. It is a rather bright red and light gray color, 1/2 the size of Bluto.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Toousen: Tiny asteroid, dark gray color, very eliptical shape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Vougg: Vulcan analog. I\u0027m not kidding, Pluto has a moon called Vulcan. But Bluto does not, It has a moon called Vougg. It has an easter egg on it that is a reference to star trek, such as a Delta Shied sculpted into the sand, or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Kasadre: A Sedna analog with a highly eccentric, Inclined orbit, at closest approach, 5 times as far away from the Neptune analog\u0027s apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-*- Frenemy: Nemisis analog, a brown dwarf star orbiting twice as far away from Kerbol as Kasadre\u0027s Apkerhelion, in a nearly eccentric orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Gurg: A tiny gas planet orbiting Frenemy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Surriurr: Bright star, large in size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Surriurr I (Doho): A planet with an atmosphere, and molten lava oceans. The oceans produce a light source, overheat parts, and otherwise behave like a more viscous water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Surriurr II (Sool): A huge red gas giant, otherwise known as a \u0022Super Jool\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Surriurr II.1 (Zilly): A small asteroid moon in a highly inclined orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Surriurr III (Herbadre): a highly eccentricly orbiting planet, ranging from 0.2 KerbAU to 1200 KerbAU. If possible, it would have multiple different terrains corresponding with it\u0027s distance from Surriurr.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHO","CreatedById":49070,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T19:35:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NovaSilisko\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NovaSilisko\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESome general concepts for changes and addition that are drifting around my head (\u003Cem\u003Enot to say this is the way they\u0027ll be though, we\u0027ve all gotta generally agree what to implement and this is just my take! \u003C/em\u003EPlus discovery mechanics and hence the rest of the system won\u0027t happen for many updates)\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJool\u003C/strong\u003E: Actually the second-smallest gas giant, with unusually large moons.
