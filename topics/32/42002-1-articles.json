Not being required to turn off SAS ever again was a really nice idea. However, the stabilizer seems to only work on aircraft. Now this makes some amount of sense to me, as flying through an atmosphere does seem to keep a jet or airplane stable because of the air pushing down on the craft in all directions when its going mach whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in space, it seems to supply too much force. When I which to change the position of the craft, it overshoots and goes back to nearly the original position. Of course, it only nudged slightly in the direction I wanted it to go. This makes me mess up very fine operations, such as orbital rendezvous. My friends often complain about this as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like like to know if this is intentional, or if I\u0027m doing something very wrong. For now, this is a very minor issue. I\u0027m not even slightly mad, just a tad annoyed and confused.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Levelord","CreatedById":57711,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T04:48:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt depends on how big your rocket is. Aircraft usually tend to be small and lightweight, so in addition to the buffer effect of the atmosphere, there isn\u0027t a lot of torque required to control the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERockets tend to be a lot bigger and massive. The new reaction wheel system functions by adding more torque to your craft the more reaction modules you add to your spacecraft. Having a single reaction wheel module giving 20 units of torque is often not enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne reaction wheel, 20 units of torque, add another you now have 40 units, add another, you now have 60 units. The more reactions wheels you add, the more stable your rocket becomes and the more responsive your SAS commands become.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding a ridiculous amount of reactions wheels, and you can even overcome the off-balance thrust in a space shuttle launch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/P4UJSNq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022P4UJSNq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GeneralHavan","CreatedById":58406,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T23:51:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut my problem is it applies far to much torque for its own good. I re-position the craft to a node, for example, and it just moves right back to the same position, only this time it\u0027s a bit farther towards the node. I feel like the movement isn\u0027t as stiff as it should be while in space.
