At one point I will use a different solar system, or at least additional planets, but I\u0027m not through with the stock system yet. Could this be some remnant of any stock elitism?

I used only one mod, and that was MechJeb, and now that\u0027s slowly becoming unnecessary. I used to use MechJeb to do everything for me -- but I\u0027ve since learned how to do almost everything manually, so I don\u0027t even put a MechJeb unit on my rockets anymore.

Making a good stock vehicle, I think, is more difficult than a modded vehicle, especially the challenge of making it look good whilst being functional.\u00A0Mods also make the game much more complex, often to the point that a lot of players cannot understand what is going on in the game due to the heavy modding. I personally like KSP because it\u0027s \u003Ci\u003Enot\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0amazingly realistic, and it\u0027s a lot simpler to think about than actual rocket science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeavy modding also means that every time the game updates, your save file is ruined until the mods you\u0027re using are updated, which may take a long time.
