Well the answer is simple, with a complicated story...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E One of my good friends and I both like the game and we had the idea of buying the game. So i gave her $15 ( when it was ) to buy the game. Everything was chill we bought two copies of the game. $30 to the Dev team right? Wrong! She pocketed the money and gave me a pirated copy of the game via flash-drive, I, thinking it was a legit copy, played the game, downloaded mods, and posted my ships on the forums like a good little Kastronaught. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Everything was peachy. Then update 0.17 came out, and I couldn\u0027t wait to play it. The questioned pirate had gotten the game in 1 our of release, impressively fast. That should have been Hint #1, but i was blinded by my love for the game and could not wait to play! So that Friday, she came over to my house and gave me the game. Hint #2, she didn\u0027t want to give me the info to his Ksp Store account so I can use the patcher. I asked why and she said \u0022Because I don\u0027t want you to buy more copies without my permission\u0022. Which is Hint #3, and the one that made me stop and think about this, she let me know the username and password to her amazon account. So I did a little snooping, and what I found was a Pirate Bay link to Kerbal Space Program 0.17. So I looked in the Google downloads and saw a torrent file of ksp 0.17 and 0.16. I was ...\u0022Speechless\u0022... She ended up giving the money back, but never paid for the full game. I would pay for the game but I don\u0027t have a credit card I can use having mine taken away for overspending and until i\u0027m 18 ( I\u0027m 15 ) I can\u0027t get a new one... -____- *. So I did the right thing and deleted the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are still friends but not as gamers anymore....

You are basically stealing other peoples hard work. A lot of games out there get pirated. Games that are in high demand, have DRM but are still popular are games that get pirated the most. I hate people who go onto forums and and start celebrating that they torrented a game. There is one game I own that has DRM. Many people on forums go and say that they will pirate the game. By paying for the game you are saying that you appreciate the developers hard work and you commented to funding the further development of this game or games to come. KSP is a game that I find hard to believe that anyone will pirate. Most people on the forums are decent people and respect the work that Squad is doing. Most people here respect the fact that this is a small company from Mexico and buy it to support Squad. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The only good thing I can see is that this case is a case of beginners pirating. I believe that there are two kinds of pirates in the world. Beginner pirates and professional pirates. Beginners spread pirated software though USB by simply copying files into it. Very common in schools and not very sophisticated. The second type is professional, these are the ones companies have to be worried about. They hack the software and turn it into a torrent to put up online. If the game needs a key, they can create a generator.
