Use the Orbital Operations AP, PE and CIRC buttons to achieve that.\u003Cp\u003EThere are 3 things to rendez-vous:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Altitude: Well, you need to have pretty much mastered circular orbits and changing altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Inclination: Look at the map, wait until you get to the intersection of both orbits and burn normal or antinormal (NORM\u002B or NORM- on MechJeb).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Period: The other ship is either before you or after you on the orbit. To catch up, lower your orbit. To slow down, raise your orbit. As you get closer, you need to reduce the altitude difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a bit of practice, this will get you within 5km. At that distance, forget about orbits, and use RCS for the final approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t use the rendezvous tools in the MechJeb, because they are confusing. Especially do not use the TGT\u002B button, because that just points you at the target and you lose any perception of how you are moving relative to the target (whether you are above it or below it).

This just forces your station/spacecract to hold a direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- go to the spacecraft you are approaching with, now turn ORDA ON, under tgt select your docking port, the station you want to dock with, and click the port you want to dock with.

If your ship goes north after passing the cross over, you will have to thrust southward at the crossover. Vice versa otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you are behind the station, make your orbit slightly lower than the station, then you will slowly catch up with it in timewarp. Are you ahead? go slightly higher, or wait to go all the way around in a lower orbit. up to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- When within around 10 km, You should be able to thrust straight toward the spacecraft you want to meet up with to get closer. At this point you should definately be able to engage ORDA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the last step is pretty rough, I never really think much about that part.
