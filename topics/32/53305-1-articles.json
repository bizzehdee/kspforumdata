Not for the creation of mystery goo, that is perfectly explained by your theory it is also backed up by a quote inside the game(The goo feels right at home(while it is in space)). The flaw is where does the goo come from before the kerbal is reanimated? Or where does the kerbal come from before it is turned into goo? Unless the goo is alive and replicates then turns into multiple kerbals rather than just one kerbal, then that would solve the flaw. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think your theory is right, seem to be clues pointing towards something like this in the game. Next question is, where do spacesuits come from? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
