It could be just a prob with my laptop display maybe because at night the screen is just black with the odd twinkle. I got a space plane lost about 100km north of the space center and it crashed because it ran out of fuel trying to find home. The reason I couldn\u0027t find my way back was because the map was black as well and there was no icon showing where the space center was. The Kerbal killed in the crash is lost for good too because I clicked on tracking station and lost my chance at reverting the flight, poor Valentina. Nighttime sucks in Kerbal Space Program. It was a good flight till I ran out of fuel, first time at 15km in a space plane.\n\n[http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=435639097](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=435639097)\n\n[http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=435638531](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=435638531)"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T01:58:11Z","Content":"So let me understand, you are upset because it\u0027s hard to see in the dark?"},{"CreatedByName":"somnambulist","CreatedById":62108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T02:04:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=435639097](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=435639097)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=435638531](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=435638531)\n\nThose look perfectly fine to me.

But I agree it can be hard to find KSC sometimes so what I do is put some markers (just very simple probes) in front of the runway. I usually put three; 500m, 1km and 1.5km away from the runway in a line, that helps you get lined up for approach way in advance and you can target one of them (double click on it) so it appears as a marker on your navball. You can also see it in map mode when KSC is in darkness. \n\n(I also put [flashing lights](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/417/Aviation%20Lights) on them, just because.)\n\nOr you could use the [Ambient light adjustment mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71536-0-24-2-Ambient-Light-Adjustment-1-2-0-Who-needs-lights-in-space-!). I think you can adjust light levels on the fly (pun not intended) with that."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T03:39:45Z","Content":"Sounds like your monitors contrast is off. I can see mostly at night when close to the ground. It depends on where I am and how varied the terrain is though. Dark side of the Mun can be quite a challenge... a welcome one. As for markers, you can use simple flag, I usually place one at the base of the big flag pole by the astronaut complex (I don\u0027t want it near the runway cause that would be really cheating in my mind). Or if you really want an elegant solution, the Waypoint Manager mod lets you set icons to appear.\n\nNavUtilities will help you find the runway if you are already close to it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T03:42:54Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 03:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T03:41:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Isn\u0027t that only when they\u0027re upgraded?

Not everybody is calibrated the same. That being said, you can increase the brightness on your monitor.. or you can download the ambient light adjustment mod, which adds a historically necessary feature to the menu of this game!\n\nwith ambient light adjustment, sometimes you will go with full brightness - other times you can dim it down to get that cool nighttime look, but i almost NEVER have it turned down to min - which is the stock setting. I even still put lights on my crafts for night time.\n\nanytime you see half decent night screenshots it\u0027s bc they\u0027re using ambient light adjustment mod.

I agree that the lighting is a tad dark on Kerbin, and a built-in marker for KSC is something that should be added to stock. For now do as other are suggesting, use a flag or two to mark the runway or get a mod to tweak the lighting. Also, even during the day, I use landing gear lights so that I can see how far away the ground is (assuming I\u0027m at all close), since it can be rather difficult to tell without more ground clutter."},{"CreatedByName":"rodion_herrera","CreatedById":66284,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T17:43:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So let me understand, you are upset because it\u0027s hard to see in the dark?\n\nLots of parallels with this remark.
