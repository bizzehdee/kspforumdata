It could be just a prob with my laptop display maybe because at night the screen is just black with the odd twinkle. I got a space plane lost about 100km north of the space center and it crashed because it ran out of fuel trying to find home. The reason I couldn\u0027t find my way back was because the map was black as well and there was no icon showing where the space center was. The Kerbal killed in the crash is lost for good too because I clicked on tracking station and lost my chance at reverting the flight, poor Valentina. Nighttime sucks in Kerbal Space Program. It was a good flight till I ran out of fuel, first time at 15km in a space plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=435639097\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=435639097\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=435638531\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=435638531\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T01:58:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo let me understand, you are upset because it\u0027s hard to see in the dark?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"somnambulist","CreatedById":62108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T02:04:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Donagh13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Donagh13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=435639097\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=435639097\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=435638531\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=435638531\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose look perfectly fine to me.

I usually put three; 500m, 1km and 1.5km away from the runway in a line, that helps you get lined up for approach way in advance and you can target one of them (double click on it) so it appears as a marker on your navball.
