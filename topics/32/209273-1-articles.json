Anyways, I\u0027m struggling to get the ring to work. At first I screwed up connecting it, and it make the whole space station spin. So I tried to fix it, and when I did, it didn\u0027t spin at all. And I\u0027ve been stuck there since, because I just put the game down. Anyone know how to get this to work?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-09T08:10:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey are tricky because you literally have no control over which part is going to spin. Unless I guess you put a dozen reaction wheels but I haven\u0027t tried that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your ring is in the middle, what you need is two rotors, one on each side of the ring, spinning in opposite directions, with the same rpm, essentially making the outside sections stable relative to each other (connecting both with struts help, as they don\u0027t break when eg. a structural piece holding the ring passes them)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did it here, and while you can\u0027t see it, it works.

My approach to get these things rotating is by switching reaction wheels on or off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo spin up, turn on all RW whose are part of ring, and off ALL the RWs whose are part of vessel body (RWs, command modules with RW integrated, all torque must be turned off). When your ring is spinning fast enough, turn off all RWs connected to ring and on all RWs connected to vessel main body. AG is your friend in this case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt worked for me even in my earliest rotary joints version, where front part, ring and engine section were totally independent, so I could rotate any of these three sections, still, when RWs are properly set on or off, only ring was spinning.
