I prefer refueling as a mater of preference because it means I have more freedom to design what I want, and not worry super hard about fuel capacity. Besides, it gives me a whole lot of ships to build and missions to fly on the side, so it keeps you busy.\n\nWith Kethane, I used to use a small refinery on the miner to top off it\u0027s fuel tanks on the surface, rather than use fuel refined by a station. I\u0027d have the rest refined by a station which was more efficient, but the refinery was also quite heavy. Planning on using the same setup with ore, though I think now I have to refuel with the stuff I refine in orbit, which is a pain (the drills seem to have a converter option, but I assume it doesn\u0027t work).

Was WAY too much work for too little benefit in almost all cases. It was always just easier to launch more fuel up from Kerbin and send it on its way. Heck, I had a space plane that could pull 21k LFO to a Kerbin escape if I wanted, so refilling my LKO or HKO (out past Minmus at maximum Kerbin orbit) stations was always super easy.. the stations could literally come back and land for more fuel, and they had a decent endurance out of the Kerbin system as well. While I can get most anywhere without refueling if necessary.. I do like to place refueling stations in a few places, and I had hoped this might provide an alternative method of setting up a station that had a somewhat longer lifespan for the extra work involved. Making it actually cost more fuel to set up than you can get by mining it is just silly - realistic or not (I don\u0027t know that we could even mine an asteroid for fuel..) it\u0027s a rather wonky gameplay design."},{"CreatedByName":"Aerindel","CreatedById":109952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T02:48:12Z","Content":"The way you would run out of resources in Kethane is why I switched to Karbonite, Bases didn\u0027t make any sense in Kethane. \n\nAnd neither do orbital refineries. Its expensive you move stuff around so it makes sense to move fuel rather than ore, or at least it should.

Running down and grabbing some fuel is pretty easy, while sending it out from Kerbin tends to be the bigger headache for me.\n\nI did get my orbital refinery and miner set up. The refinery made its way from Kerbin under its own power, while the miner took over once it hit Minmus. One load of 3000 ore was enough to top off the fuel tanks and mono prop in both ships, with a little left over. With my Atlas lifter, I should be able to carry up to at least a 60 tonne payload to a Minmus intercept using the lift stage, and I should be able to insert 50-55 tonnes right into orbit (if I can make the construction a bit more rigid). I figure that should be enough for one trip to refuel the miner and a couple arriving payloads, so I\u0027m pretty happy."},{"CreatedByName":"Caelib","CreatedById":59329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T15:17:12Z","Content":"I did this is exact same thing yesterday and my results were the opposite.
