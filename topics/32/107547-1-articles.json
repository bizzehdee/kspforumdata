Was WAY too much work for too little benefit in almost all cases. It was always just easier to launch more fuel up from Kerbin and send it on its way. Heck, I had a space plane that could pull 21k LFO to a Kerbin escape if I wanted, so refilling my LKO or HKO (out past Minmus at maximum Kerbin orbit) stations was always super easy.. the stations could literally come back and land for more fuel, and they had a decent endurance out of the Kerbin system as well. While I can get most anywhere without refueling if necessary.. I do like to place refueling stations in a few places, and I had hoped this might provide an alternative method of setting up a station that had a somewhat longer lifespan for the extra work involved. Making it actually cost more fuel to set up than you can get by mining it is just silly - realistic or not (I don\u0027t know that we could even mine an asteroid for fuel..) it\u0027s a rather wonky gameplay design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aerindel","CreatedById":109952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T02:48:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe way you would run out of resources in Kethane is why I switched to Karbonite, Bases didn\u0027t make any sense in Kethane. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd neither do orbital refineries.
