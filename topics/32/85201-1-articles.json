SAS can help with vertical asymmetry, but lateral almost always sends you into a flat spin and until that thrust is evened out that flat spin will be hard to recover from, at least in the real world. It might be easier to recover in stock KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVertical asymmetric thrust just forces the nose of the plane downward, SAS can correct it, but if you want to balance it there are various things you can do. You can angle that engine downward toward the CoM or you can make the resting angle of the ailerons raised, so when you take your hands off the keyboard, the ailerons are in a natural pitch up position, thus countering the pitch down from the engines. This is just for jet engines though, the only way I know of to counter rocket asymmetry is with more engines angling against the rotation. Those little orange radials are good for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, that was a little off topic but angeldust, you can see there are many ways to design a plane which is why even in the real world planes don\u0027t always look identical. The same is true for KSP and my personal opinion is you should do it however you enjoy doing it. If you like ejecting wings, do it. That\u0027s why I love this game, there are no wrong designs. There are more cost efficient designs, there are more fuel efficient designs, there are more balanced easy to fly designs, but none of them are wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-22T15:12:48Z\u0022 title=\u002209/22/2014 03:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
