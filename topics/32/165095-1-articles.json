It\u0027s fairly approximate, but it works well. An example of how it works would be with Duna: I\u0027d start out by sending a simple orbiter to low Kerbin orbit, and then using steps 2 and 3 I would find out that a Duna transfer takes about 1100m/s from a low Kerbin orbit. I\u0027d then send a flyby probe with slightly more than 1100m/s to fly by Duna, being sure to adjust the orbit along the way so that the intercept periapsis is at 60km (because that\u0027s where I usually leave motherships in Duna orbit). By making a node at that periapsis as if I were going to transfer to a circular orbit, I would find that it\u0027s\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eapproximately\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0650m/s (if I remember correctly) to reach a circular Duna orbit. Conveniently, this is also the amount of delta-v required to leave Duna on a transfer directly back to Kerbin, and similarly the 1100m/s is about what is needed to circularize back at Kerbin without aerobraking. Therefore the total round-trip delta-v is about 3500m/s, so if I were designing a reusable mothership to make the journey without aerobraking I would design it to have 3800m/s with maximum payload. If I wanted to find out how to get to low Ike orbit from low Duna orbit, I\u0027d have to start by sending a spacecraft to low Duna orbit and then use the exact same technique, because it also works for moons. It takes a few spacecraft to get numbers for every location, but it\u0027s certainly an effective method if you have the patience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you don\u0027t have the patience for such a method and you\u0027re using the stock system, try this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/87463-121-community-delta-v-map-25-dec-6th/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Edelta-v chart\u003C/a\u003E.
