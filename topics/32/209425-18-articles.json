The downfall of this argumentation is that not all programs can utilise multiple cores. KSP is a prime example; even though I have four cores available, only one gets fully used and another partially. Having more cores is not useful, faster cores is. Unfortunately a lot of modern programs and games suffer from this. In the near future the consoles will alleviate this problem since they use more relatively weak cores and games will be designed to utilize hardware like this, but we are not there just yet. AMD will at that point gain some terrain when it comes to gain, but do not expect that for a couple of years.

The difference with hyperthreading is that with hyperthreading only a small fraction of a second CPU core is there, while with AMD\u0027s modules a larger portion is present. The modules do, however, share a significant portion of their CPU core and thus can not be considered full cores. This makes them hard to compare directly to Intels cores, but seeing them as full seperate cores is a mistake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, octocores make for great marketing, so I do not blame them calling their chips just that, but when it comes to traditional definitions it is not really truthful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"deskjetser","CreatedById":34943,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T16:39:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Camacha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Camacha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI was talking about work per watt, so I could say the same to you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd you completely miss the fact that if the work was multi-threaded, then it would be more efficient for work per watt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe downfall of this argumentation is that not all programs can utilise multiple cores.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is completely not what I was talking about, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022deskjetser\u0022 data-cite=\u0022deskjetser\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehave \u003Cstrong\u003Emultiple programs spread out over multiple cores.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E I clearly did not say, \u0027program/s running on multiple cores\u0027.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T19:50:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022deskjetser\u0022 data-cite=\u0022deskjetser\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd you completely miss the fact that if the work was multi-threaded, then it would be more efficient for work per watt.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is quite simply not true.

Meanwhile the measured power consumption is about 250% of the 4770k for the FX 9590.
