Got the Minmus exploration contract upon return, so I\u0027ll be sending them up again in the same ship. Also got a contract to test a RAPIER engine landed at Kerbin, which I did...in a spaceplane that made orbit, for the purposes of additional orbital parts testing. Switched over at 32k going 1900 m/s - made orbit easily with less than 150 m/s delta-v. I\u0027ll be bringing that craft back down tonight in all likelihood.

(I also built part of an identical second satellite: the imaginatively named Sattle I-\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E. I had been hurting for funds, so I was totally stoked when I got two equatorial satellite missions at the same time, which have been historically super easy for me. And because they were so far out (both have periapsis above 10 Mm, beyond the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn), they paid pretty well too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, my simulations didn\u0027t detect one problem: The Sattle I was equipped with the Communotron 16, which has a range of 2.5 Mm. Remote Tech meant I was unable to control the apoapsis burn, so I was unable to complete the mission. I didn\u0027t want to cancel those missions and go back to \u0027Explore Kerbin\u0027 missions (which I *hate*), so I thought long and hard on a better solution. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter looking hard at the numbers, I decided to redesign the Sattle I to build a massive \u0027space ladder\u0027 of communotrons. 5 modified Sattle I\u0027s with two communotrons would orbit Kerbal at 2.5, 3.97, 6.30, 8.25, and 10 Mm circular orbits. This means that they would have 1:2:4:6:8 orbital period ratios, but all be within 2.5 Mm of each other at their closest approach. Unfortunately, they would only align once every 3 Kerbal months, and the space ladder would only work when it was aligned. Realizing this was a daunting task, I knuckled down on the redesign ... and discovered that I had recently unlocked the Comms DTS-M1: A directional antenna with a range of 50 Mm (just past Minmus). So now all the Sattle II-a needed was two of these (I put three on just to be sure), and then it could act as both a relay for Sattle I-a, and a valid satellite target for the second equatorial satellite mission!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I just need to wait for it to be built. Which will take 7 more days \u0026gt;.\u0026gt; . The Sattle I will still be used for close range satellites under 2.5 Mm, as Sattle I has so few parts that the boosters can be recovered, making the Sattle I about 25% cheaper than the Sattle II, but I think the Sattle II will be the workhorse satellite for Kerbin-based unmanned missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gcOAYpX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gcOAYpX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Axelord FTW","CreatedById":1896,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T12:01:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Draconiator\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Draconiator\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI ditched my \u0022huge ship\u0022 idea, and decided to go for one-way missions with a small ship that can be launched into space on a launcher, powered by nuclear engines.
