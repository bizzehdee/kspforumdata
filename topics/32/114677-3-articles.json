Unlike the \u0027confetti fairings\u0027 issue which was purely cosmetic and had no real impact on actual game play, unlike this.\n\nEdit:\n\n Yes I agree that stuff like U5 and bug fixes are far more important overall, but this relatively small mod especially for Asteroid Day makes perfect sense. And it would IMO be a good proper addition to stock in a future update. \n\nI don\u0027t personally like threads that aim to \u0027pressurise\u0027 squad into implementing some or other feature even if it\u0027s a feature I really want to see.

The thing I want squad to be doing is to move the game to Unity 5. Then I can add as many mods as I desire, also at that point adding more parts and contracts would not make the game even more unstable due to being even closer to the memory limit...\n\u003E In the mean time, trying to drag their efforts this way and that will only result in the U5 version possibly being less polished and more buggy than it inevitably will be.\n\nI agree with you, U5 is more important, but it shouldn\u0027t to be too hard to integrate it, since it\u0027s not like a 3rd party mod, which might not be up to the stock standards. (NOTE: I am not a Squad dev (Surprise, right?) so I don\u0027t know anything about how hard this would actually be.)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Correct me if I am wrong, but the mission design seems to be very narrow, basically a more detailed \u0022satelite\u0022-mission contract with some (elsewhere useless) gadgets.
