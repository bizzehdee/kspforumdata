I found these contracts simply took too long to achieve relative to their payout. The Sun satellite in particular required an absurd amount of delta-v (~10,000 m/s from Jool, ~20,000 m/s from Kerbin) and only paid out 250,000 funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most fun contracts for me were probably the orbital stations and surface outposts, mainly because my design made them relatively easy to achieve and they paid well.

The requirement to build the station \u0022into an asteroid\u0022 came up half a dozen times, but I never accepted because the payout was far too low relative to the required time investment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost all of the part test contracts were on Kerbin.

They detach simultaneously around 45 km altitude, and I never have a problem with them moving out of physics range during the descent. The upper stage with all the crew plus the satellites is fully recoverable on Kerbin for around 350,000 funds, meaning that the net cost of a return mission is only about 550,000 funds - and that includes leaving a fueled tanker in orbit around the visited body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/87213001/KSP/Beating%20Beta%20Than%20Ever/Kerano%20Supership%202.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Kerano%20Supership%202.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside from the crew compartment, there are 4 ion satellites (redockable), a detachable rover (redockable with monoprop engines), and a large tanker which provides enough fuel for multiple landings on most bodies.
