The first thing I did was to check the Kerbinport space station\u0027s available fuel supply anticipating the return of Jeb and company aboard \u003Cem\u003EBockscar\u003C/em\u003E. The station had plenty of fuel; I did do some rearranging of the tanks, which allowed me to cut lose the final booster stage from the station\u0027s core and de-orbit it. That oughta save me on the part count once \u003Cem\u003EBockscar\u003C/em\u003E arrives; \u003Cem\u003EStratofortress 7a\u003C/em\u003E craft like \u003Cem\u003EBockscar\u003C/em\u003E aren\u0027t exactly light on part count...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel pod I sent to the Munport station arrived successfully; I used the remaining fuel from its transfer stage to refuel the Mun Buggy lander already docked there, and then jettisoned the transfer stage and de-orbited it. Later on, I finally got the Stratofortress craft I had sent to Mun in orbit and docked to the station, picking up Cerxie and crew from Munport (they had delivered the buggy out there but needed a different ride to get home; I missed getting the Stratofortress in orbit on the first attempt due to hardware-related foul-ups on my box). Since it\u0027s now crewed, it was time to give the craft a name, and so I named the craft after what\u0027s probably the most infamous member of the 393d Bombardment Squadron - \u003Cem\u003EEnola Gay\u003C/em\u003E. As I had anticipated, she had arrived very low on gas owing to the extra maneuvers needed to get her back to Mun; the fuel pod is now almost empty. I will send \u003Cem\u003EEnola Gay\u003C/em\u003E and her crew back to Kerbinport tonight, and then it\u0027s definitely time to look into getting my Mun ore mining operations set up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of mining operations, the Wildcat 7 mining rig on Minmus crossed the 2050 ore threshold needed to fulfill its lucrative contract last night. For some reason, though, I didn\u0027t get paid; the ore tanks are completely full - 2400 units worth - but the persistence file says I\u0027ve only extracted just short of 600 units from Minmus. I\u0027m still trying to figure that one out; if anybody has had a similar experience or ideas about what I can do about it, I\u0027d like to know. I really need the money from that contract at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was also able to get the Minmus Mun Buggy craft docked to Minmusport, despite its initial orbit being in the opposite direction of the station. While I was fooling around with getting that craft dock, I sent the Project Peacock craft docked an Minmusport on a mission to rescue Theogel from a higher Minmus orbit. The two missions resulted in near-simultaneous rendezvous, but I was able to manage them both successfully; the Mun Buggy is now docked to Minmusport, and Theogel was able to return to Minmusport aboard the Peacock (again, despite the fact that the craft were orbiting in opposite directions). I\u0027ll send Theogel back to Kerbin on the next available flight; in the meantime, I\u0027ve got an extra engineer to help with mining operations over Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb and company aboard \u003Cem\u003EBockscar\u003C/em\u003E return to Kerbin from Minmus tomorrow; getting them docked to Kerbinport and swapping out the ship\u0027s passengers for the next run to Minmus will be part of my activities this evening, again assuming that I have sufficient time to play.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T14:02:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPosted updates for MRS and MRS Lite with the new RTG.

There would be 8 kerbals total: the Big Four, plus four additional Engineers to help with construction. As the shuttle approached, Bill hopped out to link it up to the Proliferater. Once the crew was tranferred, he unhooked it and pushed it into a sub-orbital trajectory, away from the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/46EtjBQ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002246EtjBQ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the help of KER and KAC, I was able to get a Duna rendezvous pretty easily. One long burn on the LV-Ns took us out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI, and another carefully planned burn put us on a collision course. The Kerbals went into hibernation as the ship made it\u0027s year-long journey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce in Duna\u0027s SOI, they awoke and made preperations to enter a stable orbit. Since they still had a tremendous amount of fuel remaining, they opted to skip the aerobrake and perform a brute force manuever. Nearing the periapsis, Jeb fired up the LV-Ns and blasted retrograde, eventually bringing the apoapsis to about 80km. Another burn brought the periapsis to a similar figure. Soon, it was time to de-orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/E7VwosE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022E7VwosE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb fired up the LV-Ns for one last hurrah, burning off as much speed as possible while trying to maintain a good landing zone. The fuel spent, we dropped the booster and let it fall. With no (known) life on Duna yet, we weren\u0027t too worried about it breaking apart. We deployed the airbrakes, letting them slow us down. Jeb realized we were falling quicker than he had hoped. The plan was to make the final pass as horizontal as possible, to allow plenty of time to burn off speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, that wasn\u0027t going to happen. The ship was headed at a 45 degree slope into the ground. Bill scrambled to make sure all the chutes were set to deploy as early as possible. After what seemed like far too long, the Drogue chutes popped out. Soon after, the regular chutes popped as well. We were now only 1km above the surface, but still moving much, much too quick. Jeb wanted to brop the airbrake module to lighten the ship, but Bill argued that the drag induced by it cancels out the extra weight. Jeb didn\u0027t know enough about it to argue, so he let it stay in place. The next part to drop would be the heat shield, which was at the very bottom of the craft. They figured that dropping the heat shield might mean that the smelter would hit the surface and get damaged, while keeping the heat shield on would potentially cushion the landing, possibly breaking the shield, but preserving the smelter. Between the two, the smelter was vastly more vital to the mission, so they decided to keep the shield on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe decision paid off. The Proliferater slammed into the ground at about 20m/s, shattering the heat shield into thousands of pieces. The force of the impact, combined with the slope of the terrain, tilted the Proliferater to the point where it fell. Thankfully, the airbrakes were depolyed, and absorbed the brunt of the impact. One of them shattered; the rest stood solid. It was messy, but they had arrived. When he got out to inspect the vessel, Bill suddenly realized (with a laugh) that the ship looked like a skinny, albino pineapple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Not gonna lie, my heart was pounding pretty hard during the landing... very intense \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZPY2V0W.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZPY2V0W.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite being on its side, the Proliferater was still ready to rock.

After spening well over a year cramped into little compartments and modules, they were very excited to have some personal space. Each Kerbal was able to customize their room to a certain extent. Far too late in the building process, they realized the housing complex was (somhow) sitting partially on top of one of the parts containers. After plenty of finger-pointing (and no one figuring out who was really to blame), Bill decided to rig up another winch tower, and dragged the whole complex a few meters off, allowing it some breathing room. After this, he re-arranged the larger parts container so that it would act as something of a windshield for the homes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bjESAuN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bjESAuN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/G8HVxDx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022G8HVxDx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s as far as I\u0027ve gotten so far!
