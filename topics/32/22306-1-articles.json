Total mass is around 25t. I know that is below your limit, but I had tons of fuel left over. Litterally. My final ascent stage had two large fuel tanks and I had barely used one of them before I got to a nice circular 320km orbit above Kerbin and jettisoned it. My rocket was a simple 3 stage affair. 6x6x1 arrangement with no SRBs (6 lower, 6 upper and a single center upper rocket motor, jettisoning as they ran out of fuel). If I had used SRBs and burned through all of the fuel in my final ascent/orbital stage I could likely have lofted at least 35t.

Is it even possible to get 33.46 Tons into space?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it is hard/impossible, any way to design a lighter eve lander and return system? My best design that I can come up with that has the delta-V requirements, along with the delta-V to get it from Kerbin to Eve, takes 33.46 tons. I\u0027ve never been able to design a lifter that can get that much mass into LKO. Any ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, it\u0027s totally possible. I managed to get 154tns to Minmus in .16 (with a fixed fuel bug patch.) Can you upload the .craft file for your lander and I will see if I can dig-up and retrofit my lifting stage to it? I\u0027ll go dig it up now and check it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-17T06:50:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/9516-SKRAM-Presents-our-next-generation-ship-Advanced-Super-Heavy-Lifter-MELISSA%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esomething like this?\u003C/a\u003E\n"}]}
