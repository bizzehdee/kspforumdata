I had a dream that I was an astronaut with NASA and that Minmus was an actual celestial body. My crewmembers and I left our Mun station to travel to Minmus to survey the moon. We had a lander, a habitat to live in during the expedition, and space suits! Somehow we ended up in a firefight with several celebrities but that\u0027s just my imagination. At the end of my dream, we left Minmus and returned to the Mun. This is a short synopsis but it took place over an 8-hour period. That\u0027s a long KSP session. Have you had any interesting KSP dreams yourself? Tell us all!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T23:35:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think I\u0027ve had any KSP dreams, at least that I remember. I may have been doing some mental design in a quasi-sleep stage, that\u0027s usually how I get myself to fall asleep if I\u0027m having trouble doing so. Or I read the articles my AP US Gov teacher gives us. That puts me to sleep real fast!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Comrade Jenkens","CreatedById":59544,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T00:08:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had a couple of KSP dreams which give me ideas for the next day.
