In other words, you got the game purely for the sandbox feature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Balanced Player - One who wants to use KSP in several of the modes described above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease try to focus the discussion on the options listed above--I don\u0027t want this thread to become another \u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022I\u0027m starting to hate KSP and Squad because they are not delivering what they promised\u0022 vs. \u0022Leave Squad Alone, They are Doing Their Best\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E kind of thread.
