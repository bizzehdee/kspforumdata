I think we should work together in allied space factions to achieve all kinds of new goals with recognition, funding etc. for our accomplishments. Afterall, this is Kerbal SPACE program. I think we should have a bunch of space agencies that anyone can join. No wars, no battles, no grudges. We will of course have budgets and other obstacles, but this would add a whole new thing to the game.\n\nI don\\\u0027t intend to have any particular leader for this, but I would like to start my own space program while this post is going up. I don\\\u0027t have a name yet, but I can probably take 30 people right off the bat. Then others could make their own space programs. By this time next month, we\\\u0027ll have entire cities built on Minmus.\n\nLet me know what you guys think. And remember, we\\\u0027re supposed to avoid any tension or fighting."},{"CreatedByName":"Monkthespy","CreatedById":7644,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-22T00:10:58Z","Content":"He already said they would make a fan works board, sooo."},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-22T00:18:58Z","Content":"I know he said that.
