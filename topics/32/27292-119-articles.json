Having done that, the mission was a go. Jeb was flying, naturally. Launch went great, more fuel was put into space than was originally expected. The booster had done a marvellous job. Trans-Munar injection went well, Jeb couldn\u0027t even be arsed to use nodes and just eyeballed it by burning prograde at LKO during munrise. When Jeb encountered the Mun, he circularized, waited until he had the sunlight and went in for the landing, not really aiming for anything, but also hoping it wouldn\u0027t be a crater wall or a mountainside. Jeb\u0027s professional expertise payed off once again as he landed softly on the Munar surface, after a single, continous retrograde burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETests were carried out, science was made and finally it was the time to go for an EVA.

It soon turned out that some stupid engineer had put a ladder on top of the hatch, and it couldn\u0027t be fixed. Jeb was not happy. What soon brightened him up though, was the news that thanks to the new lander model, much more fuel was still available. Jeb immediately decided to put that to good use, and blasted off the Munar surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReaching a stable orbit, he inclined himself in relation to Minmus, got an encounter, and blasted off towards the small moon.

The thought intimidated him, but Jeb understood that if he didn\u0027t pull himself together, he would stay in that small tin can forever.

He waited very patiently until his side of Minmus was facing Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe then put his ship to max throttle, pointing straight up and burning fuel fast. Eventually Jeb escaped Minmus\u0027 SOI but he still had to deorbit. The final burn was done with exceptional precision, so as to not burn any more fuel than is needed. And it worked!
