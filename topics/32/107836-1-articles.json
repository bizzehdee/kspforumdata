However, in common usage, it\u0027s thrust is rather high so I find myself attaching additional tanks to it, and it\u0027s built-in tank is no liability at all, and I think it\u0027s fair to subtract 36 tons of Jumbo64 from it with a little disclaimer star attached.\n\n(LFO tanks are all pretty much 9:1 now I believe)"},{"CreatedByName":"Haze-Zero","CreatedById":71279,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T23:02:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The RAPIER\u0027s TWR is essentially meaningless.

Can the player do ANYTHING to separate out that engine and use the engine only, freeing it from that 4 excess tons? The player can not, not in stock. The player HAS to keep that tank with him no matter what craft design he makes. \n\nHow useful would it be to a new player to see this graph with only the TWR of the engine only to realize that when he uses it, he has 4 tons of tank-structure that will limit his TWR?"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T23:17:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E While I agree with you, there engine is carrying around an extra 4 tons due to the tank structure.
