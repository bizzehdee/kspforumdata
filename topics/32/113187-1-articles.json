Although there is no official build there are still ways to run 64bit which are still causing headaches. So here is a poll to find out what it is that makes 64bit necessary for users.\n\nI use it (on one of my installs) because I like graphics! Although I could run in opengl and use my graphics mods my post processor (gemfx) isnt currently compatible with opengl. So for me its essential for ksp to look pretty.\n\nHowever I am looking at options for getting sweetfx running in opengl to remove this particular reason for running 64bit (will post a tutorial if it works out.\n\npoll above is to see why else 64 is being used and whether there is a way to avoid it to make bug reporting easier."},{"CreatedByName":"OddFunction","CreatedById":143805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T08:57:16Z","Content":"Significantly better FPS, better graphics.

I use 79 different mods (including visual improvements) according to CKAN and I still have a decent performance on Windows 32 bit version. I watched the ksp process memory and it still have some reserve. It appears that having more memory doesn\u0027t make the game run faster, quite the contrary (at least on my machine) the FPS dropped (Linux video drivers are still far from being perfect, I suppose).\n\nStill, I would gladly switch onto 64 bit if I see the difference in FPS.\n\nBy the way, running the game with nolog option can add some FPS to your game at the cost of not logging."},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T10:02:02Z","Content":"From what I have seen the Windows Directx11 32bit and 64bit versions have better looking graphics than Linux (unless you force OpenGL in Windows) and possibly better frame rates, though that could depend a bit on what Graphics card you have, Nvidia has better support and other games from people like valve show almost neck and neck performance with Windows. For now though everything works better, e.g. memory overhead, and bugs in Linux.\n\nNote: You must use the proprietary video drivers in Linux and certain command line options to get the best reasonable performance.

My experience is that the proprietary AMD drivers are a \\*beep\\* of \\*beep\\*. Of course, if you\u0027re OK with micro-stuttering, tearing during video playback, graphics glitches, regular crashes, the complete lack of desktop integration (ok, switching resolution works, but try disabling a monitor without X-server restart), no support for VAAPI or EGL (= no up to date Gnome 3 desktop) and ugly font rendering in exchange for maybe a 50% increase in fps, then go ahead and install them. When using an up to date open source radeonsi driver stack with an R9 or one of the faster R7 cards KSP is purely CPU limited, unless one uses visual enhancement mods.\n\nBut back to topic: I\u0027m running 64bit KSP on Linux, simply because when I bought KSP it was much easier to get 64bit software working flawlessly on my distribution of choice (Gentoo).

On my system, the Windows x64 workaround is *the only option* that is stable and has acceptable performance with more than a few mods installed. I\u0027m not particularly happy about this, to be honest. I don\u0027t like having to use an unsupported hack to get the game running properly, but at the moment it\u0027s my best option. \n\nOSX and all the Windows x86 options all run out of memory with even a lightly modded game, and have poor FPS to boot, as well as serious graphical glitches in OpenGl. Ubuntu is tolerable, but on my system it\u0027s a major pain in the neck to start up in Linux and the FPS is noticeably worse than on Windows. Windows x64 has the best FPS and fewest crashes of all the options, and apart from a few nuisance bugs (I\u0027ve so far found exactly three that I\u0027m confident are unique to Windows x64) it is by far the most stable. If the price I have to pay for a playable game (with virtually unlimited mods!) is that I occasionally have to edit and recompile a few dlls to remove 64-bit restrictions, so be it; the gameplay improvement is worth the investment of time and effort a hundred times over. \n\nIt\u0027s worth adding that \u0022unsupported\u0022 doesn\u0027t mean the same as \u0022unstable.\u0022 In spite of its reputation, so far I haven\u0027t heard a single report of serious instability (beyond a few minor known issues) in KSP 1.0\u002B on Windows x64, and I have heard a lot of reports of it working very smoothly. The evidence I\u0027ve seen (admittedly limited) suggests that, for some reason, at least on some systems, Windows x64 KSP is much more usable now than it was pre-1.0. \n\nStill, as I said before I severely dislike having to use an unsupported hack, no matter how well it works. Although it has no game-breaking issues (at least on my system) it does have several nuisance issues, several of which are, well, pretty serious nuisances. I would very much like to see either an officially-supported Windows x64 build or some kind of solution to make x86 more usable, and if such a solution comes along I\u0027ll absolutely give it a try."},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T20:57:29Z","Content":"\u003E Switching to linux is a good thing.
