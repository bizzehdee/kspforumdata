Eventually we rescued Jeb and he was sent on a mission to set up a base on minmus, and he once again got stuck in orbit, this time around minmus. Now bare in mind I have never managed to dock ships before\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 well Val took the spare minmus rocket to go save Jeb, and after about 4 hours she got to a decent rendezvous\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 bearing in mind I haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t unlocked maneuvers or anything so it is quite an achievement for me. Then there was the tentative docking\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 with only a mainsail and no RCS. I overlooked that, but nevertheless Val managed to do it, delivering the fuel needed to Jeb to land the Minmus base. Now they are never separated on any mission, and so far nothing else has gone drastically wrong. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003ENow on to the game-play comment\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 since 1.0 came out I have found that I enjoy the game more as an actual game, rather than a fun simulation. I can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t help but treat it more as having some sort of narrative and objective for some reason, purposefully put in or not, and I can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t bring myself to restart missions. Before, when Jeb got stranded, I would have just reverted, but having a full released game makes me want to actually play it properly, so in short this is what Val and Jeb have done for me in 1.0, they have given me a story and they have given me a reason not to just give up and revert constantly.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003Ep.s. Great job Squad on 1.0, thoroughly enjoying it so far, despite what I have seen here I would say that bug wise it isn\u0027t bad, balancing wise so far so good for me, a bit more difficult than previous releases but I enjoy that, and most importantly I enjoy that you have done exactly what you said you would in terms of realism of aerodynamics etc, not too real not too fake, for the perfect balance of fun! \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
