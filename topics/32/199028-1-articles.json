Do any of the settings in game make it offload partially to the GPU over CPU in a way that would give less overhead to the massive single CPU thread used for the ship. I\u0027m trying to fly a large ship. Does anything besides the lowest settings give extra performance?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr do any of the graphics settings use the GPU instead of the CPU to allow better graphics without harming the ship performance of larger vessels?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-12-24T04:21:36Z\u0022 title=\u002212/24/2020 04:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 24, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
