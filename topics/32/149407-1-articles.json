Further, I have complete faith that Squad is a wonderful company built on the finest capitalist foundations... meaning, its not going to die any time soon, not with more money to be made... and there is nothing wrong with that. They provide and excellent product and there is no way it can die any time soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... I am not worried, not one little bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBUT... I have read some of the posts and I am saddened. really, its not the number of excellent devs leaving Squad that will kill the game.... its the talk, the gossip, the accusations... and dare i say it.. the conspiracy theories that WILL, over time, kill the game if its allowed to continue. I have been blessed to have been part of a few very VERY good forums over the years i have been alive, and all of them... yes... all of them... were killed by rumours and speculation... a melt down caused by some for whatever reason...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure if you guys have this saying in your nation, but here in New Zealand, we say that some suffer from the \u0022tall poppy syndrome\u0022...\u00A0 meaning, they see a game, or company like squad getting bigger... successful... and they are envious... jealous... and they want to pluck that tall poppy out of the soil and kill it....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBUT ENOUGH OF THAT..... I, more than most, have had my fair share of fights with the moderators... yeah, I speak my mind, I push the boundaries... but there is a limit to how far I would push it... the limits with some of the things being said HAS WELL AND TRULY BEEN PASSED.....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are our FRIENDS you are discussing... these are the people who have given us an awesome game... in some cases, amazing game mods... and have laughed with us, cried with us on the forums here, they have put up with your poodleing about bugs and tried to help you sort them out and.... they have just been great people...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy attacking Squad... you have attacked them... the reasons they left ARE PRIVATE and NONE of your business.... you do NOT own them....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo.... ENOUGH of the bull dust!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey said they were leaving.... accept it.... be nice, play nice and let them go... they are friends... no matter what... or... are you saying you always thought of them as your slaves.... really?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nlet it go already... be nice people.... be nice to your friends...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThanks for all the fish, guys.
