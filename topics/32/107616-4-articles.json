That converts over time into a about 6 * base science * 100 funds (at 100% field science to funds strategy).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA simple Minmus trip could net 2M funds over the course of a couple of years. The only babysitting required is to top up the data (from the already collected experiments that could not be processed due to 500 data cap), and you really only need to do this once a year or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like this. Couple it with a life support mod and it is pretty reasonably balanced, from a funds perspective. Just not from a science for tech tree perspective. I would suggest it even removes the science part entirely and makes MPL data convert straight into funds, or increase the cost of tech tree nodes a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T22:07:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 10:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CorBlimey\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"uglyduckling81","CreatedById":129740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T23:03:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey should just change the game.
