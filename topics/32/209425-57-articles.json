Many motherboards don\u0027t support a BIOS update without already having a CPU installed, which would mean that you would need to have a haswell non-refresh CPU to update your BIOS before you could use the 4790s with that motherboard. Make sure that the motherboard supports a BIOS update without a CPU or use a H97 board that would natively support haswell refresh processors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the bearing type should not be the reason why you choose a fan over another. It can have effect on how quiet a fan is, but a cheap fluid dynamic fan can be a lot louder than a good fan that\u0027s using another type of bearing. You should look for reviews of the fans to judge how quiet they are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- if silence is a factor in your part choice, you shouldn\u0027t use the box cooler for the CPU.
