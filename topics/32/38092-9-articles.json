Also their is no proof they lied. That is speculation. There was a person who was able to get sims working offline, but that doesn\u0027t mean every single function is actually working properly or as intended. While I agree the new simcity is a huge flop, I still don\u0027t think that justified people out right hating EA as they do. Sure disappointed to me is a more normal reaction, but hatred is just too far.\u003Cp\u003EI have played a few of their recent games, and i can\u0027t say the quality really decreased any. To me it\u0027s equally comparable to anything I played in the past. Such as Need for Speed Hot Pursuit I enjoy just as much as their past games, but I am disappointed there was no multiplayer o.o. It most certainly wasn\u0027t a bad game though. I have not played Mass effect 3, but I absolutely loved 2.

I\u0027ve seen other games that are graphically superior and able to handle more simulations than Simcity, so if hardware was truly unable to run Simcity, EA\u0027s game coders need a stiff reach around on how to optimize a game. :I\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to EA\u0027s claim, its servers handle a \u0022significant amount of the calculations.\u0022 Which sounds less convincing when their servers could barely handle something as simple as a login load, let alone a rendering load or calculation load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what a modder discovered when checking the code in the game and dissecting specifically what information was being exchanged to the client and server:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThe SimCity servers are not doing any calculations that could not be done on your PC, even for an entire region single player offline mode, let alone just the city you are in.

EA basically ruined Simcity... but hoping for even a slither of funsies I gave EA my money and played for a month or so, now it sits dormant due crappy DRM/always on/useless multi player (by useless I mean I didn\u0027t bloody want it \u002B it\u0027s actually useless). Can\u0027t argue with ME1-3 really, and when they launched Origin I was sick in my mouth a little, then I had to swallow it because you can\u0027t play their games without it. (unless you\u0027re a very naughty boy)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can beat EA all day long I\u0027m sure, but many developers have been guilty of their sins at some point. I do feel though that EA have a uncanny knack of buying up cult franchises and then ruining them in the chase for more money. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong live Squad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The509","CreatedById":74838,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-23T13:57:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn another note, what if KSP was sold to Rockstar North?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pleborian","CreatedById":27820,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-23T15:00:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022karolus10\u0022 data-cite=\u0022karolus10\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis will never happen, I belive.\u003Cp\u003EAlso I don\u0027t think that EA really deserve all this hate, it made few unpopular decisions in game world but it\u0027s not that bad ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.kylemitchell.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/EA_sucks_but_you_suck_more.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EA_sucks_but_you_suck_more.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esrsly?
