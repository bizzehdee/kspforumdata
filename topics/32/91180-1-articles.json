Most SSTOs would be capable of climbing a lot faster than they do during that stage of the flight.

Notice how slowly airspeed increases in the same timeframe. This is because the ascent follows the standard jet paradigm of getting to 2000m/s in the atmosphere, then proceed to orbit. Also notice what happens next, how the plane has no problem climbing quickly without losing airspeed. I haven\u0027t explored this further, but in all likelihood it would be possible to make a much smoother transition, with climb rate never falling quite as low and reaching orbital speeds at much higher altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat really takes a lot of time is getting to 10-15km in the first place, because SSTOs tend to have a low TWR.

This means that a good break point is just before I circularize. I build a rocket with just enough to get the payload to orbit but then drop the stage during the coast to apoapsis. I know how to do my ascent trajectory so that I typically need less then 200 DV to circularize with it not being uncommon for me to need less than 100. Typically the stage I drop still has 200 DV or so and thus is actually a SSTO. If I expect to have more DV then that I will put de-orbit thrusters and use it like an SSTO but not often.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
