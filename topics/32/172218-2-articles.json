The first provides them with useful information that could actually benefit the player base (hey we know that 99.9% of our players are playing KSP on a machine that can handle x, y and z graphical features - why don\u0027t we add those to the next expansion?).

But, at the end of the day, I believe the onus should be on Take Two\u00A0to use an EULA (or heck, even to have more than one EULA tailored to different jurisdictions) that is compliant with the relevant law, rather than using a ridiculously over-reaching\u00A0agreement and leaving it up to their customers to either trust them (hah!) or challenge them on it, in court or otherwise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSquad were a small company, with limited resources.

Instead, they could pull their collective thumbs out and craft a reasonable agreement that\u0027s more suitable to a game like KSP which has grown up as an early-access game with a heavy emphasis on community involvement.

Negotiated contracts between parties of roughly equal standing can involve some give, some take, and a bit of trust. A video game EULA? If they slip and make a mistake, they literally cannot afford to send lawyers to every single customer or even really a small fraction thereof, and in reverse, they cannot afford to be sued by more than a tiny fraction of their customers. $40/copy does not stretch all that far.

Even if their lawyers say \u002299% chance that $1000-per-customer lawsuit won\u0027t succeed\u0022, that\u0027s still a 1% chance of losing $1000 per customer, for an expected value of -$10/customer.
