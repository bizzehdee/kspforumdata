So, I turned on the aero-forces (F12) and there is some RIDICULOUS drag forces - and it\u0027s all coming from inside the Shells. What\u0027s the point of the Shells if they don\u0027t actually eliminate drag from what you put inside them?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T00:46:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry rebuilding the fairings.
