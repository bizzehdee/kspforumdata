It basically allows users to delete VESSELS from persistent.sfs file easily. It will also allow users to delete debris automatically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve come across with another debris delete program somewhere but I couldn\u0027t find it nor did it work for me when I tried it a while back. If there\u0027s any interest for this sort of a program I could upload the file for anyone to use.
