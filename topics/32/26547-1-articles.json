If you pivot outside those points you will end up offset which isn\u0027t what you want. One thing that is useful using these AN and DN positions is when you are doing a rendezvous and are trying to get your intercept position right. When you go prograde or retrograde you will most likely find there is a minimum intercept distance you can get. Using the purple up and down (normal/anti-normal?) you can move the AN/DN nodes so that one of them matches the location of the red intercept and it usually drops the minimum intercept distance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-12T18:23:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stealth2668\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Stealth2668\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI was testing out the option where mechjeb 2.0 puts a node for you to circularize your orbit but it asks you how much time you want before you start you burn.
