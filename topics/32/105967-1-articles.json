Normally, this wouldn\u0027t be an issue. But I see these contracts a lot! They don\u0027t really fit into my progression since I haven\u0027t even flown by Minmus yet! I also don\u0027t see any contracts pointing to Minmus - which is concerning. Naturally, I except Minmus to be the next logical destination after having landed on the Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs anyone else experiencing this problem?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T12:49:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I also got a mission to Pol right after I declined my first contract.
