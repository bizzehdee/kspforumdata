This might be a bug / issue with the new version since I haven\u0027t seen it before.\n\n[Album on Imgur](http://imgur.com/a/4XDGZ)\n\nThe contract system wants me to visit Pol, the outermost Joolian moon. Normally, this wouldn\u0027t be an issue. But I see these contracts a lot! They don\u0027t really fit into my progression since I haven\u0027t even flown by Minmus yet! I also don\u0027t see any contracts pointing to Minmus - which is concerning. Naturally, I except Minmus to be the next logical destination after having landed on the Moon.\n\nIs anyone else experiencing this problem?"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T12:49:28Z","Content":"Yeah, I also got a mission to Pol right after I declined my first contract. Might be a missing requirement in that particular contract. I still decided to take it, because it was paying enough to upgrade the Mission Control even if it takes up a contract slot for a long, long time!\n\nEDIT: To be clear, I pretty sure I had not even been to Kerbin orbit when I got the Pol contract and definitely sure I hadn\u0027t been outside LKO.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T12:59:49Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 12:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cybersol**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T12:49:31Z","Content":"Have you gone to other planets?\n\nMinmus flyby contracts should show up...

Somehow this glitches up the way the contract system tries to determine what you can reach.
