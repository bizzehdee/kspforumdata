I was getting pretty good at building space planes in 0.24 but I didn\u0027t realize how often I reverted. My first design twisted on take off and blew up killing the test pilot before it even got off the ground. My next one didn\u0027t have enough lift and I had to bail into the ocean. I\u0027m now terrified of trying a new design until I have a few extra safety features or more powerful engines available.

Then add Mission Controller mod where each new hire is 4k and each death is 20k (with DRE, NEAR, RealChute, LS to further show my self hate), I have gotten quite a bit more cautious in nearly all aspects. However, I think one of my newest worries, is dropping a stage on KSC while not paying attention. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketBlam","CreatedById":103420,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T03:46:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGiving up the revert feature and the quicksave feature is pretty unnerving, because you make a lot of mistakes that you had been making all along, you just hadn\u0027t been paying for them.

It just really penalizes the sort of ridiculous experimentation that KSP was founded on, and which you still run into all the time in the spaceplane design process. It\u0027s just far too easy for something outside of your control to destroy a really expensive spaceplane design, to say nothing of the dead kerbonauts that may or may not be involved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, if you think the wobble wobble wipeout problem is bad in stock, try using the landing gear in the B9 mod in an x64 executable.

Well, it WOULD be tough if the new admin strategies were balanced, but the \u002Bscience ones are just too strong; a few orbital jaunts and one trip to the Mun and back and I\u0027ve basically finished the tech tree, and that\u0027s at only 20% on those two strategies.
