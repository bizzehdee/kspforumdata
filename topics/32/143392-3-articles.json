Also try to reuse parts if you can, I know I dropped a fuel tank that had quite a bit left just orbiting Kerbin and ended up picking up the fuel after a bunch of rendezvous to keep the mission going. Though, nowadays I plan my rockets delta-V much better, but any craft parts that can be reused is good, I have left old mining vessels floating in space to be picked apart over time for parts. I often use a designation that isn\u0027t scrap for important debris I don\u0027t want to see disappear (put survey probes in same category to hide). Sometimes it\u0027s kinda cool to just look at all the debris and see where it is and where it\u0027s gone, see what stuff might be in other SOIs than it was left in.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n4) I make minimalist living spaces, but now with UKI LS... that isn\u0027t really a possibility.

I am pretty sure you could setup a system that opened and closed gravity feed fuel from nacelles that could then be dropped and in the real world we don\u0027t have to deal with the mechanics of KSP or the limited shapes, form and size of parts available in the game. I also suspect that tracking the falling debris would get more problematic if you were dropping more of it much closer to your launching area.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"foamyesque","CreatedById":2982,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-18T10:15:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a hugely distinct difference between crossfeeding or drop tanks as they exist IRL, and the daisy-chain of fuel lines that KSP asparagus staging requires.
