I built a minmus base with a skycrane style lander dropping modules.

Its only a semi-derp though, because it still has substantial battery power, and the surface base core was self landing and had a RA-100 relay on it.

With hibernation, the battery was enough for the transfer, and the relays around Mun were enough to control the probe most of the time (and the other times, the partial control level with the probes ability to orient prograde/retrograde/toward a preplace maneuver node, etc, was sufficient). At times I revert to partial control on the probe, but so far every module it docks with to take down to the surface has battery/solar on it, and the battery is sufficient to get to orbit and dock with something that can recharge it...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso I made do with it, despite intending to have an antenna and solar panels on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere it is on the left sticking up vertically from the ground modules, no solar panels, no antenna... derp\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022QxzitlU.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QxzitlU.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022nTX6baf.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nTX6baf.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tg626","CreatedById":112361,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-11T10:29:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAntennas these days, now that they are important. \u00A0I either forget them or badly comprehend their range. \u00A0Comprehension is improving, but I still forget. \u00A0Usually realizing it after I\u0027ve built it with construction time...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot leaving empty seats on rescue contracts is another fav...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
