I\u0027m thinking of having a large base on the Mun to start, and i need a way to power it. I don\u0027t know if this is better than a massive battery bank and a load of solar panels. I think it should be stated that although i\u0027ve had this game for a year or two, i made it once to the Mun successfully, and landed a probe with help from a community member on the Discord. (Find a picture of that on my Steam gallery). I am on sandbox right now, so i don\u0027t blow my mind trying to get the tech tree first.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith all that aside, is it possible to \u0022refuel\u0022 the Nuclear Reactor?

You can then transfer the depleted uranium into an empty uranium container on the ship, and then transfer new fuel into the reactor. As such if\u00A0the plan is to refuel\u00A0you always want 1 active reactor and 1 standby reactor so when the first one runs out of fuel you can let the other one run for years, at which point you can finally refuel the first one again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-09-16T01:32:24Z\u0022 title=\u002209/16/2020 01:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 16, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by MechBFP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
