Should even have enough juice to do a few initial orbital plane changes around Kerbin if necessary. The acceleration rate, though it sucks, is low enough that it should be sufficient to keep your craft from wobbling; only other thing you could do there would be to go for a Senior or a multi-port setup, neither of which are viable options for a spaceplane in all likelihood.
