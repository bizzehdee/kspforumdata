No. I want to use an autopilot that allows you to make a point C. Where point C is acquirable through many many point B itnervals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, an autopilot you could set up with timers that would do certain things. It\u0027s...unconventional if you don\u0027t have any idea or patience to calculate every variable, but it\u0027s something I want to throw onto the pit of trial and error fanaticism. I build my rockets with style, then make them space worthy through trial and error. I will first make some random creation, launch it, watch how far it gets, return to vab to fix errors if any, or add on, repeat. Until I reach my destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this in mind, I want to find some way to set up a list of timed commands that would take place. Five second delay, launch, thirty second delay, stage, 47.269 second delay, stage, deploy space utilities (aka soalr panels and such), delay five minutes, stage, launch, and on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would make it possible to send one rocket off to one place, let it (possibly, for the goals are set far with this) land where aimed on X celestial body, and still be working on another. I would like to go as far as making ships that will launch then rendezvous in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t post this here to ask a quesiton, or jsut to find something, It has a triple purpose, all that, and I want to know peoples\u0027 opinions ont he subject.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T02:51:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/12384-PART-0-90-Anatid-Robotics-MuMech-MechJeb-Autopilot-v2-4-2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMechjeb\u003C/a\u003E?
