If you are wondering about why 6 landed before 5, it\u0027s because I launched 5 first, but ended up putting the lander for 5 on a longer trajectory to Duna, meaning the return vehicle for 5 would arrive first, then 6 would arrive at Ike, and then the lander for 5 would arrive/land on Duna and I didn\u0027t feel like it was a big enough issue to fix after the fact. And if you are wondering about Kerbodyssey 4, that one is slowly making its way to Dres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, getting back to Kerbodyssey 5, the lander was meant to entering straight into the atmosphere and land directly (no orbital insertion), so I didn\u0027t have a choice in which side of the planet I landed on, and naturally I arrived when Ike was below the surface of where I was going to land. Insertion and landing went very well, albeit I landed on yet another hill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gK0sOjK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gK0sOjK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alfondoo","CreatedById":66096,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-02T17:31:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Master Tao\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Master Tao\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlfondoo,\u003Cp\u003EClearly, great minds think alike.
