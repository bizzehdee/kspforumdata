If you have much i/o, like from a huge database, then a ramdisc could help. Ramdiscs were vastly used in the late 80\u0027s and 90\u0027s. But today\u0027s discs normally are fast enough and modern os\u0027s have better means for speed and redundancies. Also, bootloaders may use ramdisc during initial startup, when the disc i/o system is not yet ready.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for KSP: a fast processor (number threads is not that decisive), min. 8GB ram and if you use many textures / part packs a graphics card with a lot of graphics ram speed things up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: initial loading might be a little faster, but you have to load the ramdisc from disc first, so all in all you\u0027ll be slower at first loading, a little faster at sequential loading if you leave the ramdisc in ram all day long.
