Sorry for spelling mistakes etc. I try and clarify what is an actual quote from Max (if it\u0027s wrapped in \u0022quotation marks\u0022, it\u0027s the best transcript of an official Squad member you\u0027ll find on the web), and what is a summary from myself as I\u0027m aware I switch between the two with 0 notice. When I say \u0027Squad\u0027, I mean \u0027the relevant people who are currently developing the game\u0027. As always, this is just a volunteer transcript of an off the cuff vlog of a non-native english speaker - **some details may change or be entirely incorrect.**\n\n**Squadcast Summary for 2015-05-30** - [**Watch it here!**](http://www.twitch.tv/ksptv/v/5591096)\n\nMu joins in this week! He\u0027s from Manchester and has a silver car ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) 3 weeks ago, Squad were working on 1.0.1 and 1.0.2, the next week, they were jumping out of planes in Mexico. Max got a hairline fracture on his coccyx.\n\nPSA: right now, physicsless parts aren\u0027t truely physicsless anymore. They transfer drag and mass (i.e. all physical properties) to their parent.\n\nThis week, Max and Mu talked mainly about Unity 5 and the 1.0.3 hotfix. With Unity 5, every single UI will be replaced as the current system uses like 3 different UI systems which bloats the game. With them all being replaced with 1, it\u0027ll hopefully optimise things, reduce scene change loading tines a bit etc. Overall, it should run slicker and get a bit of a visual revamp. Modders will have better access to things and able to do more stuff *(some stuff about OnGUI that I don\u0027t understand (Squad are removing all uses of it, but modders are still able to use it), best to watch it for yourself if you\u0027re a modder (or not) and want to know more. Skip to 6 minutes or* [*read my transcript here*](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123613-Squadcast-Summary-%282015-05-30%29-Mu-Joins-In%21?p=1982492\u0026viewfull=1#post1982492)*)*.\n\nWheel colliders in U5.. they\u0027re not fun and are a pain unless you use them specifically for cars. For spaceships with 12 wheels at odd places, it works perfectly up to 5m/s or so then wobbles to death. So they fixed it - as mentioned in the last Devnotes, they\u0027re using a custom version of something from the Asset Store (written specifically for KSP by the author) that should handle things a lot better.\n\nAlso, brace yourself - multithreaded physics incoming ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n1.0.3 news! Mu\u0027s been putting hours into it, he noticed even before 1.0 that balancing heating for command pods and cockpits is mutually exclusive, so they\u0027re introducing a new heating system called Skin Heating - basically, rather than seeing a part as a part, you see it as things surrounded by a shell of metal that heats up and cools down quicker - this basically makes things easier to balance overall. Same system as in Deadly Re-Entry actually - Squad talked to those devs and got permission to use some of their ideas. All their own code, but some of DREs ideas. 1.0.3 will not be released this week due to this new heating system needing balance, Squad wants to make it right first time. 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 were about 6 hours apart, Squad wants to avoid that again. Re-entries will be \u0022better\u0022, should exit and re-enter more stabley. Rockets will be more stable, aero will change a bit so \u0022just wing it\u0022. More engine tunings, fairings have been fixed (\u0022for the changes to the heating system\u0022 - NathanKell), Mk3 parts drag fixed, temperature gauge memory leak fixed (huge thanks to sarbian for helping with this).. big changelog, but not coming this week and probably not the next either. Regarding the editor aerodynamic stability overlay, it\u0027s still pencilled in, but it\u0027s one of those things that the more you add to it, the more you CAN add to it, which is a dangerous position to be in. Still, it\u0027s in the devs minds. \n\nBig news: Once U5 is done, Mu will take a more serious role regarding development: he\u0027ll take the wheel for 1.1\u002B. Multiplayer development is getting seriously done, so HarvesteR is going to concentrate more on that, while Mu will take care of KSP core in general. Few new.. \u0022procedures\u0022 regarding design, input and feedback.\n\nOther stuff that you already know or don\u0027t care about happened, Jeb died again and Max is still terrible at KSP.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAnd that\u0027s pretty much it from me.

Umm, we have namespaced it all off, so you\u0027ll definitely have to recompile, but that makes the game easier to program for anyway.. umm, but they\u0027ll also be able to use our pop-up prefab windows easier which is basically like OnGUI but done in unity, so max performance with uh, actually minimal code changes, it was designed to replace OnGUI code so it almost works exactly the same.\u0022\n\nMaxmaps: \u0022Awesome!\u0022\n\nMu: \u0022And also, they\u0027ll have better access to all of the things and should be able to change them easier, it\u0027s a lot easier to code and script than EzGUI was and certainly SSUI which was, is the third thing.. so yeah, it\u0027s positive, modders will have to put a few minutes in here and there but it should be fine\u0022\n\nMaxmaps: \u0022It won\u0027t be a massive amount of work that will tank your systems, but in the end, it will be worth it, I think\u0022\n\nMu: \u0022It\u0027s gonna be worth it, both for us and players and modders because it\u0027s such a pain to maintain the interface\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T01:41:07Z","Content":"Thanks OWK!
