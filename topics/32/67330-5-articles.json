Yes we all know that realistically setting dates is both impossible and will cause more trouble than it\u0027s worth if they slip. And, importantly, yes, we all know that we have no entitlement to know, or even any entitlement to *any* future update, but we\u0027d still quite \u003Cem\u003Elike\u003C/em\u003E to know because, well we all quite like KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m aware that the official word is along the lines of \u0022we\u0027d like to have it out in April\u0022 - which in my mind punts it out to four weeks or so away whilst retaining the possibility of further slippage into May.

If you reach that level of anger, you\u0027re really just looking like a kid who is unable to deal with emotions and tries to put the blame on someone else. But thats the classic vocal minority, so i\u0027m not really talking about them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, giving information is always better. Furthermore, SQUAD tends to do a great job at summarizing what you\u0027ll get, while avoiding clear spoilers. You only get those, if you research further, e.g. look at the part-thread (which actually had a spoiler-sign) or the streams. Dont get me wrong, its completely okay not to want any spoilers or more defined pre-release infos at all. But you can also easily avoid them, so there is no point in complaining in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe actual problem resulting here is, as shown in the past, that SQUAD, or developers in general, just tend to give out a bit less information after every backlash. It was pretty absurd, when some time ago a new user asked, why SQAD gave out somewhat less extensive infos than before, and the answer was \u0027people complained over being informed\u0027. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot that it takes something away from the game or the community itself, it\u0027s just pointless.
