The reason is simple, there\u0027s nothing to do in career mode except, get more of what you already have in sandbox. So, with .90 I decided to start a stock career mode and try it. Here\u0027s my random thoughts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. At first, it\u0027s not bad. The missions keep you entertained and trying to build aircraft to do the survey missions was a challenge. Attaching a rover to an aircraft and being able to deploy and retrieve that rover (for some of the more rugged terrain) was a real challenge, especially stock. That part I enjoyed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Ok, so I got a base into orbit. Now I\u0027m asked to put yet another into orbit. Well, that\u0027s fine. But my first one serves no purpose anyway so why a second? There\u0027s only so much science I can collect on it and the cost of making it a refueling station is prohibitive... so why do I need 2?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. How many stinking satellites do I need? This is becoming a case of the Kessler syndrome with satellites. And what purpose do they serve anyway once I get them there? Ok, they have an antenna and some science but my station already absorbed all the science so... I\u0027m confused as to why I need more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Ok, a base on the Mun. I can do that. Did that. No problem. I collected science and now what? It sits there consuming Kerbals and does... what?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Oh, Mun survey missions... Ah, that\u0027s what the base is... not for? So I get these missions to survey the Mun, they\u0027re all on the opposite side of the Mun from my base and I\u0027m expected to do them then... return to Kerbin? Or fly to my base and transfer the science to the lab for what? An extra 4% science? And then what about my survey ship? Fly it back to Kerbin or abandon it just as I have my base? I can\u0027t refuel it for the next survey mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Oh. Satellites around the Mun... Ok. And I assume their purpose is just as... clandestine... as all those around Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Ah, now for some fun. A base on Minmus... that does the same thing my base on the Mun does... nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. And now I\u0027m expected to get a station in orbit around Duna, Ike and land on Eve. Again, for more science so I can get more parts so that I can land on further planets so I can get more science so I can get more parts.... etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Ok, so now I need over 3 million to upgrade my research facility. Oh, that 650 I\u0027ll get from part testing will... be a drop in the bucket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of my biggest complaints about KSC is that once you get where you\u0027re going, there\u0027s nothing left to do. In sandbox I created my own challenges or took on some of those on the challenge forum. The big problem with challenges, mine and those of others, is once you complete them, it\u0027s a huge letdown because all that effort into design, building, launching, flying... ends up sitting just somewhere until you get tired of looking at it. I created a challenge to circumnavigate EVE using an aircraft with stock and Kethane. I had a blast. Took me days of designing and testing and a week of playing to complete the circumnavigation. Once I was done, the plane sat there for months with no purpose left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad is trying hard to make KSP into a sim type game. And they\u0027re well on their way. There\u0027s one huge difference between a sim that you\u0027ll play again and again and again, and KSP. Purpose. Mods like Kethane and Karbonite increase that purpose but they too end up being a letdown. Once you\u0027re able to land and refuel ships it\u0027s again, back to building ships that go everywhere to do nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I enjoy the designing of craft in KSP, the testing, the flying, the landing... I need a purpose. (I know I\u0027m sounding like the dood from \u003Cem\u003EMatrix\u003C/em\u003E but it\u0027s true.) Give me a real reason to establish a base on Duna and not science so I can get more parts to build more stations to get more science...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion... serious resources and an economy. Not just cash for quests. Not just mining for fuel. Give me a resource on Duna to dig up and get back to Kerbin. I know it was discussed as something to add to the game once upon a time, but the time is now, before it goes into full release. If not, people will end up putting KSP on the shelf with other games where they\u0027ve killed the boss mob and had nothing left to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.90 career mode, while a HUGE improvement over previous versions... still left me wanting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GTC","CreatedById":108468,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T05:50:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fengist\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fengist\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E.90 career mode, while a HUGE improvement over previous versions... still left me wanting.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood post, and I agree.

It\u0027s a neat idea, sure, but the costs are excessive imho when playing on Normal. And by excessive I mean: they require a lot of grinding. After a while it isn\u0027t even a matter of challenge, because you KNOW that you can send how many satellites in however weird orbits around Kerbin, Mun or Minmus, or even Duna. It just takes time. It isn\u0027t a challenge any more; you only learn to be quick, dirty, and cost-effective. I\u0027m at a point where I need money to upgrade my research center or I won\u0027t be able to research the 500\u002B science techs. It takes something around 3,000,000 credits! That\u0027s... a lot. I racked up almost half the money by fulfilling Duna\u002BIke exploration contracts, but had to do so with a cheapish 70,000 credits interplanetary probe because I couldn\u0027t afford to spend too much on it. The next logical step would be sending a crew to land, but there\u0027s no contract for planting a flag on Duna anywhere in sight and I really can\u0027t justify the expense - if I want to do it, I\u0027ll probably have to go Science or Sandbox. Which kind of kills the purpose. What I mean is, missions have to be logical and progressive, and a bit more programmed. Random missions now and then are okay, but it would be nice to also have more pre-scripted missions with well thought out challenges which naturally follow our progression. On the other hand, I\u0027m asked to land a 12 kerbal supporting outpost on Eve, which is sheer madness right now. Also, it isn\u0027t explained what exactly counts as an \u0022outpost\u0022 - must everything be in a single piece, or is it okay to just have multiple facilities on the surface? The leveling up mechanic for Kerbals ends up being grindy as well - if you hire a new pilot, you better send him to Mun and Minmus so that he can rack up some experience before you send him on more complicated missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, that\u0027s the take away: nice ideas but too much grinding and too little creativity. We can add that ourselves, of course, but I was hoping for the missions to give me a good starting point, not kill it by forcing me to do repetitive, useless tasks in order to gather enough money to spend on what I really value and care about.
