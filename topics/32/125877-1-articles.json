Best advice is to place enough of them to completely surround the circumference of the spacecraft in one axis (all vertical or all horizontal) and keep your spacecraft flat in that respective axis so no matter what point your spacecraft is st, you always get power.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDon\u0026#39;t worry, we all learn our lesson the hard way. My usual fix is to just always place 2 RTGs.

For manned flights you can always push the spaceship into rotation with an EVA Kerbal.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo prevent these cases I usually disable the electricity of the probe core.
