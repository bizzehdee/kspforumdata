Breathable oxygen can then be made from the water. This is essential because even with the best recycling systems available water will decrease over time, and certainly won\u0027t increase even as the colony expands. Drugs or toxins that end up in the water supply would be catastrophic and thus make non-resupply of water unacceptable from the get-go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe site must be safe from radiation (\u0026lt;1Rem/year), so it must be either far enough from Kerbol unprotected, or under a magnetosphere\u0027s umbrella, and definitely not inside the resonant cavity of a powerful magnetosphere (like Jool\u0027s). This excludes Laythe, Tylo and Valls outright, sorry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe site, if on or under ground, must be geologically stable - no frequent seismic activity endangering the installations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, the site must allow for the extraction of waste heat: either by making it possible to radiate it away (access to the vacuum of space) or by absorption of it (access to a lot of mass of temperature \u0026lt;300K). Otherwise the colony is doomed to turn into a pressure cooker, eventually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAdditional considerations:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThese are optional, but important for priorisation.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good solar energy supply helps tremendously - saves on nuclear fuel, and allows growing food locally, saving on resupplies.

In the meantime I\u0027ll pretend there is water ice on the ground. Lots of room and some sunlight (a bit less than on Duna) to grow food, too. And a magnetosphere for protection against stellar wind and cosmic rays, albeit weaker even than Duna\u0027s. But it\u0027s there, I can prove it: there\u0027s very few impact craters on Dres compared to, say, the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, which demonstrates quick erosion even in the absence of an atmosphere, so there must be significant volcanic activity, which means a molten core and thus core magnetism, QED.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) the crazy: Eve, top atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure Eve\u0027s ground is way too hot and the pressure is inconvenient - but just like with real-life Venus, the top of its atmosphere can prove much more welcoming, with pressure and temperature close to Kerbin\u0027s.

Break water and get oxygen to breathe, with hydrogen on the side to inflate balloons with and stay buoyant - it\u0027s not like there\u0027s a risk they\u0027d burn out, since there\u0027s no free oxygen around. OK so there\u0027s not much terrain to explore 10 km above the ground, but the view should be majestic.
