Maybe someday?","CreatedByName":"Ursine","CreatedById":91918,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T23:58:28Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Ursine","CreatedById":91918,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T23:58:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello Squad, and fellow Kerbonauts!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided to register and ask up front about this, as it\u0027s been bugging me now for a quite a few weeks and after researching it for most of today on these forums, the KSP subreddit, Squad\u0027s own page (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.squad.com.mx/SquadSite/index.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.squad.com.mx/SquadSite/index.htm\u003C/a\u003E) and elsewhere, I\u0027m still no closer to a definitive answer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso as a little disclaimer; sorry to make my first post here one that\u0027s so seemingly self-serving, but I\u0027m sure there are others wondering the same thing, so hopefully this can be considered a question on behalf of the \u003Cem\u003Ecommunity \u003C/em\u003Eand not just myself! Also, for those wondering the same thing I am, you can consider this a mini-compilation of what I managed to piece together throughout today\u0027s digging. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo! What I\u0027m wondering is \u003Cstrong\u003Ehow one might land a job with Squad?\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, this would partly depend on what someone brings to the table. From my research it seems like some skills/abilities lend themselves to opportunities via mod development. For example, programmers and 3D artists/modelers might take the path that others have previously and land a job by developing first-class mods and addons. From the research I\u0027ve done it seems there are a handful of modders who\u0027ve gone from player to developer by creating great content (the C7 Aerospace / Space plane stuff appears to have started as a player-made mod, for example, and now C7 is an in-house developer, it seems!). It\u0027s great to see something like this, and that there are \u0022meritocratic\u0022 (work-based) opportunities for skilled programmers and artists to make themselves known to the studio via their work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at this page gives some idea as to the current (or fairly current) team: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/187-An-Update-on-the-Team?page=3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/187-An-Update-on-the-Team?page=3\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this comment by Harvester (from the link above) sheds some good further insight into the average Squad member: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...our titles are deliberately vague actually, because none of us are exempt from doing stuff outside the \u0027job description\u0027. No one is a \u0022programmer\u0022 or a \u0022modeller\u0022, because everyone is supposed to be able to do a bit of everything. So instead, we have \u0022developers\u0022 (doing mostly code) and \u0022content designers\u0022 (doing mostly art).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, of course, as a small and growing team, I imagine things right now would be fairly pragmatic - meaning that Squad is likely only looking for absolutely essential staff? That\u0027s the impression I got, anyhow. Modellers and Programmers seem to be the core but there are other positions listed in the above thread including PR/Community management, producers, tech support and so on. Presumably PR/Community managers come at least partially from the community too (so perhaps as an active community member you can work your way into a volunteer moderation job, and perhaps from there into a paid one in PR/CM?). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow does Squad fill the other positions, though? What about future positions, too, that might not be something that can grow \u0022organically\u0022 out of the community?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those of us who can\u0027t program or model, but who may have other skill sets that Squad might find useful down the line, it\u0027d be great to have a \u0022Jobs\u0022 page listing vacant/upcoming positions to keep tabs on. Perhaps it would be in Squad\u0027s interest to set something like this up down the line too? I couldn\u0027t see anything like that on their webpage (again, as a young, growing company that\u0027s not all that surprising) but perhaps in the future we can hope for something like this? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPurely as an example, check out this page: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.riotgames.com/careers\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.riotgames.com/careers\u003C/a\u003E - That\u0027s the jobs page for Riot Games (makers of League of Legends). There you can see what a fully-grown, \u0022AAA\u0022 studio does when seeking talent. Lots of different positions, and not all of them would arise from community work. For people who love the game and dream of one day being part of making it, it\u0027s a great landing page for them to keep tabs on, should their skills overlap someday with a job the studio is after. Has Squad given any thought to creating something like this, or is it just too \u0022early days\u0022 still for the studio to be needing such things?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, it\u0027s mostly idle curiosity for me as I don\u0027t bring much to the table in terms of \u0022core\u0022 skills (I\u0027d make a bad duck! No programming or modelling skills! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E ) but perhaps others have gone in search of the Squad jobs page and came up similarly empty-handed and curious. If any Moderators or Squaddies would care to comment it\u0027d be much appreciated, and anyone else who might have some thoughts on the matter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...and now that I\u0027m registered, I guess it\u0027s time to stop lurking and join the community proper! See you in space, and thanks in advance for any input!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T00:29:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey are a tiny company that doesn\u0027t do much hiring. Several of their current staff were mod-makers who made things which impressed the guys and were incorporated into the game, though, so that seems to be the most successful approach; make something terrific and wait to hear from them. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
