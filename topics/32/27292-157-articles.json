The guys know they only got 500ms in the tank so they didnt even bother, just waved as they zipped past. Added kerbal alarm clock to my otherwise vanilla career save just to do the ugly math for me.... 3 years before they get another try at a return, though im hoping the 500ms they have when burned down at moho\u0027s orbit will be enough to shunt that encounter directly into an aerocapture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProvided I actually remember to make said correction. 3 years is a bit brutal, even for someone who doesnt care much, like myself.
