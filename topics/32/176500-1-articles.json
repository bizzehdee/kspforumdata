requirements, and conflicting market requirements, and sudden unexpected changes due to market conditions and competitors\u0027 products, and compromises worked out between different people with divergent opinions of What Should Be Done, and \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Elots\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a customer, your interface to this vast,

that people who produce software for a living are generally not idiots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, suppose you find yourself in a situation where there are a bunch of people, working in an industry where folks tend to be pretty smart, who have years of experience doing this for a living, and who (unlike you or me) have full information about the situation.\u00A0 And they\u0027ve made

thing unless you plan to get good use out of it.\u00A0 So the fact that they didn\u0027t do so likely means that something, somewhere, went off the rails.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp

that Porkjet left Squad.\u00A0 We have no idea about his reasons for doing so, of course, nor of what sort of contractual stipulations may have been around his work up to that point-- but it\u0027s safe to say that there \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewas\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E some reason, and there \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewas\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E some contract (because nobody does

able to release it as a separate download, and to put a fairly permissive license on it.\u00A0 So here they have these nifty parts, which the players would likely love to have, but they can\u0027t actually complete the work and/or include it in the game, for some reason, possibly contractual.\u00A0 So, if we put ourselves in their shoes in such a situation, what could they
