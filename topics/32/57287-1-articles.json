The game has increased in popularity many times since I joined the game in version 0.15.2, but even with the extra revenue that the game has brought in, the devteam has only been about 4 full time members (as was said a couple of months ago). I lack knowledge of the gaming industry\u0027s business practices, so I won\u0027t speculate, but the low number of staff is the second largest problem affecting the game at the moment (IMHO).
