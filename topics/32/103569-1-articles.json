Heres what I know:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis station, which was launched by an Energia launcher, was asymetrical - like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.buran-energia.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/50_Sur_le_pas_de_tir_On_the_launch_pad_polyus2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002250_Sur_le_pas_de_tir_On_the_launch_pad_polyus2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, before launch, I set some positive trim on the rockets so that \u0022at rest\u0022 they would be providing vectored thrust (which worked quite well).

And once I did THAT, this weird behavior stopped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, it seems that IF you have a trim set, SAS on, and a kerbal on EVA, forward or backward movement of the Kerbal will cause the trim to \u0022kick in\u0022 (or the nearby craft\u0027s SAS to disengage) and set the craft spinning.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T01:57:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had an EVA going from the Mun to Kerbin, grabbing science...

As posted above, it\u0027s recommended that you zero out trim on any craft within physics range by pressing MOD\u002BX.
