Heres what I know:\n\nThis station, which was launched by an Energia launcher, was asymetrical - like this:\n\n![50_Sur_le_pas_de_tir_On_the_launch_pad_polyus2.jpg](http://www.buran-energia.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/50_Sur_le_pas_de_tir_On_the_launch_pad_polyus2.jpg)\n\nSo, before launch, I set some positive trim on the rockets so that \u0022at rest\u0022 they would be providing vectored thrust (which worked quite well). Once the station was in orbit, I used SAS to \u0022hold attitude\u0022, and found this odd behavior.\n\nDuring testing I switched off SAS, and the RCS system obeyed the trim setting and started rotating the station. Once it did I used ALT-X to \u0022zero\u0022 the trim out. And once I did THAT, this weird behavior stopped.\n\nSo, it seems that IF you have a trim set, SAS on, and a kerbal on EVA, forward or backward movement of the Kerbal will cause the trim to \u0022kick in\u0022 (or the nearby craft\u0027s SAS to disengage) and set the craft spinning."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T01:57:37Z","Content":"I had an EVA going from the Mun to Kerbin, grabbing science...

As posted above, it\u0027s recommended that you zero out trim on any craft within physics range by pressing MOD\u002BX. Moving a ship (doesn\u0027t have to be a kerbal) causes the SAS on *all* craft within physics range to disengage. So if a ship has trim input, the trim input will take over.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-07T03:50:47Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2015 03:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**"},{"CreatedByName":"tg626","CreatedById":112361,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T04:29:22Z","Content":"OK, I had forgotten about that recommendation, thanks for reminding me! :-)"}]}
