As soon as the engines start to sputter from lack of oxygen, a bit of yaw was induced which in turn leads to a positive feedback loop as the intake of the lower-thrust engine rotates away from the airstream.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are an assortment of ways to deal with it. Placing your intakes and engines in the right order can reduce thrust asymmetry; using RCS or Vernors for vectored thrust can counteract the yaw; building a plane with an odd number of engines and shutting down all but the central jet at extreme altitudes can eliminate asymmetry altogether. And, as you mention, keeping an eye on the situation and throttling down or switching to rocketry at the right time can also manage the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHypersonic aircraft are supposed to be a bit tricky to fly; it\u0027s just part of the deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKlockheed Martian has a flameout detector part that can shut down a pair of engines as soon as one begins to sputter, BTW.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Levelord","CreatedById":57711,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-02T18:36:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been told the jets in KSP are not the same as real life jets.
