While I am there might as well get my first kerbal on the Mun.... Poor Ludo Kerman died on my first attempt due to a time warp..uh..mishap..he will be missed. I said next time I am coming prepared! While it is on it\u0027s way I shall launch up another few refueling rockets along with a pod or two and rendezvous with the ship at Kerbin.... yea we\u0027ll see if it goes that way...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShip Details:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EName: NCSA-KES1-IPS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeight: 126.19t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart count: 574\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/599266384745333148/5AA3689010B3DB32C76EE459BB1BF5D6DDCB0167/\u0022 alt=\u00225AA3689010B3DB32C76EE459BB1BF5D6DDCB0167\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWow, that\u0027s not a space station, that\u0027s a colony.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T19:56:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sylon00\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sylon00\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWow, that\u0027s not a space station, that\u0027s a colony.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the name?

When we came back around to the landing site I thought it would be fun to deorbit my lander (no kerbals harmed) aiming at the flag I planted.
