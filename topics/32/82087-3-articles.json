Therefore I think the big candidates are KER, SP\u002B, FAR/NEAR, DRE, EVE and MechJeb (I might be missing a few but those are the names I\u0027ve seen most often here on the forums). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow let\u0027s look at the individual mods. Ferram has already stated that he knows nothing about FAR or NEAR being added to the game. While there is a very small chance that this was said as part of a non-disclose agreement (NDA) it is far more likely that he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s just telling the truth, so we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll scratch that one from the list. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is likely that if they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re buying/integrating a mod into stock, it means it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s something that is hard or time consuming for the team to put it in themselves. Note that while I am an engineer in real life, my knowledge of programming is limited so I could be spouting complete bull-manure here \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst up, Kerbal Engineer Redux. KER is very handy, but for the most part it is a visualization of calculations that are already done by the game. I think that this is something that Squad could implement themselves. They also voiced objections to adding such numbers as TWR and Delta-V in the past.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb: MJ is widely used and can be very handy. I estimate it is of medium difficulty to program (it uses the calculations already in the game like KER, but does a lot more with them) but would take a lot of time to program. However, the biggest argument I see against MJ being incorporated into stock is that it is still somewhat controversial. A lot of people love it others brand it as the work of the devil. While undeniably a very fine piece of work (like just about all mods out there) adding something that is disliked by a large portion of the community as stock is probably not the best move. Again, objections to adding auto-pilot into the stock game have also been raised by Squad in the past.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDRE: Deadly Re-Entry is widely used and Squad have already mentioned in the past that they want to implement re-entry heat into the game. Because re-entry is not yet in the game (other than the visual effects) coding it would probably take considerable time and effort. It would be far simpler to just buy DRE and adjust it to fit stock. So probability points for DRE right there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESP\u002B: new parts! Squad does seem to like them new parts and spaceplanes really need some love. New parts I would imagine take considerable time and effort (being visual as in addition to simply calculations they would require hitboxes, art, etc.) so buying and integrating them would be a big timesaver. Squad also are in the process of improving spaceplanes, so it would make sense to add a spaceplane mod to stock. Also probability points right there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVE: Prettier planets! Would probably take considerable time and effort, has (relatively) high impact on the game for relatively low risk (who doesn\u0027t want a prettier game?). Squad has voiced no real opinion on this matter as far as I know, but I would imagine every dev wants his/her game to be prettier. However, I don\u0027t think visuals are high on the priority list right now. Normally you first try to ge tthe mechanics and stuff right before you start polishing. Priority-wise, I don\u0027t think this will be it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in conclusion: I would guess it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s either DRE or SP\u002B. Both have arguments going for them, but the fact that the team currently seems to be working on spaceplanes, I think SP\u002B is just slightly more likely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext speculator please!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ippo","CreatedById":107018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-19T09:57:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESpacePlane plus is impossible because they had an intern working on it all summer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pizzaoverhead","CreatedById":26349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-19T09:57:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://twitter.com/Maxmaps/status/500784425819725825\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EVia twitter:\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Maxmaps\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Maxmaps\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHave some pretty hot and huge news about parts for you guys to look at on Monday.
