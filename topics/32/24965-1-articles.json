As I drove the rover in for a closer I suddenly find myself being pulled into the hole by unusual gravity acceleration that seems to come from within the hole:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i41.tinypic.com/1fud.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221fud.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOH GOD I CAN SEE FOREVER\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I reloaded a quick save and took a drive around the hole and took measurements with my onboard instruments. It seems like this abnormal gravity is fairly localised and is only noticeable very close to the lip of the hole. But the closer you get to the edge the stronger the pull becomes. So much so that if I drove with in several meters of the hole I cannot prevent the rover from being sucked in regardless of usage of braking \u002B driving backwards / parking sideways. Negative Gravioli Detector reading also reveals abnormal values for Moho:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i40.tinypic.com/33lo8xk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002233lo8xk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.59m/s^2 is slight different from the 2.58m/s^2 elsewhere on Moho, but that 0.01m/s^2 surely isn\u0027t enough to be able to suck a rover in. To be able to pull a rover in over flat surface, the force must originate somewhere close to the surface level rather than at the bottom of the hole, but watch what happens when I drive over the edge:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i40.tinypic.com/1rrqz5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221rrqz5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there is some kind of gravity singularity in the hole near the surface pulling the rover in, then the fall of the rover should also be retarded by the force. Here we see normal increase of gravity as we go down. So whatever this force is, it for some reason is selective - it pulls objects horizontally into the hole yet does not prevent objects from slowing as they fall into the hole. The force also seems to be undetectable despite it\u0027s strength. I therefore must conclude that this anomalous attractive forces is not gravitational in nature and must in fact be new physics!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETLDR: don\u0027t get too close to the Moholes, for here be Krakens\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i43.tinypic.com/29a7ex.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002229a7ex.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh by the way, if you\u0027re wondering, the north pole Mohole is about 5600m deep.
