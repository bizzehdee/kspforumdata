expect good quality in almost everything squad released, and we have also been very much used to them running an open beta test before release in order to let the community playtest and report bugs that the QC team for whatever reason didnt notice.\u00A0 There is nothing wrong with bugs, but releasing a new game update without an open beta test period, and ofc release it with a good number of (yeah minor, but still) annoyances which do get noticed quite quickly isnt what id call professional.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the game was still an indie title, i can excuse bugs because most indie games are made with a rather small dev team with little if any resources to use.\u00A0 After TT took over, i at least expected some good money put into development, but it seems that not only did they neglect the community, add questionable content (EULA scandal and analytics/spyware anyone), and release something with this many bugs, only to meet some predetermined release date.\u00A0 I think it was much better when squad ran everything and they never told us of a release date until they really were ready to do so, and they even put the update off a few times from expected because bugs showed up.\u00A0 Maybe its just me, but id far prefer they delay a product release then push it out with lots of bugs and glitches that make certain things super annoying (its still quite playable, but we have some FX bugs, parts being offcenter, most of the stock missions being badly worded with objectives or plain impossible to complete without knowing whats in their code, ect).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, whatever the case, i still have 1.3.1, and well 1.4.1 seems to work for the most part (i dont really use the 2.5m tanks enough to care about the offset tanks, and the reentry fx isnt an issue when i disable reentry fx entirely).\u00A0 Its not like its a big deal, but id still prefered to see a bit more professionalism and quality after TT took over rather then the mess they did.\u00A0 Hopefully they learn from these mistakes and dont repeat this in teh future...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"J.Random","CreatedById":63332,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-17T02:49:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022

It\u0027s basically the core of the expansion, and probably the only thing that really makes it worth the money. I\u0027ve got high hopes for it, and I\u0027m really trying to get the hang of it. However, the entire 3rd tutorial is simply missing. The game says there are 3, but I only see 2. At the end of the 2nd it tells you to save and continue on to the next one to learn more advanced techniques; but there is no next one. You can\u0027t hit save or continue; you can only hit done.
