I could probably still do it with that, but I\u0027d rather train up an engineer and go fix them, which is why Bill is waiting at Stopover for SixFerry to get back and take him to Minmus. So, I cast around for anything that had a thermometer and enough delta-v to land there. There was a really old satellite I put up in orbit on one of my early Mun missions, carrying a thermometer, a Terrier engine (it did double duty as a transfer stage) and some left over fuel, so I gave it a shot. Managed to get both of the Flight Below readings in a single orbit, then needed only a slight adjustment to land on the next one. Landing in the dark, with no lights, no landing legs, and no Ground Altitude gauge can be kind of nervewracking. This mission had a science payment that got me to 160 science, so I can get the actuators node next time I play.
