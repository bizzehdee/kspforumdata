Imagine a spectrum. On one end of the spectrum is ones and zeros, or \u0027Binary\u0027 code. This is the language that your PC speaks. Every calculation it makes is done in Binary. At the other end of the scale is the English/French/German/other spoken language. This is what you use to communicate with other humans, and can most readily understand. Programming languages act as intermediaries between Binary and our spoken human languages, so that we can tell computers what we want them to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA \u0027high level\u0027 programming language sits further towards the English/French/German end of the spectrum, while a \u0027low level\u0027 programming language sits further towards the Binary end of the spectrum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELua sits very far towards the spoken language end of the spectrum. It is very easy to understand, and that is why I was so easily able to create my little spectator mode mod. Natural Selection 2 is entirely written in Lua, so that people can modify it very, very easily. It can be modified with a simple text editor such as Notepad, and does not need to be \u0027compiled\u0027 before it can be executed.(roughly, to compile a program means to prepare it to run, and takes time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, it is perfectly accurate to call Natural Selection 2 a mod of the Spark engine. Spark is the in-house engine developed as the brain-child of Max \u0027m4x0r\u0027 McGuire. Spark is written in C\u002B\u002B, a fast low level language. NS2 sits on top of Spark, written entirely in easily accessible Lua. It is possible to mess with the game without ever having to deal with the C\u002B\u002B engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, this sounds really cool. Why don\u0027t all games run in languages like Lua, on top of low level language engines? Let\u0027s go back to the spectrum. The further a language is towards the Binary end, the faster it runs on your computer. The further it is towards the spoken language end, the slower it runs on your computer. This is not to say that Lua is absolutely slow, only that it is relatively slow compared to a low level language such as C\u002B\u002B. It is relatively slow because it takes more effort to move all the way from the spoken language end of the spectrum to the Binary end of the spectrum, where the computer can understand and execute the game code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn summary, Lua trades some execution speed for ease of access, and therefore ease of modding. Not just ease of modding, but ease of writing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now, Lua takes up around 50% of the CPU cycles that NS2 goes through to produce ever frame. This is, on its own, almost entirely responsible for the limited framerates that people experience when playing in the NS2 Beta. Rendering in Spark is actually very fast. This is why turning down graphics options, or playing on a more powerful GPU, yields negligible performance benefits.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course it\u0027s not in beta anymore so things have improved since then. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the synopsis of that was codes towards the binary end of the spectrum like C runs better but is much harder to work with due to complexity, while codes towards the human end like lua are slower because of more information needing to be processed, but is more user-friendly in return. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if I got my facts right, assuming (although a \u003Cem\u003Ehighly\u003C/em\u003E unlikely engine change) a low level language would be better the choice for ksp to run faster, but in return make it harder to mod and update, and more expensive because of the higher skill needed to code, correct?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-23T06:14:31Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2013 06:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by WhiteWeasel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4v","CreatedById":67965,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T08:15:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes, no.... most won\u0027t.
