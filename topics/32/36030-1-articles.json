Of course, a marker could make the process of getting very precise landings more accurate. Also, this works poorly with a thick atmo (ie Kerbin or Eve) because it is difficult to predict the exact drag losses. A marker could be helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brusura","CreatedById":57899,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T19:39:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes absolutly, right now I think you can do that with lazormod and the new release of mechjeb ( adding a marker )\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vcazan","CreatedById":59877,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T19:40:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can just make a maneuver node and match it up to where you want to land\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EmissionGeneration","CreatedById":71859,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T19:47:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah Nodes are the best way to go, just make sure you keep in mind after your Velocity will drop, then so will your landing zone.

Launch a probe into a low circular orbit that you will use to begin all targeted descents (Obviously remember the altitude. Mine for Eve is 135km)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Choose a target location beneath your orbit and quicksave (I chose a patch near the equator with about 4.5km hills, but you may also like landing a probe there to judge distance more accurately).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) When you reach the exact opposite point in your orbit (other side of planet), do a de-orbit burn and put your periapsis directly over where your target will be when you get to the other side. Remember the Pe altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.) See how close you get to your target. If you land before your target, raise your Pe next time (do a quickload and try again), if you land past it, lower it next time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.) Repeat steps 3\u002B4 until you are satisfied with your accuracy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.) Remember the orbit altitude and the Pe altitude and use them for targeted deorbits from now on!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Eve, a 135km x ~68km orbit will land you directly beneath your periapsis (search around that Pe, don\u0027t take my word for it. I had lots of parachutes and aerospikes because I was doing an Eve return). Also, if you have lots of wings and fins, you may be able to adjust your trajectory significantly to account for errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nats","CreatedById":58316,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T19:48:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIts incredibly difficult to land anywhere accurately with this game but I wouldnt want to be able to select my landing site. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would prefer to have better landing feedback for example horiz and vert momentum separated at the very least, or perhaps a flight path marker on the screen to show where I am going to land if I continue on this path sort of thing like they have in jets now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont want it made easy its the most challenging and fun part of the game and whereas I do want better feedback I dont want it to ever become a \u0027click a button and land\u0027 affair.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Subcidal","CreatedById":20751,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T19:50:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would be a pain to implement as everybody lands differently.

Just wait in a circular 100km orbit until your ship\u0027s passing over the southern rim of that big impact crater. When you reach that point, put your periapsis at 1.5km and prepare for re-entry. You may need to adjust speed, but all in all it\u0027s an excellent method, and since I found out about it, I\u0027ve never landed more than a few kilometers from the KSC, whereas I used to land almost always on that big landmass that I think goes by \u0022Krussia\u0022 or something.
