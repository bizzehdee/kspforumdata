The summer sale is on at steam. With discounts on lots of games. That means there is a big non-kerbal distraction happening on steam. Even Scott Manley has been showing off the classic Homeworld game recently. Hey you just got that one it too when I was editing my post. It can\u0027t just be me that sees this happening.\n\u003E Agree.\n\u003E \n\u003E Have you tried mixing Station Science and Infernal robotics? \n\u003E \n\u003E The docking ports now need a large scale logistics problem to solve to make them more interesting. Station science provides this through multi part heavy sections that must be docked together in orbit. The logistics support also provides the only real excuse for Space Shuttle development. Add in some hinges from Infernal robotic and you have a new direction to the game.\n\nMods like infernal robotics are great, but sadly there is always that issue with updates breaking the mods and not being able to share your craft files.\n\nAlso thanks to memory issues it will also make make KSP more unstable which is something that has gotten worse over the last versions.\n\nI really look forward to a day when I can actually stop worrying about the 32bit limitations or having the mods break on me.\n\nThis is why I have been so vocal about them releasing the game soon being such a bad stategy. I had expected than once we reached 1.0 these issues would no longer be a thing since by then it should be more or less finished enough to not break mods or savegames with every damn update.\n\nI have come across mods that were discotinued as well so that they were permanently broken after a update."},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T23:12:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E (Says a guy with more posts than almost anybody else on the board, and like a dozen started threads.

The level of physics simulation on \u0022parked\u0022 craft should be dynamically scalled. I think this is a case of KSP forgetting that it\u0027s a game and instead trying to be a physics simulator.
