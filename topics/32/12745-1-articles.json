Instead of fighting atmospheric drag for 70 km when going straight up or at a slight angle, you\\\u0027re fighting 90km of atmospheric drag. Plus, going at that angle, you still have to go upwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m not sure if the first one is worse than the third one, but my experience is that the first one is worse because you need quite a bit of sideways speed to go in an orbit. At least with the third ascent, you already have a direction going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second one is probably the best one, since you\\\u0027re at a slight angle going up, so you already have some sideways direction going. Also, the gradual climb to the height of the orbit is better than a sharp turn because you gain momentum to go sideways already. Getting up to orbital height is easy; it\\\u0027s actually getting into an orbit is a little harder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve learned that going at a slight angle at launch is good, then start to have a more dramatic angle between 10-15km (I usually start going to 45 degrees at 10km with SAS so it changes the angle slowly).
