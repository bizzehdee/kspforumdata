Well it is issue. Mostly because of part count... I remember reading somewhere around that the lightest lander weighted something around 70 tones, and it was made to land on one of the highest points to lower delta V required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy lander was like 150 tons and had a tons of parts. Next I had to built something capable of pushing it to Eve and I had to refuel it in orbit, and refuel lander too and then when I was like few hundreds meters from docking them while fighting with aligning them while my computer was screaming for mercy I decided that it is not worth all the effort (and if something would turn out to be working wrong I would probably kill someone)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really hope devs aren\u0027t planning missions including getting back from Eve. Well, maybe one mission - and it would be like final boss of the game...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T10:46:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see career mode as more like Sim City, or Transport Tycoon than set missions.

Do you think they will just sit for 2 days and fix all issues just before release?
