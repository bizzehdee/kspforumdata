It seems that the LT-1 landing legs act pretty much as they should, even though I\u0027d say they are a bit on the weak side also, but the LT-2 landing legs suffer from weakness, heavily. I\u0027ve been messing with the spring and damper settings for the LT-2 legs to see the effects of them and I believe the developers have set the settings way too low.
