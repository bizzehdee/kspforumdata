It\u0027s one of the things that make it unique from other games. But what did you learn from it that you cherish the most?\n\nFor me.. well, other than the basics of orbital mechanics, I learned that mistakes are inevitable events that strike whether it be a booster slightly placed off-center or a wobbly rocket, and the only thing you can do is learn from it. Making mistakes on a launch is perfectly okay. But you learn from it, cherish it and apply it to your designs, so that when you are having a conventional satellite launch or having your first Munshot, that strut will hold on, that landing leg won\u0027t destroy itself to bits, and the booster won\u0027t separate too early.\n\nWhat about you guys?"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T18:09:09Z","Content":"That little green men don\u0027t come from Duna, er, Mars"},{"CreatedByName":"Rematog","CreatedById":134130,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T18:32:37Z","Content":"Martians Go Home.... good book by Fredric Brown... trash movie...."},{"CreatedByName":"Freshmeat","CreatedById":111048,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T20:37:02Z","Content":"I finally got around to learn orbital mechanics and getting a feel for the rocket equation (I knew how to derive it, but true knowledge comes from application).

My knowledge from teaching physics makes me better at Kerbal, and my experience in Kerbal inspires me with ideas for examples to use in class."},{"CreatedByName":"General Rarity","CreatedById":67829,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T04:43:51Z","Content":"I\u0027ve learned that rockets stage. \n\nWho knew!?\n\nI\u0027ve also learned that the people at NASA/Roscosmos/ESA/etc are very smart.

Building a Space Shuttle that works, docking (I had no idea what this was until KSP), etc."},{"CreatedByName":"dsmiley53","CreatedById":98358,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T06:38:26Z","Content":"There are no straight lines in space."},{"CreatedByName":"Norcalplanner","CreatedById":112223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T06:56:54Z","Content":"Basic orbital mechanics.

Basics of orbital maneouvres and concepts, gravity assists, rocketry related concepts, basic fluid dinamics, spaceship stage comprehension, several space related terms (i.e. SSTO, Apoapsis,...), mathematics, physics, and im forgetting things for sure. \n\nApart from that I constantly pay attention to all real life space launch and have investigated a lot about probes and real space missions. I could say KSP strenghted my interest in space and aeronautics.\n\nDefinitely one of the top 5 (sometimes the best) games ever played, and the most educational by far."},{"CreatedByName":"RobotsAndSpaceships","CreatedById":122975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T22:30:43Z","Content":"In stock KSP, very little.
