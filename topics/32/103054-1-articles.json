It\u0027s one of the things that make it unique from other games. But what did you learn from it that you cherish the most?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me.. well, other than the basics of orbital mechanics, I learned that mistakes are inevitable events that strike whether it be a booster slightly placed off-center or a wobbly rocket, and the only thing you can do is learn from it. Making mistakes on a launch is perfectly okay. But you learn from it, cherish it and apply it to your designs, so that when you are having a conventional satellite launch or having your first Munshot, that strut will hold on, that landing leg won\u0027t destroy itself to bits, and the booster won\u0027t separate too early.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about you guys?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T18:09:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat little green men don\u0027t come from Duna, er, Mars\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rematog","CreatedById":134130,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T18:32:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMartians Go Home.... good book by Fredric Brown... trash movie....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Freshmeat","CreatedById":111048,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T20:37:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI finally got around to learn orbital mechanics and getting a feel for the rocket equation (I knew how to derive it, but true knowledge comes from application).
