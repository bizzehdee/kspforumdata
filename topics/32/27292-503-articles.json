However, through the wonders of makeshift gyroscopic stabilisation (read: spinning the probe really, really fast) and a low throttle, I managed to get the satellite almost up to its target orbit. I have its apoapse at the target orbit and the periapse a bit below, so I just need to wait until it\u0027s over the required location and circularise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I saw a few really neat contracts: 24-77, ant engine and TR-2V orbital tests, and a KD25k SRB suborbital one. Seeing as my launchpad can handle 140t, these experimental parts gave me the power to shoot for the Mun in 30 parts. So, I slapped together a Mun lander and transfer stage, sticking them atop a five SRB cluster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/5Pl93Z.png\u0022 alt=\u00225Pl93Z.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/gmLb77.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gmLb77.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/Omqwpr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Omqwpr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe central SRB ran out at the above location after apoapse - the first pair were on 64%, the second pair (with reaction wheels) on 32% and the central one on 16% thrust. I activated the central SRB manually just after launch, staging it only when the time came for the test. The decoupler between SRB and transfer stage stayed with the transfer stage, and I activated that and the 24-77s manually too. Then I burned to orbit at the right height for almost all the orbital tests, performed them, and immediately burned for Mun intercept. I realised later that I had missed the ant engine test\u0027s orbit height range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/Cs0FOM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Cs0FOM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo patched conics, but I was confident I could do it - it\u0027s been a while, but Mun missions aren\u0027t difficult to do mapless if you can work out your apoapse from your speed. Or make a note of the required speed. In this case, there was no need to do those, as I had the apoapse, just not intercepts. I then noticed I had very nearly enough money to upgrade my tracking station and get those patched conics anyway... but a good chunk of that came from the parts tests I had run on this very mission. One transmission contract later, and I had enough. It turned out that my trajectory would collide with the Mun\u0027s surface, but it was no trouble to move that a bit and get a nice path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/cWH9ji.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cWH9ji.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/jPXZs2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jPXZs2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/1kk73A.png\u0022 alt=\u00221kk73A.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got orbit, lowered it, took a few reports and transmitted one for the contract, then moved to land in the East Farside crater.

The rest of the ship was 29 parts, so I could squeeze it in. I tested the BACC and stabiliser landed, the LV-1R pair suborbitally, and the Poodle and LV-1 in orbit. Fuel line technology allowed me to use droptanks to hold the boosters away, and to save on parts I built up spin when I released them - taking them clear of the engine without the use of separatrons. I didn\u0027t have General Construction at the time, so no TT-70 radial decouplers were available. Bill and Bob rendezvoused with the orbiting scientist (Seanski?), then deorbited and made a safe water landing. The launch core was also deorbited, as I dropped the periapse back into the atmosphere to decouple it between the Poodle test and going to the rescue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Oh yes.

With fuel lines and the 48-7S, I decided that it might be possible for a sufficiently fueled probe to fulfill both contracts, and a little asparagus could give the lifter the oomph to get the apoapse halfway to the lower periapse height. Polaris30 was a fiddly build, I kept running into the part limit and having to remove critical-seeming things. There was another landed BACC test, too. The version you see above, I actually launched nearly to the orbit, still with plenty of fuel left, before I realised its fatal flaw. Exactly 30 parts... no antenna whatsoever. The only place I could see to remove parts was the solar panels, so the next version (not yet launched) has only three, leaving it with a small blindspot - unfortunate with its lack of battery other than the probe core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo long as I keep the blindspot in mind, it shouldn\u0027t be that big of a deal, I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-21T23:35:40Z\u0022 title=\u002212/21/2014 11:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Concentric\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xub313","CreatedById":57408,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-21T23:32:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI spent some time on my ksp addon which I had been neglecting.

What I found out was that those Base/Station missions? Very easy to complete. I had a mission asking me to build a 5-man base on Mun. So, I built a spaceplane, stuck a 4-man crew pod onto it, and flew it to Mun (with a fuel stop in Kerbin orbit). Since it had power, docking ports, etc. and held 5 crew, it met the requirements for the mission. As an added bonus, this made it very easy to level up my new Kerbonauts since they got the 2 points for Kerbin orbit and the 5 for landing on Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Janos1986","CreatedById":132068,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T08:48:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EToday (it was 00:30 when I went to bed, so it counts as today) I upgraded my Harrier VTOL, scrapping the landing legs and adding 4 newly unlocked gear bays in the exact configuration of the real deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne in the front, two on the wingtips and one in the back.

I used the science gained to unlock the steerable winglets and batteries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point I thought I\u0027d got all the low-hanging science available, and unadvisably took two satellite contracts. I was prepared to manually fly a Stayputnik, but turns out that not having solar panels is a serious impediment to an unmanned craft, even with a trio of the first batteries on board. Further complicating things was Remote Tech. It\u0027s difficult to circularise your orbit when the horizon breaks your comms link. That was a slightly unplanned re-entry... And a manned launcher was too heavy to loft to the required orbit and return, even for Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily I had enough funds to upgrade Mission Control, so I got around my contract lock-out and remembered that I hadn\u0027t returned any high-orbit science. So I sent up a manned suborbital and that gave me enough to unlock the first solar panels and RCS thrusters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still didn\u0027t have enough funds to upgrade the VAB, and I\u0027m not getting to either of those contract orbits with a manned launch, so that means setting up a relay network for my unmanned probes. The delay meant my relays were Octoprobes rather than Stayputniks, which helped a lot. They each had four RCS thruster blocks, four solar panels, a communication 16 and the first circular battery. The mk1 probe had a single spherical monoprop tank. The mk2 had 2 monoprop tanks after I realised it would need to manoeuvre relative to the mk1. The mk3 was much the same as the mk2, but with a slightly optimised weight distribution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mk1 and mk2 were placed in a circular orbit by the manned launcher at 100km, and then used their RCS to boost up to a 710km orbit. Jeb de-orbited the manned launcher safely each time. 710km is a little above the minimum of 600km for line of sight to give me a little more leeway during the initial positioning. Also, one/two monoprop tanks was a little more than required to reach this orbit, but I like to de-orbit as much as possible and the surplus have me the capability if these relays ever get replaced with something more capable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter they were both placed in a circular orbit 120\u0027 apart, I launched the mk3 with the same launcher, but without the manned pod. This meant I could stick the launcher on a suborbital flight to 710km and have the relay ciecularize at Apoapsis. The advantage of this was that the uncontrolled launcher de-orbited itself, which it wouldn\u0027t have done if I\u0027d done a usual civilization burn at 100km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a little bit of fiddling, my relay network is completed!
