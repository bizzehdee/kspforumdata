Specifically, if you add parts symmetrically onto parts that have been added symmetrically, then take the root part off and try to re-add them, the symmetry mode becomes unchangeable and parts that were added after the first symmetry action are duplicated or triplicated, or more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ogre","CreatedById":61074,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T23:48:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe bug I have all the time in the latest version is where you have parts with two different types of symmetry (I guess), then drag a new part across one of those on the way to the other. Instead of attaching the way I expect, it will slip into the \u0022wrong\u0022 kind of symmetry, where it puts all instances of the new part on the same part, rather than spreading them to all the sibling parts of the one I\u0027m trying to add to. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can get around this by turning off symmetry, dragging the part where I want it, and only then turning symmetry back on when I\u0027ve already got the new part touching the part I want to connect it to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get this especially, but not only, when trying to build rovers, where I\u0027ll typically have a 4 or 6-way lander on top, and the rover with 2-way structural plates underneath it. If I touch one of the lander engine pods on my way to the rover plates, then the part will be mirrored several times on that one plate rather than attaching one to the back plate and one to the front plate like I\u0027d expect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if I\u0027ve made that very clear. The takeaway though is: turn symmetry off. Don\u0027t turn it back on until you have the single part where you want it. Now turn it on and it\u0027ll do what you expect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Conarr","CreatedById":60613,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T00:49:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, I get you. I\u0027ve seen what you\u0027re talking about as well, I just move passed the part causing the symmetry to change and then manually adjust the symmetry back to what I want just before I place the new part on.
