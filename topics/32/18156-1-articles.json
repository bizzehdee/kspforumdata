I didn\u0027t see our intrepid trio again until the next update which reset the roster. As of 0.16, they are sitting in a command module just a stone\u0027s throw away from the launchpad because I decided to take the coward way and keep them alive this time. Though I am thinking one of these times an SRB or other debris is going to crash down on their pod. ...I should probably find a way to move their module...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I find your picture rather moving, as KSP can remind us of real life events as much as it can come up with imaginative ones.
