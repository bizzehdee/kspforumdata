I was wondering on how i would do a direct interplanetary ascent. Say, like a direct ascent to Duna, or would Jool be easier because of its large SOI? Any tips on how to do this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"soulsource","CreatedById":110576,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-26T17:02:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d say: Wait until you have a transfer window, and then, at the right time of day (\u00BC of a day - 1.5 hours - after or before midnight, depending on your target) launch and burn until you get in intercept. I\u0027d still try to go to orbit first, for efficiency reasons, but well, if you have enough dV or high enough TWR, there should nothing stop you from going directly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-26T17:02:42Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2016 05:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by soulsource\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atlas2342","CreatedById":155194,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-27T01:47:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m\u00A0not sure but shouldn\u0027t this question be in Gameplay Questions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-27T05:29:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe question with vertical launches is always one of timing (as long as your rocket can actually get you there). The best way to find out the timing is just to do it once and revert. You will miss by a bunch, but you can see how much the destination planet moves along its orbit while you are in transit. Once you know how many degrees ahead of your target you need to aim, then aim and fire at it again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
