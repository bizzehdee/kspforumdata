What does happen is that at the point where you turn off jets, a few things change:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1\u0026gt; The stock jets gimbal very well. Without them, you no longer have as much thrust gimbaling to keep you stable if your center of thrust (rockets only) and center of mass don\u0027t line up exactly. If the rocket you\u0027re using to get to orbit doesn\u0027t have much thrust vectoring (and some have none at all) it likely won\u0027t be capable of holding your design steady once the jets are off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if your design isn\u0027t perfectly top/bottom symmetrical, it\u0027s going to nose up/down once the jets turn off. That sort of symmetry is hard to gauge since some things in the game are weightless in gameplay but are treated as having mass in the VAB/SPH (like struts and landing gear), so your best bet is to keep the spaceplane as close to coplanar as possible, not putting anything above or below the design at all, or else make it like an X-wing with a clear up/down symmetry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; Intakes\u0027 drag depends on the airflow into them, so if your intakes aren\u0027t also up/down symmetrical then you\u0027ll have too much drag in one direction. (You don\u0027t want an F-16 style of design, where the primary intake is well below the centerline.) This is also why you should close most of your intakes as soon as you turn off the jets, since presumably the reason you turned off the jets was that the intakes were about to run out of air anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3\u0026gt; Angles matter. When you\u0027re using jets you\u0027re generally thrusting almost horizontally, but when you switch to rockets, the conventional wisdom is to angle upwards again somewhat (say, at a 45-degree angle) to minimize the amount of time you\u0027re dealing with the little resistance from the upper atmosphere. The problem is that if you do this too low in the atmosphere (say, below 25km) then there\u0027s still enough air to create drag that\u0027d push your nose up even further. You shouldn\u0027t be turning off your jets much below this altitude anyway, but it\u0027s still something to watch out for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4\u0026gt; If you\u0027re high enough that you\u0027re turning off the jets, you\u0027re probably also high enough that your flaps just aren\u0027t effective any more. Make sure you\u0027ve got a good flywheel somewhere on your design, preferably close to your center of mass, and make sure to keep the SAS turned on. Yes, cockpits include a flywheel as well, but depending on the size of your plane they just might not be enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re stalling, one of three things is happening. On the design side, either you don\u0027t have enough intakes (likely, given the stats of the stock intakes) or you don\u0027t have enough engine power to keep your speed up. It could also be a question of your flying ability; if you\u0027re climbing too quickly, you simply won\u0027t be moving fast enough at any point to take full advantage of your intakes. Generally, you want to be climbing slowly enough that you\u0027re getting the maximum use out of the intakes, to keep from depleting your air supply while you build up speed. Aim for 350m/s at 11km, 650m/s at 16km, 850m/s at 19km, and 1300m/s at 23km. If you\u0027re turning off your jets below about 1000m/s then you\u0027re really doing something wrong (and 1200 is what you should aim for), and if you\u0027re crossing those altitudes at speeds well below what I listed then you\u0027re climbing much too quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlamedSteak","CreatedById":67223,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T05:21:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for that Spatz, that answers a lot of question without me having to ask them.
