It\\\u0027s like flying with NovaPunch parts... Only way I could get a sane rocket to hold together with this thing at the top was to use 1M parts for the second stage and for 6x LFE boosters around a 3M first stage... ridiculously large rocket, weight about 250 tons. Landing mass on the Mun 17.7 tons...

Both SRBs *and* LFE-based 2nd strap-ons... 3M parts are just so damn heavy. Smallest 3M LF Tank weighs some like 8x as much as the tiny 1M LF Tank...
