Did you use time warp? Using time warp when deploying parachutes makes this happen. Also make sure you deploy the parachutes when you are high up, as they slow you down even when they dont fully deploy and make sure you also have drogue chutes on larger crafts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou would also want the speed to be lno more than max 200m/s or they can ripoff when they deploy fully at 500 meters above surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T15:23:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Comic Sans MS\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u0022Failure is not an option!

It hangs there for a short while as the physics get going and the live feeds for the crew start to come on, and then it drops. The big grating on top of the Launchpad has both rigidity and clipping issues, so the \u0022drop test\u0022 can cause the rocket to bounce, lean over, and/or wobble a bit, causing off-axis forces in unpredictable directions and amplitudes. And these forces, plus the rocket\u0027s own weight even if it doesn\u0027t bounce, are effectively impact loads applied all at once. So it\u0027s not surprising things break sometimes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E- Parachutes randomly fail - i did about 8 flights with one of my rockets most of those flights ended up back on Kerbal yet from lets say 6 landings with parachute 2 suddenly failed and the parachute just stopped working a few feet above ground\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWere you using rockets to help slow you down? If so, you have to be careful never to totally stop your downward velocity or even start back upwards.

Your crafts have weak points where they break because of physical stress, a simple test would be to mount something small on launch clamps and then a small fueltank on top of it, then stack a few large tanks above. You\u0027ll see the large tanks crush whatever\u0027s below them because of their mass (physics at work). So you simply have to reinforce your builds and/or not stack a lot of mass ontop of smaller components.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for parachutes, don\u0027t use physical timewarp when they\u0027re about to deploy (500 meters) nor when about to touch down. Also put them on the heaviest piece or decouple your pod beforehand, the shock of deployment will rip stuff to shreds. They need to be well balanced and there has to be enough of them to slow crafts down for soft landings, that\u0027s also down to design (and testing thoroughly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this stuff happening \u0027randomly\u0027 is down to how on the edge of failure your rocket is, there\u0027s no onetime calculation to see if your rocket breaks or not when it\u0027s on the pad, there\u0027s constant physics calculations being done and even the most miniscule of changes to your ship can make it break. During flight it will be depending entirely on your throttle/direction as that\u0027ll introduce different physical stress on your craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FITorion","CreatedById":7606,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T19:21:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ephysics warp (time warp when in an atmosphere or near a planet) can do weird things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehere read this thread (it\u0027s short) \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/46730-Just-one-question-for-SQUAD\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/46730-Just-one-question-for-SQUAD\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T19:36:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn otherwise flight-worthy design can just randomly destroy itself when the physics starts up.
