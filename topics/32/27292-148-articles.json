I had visited Duna several times before with ISA mapsats and other probes both orbiting and landing. I\u0027d even had an orbiter/return ship visit both Duna and Ike in 0.22, bringing back much Science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch was a simple affair, utilizing an upgraded Apollo-style launcher, capable of putting 72\u002B tons into LKO. Planetary transfer went smoothly as well, needing only one or two course corrections, and arriving at Duna after about 66 days. Airbraking is always the most hair-raising experience, especially on foreign bodies where I\u0027m less familiar with the altitudes necessary for sufficient friction. Dropping down to 11km over Duna is a surreal experience since doing that on any other body with an atmosphere would mean certain capture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA 45x45km orbit was achieved after a half-dozen passes. The lander module successfully decoupled from the interplanetary section and began its descent. I aimed for a landing in the lowlands, knowing that my crew would need as much atmosphere as possible to not be forced to depend on their chemical engines completely for landing. It\u0027s unnerving how low a ship gets before slowing to below 100m/s, even under 13 parachutes. Landing was achieved with a moderate use of fuel, bringing the crew to rest on a slight slope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExperiments were run, soil samples collected, and a lovely hexagonal flag planted at the site. The greatest mission glitch would prove to be the failure of the rover to disengage from the underside of the lander. It would mean the ship would drag an extra 1.3 tons of mass back to orbit and the crew\u0027s ability to explore the area was limited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a few hours on the surface and having completed their mission objectives, I elected to bring them back to orbit. The diciest stage was now to be tested, to see if the lander had enough fuel to return to orbit. The crew of Duna Visitor launched eastwards, tracking to follow the orbit of the awaiting interplanetary stage. Not only did the lander prove to have enough fuel, but through some inept handling, I failed to gravity turn at the appropriate time and put them into a trajectory with an apoapsis of 80km. Some maneuvering high above Duna placed them into an 80x42km orbit and further adjustments achieved a circularized 42km orbit, allowing them to play catchup with their target. Several days of chasing were needed to rendezvous, but the lander successfully met the interplanetary stage. Once within 60m, I decoupled the lander\u0027s main fuel tanks, landing legs, and engines, leaving the forward section equipped with the 3-man capsule, experiment modules, flight computer, and RCS fuel and thrusters. Docking backwards, to rejoin this forward module to the interplanetary stage, is an awkward experience, even after changing control perspective to that of the rear docking port. While the controls act appropriately to how they should be for that perspective, my own mind didn\u0027t handle it well. After a few minutes of thrusting, the ships were reunited and the most dangerous parts of the mission concluded. The interplanetary stage still carried ~2/3 of its launch fuel, more than enough to return to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crew remained in Duna orbit for several more weeks awaiting the departure window. The flight home was nearly uneventful with only a significant course correction of ~700m/s required to ensure entry into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheir triumphant return from Duna heralded a leap in Science of 1500 points and a major milestone in my own efforts in space travel.
