My first was a fairly simple little thing which made a 100km orbit with about 5% fuel left. My second successful spacebird (which looks FAR more snazzy than its predecessor) managed to get that 100km with around 18% fuel left over! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that strikes me as a bit weird, is that my second bird seems to fly at a really strange profile for a plane. It was sitting at around a 20 degree incline and just barely gaining altitude at around 18,500m, is that normal when space planes start getting heavier? or is something in my design a tad goofy? Just seems to be a tad bit...off to me, but maybe that\u0027s Kerbal physics at work, so I\u0027d just like a bit more insight on the subject from those that might be a bit more in the know. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway here\u0027s an image of my spaceplane with an example of what I\u0027m talking about in regards to its goofy angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cwmftw.com/files/ksp1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ksp1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-15T07:08:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIdk, I remember seeing the video of someone who flew an SSTO to Laythe, and their plane was flown at 45 degrees for much of the accelerating towards orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you haven\u0027t got enough lift because the air is too thin, and need help from engines?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps someone with more expertise than myself can advise. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, welcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-15T07:10:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause the game\u0027s current aerodymanic system is a placeholder, KSP wings are not airfoils, and the angle of attack is a primary factor in determining how much lift they will generate.
