Could be good news for one of my 0.22 based SSTO\u0027s. Evil little thing used an air-hogged turbojet to scream to high altitude, then fired off a pair of those MK55 Radials strapped to the wings just before flameout on the jet. Horrible fuel efficiency, but for a crew shuttle, it was great. Most of the time, it was just doing crew transfer to the Station, or to interplanetary ships, so it only had to make a 120 or 150 km orbit. It\u0027d circularize on the 55\u0027s, rendezvous with RCS fuel, stop at the station to pick up some rocket gas and drop off crew, pick up any crew to be returned to Kerbin, and blast off for home, consuming the entire quantity of rocket fuel in a desperate bid to guarantee a lower-than-35km periapsis. Then it was a return to home factor on the jet engine, which had plenty of fuel left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also meant I had plenty of work to do with dropping off and exchanging gas tanks, which meant I always had something to do in my space program. Transfer crew, crew return to Kerbin, launch Minmus base, send shuttles of crew, rotate station crew, send up gas tanker to replace empty Rockomax Orange with full Rockomax Orange, return empty tank to Kerbin for recycling, and so on. Those ships consumed fuel rather well, though I found myself switching to alternate engines often enough because those radials were incapable of the 200 km orbit circularization needed when I started making heavier motherships. Was a bit more picky back then, that 120 km was my stations, 150 was inter-Kerbin/ light interplanetary ships, and 200 was for Jool Class ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese days, I spend a lot of time not really leaving the Kerbin system. I don\u0027t have the patience for the long missions anymore, as there\u0027s not much new to see.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
