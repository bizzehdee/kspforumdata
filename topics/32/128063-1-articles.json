I use such roleplay that nuclear stuff is not allowed to hit Kerbin or be used in atmosphere, if it is not necessary for save the crew. I would count Orion as a nuclear stuff if I used it. Environmental effects must be tremendous because USA and USSR banned nuclear tests in atmosphere soon after they get them work reliably.

But maybe 20 km/s is a small correction in interstellar traveling. There is not any physical restrictions to make one bomb correction. Orion can be throttled by making time between explosions longer or by using smaller bombs or bombs with less work mass around them. However there is practical limit how small fission bombs can be.

It has suggested to real interstellar traveling. It does not need small correction maneuvers on accurate Hohmann orbits. You just turn nose to the target and open full throttle. If it seems that you do not hit, you burn radially until you are on course. 20 km/s does not destroy your dv budget. Trajectories are slightly bending hyperbola around Sun.

Everybody are right, they all have fun. It is main objective of gaming. Everyone should try mods and rolegame rules and decide if they are too overpowered or restrictive in own gaming style. Many people like Orion and if you feel it may be interesting why you have to ask permissions from us. Mod is free to download and simply to install.

It\u0027s the closest humanity has to a torch ship (being defined as something with simply ludicrous amounts of delta v). You get both high thrust and (relative to what we have now) high Isp. We had the technical knowledge in the 50s and 60s to put essentially as much mass as we wanted into orbit around the earth (or slightly less unreasonable amounts of payload around mars, or saturn, or, you know, anywhere).

The easiest way to throttle an Orion plate would be with variable yield bombs. The problem though (as I understand it) is that to throttle, you essentially have to pick what acceleration you want, figure out what yield you\u0027ll need for that, let the plate come to a stop at the mid point, then launch a half-charge, then go to the full charges for your give acceleration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-18T14:32:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think you would do much throttling with an orion drive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts not quite a \u0022torch ship\u0022 under normal definitions... it would not constanty thrust... it would not fly brachistichrone trajectories.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would fly very high impulse trajectories.
