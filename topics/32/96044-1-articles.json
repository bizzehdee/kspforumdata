As I progress further and further down development chain and get closer and closer to achieving the end result, I see that there are plenty more things I need to get right, if I want to get this right in the first place, and give you all accurate measurements and predictions to go off of. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESO, that brings me to my question; Of any of you people reading this, who has the willingness to go about calculating some values of KSP\u0027s planets\u0027 atmospheres? One thing in particular would be chemical composition, and getting the molar mass of the atmosphere. For example, in this equation for density: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDensity = Densityb (Tb -Lb * (h -hb) / Tb)^(g0 * M / R* * Lb)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhere b is the layer, and M is the molar mass, but for Earth\u0027s Air, I will need values for Duna, Jool, Eve, Laythe as well! And for any of you weather fans, or science nerds who may want to assist a little fox in making weather happen, lend a hand, it\u0027s well appreciated!~\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESincerely,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESilverFox8124~\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalMacDa","CreatedById":133064,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T22:10:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if this thread is in the right place...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
