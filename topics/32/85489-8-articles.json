In other words possibly more KSC\u0027s, more launch pads, more landmark buildings, more things to simply blow up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlong with this you could say in the far future you can create buildings/ secondary launch locations. These locations would be essentially buildings, but as such they can\u0027t be permanent. Which is where you come in. If things can be destroyed (as the New ksc or any other part) things can be created just as much as they can be removed. This is all implied, there is no mention of more launch locations.

This has been proposed for a while, the Devs wanted to do it and it does fit in with the next explosion effects. It also fits in with the newest building added to the KSC which possibly with be the last. Yes the Devs could of went over the flight dynamics or added more biomes or done this or that.
