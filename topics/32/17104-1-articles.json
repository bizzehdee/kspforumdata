I\u0027ve watched a lot of videos from kurtjmac, Scott Manley and trydyingtolive on the Mun and orbits and whatnot, but I have a question that\u0027s been bothering me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIs it possible to do an Apollo-styled landing?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA larger spacecraft would lie in orbit, and a landing vehicle would be attached by radial decoupler to it. Perhaps two counter weights could also be attached to balance out the rocket. (Obviously, you would need a mod to allow you to put more than one command module on to uour rocket.) The landing vehicle would deorbit and land, then rendevous with the orbiting craft, transfer crew from lander to larger vehicle, and return home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously you need a mod, but can it be done? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-16T22:41:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Rakketz, the answer is \u0022Sort of\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll need the Crewtank mod and the Mechjeb mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can send a craft to the Mun with a lander stage with the crew tank and mechjeb, transfer your crew to it, decouple it, and control it via Mechjeb to the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you can launch to orbit again, rendezvous and transfer your crew back, then fly home in your main ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander cannot redock though, that functionality just doesn\u0027t exist yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vostok","CreatedById":22467,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-16T22:45:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShort answer: No.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could possibly, with mods, do a russian style moon landing \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/55VeMPrzDRc?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E \u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E, but it would require two controllable pods on one ship, something that requires mods.\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what you can\u0027t do is re-attach (solidly) a detached part back onto the parent ship.
