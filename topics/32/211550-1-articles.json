I remember back in, oh, late 2010 or so when HarversteR came onto the Orbiter Forums and started sharing his new project: a funny little spaceflight game where you build your rocket from parts and then fly it. Needless to say, on a forum dedicated to a much more hardcore spaceflight sim, we all viewed it with some curiosity and encouraged him to press on. I looked at it, thought it was kinda eh, and went back to wrestling with my beloved Orbiter.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor those who\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0know of Orbiter, I can\u0027t say I blame you. It\u0027s a fairly niche product. Full\u00A0\u003Cem\u003En\u003C/em\u003E-body simulations, fully to scale solar system... and none of the flexibility in designing ships, planes, rockets, etc, that KSP has. It\u0027s the passion project of a single man in England, and only gets updated every couple years. (2010 to 2016 was the last update gap that I paid any attention to.) It\u0027s a proper simulator, like Microsoft Flight Simulator or Digital Combat Simulator, especially with projects like the aforementioned XR family or the G42-200.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, I finally dipped my toes into the KSP party in December 2011, with (I believe) V0.12 being my introduction. I downloaded it onto a flash drive and played it on the computers at college instead of doing homework.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u00A0(And yes, it was small enough to do that kind of stuff back then.) Those early days where we had only the sandbox, Kerbin, the Mun, and the Three Brothers. No tutorials, no fancy plugins, not even multiple flights at once. Lessons learned from hard experience were shared in the forums, and were taken to heart. Some, like how to properly escape the soup of an atmosphere we had back then, have largely fallen to the wayside as irrelevant. Others, like the rule of thumb for flying to the Mun (\u0022The Munway opens at Munrise\u0022), still hold true to this day, and I occasionally lean on them, even in the days of MechJeb, maneuver nodes, etc. Something to be said for that kind of simple, seat of the pressure suit flying, ya know?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then 0.14 hit. And hoo boy, what a difference. Multiple flights at once, and all new Kerbals! Persistence! We could do rendezvous missions, but that was about it. No docking, no EVA. But hey, you could land on the Mun next to the ship you crashed. That\u0027s a rescue, right? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u00A0Plugins became a thing. First iterations of autopilots like MechJeb cropped up, as well as ones long since forgotten. (Anyone remember Lazor Guidance? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E) I definitely remember an early plugin for hunting monoliths and such... an AWACS rotodome with a two-color light to tell you if you were travelling towards and anomaly, or away. Simple, but effective. And the parts packs mods back then... I think the legacy of only a few live on. C7 plane parts started out as a mod before they rolled them into the stock game, iirc, and Firespitter still lives on in a much updated form, but beyond that... things like NovaPunch, one of the classic packs back then? Gone. I don\u0027t know if many of those early mods and plugins survive anywhere anymore, as we shared them on the forums directly back then. No SpaceDock or CurseForge or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E available.\u00A0 And after The Great Forum Derp of 2012... well, lots of that stuff got lost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that, things seem to kinda blur together. EVAs, the rest of the Kerbol system, docking, tutorials, rovers, probes, electricity, communications, asteroids, ion engines, Science, career mode, banishment of the soup atmosphere... Everything came together to make the core of the game we came to know and love.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd then, the much awaited V1.0 hit. Much celebration from the community. We got \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E, reentry heating, all new Kerbals (again!), fairings, and a whole lot of fun. (Especially with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E. You didn\u0027t need to get a mod to refuel your Jool 5 mission anymore!) It was a glorious time. The community was going full tilt. Challenges, missions and exploits being shared, cooperative saves... All of that had been present before, but now it took on a whole new level of energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich was good, as the pace of updates slowed down moving on from 1.0. Less tinkering with core mechanics at a rapid pace, and more methodical, well tested updates. New parts, new capabilities, new functions, all introduced with great success and much appreciation from the community. Parachutes for Kerbals? I can\u0027t imagine KSP without those personal \u0027chutes anymore, tbh. literally game changing. EVA Construction? Definitely a case of the community inspiring the devs to make their own version. (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E is a staple of mine ever since it got introduced, and it actually pairs quite well with the stock version.)\u00A0 Fireworks? Oh, man. Not gonna lie, I made a few attempts at Orion drives with them and holy cow was that fun while it lasted. Robotics? Another community inspiration, and I\u0027d almost argue better than the mod that inspired it. I certainly have made good use of the robotics on many an occasion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThrough all of this, though, the community has been the heart and soul of the game. Between the diversity of mods available, the challenges we pose to each other, the missions we share to inspire others, and the help we give to those who are staring at a learning curve that seems insurmountable... We\u0027re always there for each other. And I can\u0027t thank all of you enough for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, as we prepare for the arrival of the successor to our beloved booster burning, Jeb launching, Kraken summoning game, I ask all of you...\u00A0 what are your favorite memories from the OG KSP?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jacob Kerman","CreatedById":223574,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-17T18:05:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy first time playing was in 2016 (Yeah, I know, pretty late, huh?) And I instantly fell in love with the game. It had everything I had ever wanted in a space flight game, and I haven\u0027t stopped playing since. With KSP2 coming out, I am definitely exited, but like many, I will never say goodbye to such a wonderful game, and I encourage the Devs to keep working on what has motivated my to the point, that now Im going to college to get in the space flight industry! I didn\u0027t even want to go to college! This game is needed to plant the seedlings of wanting to learn in the minds of children these days. This game let me express what I want to learn about, what I want to do, let me make my own choices, learn from my mistakes, and have fun! We need these games to learn, to experience, to grow! This game has done more for me than most schools or books, even people! I dont think that the Devs understand what they have accomplished, or what they mean, but if they read this, Thank you for all your work, effort, and patience.

all the quicksave files for your career can\u0027t be accessed individually outside of the game, that career becomes unplayable.\u00A0 This is still occurring in 2023.\u00A0 The only way I have been avoiding losing another career save is by backing the file up to the PS cloud storage upon normal shutting down of the game application.\u00A0 That way, when a crash corrupts the save, I just download the uncorrupted file from the cloud, and lose the last session instead of the entire career.\u00A0 It\u0027s not ideal, but it\u0027s better than losing everything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI recently tackled a Moho landing and return to Kerbin to unlock the platinum trophy for the game, which was tremendously satisfying.\u00A0 I also built my version of the NASA space shuttle and launched it into orbit without ever opening the map screen.\u00A0 I haven\u0027t been able to gracefully land the shuttle yet, but I did land it;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg

spaceship that I constructed in orbit around Kerbin, that involved several multi-port docking maneuvers.\u00A0 This ship will likely never see action, primarily because we still don\u0027t have EVA construction and I can\u0027t add much needed structural supports.\u00A0 I still love this game, and always challenge myself with new goals.\u00A0 I just wish the console version hadn\u0027t been left in the dust.\u00A0 We\u0027re still on 1.10;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022
