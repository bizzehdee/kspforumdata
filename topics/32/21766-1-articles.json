All the parts related to each plugin appear in my parts menu in game but all say \u0022This part is not available in your version of KPS.\u0022 Any addons I have that just involve parts I have been able to install by just copy/pasting the parts files to my parts folder in the KSP folder. Doing the same with the Plugins to the Plugins folder in the KPS folder does not seem to be working. In the case of the \u0027Electrical Energy\u0027 plugin there are other folders such as \u0027Resourses\u0027 and \u0027Sources\u0027. I was able to find a Resources folder in the \u0027KPS_Data\u0027 folder so I did that same there, still nothing worked. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was originally running 0.17 but went back to 0.16 on the chance that the mods were outdated. I havent been playing KPS for very long, just a couple of weeks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClearly I am doing something wrong with where am copying the files after unzipping the downloaded plugins files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPLEASE PLEASE HELP !!!!! It has become a battle of wills now, and I really want to get these mods working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do I need to do ??\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
