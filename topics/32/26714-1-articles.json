As the Kerbals might land just about anywhere, the plane needs to have enough fuel to do a full trip around Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question then becomes, what is the most fuel efficient atmospheric engine one can build? What altitude should I be flying at? I noticed that the basic jet engine is listed as having a higher Isp than the turbojet engine, but after running a few tests, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m thinking this data must be based off of an altitude where the turbojet engine hasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t reached its optimal Isp. Right now I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m leaning towards using a turbojet engine plane and flying it around 15,000m, would this be close to as efficient as I could get? I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m also thinking there would be no need for more than one engine, is that correct? What should I be using for air intake to optimize efficiency?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T20:14:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was a challenge a long time back, where players had to get as far as possible on as little fuel as possible, the trick was lots of wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I don\u0027t mean with the infinite glide bug either, seriously large wings were used and the craft were very slow, but man, they were frugal \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RawChicken","CreatedById":57199,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T20:25:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, so I did a plane for exactly the same reason as you.

With a fast enough aircraft, you can go around the world several times by making a series of sub-orbital hops out of the atmosphere. If you convert a sub-orbital hop into a proper orbit, you\u0027ll be able to circumnavigate the globe as many times as you like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest way to make sure you can go from anywhere on Kerbin to anywhere else is to make a spaceplane which can go into orbit, land, orbit again, and land again.
