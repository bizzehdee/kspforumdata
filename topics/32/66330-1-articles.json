Everything the player does not manually park at KSC (like a spaceplane) would be sold at a loss, rebuying it no longer simulates having in storage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if reusability were to be a thing in KSP - besides parking a spaceplane next to the hangar or building a huge crane to dock a pod onto a new rocket - it would have to go all the way really:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScrapped parts would have to be stored as a numerical value in the VAB. As soon as the player presses launch this value would be reduced as would be the budget by the costs of the parts newly bought to assembe the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would also open the possibility to introduce \u0022mission parts\u0022 from contracts, special payload put into the players storage to be rocketed to its destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rickenbacker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rickenbacker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat can be solved, though. Just have any parts that leave the rendering range on a collision course with the planet, and not going too fast, automatically recover.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternative/possible solution: Every part/stage that gets deleted from the simulation is stored in \u003Cem\u003Elimbo\u003C/em\u003E. Via an option at the space center a background simulation is run to calculate the survival/destruction of the stored parts. This allows for lag-free (cough) continuation of gameplay and the background simulation can be run by the player at any time he is comfortable with it. (Which might take a few minutes depending on the size of said \u003Cem\u003Elimbo\u003C/em\u003E), would probably have to be limited to a fixed number of part-assemblies/timespan.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-21T12:52:05Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2014 12:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by KerbMav\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
