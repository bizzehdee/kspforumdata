The plan was to use the same Launcher and interplanetary that I had been using to get to the inner planets. Once I was at Jool, I would drop off one probe just above the atmosphere, and one a little higher, and then I would finish off the mission by crashing the interplanetary stage into Jool. That was the plan at least. The launch went fine but not the transfer. I came in a little ahead of Jool, so to make a successful entry into its system, I had to use a lot my my precious Dv to raise my orbit enough to get an SOI change. After I had used most of my fuel, I had a very long timewarp wait until I entered Jool\u0027s SOI. When I finally did, I used all but a sliver of the rest of my fuel to bring myself into an orbit. Once I tried to circularize my orbit however, I ran out of fuel. I tried using RCS, but that was exhausted too, so I dropped one of the probes, and timewarped to see what happened. What happened was the Probe and launcher were thrown out of the Jool System at high velocities by Vall. The probe is now going interstellar, and the launcher is in a highly eccentric orbit with a total period of about 30 years. The interplanetary launcher is going to be save edited to be a comet in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis Probably isn\u0027t my worst fail, but it\u0027s the best I can remember.
