I think it\u0027s axis 9 and 10(?) do the axis on each trigger alone, so zero when released and full when depressed. So it may do what you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFYI this was the standard behavior pre 1.0. With 1.0 they made assigning axis 2 rather than 9 and 10(again question mark) default.
