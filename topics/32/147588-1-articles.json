He was mocking my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E abilities, or lack thereof. On one of my attempts at a powered landing after a suborbital flight, he laughed because I really only had a sliver of fuel and airbrakes left. As the ship came hurtling back to Kerbin, I decided to EVA the entire crew of three Kerbals around 10km from the ground. Imagine my surprise when only one died upon impact. If I recall correctly, they were doing in the neighborhood of 40-50 m/s. Anyone else experience anything like this? Is WAD in vanilla? While hilarious it seems a bit ridiculous. While I am using mods, none that should do anything to allow this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what exactly *is* Jeb\u0027s crash tolerance?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stargate525","CreatedById":53585,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-14T00:30:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf they land on their helmets, it\u0027s very very high.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"W.
