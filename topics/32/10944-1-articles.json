In the real world, having an angle of attack (angle to airflow direction relative to the plane, usually assumed to be just angle to horizontal) of over 16 degrees will stall the plane making it fall pretty quickly. In KSP, this mechanic is nonexistent, and wings continue to generate lots of lift at ridiculous angles. because of this, a good angle of attack simply depends on whether you\\\u0027re going for distance or height. if you want height, 60 degrees works well, but for distance, you might want around 30 degrees. An optimal one is actually much the same as a projectile -- 45 degrees."},{"CreatedByName":"Mustangrande","CreatedById":21742,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T21:54:12Z","Content":"A projectile in a vacuum, of course.

At 19,000m I switch off the jet engines and go purely on rocket. Then at about 40,000m I pitch down to pick up more horizontal speed.\n\nThe spaceplane I use is:\n\n[http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=12625.0](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=12625.0)\n\n\u003E ![34ih8y9.jpg](http://i45.tinypic.com/34ih8y9.jpg)\n\nSurprisingly the weight penalty from bringing two deadweight jet engines from 19,000m to 70,000m is more than offset by the fuel saved in the first 19,000m, especially the first 8,000m where the plane uses pure jet power.

In real airplanes the main gear are close to the center of mass and hold around 90% of the weight of the airplane. So if you are \u0027stuck\u0027 it just means your landing gear are too far back so too much weight is on the nose gear. If the landing gear were placed too far back in real life, the airplane would also be stuck and unable to raise its nose for takeoff (This may also indicate you need more elevators). If you have a problem with tail strikes I recommend either putting the gear on pylons to make them longer or raising the tail up."},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T22:06:53Z","Content":"My orbital spaceplane, the *Vulcan*, has an engine set-out comprising of two high-altitude jets, and two NERVA engines on either side.
