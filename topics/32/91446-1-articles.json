I have a Mun probe based on the O-10 engine that\u0027s designed to hop around looking at scenery, then return to Mun orbit for a refuel before going back to the surface. I experimented with changing the design to use the ant engine or the 48-7S, and found that the added weight of having to carry a separate tank for my monopropellant, which is necessary for docking maneuvering, ultimately causes the lander to be heavier for the same delta-v, despite the better ISP from the bipropellant engine!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was quite surprised at that result. Up until 2 weeks ago, I had completely dismissed the O-10.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boris_T_Roach","CreatedById":27512,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T18:17:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like \u0027em\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMind you I only use them on small craft to adjust AP/PE by a small amount after the craft has been released into orbit by a larger ship\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I\u0027ve now taken to ions for the job\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T18:29:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Ant is my go-to engine for tiny space probes.
