I\u0027m currently in the middle of that flight and I noticed a new feature in the map view. On the right of the screen are two tabs, the first has an icon of an \u0022i\u0022 which give vessel information, but its the second one that\u0027s more interesting. Its marked with an icon of a Kerbals head and clicking it shows you where they are seated in the craft (left seat, right seat, middle seat) and below that are two bars, one labeled courage the other stupidity. Is it possible that in this latest version, your individual Kerbals gain experience with each mission? It\u0027s interesting because perhaps this gives you an incentive to return them home from their mission and not strand them on other worlds so that you may use more experienced pilots for later mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-22T22:52:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2013 10:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by OUScooby\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Malachai","CreatedById":61407,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T22:45:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know those stats existed in previous versions.
