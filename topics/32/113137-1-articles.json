And I blew it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was working in a research facility back when everyone thought H2 powered cars were the future, before Li-ion batteries got really good and really cheap. One of the projects was a new way to store the H2 in a solid state medium. The head boffins wanted a cheap and easy way to test it out. So I said, \u0022How about a lawnmower?\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy partner and I acquired a kit meant for adapting a gasoline-driven generator to run on propane. Then we went to a local dealer for the lawnmower. The owner overheard us talking about where we were going to drill the hole in the carburetor and how much we\u0027d need to delay the spark timing; also, how long to make the extension cord for the electric starter so we could start it from behind cover. \u0022Should I even bother filling out the warranty card for you boys?\u0022 he asked us. \u0022Nope.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe did the modifications in a few days, then wheeled it out behind the building and hooked up the hydrogen system. Naturally it didn\u0027t start. And then it didn\u0027t start again. And then it kicked over a couple of reps--and then it failed. Encouraged by evidence of some kind of combustion I held the starter down for a few more seconds--then the hydrogen that had accumulated in the engine ignited, blasting off the oil fill cap like a mortar rocket. We approached cautiously, knowing that a hydrogen flame is both (1) really hot and (2) invisible. The engine was trashed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext day we got a second mower from the same place (\u0022I knew you\u0027d be back!\u0022) and did it all over again. This time with a bit of an adjustment to the spark timing the mower started right up. Of course the project went nowhere, but hey hydrogen lawnmower lolz.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corw","CreatedById":7116,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T20:33:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve killed guy named Jeb.

Including lighting the roman candles and pointing them at each other like guns. Lighting the bottle rockets in our hands and firing them into the surf. (Looks really cool when they go \u0026lt;POP\u0026gt; underwater.) Good times. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne time we go down and are being our usual unwise selves on a deserted beach. We turn around and there is a Mexican soldier standing next to his Jeep parked next to our van. With his rifle. And his rifle is not on his shoulder. And I\u0027m all, \u0022Okay, everyone stop what you are doing, keep your hands where he can see them, and, TERRI, WHERE ARE YOU!\u0022 (Terri being the one person in our group who spoke Spanish.) Just as I finish saying this, Eric comes running around the corner of the van with his roman candle firing everywhere, screaming like a banshee. Mr. Mexican Soldier now shoulders his rifle and aims it at Eric. Eric sees the rifle, drops his roman candle, puts his hands up, and starts screaming like a completely different type of creature, \u0022Don\u0027t shoot! Don\u0027t shoot!\u0022 Now Terri finally arrives on the scene and starts talking the soldier down off of the ledge in very soothing tones of Spanish. Turns out the beach we were on had been secured for Mexican military exercises, and we had somehow managed to find an unsecured entrance to it. After some quick apologies and a rapid cleanup we got the heck out of there. And once the adrenaline wore off we all started laughing hysterically. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-----\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother time we\u0027re down there shopping for fireworks and we saw: The Boom. It was in the back of one of he shops. You could call it a firecracker, in the same way that you could call Godzilla a lizard. It was about a foot tall and about five inches in diameter. The vendor claimed it was four sticks of dynamite bundled together. We had our doubts about that. It was definitely four somethings wrapped together, with their fuses wrapped together at the top, and it had a label on the side that said, \u0022Fuse is guaranteed to last for 15 seconds\u0022. (This becomes important later.) But there was no doubt about two things: It was huge, and we wanted it. He wanted $60 for it, we could only haggle him down to $45, and that was a lot for us, so we moved on. But I kept looking over at my buddy Robert and saying, \u0022You know we\u0027re going to go back and get The Boom, right?\u0022 \u0022Yeah, I know,\u0022 was his response. At lunchtime we went back to the shop and pulled the, \u0022All we have left is $30!\u0022 card, and it worked, we owned The Boom. We went out to the beach and had our usual hijinks, saving The Boom for the finale. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it\u0027s getting late, all of the other fireworks have been expended, so it is time to light off The Boom and go home. But as stupid as we all are, none of us are stupid enough to light this thing. So we draw straws. And Manny draws the short straw. So we pick a rocky point on the beach and set out The Boom. Manny sits out with a lighter, the rest of us retire to a respectable distance. It\u0027s windy, so he has to huddle up against the fuse to get it lit. Finally after several tries he gets it lit. And from our perspective, it looks like we\u0027ve been ripped off! A giant shower of sparks lights up the twilight sky! What is this, some kind of roman candle or something? Manny has a shower of sparks go off almost in his face. He falls over on his butt and looks at the thing for just a second. The bundled fuses are what is sending this terrific shower of sparks upwards. (What had happened was that the vendor wrapped the fuses of four large firecrackers together when he concocted this monstrosity. And, as any pyrotechnics technicians in the audience already know, when you wrap a fuse it burns faster. So lets all say it together with Manny as he comes to the dread realization in his mind: ) \u0022This fuse is not going to last fifteen seconds.\u0022 He rolled over, got onto his feet, he made it one step, and then\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;BOOM\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly our disappointment was replaced with a mix of exhilaration and terror. All we saw was a four-foot fireball with Manny\u0027s figure silhouetted against it. He went sprawling on the ground and we went running up to him. We flipped him over and he was just staring at us wild-eyed. We\u0027re asking him all these questions, \u0022Are you okay?\u0022 \u0022Are you hurt?\u0022 \u0022Can you move?\u0022 Totally not realizing that his ears are ringing so bad he is stone deaf, all he remembers is us huddled around him flapping our jaws. He was fine, his hearing came back after a couple of minutes, his ears were ringing for a day or so, he skinned his palms on the rocks. And, once again, when the adrenaline wore off, we all started laughing hysterically. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOMG we were idiots.
