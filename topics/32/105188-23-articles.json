I bought it for 28, but I could have bought it for as low as 16 if I had waited for a sale. This game should be the standard $60 for a game. In an industry where people pay $70 for crappy games, KSP stands alone as an Early Access that provided many times over its value in content than originally promised. If you don\u0027t like the price of KSP, don\u0027t buy it. You are the one missing out, not Squad.\n\nSquad is actually missing out. KSP is not big and good enough to cost $59.99, like other AAA games. The current price is not accessible to everyone, and it is the reason why KSP has a steady 5k active players. If it was more accessible, it would have much more players.\n\nEDIT: KSP is not an AAA game to be priced $60.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-22T21:57:29Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2015 09:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RockyTV**"},{"CreatedByName":"dsonbill","CreatedById":115997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T22:26:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E KSP stands alone as an Early Access that provided many times over its value in content than originally promised.\n\nApparently you haven\u0027t played many Early Access games."},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T05:24:07Z","Content":"People who play KSP appear to have slightly different values than the bulk of \u0022mainstream playing for entertainment\u0022 videogame consumers.

And it has a educational value instead of blind violence and utter fantasy as such in other software available, great work SQUAD!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-28T05:34:48Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2015 05:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mikki**"},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T12:59:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Its definetly one of the three priceworthiest pieces of software i know in my life\n\nI have said this elsewhere, but it\u0027s one of the two best spenditures of my life in terms of return of investment.

Players somehow think that game designers are making games so they can have as many people playing them as possible. Why do you think this? Game designers design games to make money.\n\nThe price that would make KSP the most accessible would be $0. Then everyone could have it. But Squad is in this for the money - and that\u0027s fine, there\u0027s nothing wrong with it.
