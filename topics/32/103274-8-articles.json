Most of the reason the KSP forums are so great is *precisely because so few people* ***normally*** *leave spam-like posts, gratuitous large images, or other wastes of bandwidth*. Thus, the HypeTrain is both worrisome and a bit unwholesome for the Forum as a whole.

This will not only be negative for long-time KSP players, but it will also be downright painful for new players who are unaccustomed to the bugs and who want a better game. I kinda wanted this update to be a sort of 0.99 update that allowed the community to iron out bugs, but alas, it was not to be. So that takes a lot of the excitement (and adds a lot of worry) to the coming update. I really can\u0027t get hyped about 1.0.\n\u003E \n\u003E So this HypeTrain isn\u0027t for me.

The whole \u0022they should have done one more beta release\u0022 is quite old. It\u0027s clearly not happening, so why dwell on it? Also, if I\u0027m not mistaken, there was a post on Reddit noting that KSP has hit the 1 million sales mark. I find it hard to believe having a release that is a little buggy would somehow ruin KSP\u0027s long-term success. It has already been EXTREMELY successful for what is supposedly a \u0022niche\u0022 game.\n\nThat and the game software model has drastically changed. Plenty of games that were far buggier than KSP even prior to the 1.0 bug squashing-fest, have been released an been ultra-successful. \n\nBRING ON THE HYPE!
