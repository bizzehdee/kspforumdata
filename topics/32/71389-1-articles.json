If it\u0027s one of the generic ones, they either do the same thing or respawn within a few launches. I kind of feel like my immersion gets broken when this happens, and I get tired of launching the same guys over and over and over. I can change it by selecting a different crew in the VAB, but since the game always autoselects the top Kerbal(s) on the crew list whenever I\u0027m launching a rocket, I have to specifically choose a new crew every time I redo a launch. Is there a \u0022permadeath\u0022 button I\u0027m missing? If not, are there mods to create permadeath (at least for the generic Kerbals) or to randomize the crew each new launch instead of picking the same guys every single time?
