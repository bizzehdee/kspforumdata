I bought it about a year ago and messed with it for a while but soon lost interest due to too confusion about what all these bits were supposed to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut a couple of days ago I thought I\u0027d try again and updated to 0.23 and what a difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarted the Career mode and started making ships with only the parts I had which made things so much more straight forward. My ships started getting higher and higher, until one ship got into an elliptical orbit that took it outside the orbit of the moon and then nearly hit it on the return leg. I tried a burn to get back home and failed, this kerbal is now floating in space just inside the orbit of home around the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFollowing this I finally managed to get into a stable orbit and come back home safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Career mode is what this game needed with lots of little goals that make sense and I can now choose which way to proceed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy only real issue with this mode is that I was expecting to have to start with unmanned rockets like the early WW2 rocket pieces rather than your first launch actually involving sticking a person on top of it, but that would only add a single extra science skill at the start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep up the good work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Linear","CreatedById":26619,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T13:25:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat to see you\u0027re enjoying it.

Probes actually do less than a Kerbal, and judging from what is planned later (the ability to fix ship parts on the fly) Kerbals could do so much more like grab surface samples for example. It isn\u0027t that hard at all to get Kerbals into space using Tier 1 tech in the first place, and I don\u0027t see how switching out the command pod for a probe core will magically make it easier to fly (since probe cores have less torque and electricity storage compared to the capsule).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current tech tree is a placeholder and it shows, the way the tech is arranged doesn\u0027t flow with how actual technology logically advances and is so unrealistic it can break immersion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
