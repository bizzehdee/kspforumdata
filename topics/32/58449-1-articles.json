The ship shown there, the Nimbus, was a 55-ton Kethane-refining vessel using 12 hybrid ion engines (roughly equivalent to an LV-N) as its primary propulsion. The ability to refuel on the ground was the main factor in being able to land on Moho, Tylo, etc., and I had a network of refueling ships in various spots as well. For Eve it had to tack on an additional module containing Kethane-burning turbines (but it brought that module back up to orbit), but for every other body besides Kerbin it was an SSTO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the original point of this thread? Honestly, I was disappointed in Eeloo. Very little in the way of terrain, no atmosphere, weak gravity... by the time I got there that sort of landing had become very routine. The only real challenge was in matching its orbit, but even that isn\u0027t a big deal once you learn to make designs with large delta-V capacities. (My primary spaceplane has a couple ion engines on it so that it can fly straight to Laythe from Kerbin. Making a design that can get to Eeloo just isn\u0027t a challenge any more.) On the Grand Tour, going to Eeloo wasn\u0027t bad because I headed there from an easy refueling at Pol; the harder part was going from Eeloo back down the well to Gilly, which is why I stopped back in Kerbin\u0027s SOI on the way. But even if you don\u0027t have a fuel network set up it isn\u0027t hard to get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027d be nice if Eeloo gained the cryovolcanoes the developers had talked about, or at least a thin atmosphere, but that may or may not ever happen given that a lot of the talk about moving it to be a moon of a second gas giant revolved around the work of someone who\u0027s no longer employed by Squad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"celem","CreatedById":91132,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-01T11:29:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHorrible, missed the encounter with a manned mission and didn\u0027t notice quite how bad my trajectory was until it was too late to do anything about it in a vaguely fuel-efficient manner.
