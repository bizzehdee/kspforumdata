Well, I also did a \u0022simulation\u0022 of the flight there, and I managed to get to a more or less suitable orbit. Nevertheless this was the point I reverted the flight, as I realized that probably due to some rescaling of procedural parts a fuel tank was clipping into the cargo bay, locking the lander in there. I had seen this issue before, still in the VAB, but I was rather certain I clicked the save button after I had fixed it... Maybe I should make sure that it isn\u0027t an issue when I launch my real mission...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, there were some minor issues with the craft, that I will have to address. The dV budget was tighter than I anticipated, because I totally underestimated cryo-fuel boiloff. Furthermore, I didn\u0027t realize, that RCS ports need a fuel connection in Realism Overhaul, so 3/4 of them didn\u0027t fire, making it a pain to maneuver. Last, but by far not least: Solar panels... In the current configuration all of them need to be opened and all of them need to see at least some sun. That\u0027s a pain, because it means, in order to have the Kerbals survive the craft needs to be oriented correctly during the flight...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I think I\u0027ll need to work over the lander. I thought I could simply land it from a very low orbit around the Moon, but for such a big body an altitude of 15 km just seems too low, now that I\u0027ve seen how low 50 km look, so I\u0027ll aim for an orbit of 50 km instead. While this doesn\u0027t change the dV requirement drastically, the budget was tight enough already before this change of plans... My current goal is to improve both, TWR after burning about 1600 m/s of the fuel, and total dV without increasing the crafts mass. Maybe I\u0027ll really go for an Apollo style landing with a two stage lander - who knows?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T09:42:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1383.photobucket.com/user/Yukon0009/media/screenshot14490_zpscban4gqq.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah315/Yukon0009/screenshot14490_zpscban4gqq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot14490_zpscban4gqq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T09:54:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Yukon0009\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Yukon0009\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah315/Yukon0009/screenshot14490_zpscban4gqq.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah315/Yukon0009/screenshot14490_zpscban4gqq.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you just made FPS drop across the whole internet \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E It\u0027s beautiful, but I bet the real-time to orbit hurt a tad?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T12:00:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022eddiew\u0022 data-cite=\u0022eddiew\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think you just made FPS drop across the whole internet \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E It\u0027s beautiful, but I bet the real-time to orbit hurt a tad?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E905 parts, laggy much\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T13:09:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOuch!
