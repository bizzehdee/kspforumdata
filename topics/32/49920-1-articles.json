I had a fairly simple largish lander with 2 personal pods, 6 material bays, 6 thermometers and 8 goo containers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI managed it by hopping around to several nearby landing sites to get into different biomes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI 1st landed on the far northern edge of the farside crater biome. From there I jumped 3km north into a Mun midlands biome. From there it surprised me but I had only another 1.6km jump to get into a Mun highlands biome. Then I went for about a 50km jump to the Munar canyon just north east of the farside crater. I had Jeb riding shotgun on my lander doing EVA reports like mad to figure out where the Mun canyons started and was quite surprised when I set down I ended up in the Northwest Crater biome (It extends about 100km farther south than I would have guessed looking at the Mun globe). Anyways Jeb did a little investigation and found that the Mun Canyon biome was a mere 200m away so I hopped over to it and then headed home. I probably missed other nearby biomes with my scattered approach but 5 was pretty good for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe icing on the cake was that because I was so high up the mun I was able to complete a phase change and land at Kerbin\u0027s south pole picking up more samples....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spatzimaus","CreatedById":57215,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T20:36:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost of the Mun is \u0022Midlands\u0022.

Frankly, I\u0027m expecting a mod like ISA MapSat to add a graphical representation of the biomes, so that you can see where each of them is once you\u0027ve flown a probe over them once, but until then it\u0027s pretty hit-or-miss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThing is, it doesn\u0027t really help to hit multiple biomes in a row on a single mission, because your science modules can only hold one set of data.

So another way to go about it would be to have a lander capable of several sub-orbital hops and well stuffed with gadgets. By that I mean one full suite of your available scientific instruments for each biome you intend to visit, as well as a crew. As long as you don\u0027t transmit, the experiments will be stored for 100% recovery once you bring the vessel back. EVA reports and surface samples can be stored in multiples inside a single pod as long as they\u0027re from different biomes (though crew reports can\u0027t, but then they can be trasmitted at 100% value). The best idea seems to be to run as many first-time experiments as possible on the same vessel, hop it over to another biome, repeat with a separate set of instruments on the same vessel, an repeat until your instruments and command pod are all loaded to the brim with juicy science to bring back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket Farmer","CreatedById":71519,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T22:58:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Thing is, it doesn\u0027t really help to hit multiple biomes in a row on a single mission, because your science modules can only hold one set of data. \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
