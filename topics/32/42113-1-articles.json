Going by your logic, how is it not more tedious to just watch what is essentially a youtube video every time you go to orbit every single time?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was my point. Doing a launch that requires \u0027minimal interaction\u0027 is tedious. It leaves you with two things you can do: Check your gauges, or do something else. If you do something else, you\u0027ll miss your gravity turn start or MECO or something, sooner or later. The slight differences from launch to launch really don\u0027t amount to much unless you botch something up. So instead of a 10 minute-ish \u0027youtube video\u0027, you get a 10-minute-ish cutscene with occasional \u0027press a to not die\u0027 events.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet mechjeb to do it, and you actually CAN go watch videos on youtube, read wikipedia, get a cup of coffee...whatever, and come back and it\u0027s done. You don\u0027t HAVE to watch it anymore, because instead of minimal input it now requires no input. Instead of doing the same thing over and over and over, you\u0027re catching up on the news while your 107th uneventful launch in a row ascends to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me just add that it doesn\u0027t ease or invalidate test launches particularly either: Mechjeb\u0027s not any better at flying the rocket than a competant player is. In fact it\u0027s worse in some ways, with a tendency towards Pilot Induced Oscillation on marginally controllable craft. It also doesn\u0027t have any magical ability to manipulate the controls better than a human, so any problem that prevents you from being able to control it, Mechjeb isn\u0027t going to do any better with (and may do worse). In short, it\u0027s only really helpful on easy, uneventful launches anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, you can use the \u0027ascent path target on navball\u0027 option to help you fly a more precise ascent path without the autopilot, which is very handy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-12T04:01:46Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2013 04:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
