The game wasn\u0027t as popular then as it is now, it was much further from being feature complete, it was much, much buggier, and the ToS clearly laid out that Squad could stop development at any time and the current version would be the last one (which seemed much more possible then than now). So there was a chance that I would buy in and development would stop.

I don\u0027t care too much that the next update might be the last (though I would be disappointed).

But even in its imperfect and incomplete current form, it\u0027s still one of my favorite games of all time, and if development stopped today I would keep playing, likely for a long time to come.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, for me at least, it doesn\u0027t matter what the roadmap looks like or if there even is one; all the stuff Squad adds in updates only makes a great game even better.

Let\u0027s think of KSP as Sandbox-complete, Scope-complete and Complete. At the moment, and since 0.18, KSP has been Sandbox-complete. This means that all the base gameplay mechanics we want in Sandbox Mode are implemented, however they still have room for refinement and improvements to each feature. We\u0027re now in between Sandbox Completion and Scope Completion. Scope Completion is where all the main features that we want in the game are implemented, with room still left for minor additions, refinements, improvements \u003Cstrong\u003Eand bug fixes\u003C/strong\u003E. Now, that\u0027s KSP\u0027s Development on a macro scale, on a micro scale it\u0027s much more dynamic and, as we saw from the initial round of 0.24 Experimentals, incredibly dependant on the feedback, via the conduit of the Experimental Testers, from the Community. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat actually brings me to a tangential point that I\u0027d like to quickly discuss. I see a surprising number of people complaining that they\u0027ve paid to play/test the game and thus the fact that \u0027secret\u0027 teams of people that get it early due to some sort of corrupt selection process is unfair. Firstly, and this has been covered by others, you paid for the game as-is, you didn\u0027t buy the game on a promise of testing content right from the developer\u0027s keyboards (and if you had, then that would be very troublesome for pretty much everyone involved). I\u0027m sure we\u0027re all pretty well-educated on that point by now, so I\u0027ll move on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, the only two Teams that get to test KSP are the Experimental and QA Teams, respectively. They\u0027re very much public and we tell you exactly what is going on in them via the Dev Notes. The other Teams that exist that receive preview access are media-related and have their own jobs to do for that (I\u0027m not massively familiar with their day-to-day activities). As we can see, no-one really gets preview access to KSP to just play around, other than maybe the Moderators, but they tend to be far too busy \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through\u0022\u003Epepper-spraying\u003C/span\u003E taking care of the Forums. Furthermore, as Vanamonde previously pointed out, the Experimental builds can be constantly changing in terms of build stability and feature stability, so if one\u0027s goal was to simply use their preview access to play the game, they\u0027d have a hard time not reporting any issues or at least providing feedback. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, neither of the Teams are closed off, both will be open for applications post-0.24 and I\u0027ll be sure to post the application form all day, erryday.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the opinion of testing updates before releasing them to the public hopefully successfully countered, I\u0027ll get back to discussing KSP\u0027s Development.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo try and pin down KSP\u0027s development state to any particular one is a mostly pointless task, because you\u0027re left with little benefit once you\u0027ve shoehorned it into the one that satisfies your own point-of-view on the matter. We all know it\u0027s not complete, that us folks at SQUAD still have more to add, more to tweak and more to \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through\u0022\u003Ebreak\u003C/span\u003E fix, so why does a - relatively - outdated development state label matter? If you\u0027re unsure of our priorities here, we\u0027re gunning for Scope Completion, so that should give you an idea of where we want to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the answer to questions such as \u0022When are we fixing Bug \u003Cem\u003Ex\u003C/em\u003E?\u0022 or \u0022When are we adding improvements to \u003Cem\u003Efeature y\u003C/em\u003E?\u0022 are still unclear. For the former, the answer is quite a long one. When we\u0027re planning out an update, I, with the help of the Community Moderation Team, Experimental Team and QA Team, look over the Forums and the Bug Tracker and highlight pressing issues that should be fixed for the next update. These issues are collated and considered when developing the update and where the Developers have the time and resources to focus on fixing an issue, they will fix the issue. However, it\u0027s difficult to narrow down the list of issues to those that we can afford to spend the time investigating and fixing, many of the more serious bugs, in symptoms, tend to be the rarer bugs that have more elaborate reproduction steps and thus take a lot longer to perform the aforementioned actions for. So, there are simply some issues that we can\u0027t fix as we don\u0027t have the time just yet, though there are many that we do have the time to fix and we do. Conclusively, we don\u0027t have a specific aim of when to fix each and every issue, especially not before scope completion, but we do have an aim to be aware of each and every issue and fix them when and where it\u0027s possible, be sure of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the second question, the most likely case is - if the feature requires improvements - then it will be performed when we\u0027ve finished base development on the main features of the game; Scope Completion. It may happen before then, but in nearly all cases, we\u0027re all too busy adding new content to the game to simply go back and add improvements to a feature that\u0027s already playable. What\u0027s the point in ensuring you\u0027ve got two GPUs, in SLI, that are the best you can build, when your HDD is using IDE or you don\u0027t even have a HDD?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoving on to my next point, which is loosely related to the old one. Something that comes up a lot is that in the case of \u0022\u003Cem\u003Efeature y\u003C/em\u003E\u0022, it\u0027s perhaps something that here we\u0027re happy with or it\u0027s perhaps something that we have plans for in the future, but won\u0027t go ahead now. They\u0027re cases of where Community interaction provides us with a perspective of what the Community wants from the game compared to where the game is going. A significant portion of the opinions I see on the Forums, and in the wider Community, are based on an assumption that what the poster wants and what SQUAD want are the same. In some cases, this is a hasty assumption and a bad one to make. We\u0027re all very open about Community suggestions and opinions on the game, but there are limits to what we can take into account when developing KSP, there are some things we don\u0027t want KSP to be. A very good case study of this would be the whole \u0022KSP is a simulator, add \u003Cem\u003Ez\u003C/em\u003E!\u0022 discussions. We don\u0027t want KSP to be a simulator, primarily. We want KSP to have simulation elements, but also have an approachable \u0027arcadey\u0027 side to it, that allows for forgiving gameplay and fun returns on the sheer amount of time you can invest in it. So, to declare that KSP is a simulator currently, would be incorrect and means the discussion then focusses on a tangent that could be avoided.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m not saying here is that you shouldn\u0027t suggest things to add to KSP, or tweaks that should be made to certain features; they\u0027re incredibly useful and interesting to read. What I am saying is that when you create discussions about KSP, where it\u0027s heading, what should be added, what should be tweaked, etc., don\u0027t state what you feel KSP is currently as fact. You should consider that perhaps not only what you see KSP as currently is not what everyone sees it as, but what you see KSP becoming is not what the rest of the Community sees it as or even what we see it as. Again though, the point of this part isn\u0027t to stop the Community from providing feedback, but to increase awareness as to what constitutes \u003Cem\u003Eyour opinion\u003C/em\u003E and what constitutes \u003Cem\u003Efact\u003C/em\u003E in the context of the establishment of development discussion. I\u0027m hoping as a result, when having these discussions, we can see that everything in KSP\u0027s Development (and in fact, life), is not black and white. Proclaiming that the game is in alpha and therefore don\u0027t complain is a pretty bad approach to addressing someone\u0027s issue, as is saying that the game has been in development for \u003Cem\u003Ex\u003C/em\u003E amount of time and thus \u003Cem\u003Echange i\u003C/em\u003E should be in by now; they\u0027re both incredibly black-and-white approaches and a better discussion would be to try and bring about a positive outcome and even assist the poster in understanding the topic better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I\u0027ll briefly touch upon the topic of not enough being added or development being too slow. I\u0027ll just say that since February, I haven\u0027t gone a week without having a feature in QA.

Some complaints are greeted with relative public consensus - nearly everybody agrees rovers suck, and that the aerodynamics need changing. What\u0027s more important than how this public mass reacts is how the developers act, however - and they continue to add cool things to the game.
