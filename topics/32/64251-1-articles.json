If you\u0027ve constructed things badly, presumably it will explode. Would the real-life NERVA have had the same sort of heat production issues?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I understand, it works in theory by having a nuclear reactor running, passing propellant through the reactor, and using the thermal expansion of the propellant to drive the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost nuclear reactors don\u0027t particularly like rapid power excursions, so I would have assumed that any rapid throttling of the NERVA would have happened by changing the mass flow rate of the propellant through it. Slower power excursions would have been possible by adjusting control rod position in the reactor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this in mind, would throttling up a NERVA not, at least in the short term, actually cool it down, as you\u0027re effectively increasing the flow of coolant through the reactor? Or am I thinking about this all arseways?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Silverchain","CreatedById":83000,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-25T17:17:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds reasonable to me after a quick look through \u0022how the NERVA works\u0022 pages. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, how I\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/j6gKFvPjGpQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E one!\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-25T17:19:59Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2014 05:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Silverchain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-25T17:19:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs I understand it, under thrust the propellant in a nuclear rocket cools it as it passes through.
