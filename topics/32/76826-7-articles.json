The OP\u0027s objective seems not to get a finished product for the sake of having a fully-furnished game, but rather solely to be able to judge this game against others; to be able to put Squad next to the likes of EA and Firaxis and Valve, etc, and say that they\u0027re definitively better or worse. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you ask me, the fact that this is still considered an \u0022alpha\u0022 allows for \u003Cem\u003Egreater\u003C/em\u003E community access, not less. Instead of pointing out bugs in hopes that someday a patch comes out, we can point out bugs and know that there is a real possibility those bugs are going to get fixed down the road. It is the opportunity to offer real-time feedback to an invested core of developers, not a complaint that will fall on some faceless marketing/moderation crew of a big development company who has already moved onto another game. The fact that Squad has not thus far turned and said, \u0022hey, we made enough money with this, we\u0027re going to call the next update the final and then move to develop some new game for a different market,\u0022 should be enough to qualm the concerns laid forth in OP. Calling this game \u0022alpha\u0022 is not an excuse, but rather a chance to enhance understanding and to let people know that, when the right channels of communication are used, bug notifications do not go unnoticed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, IIRC there were some complaints that new versions break some mods; this is no worse than other fully-furnished games that do end up releasing patches, as many of those tend to create a need to update mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI purchased this game last August, just before 0.21 came out.
