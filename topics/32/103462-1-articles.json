The skillset for Kerbonauts is a welcome addition - I was wondering if I took 2 scientists with me on a mission would the science benefits stack? ie. would I get a 200% bonus on science from having 2 scientists onboard? Also, is it worth it to cluster lv-t30s any more or are their better engine solutions out there?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InterCity","CreatedById":98462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T19:36:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think scientists don\u0027t stack. It\u0027s just the highest one that counts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the engines, it\u0027s just a matter of preference. I personally cluster LV-T45\u0027s, skippers, or nukes (depending on the craft).
