I want to play with the new content using a controller for some piloting, but the process of setting it up and testing is very tedious, especially because you can only change the input bindings from the main menu, so there\u0027s a lot of waiting for loading while trying to test the many keybinds. On top of that, I\u0027m neither a digital\u00A0input nor aircraft expert.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I\u0027m sure there are members of the community with settings they\u0027re happy with and if anyone is interested in sharing, I will really appreciate it, and I\u0027m sure others will too! You can also just copy/paste the relevant section of the file into the post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully a bunch of people are willing to share this because everyone is likely to have very different preferences with this sort of thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, edit,\u00A0if anyone knows if there\u0027s any way to adjust things so that the game allows combo inputs (eg LB\u002BDPadDown = Landing Gear), or if there\u0027s a mod for it, I\u0027d appreciate being pointed in the right direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-07-14T04:01:22Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2021 04:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Goldenself\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
