Within the Japanese culture, which enjoys a strange and borderline schizophrenic duality of extreme politeness and prudery together with a very liberated view of sexuality as a whole, suggesting such a thing makes absolutely no sense. Much to the contrary, Bayonetta is drawn the way she is because to the average Japanese, she represents the exact \u003Cem\u003Eopposite\u003C/em\u003E of female objectification. She is designed to represent the epitome of a woman who is strong, self-realized, and free from very classical submissive female roles like geishas, schoolgirls, stereotypical housewives or adult manga moe-bombs. Believe me, if you want a female reduced to a ... object in Japan, you can get that in the nearby corner store\u0027s magazine section... and it\u0027ll look completely different from Bayonetta.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen along comes western media and goes \u0022omg a pantyshot in a videogame, clearly this is a cheap ploy to pander to sexist gamers!\u0022 Which might well be true if this game had been produced in the west, because that is a thing that exists over here.
