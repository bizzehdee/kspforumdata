This video is much shorter. I thrust from stationary, the ship pitches up about 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA and hods it there (briefly - it runs out of fuel at this point), and then when the engines cut out it returns to the set heading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour new vid says the same thing...your SAS is working fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe orbital procession in your original video explained why SAS returned your final heading (after engines were shut down) to a position that was 10-12 degrees above the horizon, which is where the test was started a minute beforehand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the 5-10 degrees when thrusting, that\u0027s because, as you originally noted, your craft is unbalanced. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the new behavior of the SAS doesn\u0027t try to fight all the way back to your locked heading in that case.

When you pitch up like that and release, SAS immediately throws the pitch into the other direction - but at that attack angle, all it does is flip the thing over. You can replicate the effect manually, but it takes some doing - and SAS treats it like a perfect \u0022reverse course\u0022 maneuver, sticking to the retrograde direction.

I just performed the most casual and controlled moon landing I\u0027ve ever done. Most landings are an exercise in switching ASAS on and off and compensating for my own overreaction. Not any more. The techniques of following the retrograde marker onto the radial point work easily with the new SAS system and allow one to concentrate on thrust and pitch without having to look at the keyboard for the T-key. I practically did this one-handed. Brilliant feature and must not be lost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it also clear that a balanced rocket that can perform a gravity turn perfectly (with SAS holding two axis still, while 90 degree heading is achieved) will become completely uncontrollable if even the smallest of fuel tanks is added to make it asymmetric. Movements on one axis will result in all manner of movements on the others. This will account for some of the complaints - especially those who specialise in building monstrosities.
