I think you are assuming most people use mods to cheat when for alot of us it is the other way around. We use mods to add difficulty and features such as deadly reentry, FAR, Remote Tech, Kethane etc. what is wrong with making career mode harder if one wants to? yes some may cheat but that is their perogative and choice to do!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love mods, I used kethane a lot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you mean by \u0022structured\u0022?

You can mod it if you want but it comes down to cheating on your own single player game, it is not balanced anymore to give you an experience on which you can compare design/maneuvering prowess with other Kerbals. I am not against it in any way if some people feel the need to do it, but for me the career mode will be about balance and the trill of learning to put something into orbit using stock parts only, then gradually teach yourself to explore the Sol system. I am still amazed at how much of a rewarding experience this game has been so far, I have just figured out how to do a gravity assist (something I should have know from my kinematics class in my bachelor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETho I should add that some mods are getting very nice in terms of keeping the game balanced while adding fun content.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-11T23:01:16Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2013 11:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by JonhyBee\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SleepyWacKo","CreatedById":72826,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-11T22:58:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Qumefox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Qumefox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAll I see are people who want to be told cheating is ok so they can feel good about themselves for avoiding challenges.

Rebuttal after rebuttal, you listen to nothing. You keep using the same core structure to your sentence where you say \u0022I\u0027m not affecting your gameplay no?\u0022. You have yet to answer in a logical way once, you dodge the questions, and keep ramming your ideas even after they were proven not to work. Your arguments are not progressing logically, instead, you just repeat yourself over and over. You are trying to impose your vision of the game to other people because /you/ want it that way and /you/ want /your/ things to be cleared out so no one cheats on /you/. I\u0027m debating with a rock, and this is going nowhere. Knowing when to take out is just as essential as knowing how to structure an argumentation, so as I see this is useless, I\u0027m out.

When in a debate like this, the goal isn\u0027t to bash your ideas in other people\u0027s face, but rather to consider all the ideas people give, and all the arguments, and try to figure out which make the most sense.
