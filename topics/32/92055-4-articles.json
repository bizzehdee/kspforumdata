The size limit is just as artificial. There\u0027s no actual walls keeping us from building bigger, just as there\u0027s no actual part shortage keeping us from adding more parts.

And after all career it\u0027s meant to have some kind of progression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s like finally implementing a part of my own suggestions from some time ago about implementing features and abilities in the tech tree and not just parts, although this now gets implemented using upgradable buildings. Now abilities like EVA, Calculating conic patches, launching heavy craft, which all require advanced technology involved, also actually require a progression in Career. Great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the restriction with part count is great IMO, i might be on a lonely spot here, but for me it makes sense, even with the immersion: The Launch-Facilities already limit your weight (and thus, also size) which makes sense. And size is not logic to be restricted through a building, since just building a bigger building solves the problem, and i see the upgrades of the buildings as getting more \u0027advanced\u0027 buildings with new technology involved. Seeing it that way the part count is the way to limit the \u0027complexity\u0027 of your crafts. More parts can be seen as a more complex ship design, which is therefor harder to construct. I see an upgraded VAB as a new VAB with more advanced construction machines inside(be it \u0027precise\u0027 ones, or big-heavy ones like for lifting a shuttle to the side of a tank), which allow the engineers to actually build my crazy complex designs, which they could\u0027t in a barn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: I find Part count as a limit makes more sense than size IMO and like it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of KXP is also a cool new addition of gameplay depth in career. But the pilot skill has yet to show it\u0027s usefulness: For me it\u0027s not clear yet, why i wouldn\u0027t want to attach a state-of-the-art probe core to my ship and spare one pilot and thus one crew member, while keeping all the abilities. Engineer sounds good. Scientist is not so much revealed yet, so to be seen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEditor extension and switching VAB-SPH: Great. Period.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMk3: Great look so far, a little Space Shuttle-ish. (Although the concept of a Space Shuttle is not so great, it was not really more efficient than normal rockets, due to rebuilding a tank and maintaining the orbiter. You have to go the SSTO Skylon way or the Space X reusability way to really gain a lot) Still to see the Cargo bays, to see what can be fitted inside. Also discouvered the OPT big Space plane parts mod (also 2.5m bay size) two weeks ago, which really looks awesome!!! To see if you might be able to senseful combine both Parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFine Print: Cool. More things to do, but that actually leads to my final thought:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks like the Science System remains the same, although a lot of biomes will be added. I found out IMO limiting the scinece gain in difficulty just makes unlocking needed tech a grind. But (normal mode) in late game you\u0027re literally swimming in Science with nothing more to spent it on. And more contracts will also bring you more Science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem is: I think i would want most of the Parts unlocked (not all but most) by exploring Kerbins SOI(Kerbin,Minmus,Mun), but after that there is still so much to gain... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I\u0027m holding the Jool-5 Challenge Science Record and got over 25k points from Jool SOI alone,enough to unlock all tech, and thats without biomes!) I want to go there and do stuff but i\u0027m missing the ingame immersion to have something gained with getting all that science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo currently i\u0027m thinking about changing my beta career difficulty to something like: Science 80-110%, penalties:1000% , Money: 10-20%. Making Money the main limiting factor and the main immersive motivation for my Space company. So i won\u0027t experience any grind, but have fun doing all cool contracts while actually gaining something out of them because i really need those money, especially if playing no reverts and needing to spent money on testflights of prototypes (especially if they fail...) I think that could overall be more fun then the current hard-mode settings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anybody has played in a similar configuration?

It used to be that you had reaction wheels (SAS) and heading hold (ASAS) as separate parts. So if you wanted to have control, you needed to add an ASAS, otherwise it was manual flying (read: spin stabilization). The ASAS was pretty heavy, 800 kg, so you\u0027d typically have it on launchers and maybe landers, but not on the ascent stage, for both dV reasons and size. ASAS functionality was added to the pods in .21 when the SAS was rewritten, so not even that long ago.
