I\u0027m lucky to get a third of my nominal 14-meg speed, my router constantly has to be rebooted cuz it \u0022forgets\u0022 what\u0027s connected to it, and I\u0027m stuck with wireless-g and \u0022not in the area eligible for upgrade.\u0022 The joys of doing business with an independent, small-town phone company. I think the hardware supports it, but the ISP does not, and they have full control of the router. I can\u0027t even access it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cantab\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cantab\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMost ISPs will provide you with a wireless router for your home. They vary, some are a bit rubbish, but they\u0027ll almost always have port forwarding options, and by default will firewall all incoming traffic.\u003Cp\u003EIf your ISP is rubbish and have only given you a pure modem - which is basically unheard of in Britain nowadays but maybe it\u0027s common in other countries - then you\u0027ll have to get your own wireless router. Check what sort you need - an ADSL router will connect directly to your phone line, while a cable router will connect to a modem by ethernet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for what router to get, well it depends what you want. I find the \u0022big name\u0022 hardware is often needlessly limited and dumbed down, but then I have knowledge and confidence in configuring stuff. I highly rate Draytek routers, but they aren\u0027t cheap or simple. Edimax and TP-Link are cheap brands yet they offer plenty of features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo give you some comparisons of the kind of stuff I mean:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a Virgin Media (Isp) \u0022Business\u0022 router will do port forwarding (eg port 80 on the web to port 80 on a certain PC) but will not do port redirection (eg port 8000 on the web to port 80 on a certain PC). It will only let you give a limited number of devices fixed IP addresses on your network. I have a Draytek router that will do port redirection, unlimited devices having fixed IP addresses, and much much more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a Netgear (big name) wireless range extender. It only works when connected to an existing wireless network, and then devices can connect to the range extender by either wireless or cables. I have an Edimax (cheap brand) wireless access point that will do all that, OR can be connected to an existing wired network and create a new wireless network where otherwise you have none.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have a router/modem, but the ISP controls it.
