Pretty much the last thing I do successfully is my proudest moment, and tonight was no exception. When I first got it a couple of months ago, I dove right in without reading any tutorials or guides, but I did do the built in tutorial when I played the demo. I slapped together a rocket and actually managed to get it into orbit after several tries. I then stuck a stayputnik satellite on it and I got the satellite in orbit on my first try, but it was a wild elliptical orbit, ~425k Ap ~95k Pe and offset about 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and going counter to the rotation of Kerbin. I couldn\u0027t deorbit the rocket because I didn\u0027t put a control module on it, so I could control it after decoupling the satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was determined to get a satellite into orbit and return the rocket leaving no junk in orbit. I read some guides on the Wiki on getting into orbit, and it turns out that was pretty much how I was already doing it. By some coincidence, the rocket I built staged perfectly with the guide to getting into orbit. I used three solid rocket boosters which burned out just above 10,000m, then I ditched the SRBs and lit the second stage liquid rocket and pitched over 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. I didn\u0027t put an SAS or reaction wheels to help stabilize the rocket so whenever I pitched over 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 it was just whatever direction I could hold it, which led to the wild orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made modifications to my rocket, I added reaction wheels and a 3rd stage and this time put a control module on the rocket stage and tried again. I got a good circular orbit going 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 East at ~75k, detached the satellite, but still couldn\u0027t deorbit the rocket. I quickly realized my mistake, I had stuck the battery on the satellite, so even though I had a control module on the rocket stage, there was no power to control it. On my 3rd try I changed some more things around. I put solar panels on the satellite and moved the battery down to the 3rd stage rocket. I got the satellite up in a good orbit, and after detaching it I still had control of the rocket. I was too excited controlling the rocket and watching it deorbit and parachute back to the surface that I forgot to extend the solar panels on the satellite. So while I was successful in getting the satellite up and deorbiting the rocket, I still called it a failure because the satellite wasn\u0027t functional. I did a 4th launch with exactly the same setup as the 3rd, but this time I extended the solar panels before detaching from the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now I had 3 satellites and 3 pieces of junk in orbit, and I wasn\u0027t happy about the junk. I wanted to do something about it, and not cheat by deleting it from the control center. I was still getting the hang of going to orbit, so I turned my next objective into getting a Kerbal in space. I used the same rocket design, but replaced the satellite with a manned module. I did two successful unmanned test runs by attaching a control module to it and not putting a Kerbal on board before I went for the real thing. My niece was interested in watching me and wanted to see me do the manned orbit, but she had to leave. Two weeks past before she came back over, and I didn\u0027t mess with it between that time. She remembered and still wanted to see the Kerbal go into orbit, so I loaded it up and went for it. I was rusty and used too much fuel. I think I could have achieved orbit, but I didn\u0027t want to take a chance and not have enough fuel to bring the Kerbal home, so I let it come back down. I tried a 2nd time and let him orbit a couple of times before bringing him back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s been several more weeks since I played, and that space junk has been nagging me. I finally decided to do something about it, and tonight I finally managed to successfully knock the first piece out of orbit. I learned how to match an orbit and intercept another object in space. I then came up with \u003Ca href=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/902134800753389937/5402286E671A84D31F0E9F95B6828948AE7221F1/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ea design\u003C/a\u003E. I put some landing struts on the tip of the ship, and the plan was to lower them (which will open them), get close to the junk and raise (close) them. I was hoping this would snag the junk and I would then be able to deorbit the rocket and parachute both back safely to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided to go for the defunct satellite first because I figured it would be easier to capture than a rocket and fuel tank. The tutorials I found for matching orbits all showed getting a lower orbit and using your faster speed to catch up to your target. The satellite I was going after was orbiting at 72-75K, so going lower wasn\u0027t going to cut it. I figured I could just go for a higher orbit and wait for the satellite to catch up to me and descend on to it. That\u0027s what I did, but it still took me three tries before succeeding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first time I simply didn\u0027t have enough fuel, so I added extra fuel to both liquid rocket stages. The second time was just inefficient use of fuel and several mistakes in matching orbits and intercepting. The third time I almost aborted again due to low fuel. I made a couple of mistakes and had to burn extra fuel to correct for it, but I thought I\u0027d still be able to do it. I was 5 minutes from making my last burn to intercept the satellite when I had to quit and go run some errands. I came back a few hours later and when I loaded the game, the landing struts had disappeared from my rocket. I was using the auto save instead of the quick save, but I don\u0027t know if that would have made a difference. I decided to keep going since I was so close, but I would have to push it instead of trying to grab it. Now that I think about it, those landing struts probably would have broken anyway when it grabbed the satellite, and then I would have had extra junk to clean up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made the final burn to match the satellite\u0027s orbit. When I cut the fuel, I was 1200m away from the satellite, and with so little fuel left that at first I wasn\u0027t sure if I cut the fuel or ran out. The fuel meter looked empty, but the numbers showed I had a little over a tenth units of fuel. I used the RCS to maneuver up to the satellite and swing around so that my engines would be pushing toward the satellites retrograde. I slowly inched forward until I was touching the satellite, then I hit the throttle, and the engines only fired for half a second and I thought it was a failed mission. Then I switched to the map view and saw both the satellite and the rocket\u0027s Pe were going to be just under 69k, which should be enough for them slow down in the atmosphere. It was a tense last few minutes for me because I couldn\u0027t remember if it was 68k or 69k when the atmosphere actually began. I knew I could at least use the rocket\u0027s RCS deorbit it so there wouldn\u0027t be more junk in orbit. Luckily they hit 68k and began slowing down. The satellite splashed down in the middle of the ocean almost as if I planned it, and the rocket\u0027s parachutes opened and it safely landed a few km away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to jump up and high five a bunch of people like you see them do in footage of NASA control rooms, but there was no one around to share my triumph.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Silverchain","CreatedById":83000,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T08:46:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EManual crewed Tylo landing and return, stock, no quickloads.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T09:53:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think my proudest moment was when I ran out of fuel on the way back from Minmus and left the ship on highly elliptical orbit around Kerbin.

It took a long time and lots of practice, but now I have it. I went through a series of missions replicating NASA\u0027s Gemini missions, using a replica Titan launch craft. Several of those in order to practice docking maneuvers without MechJeb. And all the while learning about orbital maneuvers, the Nav-Ball, and what is possible when you put your mind to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt all culminated in a huge project. This TRIDENT space station. Its got 4 orange tanks full, tons of RCS, lots of living space, and a full backstory. I\u0027m absolutely in love with it. Sure, I\u0027ve continued on and done more and more, like putting a station around Jool, flying a plane on Laythe, constructing a huge base on the Mun.

I built them using the 4x4 flat plate, but it was creating huge lag for everything. So I edited a stock adapter plate to be 4x as large as stock and turned them into satellite / radio dishes.
