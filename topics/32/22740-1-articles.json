It is literally possible to blow off some of the smaller surface-mount components with, say, compressed air. Especially 603 and smaller scale surface-mount components; Some of these components are no bigger than a smudge of dirt, so it\u0027s impossible to tell by visual inspection if you\u0027ve damaged something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E Opening the case can actually make things worse. Assuming you have decent air flow (ie: no cable bundles or whatnot in the way), your PC gets maximum cooling with the case closed, even minus the side fan. Most of your airflow will be coming from your power supply, and any supplemental fans you have along the front of your case. The air should be sucked in somewhere around the front, blown up through the CPU area, and exhausted out of your PSU and/or rear fan. Your side-mounted fan provides additional air capacity for the CPU cooler. Opening your case disrupts this air flow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree with Endless, 73 Celsius sounds awfully low for a system shutdown assuming a fairly modern CPU. My laptop is running 68 to 72ish right now, in fact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy older Athlon processors run around 50-60, and they don\u0027t like going above 70 or so.
