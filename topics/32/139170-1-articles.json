In a sort of mental debrief i am wondering what i could have done better.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe setup wasn\u0027t bad, it\u0027s just that KSP can\u0027t handle its own mechanics...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me start at the beginning. Mission was Duna \u002B Ike, with a Rover that drives to as many biomes as were timely manageable. The rocket consists of 2 parts, a nuclear driven Traveler-Strage with about 5k dV and a lander with 3 Kerbal and a Rover.\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) It was a MESS to build a vehicle that can be unloaded and loaded back up with all science on board including the possibility to store experiments. I know that some players build monster trucks that are huge as a house but i have a problem with that.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI just hate inefficiency! So much that i regularly quit KSP and have to let off steam elsewhere... great. So i built a really small vehicle with the help of TweakScale. I was small enough to fit/drive inside a 2.5m service bay.ofc driving in and out\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas easy on Kerbin, on the other planets the wheels suddenly could no longer manage to drive in. The service bay was my \u0022landing gear\u0022 so it was on the floor. And ofc the wheels popped inside the bay everytime the ship moved even tho the rover was secured with\u003Cbr\u003E\na docking port.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBuilding vehicles to reach as many biomes as possible is one of the BASIC and FUNDAMENTAL things in the game BECAUSE of how the career mode is made. But there are almost NO PARTS to help out. Yes there are wheels... but HOW THE HELL do you transport those vehicles ?\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere are cargo bays... sure, and how do you land something with a cargo bay in a way that you can reload the rover ? Ahhh... the huge plane with ramp. Seriously, that is the ONLY option ?! Like no one would ever want to build a rover and drive around on planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut hey, with enough cheating and mods somehow i got the rover thing done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Reentry. It\u0027s a good thing that reentry finally is more deadly, but mainly its deadly because there are no parts to build proper rockets that can survive it. I know there are heatshields, but how do you build a ship that has a somewhat aerodynamic nose, and engine pointing in the\u003Cbr\u003E\noposite direction AND a heatshield that points in the same direction as the engine ?! Good thing for me that a service bay is almost better than a heatshield but still i have to mount so many parts radially and they will pop.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI mean how do i protect landing gears that i HAVE to attach radially because the only thing with a bay is the plane gear stuff. I can\u0027t wrap everything in a fairing that i rebuild every time. There is this awesome inflateable heatshield, but it is MAX SIZE and heavy AND does not allow\u003Cbr\u003E\nand engine other than radials. And radial engines SUCK (efficiency). I only need ONE nerva so radial placement is off the table anyway unless there would be smaller nerva so that i could split up 1 into 3 or 4.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYes i could do all that with TweakScale BUT when i tweak a part i can no longer see its stats as i could in the part description. Makes planing harder. Plus i have the feeling that the 4x weight scaling is a little bit cheat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo how do i design a PROPER rocket that has to do multiple aerobrakes ? I spent AN HOUR until my ship finally slowed down enough through duna that i could orbit without blowing up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy was that an issue ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) So to plan a mission i have to look at community budget maps. Why ? because the game itself provides NADA. You can\u0027t even plot a course at a future time to see how many steps and dV would be required. The game simply provides NOTHING but its silly course plotter.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHow much dV can i aero off at duna with my design ? NO WAY of finding out other that cheat/beaming the ship to duna and trying it out. Oh yeah, thats practical.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHow lost would i be without Alexmoon\u0027s charting tool... how will the planets be aligned in 300 days from now ? Stock game CAN\u0027T give you the answer. You need mods mods mods. And this isn\u0027t something special, this is the VERY BASIC in a game that deals with rockets and space travel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) have you ever looked closely at the weight of the stock components ? Some are so rediculous. The smallest wheels weigh 50 kg, same as the bigger ones... WHY ? Both extendable ladders weigh 5 kg but one is twice as long ?!\u003Cbr\u003E\nBatteries however. An average car battery weighs a good 10 kg and in KSP the smallest disc-battery weighs the same. What a bargain! All the parts... it\u0027s like 5 years ago someone quickly scribbled some numbers together, late for dinner or whatnot and BAM they made it into release and have never\u003Cbr\u003E\nbeen touched again, EVER.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) Cockpits. Now with the system of 3 professions it is somewhat obvious that a lot of players will want to bring 3 kerbals with them however there are only TWO cockpits that allow 3 or more and they are utterly bad.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe one is a plane cockpit and the other one weighs... That would all be no problem IF there were nicely stackable 1-kerb-cockpits. But the Mk1 can not be stacked properly and the lander can has horrible aerodynamics.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt would take a developer TEN MINUTES to overhaul those numbers, but no one does it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo i am playing this game since... dont remember... and still so many vital parts are missing. Instead we get a career mode that feels like occupational therapy for ADS. Unity 4 to 5 and imho it still looks the same and i have everything maxed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEvery year we get like 3 new parts, YAY. Most of the time they are not balanced, Duh.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHow do you deal with it ? Install 20 mods and once more unto the breach ? I just can\u0027t build those cartoon rockets with parts sticking out left and right, i really hate that. So how do you all deal with it ?\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd please don\u0027t answer by suggesting even more mods, my limit for a year is reached.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI REALLY like this whole space stuff but KSP just gives me more and more headaches with each patch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-06T22:21:58Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2016 10:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by NikkyD\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rabada","CreatedById":66044,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-06T22:33:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding your question about heatshields and engines:\u00A0Look up how NASA designed the skyscane to land the Mars Rover Curiosity.

Your rover can then fly on and out of the bay if needed. Leave it on Duna, no need to reload it. Don\u0027t bother stowing experiments again, take the data and leave them. Use interstage\u00A0fairings to shield unwieldy lander bits until you actually land.

Not quite in a box but all folded up in a nice neat package on the the side of the LEM. Pull a lanyard, package folds down, wheels pop out and off you go.

For the most part you have the parts you need and the\u00A0\u00A0trajectory planning tool is wonderful - in\u00A0fact I would strongly argue that the map screen and the way it gives you a very visual feel for something that\u0027s inherently very complex,\u00A0is KSP\u0027s stand-out feature. That XKCD cartoon with the \u0027learning about orbital mechanics\u0027 hockey stick graph? That\u0027s the map screen right there. Most importantly of all, iteration and learning by failing is quick and relatively painless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGo beyond Kerbin space and it\u0027s clear that the spaceflight part of the game really hasn\u0027t advanced very much since the planets were first introduced. Worse, the\u00A0tools and \u0027learning by failing\u0027 philosophy that work really well for shorter missions really don\u0027t scale gracefully to the added complexity and timescales of interplanetary flight. It\u0027s obviously perfectly possible but without mods it\u0027s nowhere near the compelling experience that the cis-Munar game is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stock game isn\u0027t great for actually building and doing stuff in space or on the planets either. Again - it\u0027s possible but it\u0027s very rough and ready. Yes, there are mods, but some improvements in the stock game would go a long way too. Plus - and it\u0027s a personal thing, I get a bit tired of the \u0027mods will do everything\u0027 attitude. Some folks are happy with a framework game that they can flesh out with mods - that\u0027s fine and I respect it. I\u00A0prefer something a bit more substantial\u00A0which can then be improved or tweaked a bit further with mods\u00A0rather than relying on them to\u00A0build my whole game for me.

On my side of the fence, I\u0027m well aware that it\u0027s easier to criticize than create. I\u0027m also one voice amongst hundreds when it comes to ideas and opinions on the game. With all that said, I still think OP has a valid point.
