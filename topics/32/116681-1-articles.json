Having justified my edit, I loaded the stranded guys on Duna into the rescue ship. Lift off, orbit, transfer, all went according to plan. As I was preparing to lower the Pe into the atmosphere, I realized I forgot to install a heatshield. sigh. Rookie mistake and I\u0027ve been playing for a year. d\u0027oh. Having experienced the wrath of the reentry heat in previous attempts with 1.04, I was not optimistic. I\u0027ve read on the forum that many claimed to not need a heatshield. I wasn\u0027t sure I believed you. Decided to go for it. I had enough Dv to circularize at 55k. From there I watched as the orbit slowly decayed. The heat gauges never popped up even once. I for one am amazed. Interestingly, the expression on the guys faces during reentry was one of concern.
