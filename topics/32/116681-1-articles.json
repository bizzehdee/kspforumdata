I figure it is not cheating since 1. It wasn\u0027t my fault. 2. In real life the guys would have used duct tape and whatever they could find to put it back together. Having justified my edit, I loaded the stranded guys on Duna into the rescue ship. Lift off, orbit, transfer, all went according to plan. As I was preparing to lower the Pe into the atmosphere, I realized I forgot to install a heatshield. sigh. Rookie mistake and I\u0027ve been playing for a year. d\u0027oh. Having experienced the wrath of the reentry heat in previous attempts with 1.04, I was not optimistic. I\u0027ve read on the forum that many claimed to not need a heatshield. I wasn\u0027t sure I believed you. Decided to go for it. I had enough Dv to circularize at 55k. From there I watched as the orbit slowly decayed. The heat gauges never popped up even once. I for one am amazed. Interestingly, the expression on the guys faces during reentry was one of concern. When it became apparent they might actually make it, I swear they all started grinning."},{"CreatedByName":"jaredkzr","CreatedById":73023,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T19:46:45Z","Content":"The only time I\u0027ve needed a heatshield is when I\u0027ve aerobraked into Jool or Eve\u0027s atmosphere.

Retracted solar panels overheated on one attempt but a reattempt resulted in everything staying attached and a successful landing.\n\nNo heat shields, just six Rhinos. Nothing even showed bars - the solar panels that exploded on the one attempt glowed red then exploded spontaneously, presumably they were acting as heatsinks, not generating heat themselves from drag.\n\nI\u0027ve also entered Kerbin atmosphere going 3km/s\u002B using a spaceplane and braked using just drag on the dorsal side of the craft (i.e. I went in belly-first), again nothing showed bars (except some static solar panels mounted on the top of the fuselage, once - they survived fine, I just didn\u0027t pull my nose up soon enough so they showed bars). Monoprop tanks and all other stuff under my wings were fine.\n\nBasically it seems to me that unless you\u0027re doing a reentry that would burn up much of the ablator on a heat shield, you likely don\u0027t truly need one.

That was the biggest problem with 1.0.2, you could re-enter radially into kerbin and be fine. In 1.0.4, no more.\n\nBut shallow Kerbin re-entry are quite forgiving as long as you\u0027ve slowed down enough by the time you get to 10,000m.
