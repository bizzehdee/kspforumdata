While at first glance the difficulty curve demanded by the mod tools - Unity, plus whatever graphics/modeling you chose to use - may make the attempt seem not worth the trouble, these tools are not that difficult or demanding; they require a basic level of knowledge, yes, but nothing like a college degree. Anyone who wants to will be able to learn how to use these tools. For Unity, there are several tutorials on the forums about setting up and exporting a part, and the vast majority of parts will all follow the same procedure and part setup. If you can get the tutorial fuel tank exported into KSP, you have the knowledge to export almost anything. For Blender, while it forces the user to remember keyboard shortcuts, there are many many tutorials, both on the forum and online in general, for people whos skill level is anywhere from absolute beginner to more advanced, that will be able to walk a user through the process of creating a model. To learn to use these tools will take a little time, yes, but its worth the trouble in the long run. KSP would not be the game it is today without people like you and me setting to to create mods that add a vast amount of extra options and functionality to an already awesome game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-14T23:14:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222322833\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022127855\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221450133684\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002296332\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pecan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 minutes ago, Pecan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNever mind - I see this is a duplicate thread and the original has more/better answers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor everyone\u0027s reference, thread is here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/127856-modding-ksp-making-3d-game-modelsis-it-worth-the-trouble/\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/127856-modding-ksp-making-3d-game-modelsis-it-worth-the-trouble/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"roosterr","CreatedById":61317,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-15T10:59:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the 21st century, you can achieve\u00A0excellence\u00A0without a college degree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-15T14:27:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLocking this duplicate, please carry on in the original thread in the proper subforum:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/127856-modding-ksp-making-3d-game-modelsis-it-worth-the-trouble/\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/127856-modding-ksp-making-3d-game-modelsis-it-worth-the-trouble/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
