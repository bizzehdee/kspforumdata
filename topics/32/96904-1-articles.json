Popped some reminders into Kerbal Alarm Clock, returned to the space centre to accept another contract or three, and noticed the full text of the exploration contracts. Turns out surface science is a thing too. As a result, I have now got two really expensive probes sat in LKO \u003Cem\u003Ewhich can\u0027t do half the job they were built for\u003C/em\u003E. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-17T19:21:57Z\u0022 title=\u002201/17/2015 07:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SufficientAnonymity\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SubzeroSpartan7","CreatedById":100972,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T19:48:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had an ion powered manned exploration craft that was attempting to land on every biome on Minmus. Unfortunately while landing at my second destination the stock auto-pilot freaked out just before landing and pointed my craft directly towards the ground breaking all but one solar panel. Luckily since it was Minmus I was able to right myself back onto my landing legs, but with one solar panel my exploration days were over. Me being the genius that I am didn\u0027t put any batteries on the craft. I was able to limp back into an elliptical orbit at 1/4 thrust. The craft had a docking port on it because at the end of the mission it was going to dock with my Minmus station after exploration and the pilot Jerfrid Kerman (an avid explorer) was going to take a CTV back home. Luckily I always have a nuclear tug lying around in Minmus orbit to dock modules onto the station or for situations like this. However things got much worse. The nuclear tug was approaching the craft and at 500 meters away and at 30 KM above the surface of Minmus a violent explosion rocked the lander. Every single piece of the lander except for the lander can (which was now magically on a suborbital trajectory) were launched at 20,000 m/s into interplanetary space. I guess the game hated me that day. So now the lander can doesn\u0027t have a docking port and is free falling towards the ground so I get Jerfrid out and using the nuclear tug push him into an orbit where he can rendezvous with the station. Unfortunately the station is full of kerbals and so is my Minmus base so the commander of the mission, Chadski Kerman, decided to give his life to save Jerfrid. He attempted to land at the Minmus base with his EVA pack so they could at least recover his body. Unfortunately he ran out of fuel just short of landing and hit the ground at 50 m/s. Than Jeb and Bill put up a flag near the base in remembrance of Chadski. Jerfrid is still waiting his flight home and will re-attempt the mission in a redesigned lander.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ShadowZone","CreatedById":112420,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T22:44:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI recently put two big interplanetary cruisers in orbit, both waiting for their transfer windows.
