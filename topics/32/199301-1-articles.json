Thankfully, Procedural Fairings provides an engine plate to do just that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m building a manned ship to Duna that needs 5 propulsion modules. Now, these modules are big and heavy modules, around 30-40 tons each. And so, a large rocket is needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember when I mentioned the Procedural Fairings engine plate? How they work is they have a single structural node in the center, and the engines are placed on nodes in a ring on the outside. I needed to place way too many engines in a space too small for their engine bells to not collide. I also wanted the structural node so I can attach an interstage. So, I had to put a second plate, leading to this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022unknown.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002270.33\u0022 height=\u0022813\u0022 width=\u00221156\u0022 src=\u0022https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/454043306800840714/795145850959560724/unknown.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMmm yes nesting engine\u00A0plates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-04T04:07:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLast night in a mad quest to find an alternative to break-happy rover wheels, I accidentally invented a dancing robot.\u00A0 Instead of walking about, it just sort of does a merry jig with its 4 legs and generally spins around looking like it\u0027s having a great time.\u00A0 It\u0027s hilarious, but hardly useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
