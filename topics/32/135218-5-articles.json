Sure, I can challenge my self during sandbox play, but it\u0027s never anything but a side effect of me doing whatever the hell I feel like doing, and that particular thing just happening to be hard to perform. But once I beat a challenge, I never go \u0022Wooo! I made it!\u0022, instead I just go \u0022Wow, that was fun in the end.\u00A0Too bad it was so much work\u0022 and then I move on.

This leads me to save scum a lot, since I want the \u0022story\u0022 I\u0027m writing in my head to move in a particular direction, and the less artificial challenges and restrictions, the less I have to re-load my games. A funny side effect of this is that roughly half the time I\u0027ll reload because I felt something went to smoothly. I wanted that M\u00FCn mission to be a bust, but somehow I managed to stick the landing in the very last moment, so now I have to reload and tell the story the \u0022right way\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, structure and artificial limitations makes it harder for me to enjoy my games, and instead turns the game into something I enjoy about as much as I enjoy my actual job.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find this interesting. \u00A0It all seemed\u00A0very familiar, except for the differing conclusion regarding career vs sandbox.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it might be that lately I\u0027ve just used career mode to generate rescuees, show a tech progression, and track a score in terms of kerbal XP and milestones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t had a\u00A0need to explicitly force accidents to make things \u0027interesting\u0027 for the kerbals, since I\u0027ve just been flying wild frontier space cowboy designs and eschewing probe cores (AIs are not allowed to be wired to something with reaction drives (anti-skynet pilot\u0027s union rule), and other than the Fantastic Four all crew are rescued from space). \u00A0Current lander tips over every time, except on minmus flats, but I haven\u0027t bothered to redesign it. \u00A0All mun landings are instead simply flown by engineers who can KAS it around into its own unique rescue ship, and Minmus is small enough to stand the ship back up as needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpace\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003E\u00A0cowboy\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003E\u00A0management\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u002B TAC \u002B KAS keeps things lively enough for me (Only 5 dead kerbals despite at least 15 \u0027incidents\u0027), and even on hard, funding isn\u0027t an issue; rescues and milestones and stage recovery fund the whole program.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Optimist","CreatedById":151904,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-02T01:30:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy favorite Kerbal is the RC-L01.

It\u0027s entirely outside the current scope of game (and I\u0027ve gotten so much value for dollar out of KSP I\u0027d happily pay for an add-on), but I\u0027d love to see AI added---both as kerbals who can do stuff autonomously (even just as eye-candy to have them work on stations, or do EVAs just to add \u0022life\u0022), and possible AI agencies (i.e.: the ability to do a \u0022space race\u0022 kind of mode).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may want to tinker with the custom settings for Science and Career modes more. You can actually start off with all the science you need to unlock everything, and make your space program entirely about funds. \u00A0I enjoy running a space program run by deficit spending, where the nation\u0027s budget is spent on the space program like the US\u0027s budget is spent on its military\u0027s. \u00A0True, I could do that by just playing Science mode, but with this\u00A0I still leave a bit of a chance that with enough \u0027oopsies\u0027 and \u0027uh-ohs,\u0027 I could face some serious challenges and have to trim a few things from a rocket just to try to get a decent payday in order to continue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also allows me the opportunities to perform some missions independent from contracts that I would like to perform. \u00A0Such as the other day I suddenly got the burning desire to tinker with the Juno jet engine and see what it could do. \u00A0While I did use it to achieve a couple of test contracts, I decided to build a craft with Junos and took it on an intercontinental flight. There wasn\u0027t even any science reward to be had because of previous landings in the destination area, but it was still an enjoyable experience. \u00A0Part of my point here is I don\u0027t see Career Mode being all that binding or singular in nature. \u00A0It comes with a lot of flexibility to make it more to your style, and there really is no one way to act upon it. \u00A0And it really has gotten a lot of love from Squad from its inception, as when it was originally introduced it really was a lemon. \u00A0But the improvements and additions to it really flesh it out to be a fun mode of play. \u00A0Although, I will still hop over to a Sandbox save I have and tinker a bit there now and then. \u00A0Sometimes you just want to stretch yourself and try some really wacky ideas. \u00A0I will confess to being quite the fan of Danny2462.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, as to the latter bit of your post, Squad has stated there is zero plan for NPC space agencies, and so far that is likely to remain so. But there was also zero plan for aeroflight once upon a time, and that got changed. It really is a matter of what the game and engine is capable of doing, and that is getting a big upgrade here shortly. \u00A0While I am not all for NPC space agencies(but I am also not totally against them), I am rather for building self-sustaining bases on the Mun and maybe Duna to launch missions from, at least late in the career game(or, of course, at your leisure with sandbox). \u00A0I would quite enjoy the opportunity to launch a mission from the Mun and use\u00A0Kerbin\u0027s gravity well to kick it off towards another planet, as opposed to having to always\u00A0fight with Kerbin\u0027s gravity well in order to get anywhere. \u00A0I know there are mods for that(Duna Space Program I believe is the name of one), but with mining now being a stock feature, I feel there is more to look forward to with the stock game. And setting up other launch complexes seems to be a very possible next step.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-04T08:16:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve still never got more than a few nodes into the science tree before I\u0027ve got bored \u0026amp; gone back to planning epic missions in sandbox - it\u0027s never appealed to me once since it arrived, although I guess I\u0027d already run several sandbox games by the time it turned up \u0026amp; thought \u0022what is this strange pointless restriction on my time\u0022.

Getting stuff to orbit is really cheap with my standard SSTO designs, but I\u0027m often spending more funds on SSTO rockets because they are faster. I\u0027ll agree somewhat with regex here about stock cartoon sizes... its far too easy to get into orbit.... the tonnage of stuff I can throw into orbit via SSTO is rather ridiculous. I find the stock ISRU has taken a lot of the challenge out too... or maybe it has taken the tedium out of sending refueling missions... before I had ISRU, I was using turboramjets to ssto fuel tankers to orbit to resupply my Mun fuel depot (only did that mission twice, thankfully)... but the end result is that I\u0027ve now got about 500 tons of stuff in Duna orbit...

I had to hire more crew and do a training mission, just because all my crew were occupied. I train all crew to lvl 3 (mun, minmus flags, short jaunt outside of kerbin\u0027s SOI)... 3 went to Moho and are returning (\u002B1 from a rescue mission from moho orbit.

I probably won\u0027t return those crew in this save/ that is their last mission. The crew hiring and training is now the most tedious part for me... Doing the same mun-minmus-solar orbit mission over and over to have a competent crew to send on interplanetary missions is tedious. I need more rescue contracts - picking someone up from moho orbit is a free lvl 3 kerbal. Picking someone up from Gilly orbit (they can eva down to plant a flag very easily)... means 15XP for gilly, 7.5 for eve orbit, 6 for solar orbit, 2 for kerbin orbit... one trip to Mun and they are lvl 4... still it takes years for them to get back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still do a fair amount of playing around in snadbox too, especially with HyperEdit... and other mods\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuna with oceans and an oxygen rich somewhat thicker atmosphere? yes please!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fsyQmzD.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fsyQmzD.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222ISQFQz.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2ISQFQz.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 way\u00A0 to tekto? why not?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022GTJGjpm.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GTJGjpm.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTesting a cargoplane that can load/unload rovers, making a \u0022ssto module\u0022 rover\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00227SgYoFs.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7SgYoFs.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022C5u6uKz.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/C5u6uKz.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(*Laythe only SSTO.. can\u0027t do it on kerbin, forgot to upload pics of it making orbit on laythe, but it did)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCareer mode doesn\u0027t direct one to do any of that...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mrclucks","CreatedById":139561,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-04T14:32:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have been playing for about a year now but I am still learning some of the intermediate and alot of the advance tips and tricks. \u00A0Sandbox is typically where I will test out my new knowledge and skills and is also where I\u0027ll build up something or another. \u00A0If I install remote tech, then I\u0027ll build up the kerbin system and then go interplanetary before sending all my kerbals to remote locations. \u00A0Sometimes I just start making mini bases and adjusting with ore refineries, or space planes. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there is career. \u00A0I usually start with Max science, minimize fundsrisk and double funds rewards.
