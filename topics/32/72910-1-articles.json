Kids are spoken down to eight hours a day, five days a week to earn the autonomy and respect we grant adults. Whatever our educational goals, that social dynamic is unhealthy: engineering can be a respite. To get that respite, treat them like you would engineers because being taken seriously after more than a decade of being laughed off is such a relief that they, ironically, will be thrilled. Keep the emotions kid-scaled and validated, and they will feel motivated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, goals. Not everyone is necessarily an engineer. Some people lead well, others make pretty art, and others still can lead. Provide diverse, relevant roles, let student choose one, and allow students to affect the structure of the class. For example, if you want to do a natural disasters unit, then you could create a Kerbinar Guard, whose four teams of four engineers each must find and deflect a deadly asteroid from Kerbin while fourteen leaders, writers, and artists organize the teams and manage their scarce political and financial resources, report on events, and make informative and motivational art.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, be sincere. Begin the lesson in character and costume and never let them see you break it--not even after school--because the planet is in terrible danger and we can\u0027t dawdle around. Have a boombox play dramatic music. Offer advice and guidance only when needed. Keep the game world simple and dynamic with fake news reports and speeches. And most importantly, whenever you wonder if you are going overboard, go further because the kids will eventually just to with it and, with every year, the unit will approach legend: proud will be they who steer mighty craft through the stars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn example opening speech, given in a suit after a brief silence,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Welcome to the Kerbinar Guard: you\u0027re here because you\u0027re the best.

Four asteroids will destroy us in a year, and we need you to knock them off course. We have hidden this information lest panic should doom society, and we have built you an integrated design, flight, and command center wherefrom you can run this black project. Or, you can use this agency\u0027s broad emergency powers to publicize the impeding asteroids to seek more funding than we can pilfer from the budget, create black sites elsewhere, or do almost anything else.
