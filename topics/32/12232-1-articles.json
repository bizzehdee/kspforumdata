After post-production was done, Trumbull came to Kubrick and showed him the finished product that he had done practically himself. Stanley either was just full of disbelief(which, knowing the big SK, I don\\\u0027t believe that), or he just really wanted to use Jupiter instead.

It was more a collaboration between Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C Clarke in its entirety. Preproduction was started when there was more just an outline to the book, and Clarke holed himself up to finish the book so they could do up the screenplay in time for main production. It was a weird experiment on producing movie and book simultaneously that actually worked. I have my doubts it will ever be pulled off again, but there have been times when it almost did. I think Jurassic Park: The Lost World had just hit the printers when the movie began production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is probably the next best example when you consider Michael Crichton had to bring Ian Malcolm and John Hammond back to life for the book.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@sirguinea: Yes, I did, smeghead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
