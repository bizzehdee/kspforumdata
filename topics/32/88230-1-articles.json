The craft connects and the fuel transfers well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem comes when detaching the KLAW and disarming the mechanism. Then my plane is permanently stuck in mid air unable to move. As you can see in the pictures below, the landing gears are retracted and the plane is floating in a fixed position.

For a ship that\u0027s stationary relative to the planet it is on, it\u0027s on rails orbit is of course stationary relative to the planet. This works fine with moving asteroids about in space, and can possibly be fixed for ships in space by briefly switching to some other ship outside physics range. But it does not work for ships in atmosphere, as you cannot switch away from them, so they remain in flight on rails for ever. Or until you kill the game, but that has good potential to corrupt the save.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stratzenblitz75","CreatedById":108287,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T20:50:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat right there, might be what I call \u0022the floating probe core\u0022 bug.
