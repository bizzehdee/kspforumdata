Yeah, I like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever due to my recent decision to stop using half-cheats, like being able to orient ships with reaction wheels, I\u0027ve got an issue with the RCS fuel for this thing. I only need a small amount, not a whole heaping lot. So one side mounted RCS tanks should suffice. This allows me to cut down the weight for my lander (and rocket overall) along with some nice T:R. The issue is being where and HOW to place this single, radially mounted RCS tank.

Size increases trigger more size increases (the support structure needs to be stronger, you need bigger tanks and batteries and so on) so doubling the payload usually results in a disproportional increase in launch weight. Plus... unless you want the top of the lander to be open (and I\u0027m under the impression you don\u0027t) and unless you don\u0027t want a bottom either... double the diameter and you need four times as much material for those. And because they need to handle stresses over a longer distance (twice as wide) they\u0027ll have to be thicker too. All in all, the increase from .6 to 2.5 seems perfectly reasonable to me. It\u0027s the price you pay for going bigger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs magnemoe shows, once you go the other direction it\u0027s amazing how much lighter you can get once you start shedding weight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheIncredibleDalek","CreatedById":73129,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T02:36:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, don\u0027t forget landing legs.
