When I started at version 18 there was much more talk about technical things including better aerodynamic model, re-enty effects and technical resources (living supply and mineable resources on planets). Squad even did re-entry animation to some version but never finished physics. As always, projects change during time. Workers change or get interested in new ideas, community wants to certain things, economic issues may change (to good or bad direction) etc. Squad decided to concentrate developing the KSC and terrestrial economy and career management instead of space and physics things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI disagree that FAR would kill the game. Probably many players who likes planes have played different flight simulators before KSP and expect similar realistic like aerodynamic behavior. Every serious flight simulator have flight model much more like FAR than very strange KSP\u0027s stock aerodynamic, even their \u0022simplified model\u0022 -options. Actually I remember than when I played very simple fighter games in Commodore 64 (about year 1989) they had more realistic aerodynamics than KSP. Of course they did not handle supersonic effects and many other things but at least it was possible to stall. Maybe it would be a good idea to put some of the FAR\u0027s parameters behind an \u0022Advanced (no not touch if you do not know what you are doing)\u0022 -button or in configuration file, but it works very well with default settings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yakuzi","CreatedById":85181,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T11:12:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CptRichardson\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CptRichardson\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EActually, I am pretty sure that we\u0027re going to get some form of Kolonization in .26, given that part of the building destruction mechanic is rebuilding buildings and that the .26 massive new feature with insane amounts of art development is said to build off of the base of .25.

What i mean is it\u0027s an animation for each building played when the system desides to change the state of the building to \u0027destroyed\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT they have splitted up the \u0027clickable buildings\u0027 into more seperate buildings. What i mean is that the water tower and the launch pad are different buildings physically, and each commdish or the different sections of the runway. Splitting the models into new functional groups and setting the borders for them was something that has been done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i don\u0027t see any groundwork to make lets say the VAB upgradable or buildable at the beginning, although they could use the splitted models to lets say add the water tower to the launch pad, but i don\u0027t see what gameplay value that could have, maybe you\u0027ve ideas for that but i don\u0027t think it is upgradable buildings at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat has also been done is something like a \u0027health state\u0027 for the buldings, to detect when it has got so much damage that it\u0027ll blow up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd a detection system to detect when a non-craft-object got hit by something. until now only crafts are affected by any collision. With 0.25 also the KSC buildings achieve the ability to detect a collision on themselves and react to it (with exploding).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd a system had to be implemented to modify the current state objects in the game (assuming a destructed building will have a different collision mesh than an intact one) and this model replaces the place of the intact model while this building has the state of destroyed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(But that could\u0027ve been already there, i don\u0027t know, maybe mods like KerbinSite using that already)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd we have to think of a purpose for the 0.26 feature, because upgrading buildings to unlock parts doesn\u0027t make any sense. We have a unlocking system for the parts already: called TechTree. Destroying buildings is fun cause of explosions and has an effect on your budget. Upgrading wouldn\u0027t be fun to watch, would cost money and i can\u0027t think of anythink getting unlocked through that. Maybe the planets but that would counteract the freedom to go where you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAND they needed to apply animations on non-craft-objects in the first place. Every non craft thing is just static right now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you can build a new launchpad or runway anywhere on Kerbin, but (apart from making the game harder or change the view) there isn\u0027t any purpose in that either since the equator is already the best launch position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd Craters are a much too easy feature to be the BIG 0.26 Groundwork needed feature. just apply an overlay Crater texture at the coordinates you impacted. Or you mean deformable terrain, but i think that would be far tooo big as you\u0027d have to save the currenct shape of every single planet in the game everytime you save, and i can\u0027t see groundwork for that since KSC is just destroyable and not deformable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe it\u0027ll be more Buildings on Kerbin, that would be a big art project too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOR they\u0027ve finally decide to flesh out all the planets a bit with Geysiers and Vulcanoes and Solar erruptions and waterfalls and caves, using the ability to apply animations to non craft objects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut honestly i\u0027m not sure which is the most realistic since all the ideas have pros and cons why and why not they should make it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally i\u0027d like something with all the other planets, not just Kerbin, to flesh out the things to do at your destination instead of making Kerbin prettier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides: We get new Explosions, it seems they are to scale to the part exploding. So do you think they also applied these to the asteroids?

Buildings and everything are memory structures. You can copy them in computer\u0027s memory and give another coordinates to other copy. Then you change code which calls functions that draws KSC of handles its functions so that it reads list of all space centers and calls these functions to every space centers.
