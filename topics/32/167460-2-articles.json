When pictures of modded parts started showing up the screenshots he was sending me of his progess, I was very critical of him for using mods to achieve those things. The reasoning behind this roughly breaks down to:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nparts packs were not balance-audited by the dev team but by the modder\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nany given mod part could have \u0027magical\u0027 unrealistic properties\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nevery mod part that filled a niche in the stock game made the stock game easier, because achieving the same thing without that part would be harder/more costly\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI had been enjoying the rivalry of oneupmanship in the achievements we shared by sending screenshots, but with mods there was no parity of effort\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a consequence, I steered well clear of all mods for a long time, and didn\u0027t really come to the table until I saw how beautiful the game could look with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, which led me to science packs, inflatable parts, surface base packs, and functional mods like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E. I still tend to avoid \u0027pure\u0027 parts packs - B9 Aerospace, for example, is well outside my comfort zone, because I feel like it would a) bloat my parts list, which already gets damn unweildy with the mods I do like, and b) it would make the game easier, and it would feel like I was cheating myself.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs far as my friend/others in general go these days, y\u0027all can do what you like. I play stock sometimes and modded other times, depending mostly how patient I\u0027m feeling. Mods can be a curse as much as a blessing. But a lot of that reasoning above still stands up - if you use a mod and I don\u0027t, we\u0027re not playing the same game anymore.
