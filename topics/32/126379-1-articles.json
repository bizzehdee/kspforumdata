Things in fairings tend to get yanked around quite a bit by simply moving the rocket. Shaking, tilting, or otherwise doing much of anything to your rocket while in flight has always caused payload problems. The decouplers alone don\u0026#39;t always hold things steady, especially large and/or unbalanced objects like rovers.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Vlad","CreatedById":106306,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T02:04:57Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Enorats\u0027]That picture posted earlier seems to have a rather massive fairing on top of a wee little rocket.
