But here\u0027s the concept. You know you can\u0027t land on Jool. But you can go into its lower atmosphere. So what if we were to go into Jool\u0027s lower atmosphere, collect science, and then blast back out?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool\u0027s lower atmosphere starts at 120km according to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Science#Celestial_body_multipliers/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we could do a high-speed aerobrake and get our science. But what about a more leisurely option? Parachuting into the lower atmosphere and then blasting back off after collecting some EVA reports at low speed, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/File:Pressures.svg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis is a graph of atmospheric pressure in KSP.\u003C/a\u003E As you can see, 120km is really high. Let\u0027s say we float down to 30-40km on parachute. At that height, Jool\u0027s atmosphere is similar to Kerbin\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question - is it theoretically possible to escape Jool\u0027s atmosphere from 40km and get into oribt? Jool is so huge that getting back into orbit has to be tough.
