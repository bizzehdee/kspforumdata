I want to play KSP. Unfortunately, besides the typical Mun mission, I\u0027m not sure what to do. I\u0027m going to rescue Luney Kerman from Kerbin orbit, but other than that I\u0027m a little stumped. And I don\u0027t really feel like more Moho mission testing today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where you come in. Suggest ideas for me. Some details:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I\u0027m in what I like to call a \u0027Sandbox Career\u0027--I unlock all the parts through cheats, keeping money, reputation, contracts and science flavor text without all that tedious burn-Kerbin-and-moons-for-science stuff (though now, science is more of a way to keep score than anything else). This way I can do fun stuff while keeping budget. Keep that in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.Mods I have or will be installing momentarily: DebRefund, FinePrint, Final Frontier, Kerbal Alarm Clock, SCANsat, Kethane, Chatterer. (Can Interstellar be integrated into an already-existing save? I was never able to figure out how far I have to cheat science to get the full stock tech tree without spilling into warp and stuff, which I\u0027d like to be able to unlock normally.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.I don\u0027t want anything interplanetary--keep it in the Kerbin system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.If you can figure out some roleplay-ish purpose to the mission, all the better! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHelp me out here!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T22:21:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInterstellar can be integrated into an existing save just fine as long as your not useing another mod that installs a custom tree through treeloader already. Make sure you get the experimental version wave put out till fratal gets back as the 23.5 version does strange things in 24. For the most part you\u0027ll get some basic nuke reactors, some engiens and some support parts in the stock portion of the tech tree and then you\u0027ll have expensive nodes for things like fusion/antimater/warp tacked onto the end. The only reall \u0022ISSUE\u0022 with installing mid game is the standard gota go back and manualy unlock new parts in the nodes thats common to all mods that add parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas for a mission. Luney is too golden an opertunity to pass up. Send a ship up for him and send him to mun/minmus before bringing him home for the irony of it. Bonus points if you \u0022Rescue\u0022 him by grabing him with the claw and lug him around for a while before you let him get in the pod to compleat that mission requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Jedi Master","CreatedById":57348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T22:51:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you provide a link to the experimental version?
