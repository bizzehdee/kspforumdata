This is the far extreme of using an extremely high amount of DV to accelerate fast enough to make for a shorter trip. The transfer window planners go for the opposite: they give you the point to launch that uses the least amount of DV, but you can find a happy medium if you want."},{"CreatedByName":"Caelib","CreatedById":59329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T15:53:39Z","Content":"Just wait until you try to rendezvous with Eeloo ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Rosco P.

There was a really good suggestion made in the ideas forum about adapting the maneuver nodes system so it could be used in the tracking station.

One heatshield should be more than enough for any duna capture (and if you\u0027re doing a low-energy transfer you probably won\u0027t need it at all). Jool and Eve are more tricky, but as long as everything\u0027s behind a shield, you should be just fine. The margins for your periapsis are a heck of a lot smaller than they were in the old aero, but it\u0027s definitely still possible (and useful). People have been doing this for years with Deadly Reentry and the new stock heating is *much* more forgiving."}]}
