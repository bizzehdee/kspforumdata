I\u0027m thinking I had too much drag going on, on account of I used Shock Cone Intakes instead of Ram Air intakes for the design. Anyway, I had to borrow fuel from the payload to get the thing into orbit. This turned out to have no effect on the mission - to put the Moneymaker in a specific orbit for a FinePrint contract. Landing the plane was surprisingly difficult - this was a craft that handled beautifully without payload, and one that I was able to land unpowered during testing. I did finally land it - on the runway, but to spite me the game tore off the wingtips off for no apparent reason after touch down (seriously - I was level at that point, moving forward, wings poofed out of existence).
