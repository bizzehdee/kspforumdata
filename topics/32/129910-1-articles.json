a while back in my Career mode I launched a 600k ship called the Tereshkova and sent it off to Duna with a lander in it\u0027s tow spot. \u00A0I managed to use my refueling operations there (which I had launched a while ago) to send it back and decided that while fully functional, I didn\u0027t want to keep sending stuff out that required me to spend a few hours of my time docking, landing and launching a mining ship to refuel it for a return trip. \u00A0I had planned for the Tereshkova to be a permanent space ship that would travel between systems and whatnot. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I commissioned and launched the KSP Athena which is capable of doing a landing directly on the surface of a moon or planet. \u00A0It\u0027s outfitted with \u0022belly engines\u0022 (Thuds) to allow it to do a direct descent along with rows of Chutes for landing on worlds with atmosphere. \u00A0It has its own pair of mining drills, ISRU convertors, Fuel Cells, and a pair of MSL\u0027s (though only one can function at a time it looks good for the symmetry). \u00A0The problem is that the Belly Engines still aren\u0027t balanced right and I\u0027ve not yet tried to tack into the power of a nuclear engine (I\u0027m nervous about the required cooling for them). \u00A0So I\u0027m finding myself musing on the idea of building a new Athena II to send up that will feature Nerv engines, (in place of my current LF/Ox engines) and make some other general design changes (such as correctly setting up my fuel lines, adding a runabout shuttle, etc.).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich also means, yet again, I\u0027m taking a \u0022I don\u0027t need to keep designing I can just use what\u0027s out there\u0022 and instead I\u0027m planning

wheels generate sufficent torque to keep me mostly level with the ground on the way down. \u00A0I did run into a small problem coming down on Duna in that I ran out of fuel (not good I know) and that created the situation where I hit harder than I would have liked. \u00A0I\u0027m also not that well balanced front to back when empty compared to when fully loaded. \u00A0I twiddled a little with the max thrust on my front engines and I was mostly level when empty but when I lifted off I had a real serious pitch up, probably because all of my fuel was towards the

deal with contingencies, and returns to Kerbin for a 45 km aerobrake. \u00A0The current version has some\u00A0small retractable radiators\u00A0landing legs\u00A0and Procedural parts LF only tanks.

interplanetary ISRU that will make Moho orbit (needs a refuel for landing) based on the same concept. \u00A0It has two small retractable radiators but relies on three of the four ISRUs\u0027 radiators for the loooong Moho burn. \u00A0 \u00A0The other side has a small ISRU and a single radial ore tank. \u00A0It\u0027s not perfect, but perfect is the enemy of good enough. \u00A0I plan to have one of these at each planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s important to keep the Main LF tank centered so that as fuel drains, the center of mass doesn\u0027t shift around. \u00A0The LFO tank is locked since it only feeds the surface operation engines which aren\u0027t used in space.

You always burn more than you make. Even using the large converter you need to be on a good ore concentration and have an engineer with you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made a very detailed spreadsheet a while back to investigate this. \u00A0It\u0027s a rather more complex picture. \u00A0I\u0027ll try to be as clear as possible. \u00A0All the following assumes steady-state mining and conversion on the surface, not mine and lift. \u00A0I also only looked at 100% fuel-cell power -\u00A0I was looking at destinations like Eve and moons of Jool where solar is essentially useless, and\u00A0KSP\u0027s fuel cells are so efficient it hardly makes a substantial difference anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the large ISRU, large drill, 100% fuel cell power, and\u00A0a zero star engineer, mining is profitable on about 0.3% ore concentration\u00A0or\u00A0better. \u00A0With no engineer at all, you need about 1.5% to turn a profit. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the small ISRU (which does require 10X ore for the same fuel output relative to the large ISRU), large drill, 100% fuel cell power, and a zero star engineer, you need around 3% concentration to turn a profit. \u00A0With no engineer at all, you can just barely turn a profit\u00A0on 14% (this is so rare to find on the surface that it\u0027s basically impossible).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you can use a 3-star engineer (the max you can get in the Kerbin SOI, and easily obtained by the time you\u0027re looking at ISRU ships), it\u0027s basically impossible not to turn a profit with the large ISRU. \u00A0The small ISRU will profit down to about 1% - for this reason alone, the small drills (which do not work on less than 2.5%) are a major liability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince large and small drills extract the same amount of ore per electric charge burned, the math comes out the same with either. \u00A0You simply need five small drills to equal one large drill. \u00A0And part count being what it is in this game, plus the 2.5% problem mentioned above, it\u0027s really, really worth finding a way to use at least a single large drill over any number of small drills.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-20T20:22:08Z\u0022 title=\u002201/20/2016 08:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by fourfa\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WhiteKnuckle","CreatedById":101722,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-20T20:37:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the detailed info \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/151713-fourfa/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022151713\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/151713-fourfa/\u0022\u003E@fourfa\u003C/a\u003E, so basically a manned (engineer)\u00A0miner, you can get away with using the small converter, but an unmanned op is going to require the large one if you plan on using fuel cells to power it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood to know\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-20T21:32:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222361547\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022129910\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221452783112\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022153514\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MrOsterman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1/14/2016 at 3:51 PM, MrOsterman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich also means, yet again, I\u0027m taking a \u0022I don\u0027t need to keep designing I can just use what\u0027s out there\u0022 and instead I\u0027m planning to discard what\u0027s out there for something better....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see nothing wrong with that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for myself, the main game is Vehicle Assembly -- the whole simulator thing only serves to prove my designs (or occasionally to fail them, but nevermind...).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy last career was full of could-be reusable designs that were nontheless discarded for something even better; and the one time I devised a go-anywhere ISRU lander, it became boring once it had proved its mettle landing on Duna and Tylo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027m trying to get at: there\u0027s no \u0022right\u0022 way to play KSP.
