Rovers would break under the gravity and nothing could fly near the surface making exploration impossible except from orbit. The surface would be pointless and most likely would be obscured by the extremely thick atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways just to recap on what we know so far that\u0027s been for the most part confirmed about the solar system gathered from various forum posts, mostly from Nova (which I\u0027m not bothering to quote since I just woke up so correct me if I\u0027m wrong. Also some of the info was wiped when the forums went down back in April):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-3 more gas giants to come and 2 ice worlds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-There\u0027s supposed to be a lava dwarf planet with a super-heated atmosphere somewhere in between the sun and Moho.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Whenever weather is implemented Eve will have an extremely hazing atmosphere blocking most sun-light to the surface and dimming visibility greatly. The surface will have very little weather beyond some occasional light winds while the upper atmosphere will be extremely windy and turbulent. Clouds in the upper-atmosphere will occasionally spark lightning storms. The oceans are hot from radioactivity and have an updraft of air over them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-There will be an asteroid belt in the area between Duna and Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Laythe is a cloud covered rainy/stormy planet being bombarded by Jool\u0027s magnetic field radiation. There will be active volcanoes and lava flows on the islands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Eeloo will have cryovolcanic geysers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Gas Giant #2 will have rings like Saturn. The planet will also be much larger than Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for my planet/moon suggestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-A Titan analogue around the second gas giant, a cold moon with a thick, hazy atmosphere that obscures the surface and is around 2 atmospheres in pressure. The surface would have low visibility due to the haze with a frost covered ground and areas with rolling sand dunes. The weather would be light to moderate winds. The moon would be dotted with lakes and oasis\u0027s of liquid rocket fuel on the surface like how Titan has seas of liquid methane and ethane. The gravity and moon size would be a little bit higher than the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-two \u0022Hoth\u0022 moons around the third gas giant, with orbits close to each other. Both moons orbit the gas giant in a polar orbit. One moon is nearly always covered in windy blizzard snow storms, obscuring the surface that is covered in a combination of massive ice and rock mountain ranges. The other moon has the occasional light to moderate snowfall and its surface is mostly rolling ice dunes with large, jagged ice sheets jutting out of the surface like solitary mountains and cliffs dotting the surface. The pressure on the first moon would be about 0.5 atmospheres while the second moon would be around the same as Duna\u0027s The first moon would be slightly larger than Moho while the second moon would be slightly larger than bop, being just large enough to have formed into a spherical shape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The forth gas giant could have a cryovolcanic moon in a close orbit with the gas giant. Another moon around the size of Pol that has a massive impact crater that takes up almost one side of the planet\u0027s surface. A moon made of dark, blackened minerals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-27T17:21:30Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2013 05:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by EleSigma\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T17:03:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI hope Eve does get some breaks in its could cover though.
