But I\u0027d like to ask if anyone who does have it, experience any performance boost whilst playing KSP. Quite frankly, KSP is one of the most un-optimized games I\u0027ve ever played, and for good reason. I can\u0027t blame squad on it, but it\u0027s certainly something that should not be dismissed. I\u0027m not sure if KSP utilizes much of the gpu\u0027s power. I have 16Gb RAM just for KSP alone, joined with an i5 with a GTX-970. I was pretty disappointed when more RAM doesn\u0027t mean better framerate when it comes to heavy part counts and tons of mods. Though it certainly did make the editor smoother for me, it didn\u0027t make my framerate get any better in-flight.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo my questions is:\u00A0does GPU memory and speed affect KSP\u0027s performance, and is the current KSP terrain system unoptimised.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat do you think is slowing down KSP? and what are your tips on running KSP butter smooth?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cairol","CreatedById":145279,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-16T16:21:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe limiting factor for KSP is and probably always was the CPU and the inability of the game to utilize all cores to it\u0027s fullest. (which is not to blame anyone, but just a fact).\u003Cbr\u003E\nI believe it can use 4 cores / threads up to now, while some CPUs (i7 and such) could offer 8 hardware threads or even more with a 6-core CPU.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis means, KSP currently can only utilize 50% of a modern i7 processor for it\u0027s physics calculations, because physics calculations of a single craft in KSP are hard to distribute.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSquad is obviously improving this steadily. But currently it\u0027s still the biggest bottleneck.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo If you have a GTX 970 (which is already completely over the top for KSP), you really don\u0027t have any advantage with a 1080.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s not your FPS that suffer with heavy part counts, but your simulation speed - which has the same result in the end.

(The devs made a lot of improvements early on in smartly removing any parts from these interactions that didn\u0027t absolutely have to be included.)

The downside is that it\u0027s coming with PhysX 3.4, and there really isn\u0027t any telling when that\u0027ll get incorporated into Unity.

The Problem: I had built an awesome station with the latest build (5.2.4 for KSP_x64.exe) but was getting no more than 12 FPS. This was on a Asus G74SX with a i7 2630QM quad core 2 Ghz, 12 Gb of ram and a GTX 560M with 3 Gb. So I just bought a Asus G751JT with a i7 4710HQ quad core 2.5 Ghz, 24 Gb ram and a GTX 970M with 3Gb. Using the exact same in game settings, my FPS is now 20 while messing with that same station in the same scene,\u00A0115Km above Kerbin. Frankly, it\u0027s not the leap I was hoping for, but is still a 67 percent increase. I only point out here for anyone who may be wondering how specific hardware changes can affect the FPS for large stations/ships, etc. I will leave it to better experts to sort out which part of the hardware upgrade likely had the greatest impact.

It\u0027s not a frivolous extra-pretty effect but part of the core gameplay. Keep in mind that it is a hybrid GPU/CPU solution at the moment, and you can actually take the GPU out of the equation entirely. No GPU acceleration then, but as the article makes clear, the main benefits of the GPU acceleration come only when dealing with many thousands of objects. With the object counts we\u0027re taking about in KSP, the CPU may still reign supreme.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso the biggest reason that PhysX and the like have typically been relegated to only pretty-fluff is because those are the easiest to parallelise.

The objects that are interacting directly with each other may still need to be calculated linearly, but you can run those linear operations in parallel between those chunks.

Since rigid-body physics is the main constraint on KSP\u0027s performance, that\u0027s what should be concentrated on when offering possible solutions to people experiencing low frame rates (which are coupled with a low physics-to-time ratio, which can be viewed easily with KerboKatz utilities; if it\u0027s just a low frame rate but the physics simulation is fine, you actually do need a better GPU).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen it comes to the other things in PhysX 3.3, like hair, particle interactions, and the like (so all that \u0022pretty stuff\u0022), I\u0027m pretty sure KSP hasn\u0027t touched any of the GPU accelerated parts.
