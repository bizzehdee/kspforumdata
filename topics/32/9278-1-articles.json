Do this over a period of time with evolving craft and it would be like a virtual campaign.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are each highly skilled engineers and you see an ad in the Kerbal Times newspaper stating that any Kerbal that can pilot a craft to an altitude of 6500m, and descend without casualties, gets a \\\u0027corporate\\\u0027 prize (sponsorship) of $5294. The problem is, as game master, I\\\u0027ve set the rule that all you budding engineers have are the basic components available to you. SRB, capsule, chute and decoupler. It\\\u0027s not a lot to work with and to make any money, you have to build a craft that costs less than your start up fund of $5100. Your accountant tells you a command module costs $1600 and decouplers cost $975 and other bits also cost money and so on. You mess around with a few designs and you come up with a winner. It\\\u0027s lean and it only just scrapes an altitude of 6500m but you\\\u0027re sure it can make you money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou submit that craft too me. I make sure its within your budget and uses technology you have available and if I can accomplish the stated mission with your craft (offline), I update the original post so everyone can see you now have $5294 prize money \u002B whatever lose change you had from building the craft. Now with this extra money, you set your sights on grander missions. Higher altitudes. Near orbits. After a few successful missions, you unlock liquid fuel engines (for a price) and orbits become a reality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut to win the space race you will have to build low cost craft. We\\\u0027d all like lifters with 10 engines on them but the budget might not allow for that. You\\\u0027ll need to keep your craft lean and you\\\u0027ll have to post on this forum if you wish to unlock new technologies. You\\\u0027ll have to keep an eye on your competitors and pick out the missions that pay the most and are within your grasp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver time you can unlock a full tech tree and be the first to put a cart on the Mun and claim the ultimate accolade. 8)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would be turn based. You would submit a craft file every 2nd day (I suggest) and if your craft meets all the parameters, you\\\u0027ll get paid. You then spend the next two days working on something bigger for your next mission and then submit that craft file to me. I\\\u0027d fly each craft to make sure it is structurally capable of the claimed mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou pick the mission. You build a craft within the budget with the allowed technology. You decide how to beat your competitors. You do this every 2nd day. I announce prize money and manage available missions over time. When orbits become a reality through research then I can post persistence files for those that like to fly past their competitors satellites and see burning debris on the Mun. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this sounds like a simple distraction and a new challenge (ie thinking about money for the first time ever).

If I had a bunch of people fly the missions (successfully) using craft that is as lean as possible and send me their craft then I can see, on average, how much one can expect a mission to cost (and then calculate reward). Only then can I price the reward for the mission successfully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, I have a mission objective of landing on the Mun and returning.
