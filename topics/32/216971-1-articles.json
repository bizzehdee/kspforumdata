The original \u0022Fat Phoenix\u0022 that barely got tested. Its way uglier anyways. I tried making it compatible with the FreeIVA mod (it worked). But eventually I found the MK2/MK3 passthrough mod thing. And I went with the MSS-1000, the more charming one. Due to the 2 wings that it has, the 2 engines and the bigger parts, it flies poorly, compared to the MSS-1000. HOWEVER, due to its bigger fuel tanks, it has almost twice the vacuum delta v. Enough talking, take a look.

Was meant to be a Phoenix succesor, but for some reason I abandoned it (it may still be on my PS4, hidden somewhere). It would\u0027ve been called the MSS-200, I guess...
