So looking at the real life\u0027s\u00A0Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, I notice it\u0027 pretty much peppered with antennas, with 2 large and one medium dish visible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo how helpful is it in 1.2 to have multiple antenna on the same object?

KSP holds a bunch of parameters of parts in the save file. If it e.g. appears that the \u0027relay\u0027 ability of an antenna, or its range is defined in such a way, any antennas launched prior to 1.2 will be useless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough someone with access to Testing version should better verify it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
