A surefire way to piss off gamers is to break the game up into chunks and charge for each of them. Expansion packs are one thing (provided it\u0027s actually an expansion pack that comes out some significant time after the original game and was obviously made as an addition to, but not a central part of, the original game), but DLC usually involves either cosmetic crap that won\u0027t sell well or integral parts of the core game that amount to hidden charges for those who buy the game in good faith.
