It\u0027ll be the next big mission I do. The ship is already mostly assembled (in orbit) but is so far unmanned, and I need ideas for what they should do once they are there. They will be there until the next Duna-Kerbin transfer window, so probably something like 500 days. I have no idea what to bring besides landers. Can you guys give me ideas for stuff to bring with me?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-07T23:20:52Z\u0022 title=\u002210/07/2015 11:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Findthepin1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T21:31:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re not against mods, propeller-driven aircraft are pretty fun to fly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Kwuu0SM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Kwuu0SM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T21:33:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBring a rover or two.
