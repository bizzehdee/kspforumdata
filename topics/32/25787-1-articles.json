For one, Gilly is before Ike, and you can pretty much visit Ike without difficulty once you\u0027re at Duna, so it\u0027s just a question of having some extra dV. Also, Gilly is tricky to land on because it requires such precision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would at least switch the two around. Also, I would put Laythe earlier on that list; even though it has a fairly substantial atmosphere, you can use it to brake on almost parachutes alone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T00:06:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce upon a time Gilly was hard to reach, but these days with better navigation tools like orbital nodes and manoeuvring nodes it\u0027s only marginally more difficult to reach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIke is easy to reach, but Ike is not easy land on. It\u0027s big with substantial gravity, it\u0027s got a lot of very hilly areas and worst of all it has a very fast rotation due to tidal locking with Duna.
