They would probably need to sit down and go through the design process all over again and adjust the tooling to build the proper cylinder side lengths. Let\u0027s not forget they\u0027ll need to calculate and build properly sized expanders for the nitrogen or helium vessels that will maintain tank pressure. The advantage to their system is that they don\u0027t need separate production lines/facilities for each tank or can reshuffle production if machines on one of the tool sets are broken. That\u0027s a step towards the standardization route, not the custom innards route.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay.

When we\u0027re sitting in the VAB or the SPH we\u0027re in the \u0022design process\u0022, as you put it. As such, there\u0027s no reason we shouldn\u0027t be able to alter the internal geometry of the tanks. No space agency is going to \u0022design\u0022 a rocket that\u0027s got a large empty tank that they have no use for. It\u0027s a waste of mass and a waste of volume. Truly, no self respecting engineer is going to intentionally design in a large empty tank that they don\u0027t plan on using, and indeed, any attempt to do so would likely result in said engineer ending up on the food line where he can\u0027t do any more damage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re not talking about altering tank geometry in flight, that would be ridiculous. We\u0027re talking about altering the base design of the craft before it\u0027s constructed, which is not just plausible, but quite realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit - Just think about it for a moment... What\u0027s more likely in this scenario. Option A or Option B?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt NASA in the \u002760s, engineers are gathered around in a smoke filled room to discuss their greatest challenge yet. Designing a rocket that can lift the 4,050 pound Apollo missions into orbit. They nervously glance at one another after their latest series of calculations show that they won\u0027t be able to manage the required delta-V with the current design. They know the whole country is counting on them, and that they can\u0027t afford to fail here. Suddenly, from the back of a room comes a suggestion. \u0022Hey guys, I have an idea! Lets throw in a big empty tank that we won\u0027t use!\u0022 The room falls silent. All of the other engineers face towards the originator of the idea, it\u0027s Alan the intern. The lead engineer\u0027s jaw falls open, his cigar falls onto the floor, still smoking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA. Suddenly, there\u0027s widespread cheering and applause. The engineers pick up Alan and carry him to the nearest bar to celebrate by buying him a round of drinks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB. The lead engineer immediately picks up the phone and calls for security to remove Alan from the building for suggesting such a ridiculous idea in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-14T00:34:40Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2013 12:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Firov\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T03:13:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI prefer having specialised fuel tanks.

This is pretty much what every space agency does since the design engineers have no need to worry about part availability or design restrictions or manufacturing constraints (to a sane level). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E A user thinks that the VAB/SPH is like a custom ship akin to OCC or Gas Monkey Garage where they take off the shelf components to build customized rockets within a range of specifications. A shop like this is full of design constraints since it uses only standardized parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow let\u0027s look at the definition of tweaking. Tweaking by definition is the fine tuning of a system such as adjusting the throttle cable on the car or tire pressure in the tires. If you look at it that way, you can\u0027t tweak fuel capacity or fuel type of an already built tank; doing so would be incurring a major engineering change. Replacing liquid fuel with LOX would have to change the expander, cryogenic systems, etc. along with tank sizes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the scope of tweaking in mind, it\u0027s easy to see the difference in degree between the mindsets of A and B. A is a design house, changing the fuel for the tank is just changing a number. This falls within tweaking semantically since it\u0027s just tweaking numbers before anything is sent to manufacture. The problem with this is that A has a severe level of abstraction that forgoes any engineering related to the fuel type, which is okay for project managers and system level engineering, but makes it a potential nightmare for component level engineering; a tweak of this level might mean redoing all your work. B is a custom assembly house, tweaking fuel capacity of a single fuel cell is impossible for B. The only way to manage this is to request a custom part or add more tanks to fit the need. As or right now, the VAB/SPH very much represents B in gameplay but has potential to be A (which it should strive for to a degree). Mods like Procedural Wings and Stretchy Tanks make the build process much closer to A but the nature of the game will likely stay in the realm of B to keep the barrier learning curve low enough for casual players. I think that something along the lines of Stretchy Tanks is perfectly feasible for stock game play, but that doesn\u0027t really fall under the title \u0022tweakable\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW: I very much would like procedural tanks over our current piecemeal design, but I am also very much aware procedural tanks is very far from what \u0022tweakable\u0022 is or ever will be.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-14T13:09:54Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2013 01:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by chuangatronic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Toshogu","CreatedById":65709,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T16:42:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wayfare\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wayfare\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat seems to work backwards. Say I need a tank full of liquid fuel for an airplane. That leaves me with only the pure liquid-fuel tanks to really choose from. Sure, I could remove the oxidizer from a bipropellant tank but that leaves me with a rather lot of dry weight compared to the amount of fuel I\u0027m bringing. If I want to build an oxidizer tanker where SSTOs can top off for interplanetary flights, same problem. Allowing full customization of a tank\u0027s contents would allow me to use any tank for any purpose. Volume and shape would then become the deciding factor, rather than pre-programmed compartments.\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of coding and user-friendliness the main stumbling block would likely be the odd ratio of liquid fuel and oxidizer that\u0027s used by rocket engines. The simplest fix for that is to change the LF/OX consumption ratio to 1:1. That, of course, would take some elbow grease in reconfiguring all rocket engines and fuel tanks, but in the end it would greatly simplify fuel tank logic: Tank holds up to X units of resources, fill as you please. For realism\u0027s sake, an individual tank\u0027s max values per resource could be set once the craft is moved to the launchpad/runway: no re-compartmentalization on the fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso basically what you want is Kerbal on Easy/Godmode/dumbed down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeave the stock game as they see it so far.

Filling different tanks with different things wouldn\u0027t make the game any easier, or dumb it down. For example, if you were making a rocket, you would still need liquid fuel and oxidizer. Filling one tank with only liquid fuel would still mean you would need another tank with oxidizer. No one is arguing for a \u0022Godmode\u0022 where you can fill a small tank with a disproportionate amount of fuel. Even if people were asking for procedural tanks, that wouldn\u0027t be overpowered -- fuel still has mass, and the dry mass of the tanks would still scale with size.
