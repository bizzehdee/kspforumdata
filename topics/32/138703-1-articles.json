Unfortunately 1.1.1 to 1.1.2 nuked it completely it seems...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s annoying because I hate having to go through and reset all my keybindings YET AGAIN. Why is it that the devs can alter specific bits of binary files but not be able to alter specific bits of text files that need changing. With all my controllers and keybindings I now have to go through each and every one again and reset them to the the same darn settings. I saved the settings.cfg before updating via the launcher from 1.1.0 (as normal). But because it was working flawlessly up to now I didn\u0027t this time because I thought the devs had finally figured out they didn\u0027t need to replace it each and every time... and the kraken bit me in the ass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh well...

After building and flying a bunch of flight sim cockpits it\u0027s just muscle memory now... Then I started making custom controllers and then got setup... then I bought things like a Leo Bodnar input board (my fifth) just to make an Apollo-esque landing pod and all these had to be setup for the game.... and so on and so forth...
