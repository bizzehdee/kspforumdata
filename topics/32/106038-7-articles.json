It might be beneficial for isolating Squad from criticism but it seems to place the experimentals and QA teams in the firing line when there\u0027s public ire over bugs. \n\nThe testers have been taking flack, probably unfairly, because of the presence of obvious bugs that seem to have made it to what was supposed to be the \u0022ready for primetime\u0022 release. As has already been said though, this could be because they missed the bugs, or it could be that they were reported but left unfixed by Squad in favour of a quicker release. If it is the latter then, from an outside perspective, the testers seem to be being thrown under a bus. Squad don\u0027t seem to be in a hurry to comment, and, by barring them being able to confirm or deny whether the bugs were known, the testers are made to look poor.

Yes, it wasn\u0027t done in time to be released with 1.0, but I hardly call that a reasonable excuse to be up in arms over that. There is still a plethora of videos and guides online to help, made by slave laborers(since that term seems to be popular in this thread, I use it only in jest, of course) out of their own time with no call from Squad to do such...blah blah blah\n\nI don\u0027t think you have quite understood my point. It\u0027s not that we literally don\u0027t know how to play the game. I for one, have at least 1,000 hours playing it. 700 on Steam and at least several hundred undocumented hours in \u0022offline\u0022 play and earlier versions. Most of this time was broadcast on Twitch as well. I\u0027m quite familiar with the game and its mechanics and have been an active, if somewhat irregular part of this community for years--just not on the forums.\n\nMy criticism isn\u0027t leveled at \u0022Oh, woe is me, I have to redesign my fleet of rockets because of the new Aero or Ore Tank changes.\u0022 If I may put on my monocle: That feat is done easily enough for someone at my skill level.\n\nMy criticism is that I have to. The game is no longer Early Access. Release builds of the game should no longer be treated as mass testing or gameplay balancing versions. The game should be stable both in terms of software bugs and gameplay practices. For the Record: No software is going to be bug free...but at least for me, that\u0027s not the issue in my criticism of the process since 1.0 hit.\n\nI\u0027m going to go back to my card game analogy for these changes. KSP has always been a game about flying rockets to space. Poker has always been a game about having a stronger hand. However, when one changes the aerodynamics model on a week to week basis, which is well before many of us can complete a career play through, it\u0027s like going from Poker to Texas Holdem while still playing the same round. They are both undeniably similar games, but also undeniably different. How are we supposed to play when the rules keep changing so drastically?\n\nThis is a direct result of Squad failing to use their chief advantage of having a game in Early Access: the sheer amount of people willing to test the game. It\u0027s why I bought the game in Early Access. I understand the need to have a smaller team test the game to make sure the product pushed to Steam isn\u0027t all regression, no progression. But once a build gets to that point, it should be provided to the Early Access community.\n\nI seem to recall a poll on this very forum asking this community if KSP should go from .90 to 1.0. And the poll was decidedly against that. By several hundred votes. The issues we are seeing now with the game aren\u0027t the result of Q\u0026A or Testers, but of a failure by the developers to leverage the advantage of having an Early Access community. They should have released components of what eventually became 1.0 to the wider Early Access community gradually over several builds. \n\nWe could have critiqued the game over the past several months constructively and had a 1.0 version that doesn\u0027t change rules or core mechanics from week to week. Early Access builds of any product are supposed to change rules and core mechanics--and frequently. If people were to complain, that\u0027s too bad for them, because they don\u0027t understand Early Access. We have now had more updates in a single week than we did in the past four months. These updates change the way you have to play the game. These are not bug fix releases--they are core changes.\n\nThe game is now in a different phase of its life. It\u0027s supposed to be \u0022done.\u0022 And its gameplay and underlying systems should not be revised as drastically as they have in the past week. These revisions are necessary...but they are the result of not doing Early Access properly. It makes it difficult to play the game, not because the game gets harder or easier...but because we don\u0027t know if we are doing Poker rules or Texas Holdem rules. \n\nAt this juncture, Squad needs to pick one and stick with it--and also tell the community not to expect an update to the mechanics in question for a significant amount of time so that we know it\u0027s \u0022clear\u0022 to start a serious long-term play through of the game.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T16:32:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 04:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Scourge013**\n  \nAdded the \u0022For the Record..\u0022 bit"},{"CreatedByName":"hawk_za","CreatedById":59433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T16:54:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E At this juncture, Squad needs to pick one and stick with it--and also tell the community not to expect an update to the mechanics in question for a significant amount of time so that we know it\u0027s \u0022clear\u0022 to start a serious long-term play through of the game.\n\nthat is insane if a game mechanic is not working correctly it should be fixed REGRDLESS of version number \n\nto that point we all know squad is working on multiplayer for post 1.0 that\u0027s a core aspect of the gameplay but he our software has a 1.0 tag so in the words of tatu you aint goanna get it (heheh) \n\nI defiantly feel there has just been an self justified overreaction here over what a version no \n\nthis is getting insane now"},{"CreatedByName":"Aerindel","CreatedById":109952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T18:46:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E this is getting insane now\n\nNo, its getting sane now.\n\nWhat was totally insane was to introduce entire new classes of gameplay without testing.

Even a halfway competant testing system would have found the major issues in literally ten minutes of play. Either the testers where not give 1.0 as it released, or they where not listened to, or they testers chosen where some bizarre element of the community that uses kerbal to simulate truck driving or something. (unlikely) \n\nThe reason we are so up in arms right now is because when you see a fundamentally broken system in charge of something you really like it causes a lot of fear that we will lose kerbal as a enjoyable game and whole house of cards will come down. 1.02 had more changes from 1.0 than 1.0 had from .90.\n\nWhat will 1.03 have in store for us? A few minor tweaks and bug fixes?
