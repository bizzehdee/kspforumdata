Sure, it does update information for 1.0.4, but many of its pages on parts and modding are still lacking behind in terms of content. Many articles on parts are stubs and lack detail, the newer parts introduced in 1.0.4 don\u0027t even have finished pages. The modding guides aren\u0027t finished and are outdated, most of them applying to 0.2X versions of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that we, as a community of players, should help and update it. With the full release of KSP and it still being in development and far from final release (which I hope never happens), it\u0027s going to garner a lot of new players. The wiki is a really great place for these new players as every thing is nicely collected and presented in an easy-to-read page. It contains all the guides on the different planets of the Kerbol System and all the info such as delta-v required to reach these planets. But when you compare these wiki pages to real life pages they lack in a lot of aspects, missing out on simple points of interest. As they travel deeper into the wiki, interested on guides on how to use this part, how this works, they\u0027ll be quite disappointed at how empty the page is. Sure, we have this great forum right here but navigating it to find guides is quite troublesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, let\u0027s work together and update the wiki for the new players!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T14:42:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESince the release of 1.0.x, I\u0027ve done some updating to the Wiki.

This prevents such things as uploading images, or using math text. These limitations can cause some frustration when trying to make updates. We can make plain text updates, but that\u0027s about it.
