The rover was active. I had driven it up on autopilot (probe core) to pick up this Kerbal. I didn\u0027t run him over or knock him down, and I didn\u0027t do any switching back and forth between the rover and the Kerbal (or anything else). Just changing views put him in the positions you see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this something new or what? Weird.
