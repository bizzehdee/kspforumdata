Then put a little nuclear transfer stage in, and re-used that heavy-lifter that the Station Aleph Tank used, because this really was thrown together in a couple of minutes. The plan? A Duna probe mission, which is why I called it DunaProbeAttempt - an unimaginative name, I suppose. Eve was also a consideration, but I decided on Duna. Then I changed my mind when I was setting up my escape-encounter burn, because I had a Jool window for under two thousand m/s.
