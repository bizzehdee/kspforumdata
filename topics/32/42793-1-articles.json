Are your problems in the design of your craft or the execution of the mission? Would help if you post a pic of the craft you are using and some pics from in map mode showing what your transfer attempts look like. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf watching tutorials hasn\u0027t worked out for you, perhaps a written tutorial might work out better? My friend Vanamonde has made a (stock) craft specifically for training new pilots to get to and return from Mun. As well as the craft there is a very detailed written tutorial (with pics) explaining how to fly the craft and navigate it to Mun, land and return home again. Might be worth you checking that out, at least you can know that you have a craft that will work so you can just focus on the piloting aspects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25029-A-moon-rocket-and-moon-trip-walkthrough-for-newbies-%2821-1%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s the tutorial with the craft download\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T11:24:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be helpful if you could be more specific as to what aspect of getting to the Mun you are have problems with - getting an intercept, establishing an orbit around the Mun, landing?
