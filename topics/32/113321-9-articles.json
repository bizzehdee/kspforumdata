With 6 BACC SRBs the TWR was something like 1.2 at launch and there was a serious control issue causing SAS to try and tip the rocket on its side immediately after blast off. \n\nThis is one rocket I delayed starting the gravity turn until above 4000m when there\u0027s enough airspeed to ensure stability. \n\nI did not want to revert to VAB either as I previously quicksaved with the rocket on the pad and then the game crashed on engine ignition. \n\nStill, with a souposphere style ascent profile the launch went well and the second and third stages pretty much flew a level flight path at 50 to 70km altitude and circularised precisely thanks to precise vertical velocity readouts from Kerbal Engineer.\n\nThe self propelled Salyut style habitation module had in excess of 2k dV remaining, and will soon link up with two munar landers and a fuel tanker to add another 1k dV to it before doing transmunar injection with the landers attached.\n\nConclusion: If using stock parts use Mainsail for Salyut / Mir / Zvezda sized payloads or use moar boosters.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T05:11:09Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 05:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pandoras kitten**"},{"CreatedByName":"Coga19000","CreatedById":125394,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T06:55:30Z","Content":"Those times when you successfully send a tricky rescue Mission, only to realise that my craft is already full.
