Im not a big fan of this, since there were more then enough designs i had planned (like my Ho-229 inspired SSTO) which really really benefited from those wings, but ive given up on that project 100% as those wings are now impossible to use efficiently (you have to do a much slower ascent which is more fuel wasted). \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for pods, you have very low internal temp because well, kerbal is in there!

I\u0027m also seeking advice on how to make it better. :-)\u00A0 It\u0027s powered by 12 rapiers and 4 nukes, and winds up with roughly 4500 m/s delta-v from LKO, plus it holds a lander that gets about 4300 m/s delta-v, and the ship carries enough rocket fuel to refuel it. I guess that\u0027s about 25 tons of cargo, which seems rather poor given that it weighs almost 210 tons on the runway. Maybe it can carry more, though. I haven\u0027t tried maxing out the load.

The scanners can all extend without clipping into anything else (except that the survey scanner hits the cargo bay walls).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo it\u0027s definitely true that you don\u0027t need many intakes anymore. Just 2 shock cones can power 12 rapiers with no problem (except some stuttering for the first few seconds on the runway - avoidable by not starting them all at the same time), and with a bunch of intake air left over. You can probably power 16 rapiers with 2 shock cones. It seems like Squad overcompensated. Personally I think that intakes need to be nerfed now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy first attempts had most of the engines under the wings. That turned out to be a bad idea due to the asymmetrical thrust in and near space causing it to pitch up. This design puts only four engines under the wings, and they can be toggled with an action group, so the rockets can be used in space if needed. I guess the wings could have also been raised up so the engines were aligned with the center of the fuselage, but then it would have been harder to mount the landing gear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy first attempts put the wings and center of mass near the center of the craft, like a normal aircraft. This worked alright, but it apparently works well to put most of the mass in the rear. This also avoided problems with engines under the wings in the center heating the rear landing gear and causing F3 log message spam on takeoff and eventual game crash, and generally made things easier to balance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStruts connecting the wings and fuel tanks to the body turned out to be necessary to avoid the wings tearing off at high speed and angle of attack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used Vernor engines for RCS, to avoid having to carry another type of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know much about flying spaceplanes, but here\u0027s the ascent profile I used: ~16 degree pitch until 7.5km to escape the dense air and then an 8 degree pitch from there to build speed. At some point it\u0027ll nearly explode from heat, so I pitch up very gradually to keep the heat bar at around 95% (though when it starts cooling at altitude I don\u0027t pitch back down). I activate the nukes at 21km and the rockets at 29km, then pitch up to 25 degrees until apoapsis is 59km and finish with the nukes around 5-10 degrees pitch. I never really did a dedicated \u0022speed run\u0022, but I got up to around 1400-1500 m/s before firing the rockets. I know people say to pitch up to 45 degrees with rockets, but it seems like the high angle of attack causes too much drag. Is this profile reasonable?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReentry is easy but landing is real tricky because it ain\u0027t no fighter jet. I usually aim for the field next to the runway because it\u0027s hard to line up perfectly with the runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, here are the craft files. I don\u0027t like cheaty clipping, so I tried to avoid it. There\u0027s only one cheat, which was squeezing the RCS tank into the lander. I also changed the LF/LOX ratio of the orange tanks. They still hold the same amount of fuel, but some may say that\u0027s cheating. The delta wings are stuck together, but there seem to be no good wing parts for making big delta wings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStork (uses parts from KER, KAS, and ScanSAT): \u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/azJGBWFx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/azJGBWFx\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStork (stock parts only, I think): \u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/qAPC8hR0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/qAPC8hR0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not a spaceplane veteran, but overall I think the 1.0.5 model is decent, except that intakes are overpowered now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-16T06:10:01Z\u0022 title=\u002202/16/2016 06:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by AdamMil\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-16T19:35:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222274418\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022124932\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221447355157\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002292782\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022H2O.\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 11/12/2015 at 2:05 PM, H2O. said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am not denying anything you are saying.
