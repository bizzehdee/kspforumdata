And I already know there\u0027s nothing I can say or do to ease your mind. We are also not a bunch of monkey automatons bandying about on the forums. We are humans, and we aren\u0027t necessarily able to see all and hear all. Nor do we wish to \u0022keep down\u0022 the forums. I can\u0027t swear that rules are always 100% enforced in a perfectly balanced manner in every circumstance, again because we are all human.\n\u003E Also, perhaps in a more constructive manner, you could explain what the moderators have done to promote hate on the forums, because that certainly isn\u0027t what we want. Nearly all the hate I see on the forums is how people like or hate MechJeb, like or hate FAR, like or hate x64, like or hate what Squad decides to do with their own game, and so on. If you feel you are being unduly attacked by a moderator, we have a process of review.\n\u003E \n\u003E We do, in fact, have moderators on the team that are about your age. I\u0027m also sorry if that\u0027s a measuring factor of what\u0027s a \u0022good moderator\u0022 for you. Not that age is a strict measure of who is \u0022above\u0022 who, and who deserves being sucked up to, because none of the moderators should be getting sucked up to anyway.\n\u003E \n\u003E Cheers,\n\u003E \n\u003E ~Claw\n\nmaybe you misunderstood... the monkey comment was saying that Squad are human, not monkeys. I was defendingn them and the game from the \u0022haters\u0022 although that may well be too strong a word.\n\nAs for the moderators, maybe I over stated the problem, generally, if they leave my posts alone then I don\u0027t have a problem with them, so, I accept that most of the time, things are good, but only if they don;t stomp on my posts... normally, if I screw up, fair enough, but when others gets away with what i didn\u0027t... resentment creeps in. \n\nFYI, I used to run a forum myself, and it was Vbulletin. I know that moderators are under appreciated, and hated... for doing a job people do not get... to create a place for EVERYONE to like, and to stop flame wars before they start. Having a forum go critical and suffer a meltdown is just what Moderators want to prevent, so yeah, I know all about that. But when I had my team of moderators, I told them to be fair but hard, not to allow one to get away with something another wasn\u0027t allowed to... \n\n...but more importantly, I told them not to be over enthusiastic it interpreting the rules, to allow some leeway. Closing threads down for the silliest of reasons creates more problems than it cures. So, allow some leeway.\n\nThe first thread I posted on this forum, well, one of the first, was about \u0022The Mun landing being a hoax\u0022.... that KSP faked it for the funding... I asked if anyone else could think of any... and they posted their theories about a face in the ocean... etc etc. That thread was closed down because conspiracy theories were against the rules. GIVE ME A BREAK ALREADY!!!! Kerbal Space Program is make believe... how can a make believe conspiracy theory be against the rules?\n\nlately... I have seen people post a few REAL conspiracy type posts... about phone numbers on heat panels.... and nothing happened. Yep... I even tested the theory and stated in that thread that conspiracy theories were against the rules.... STILL NOTHING.\n\nSo, my attitude now is... some mods don\u0027t deserve to be mods, they do more harm than good... they act more like dictators than mods, people they know (and like?) get away with murder... and others do not. \n\nSo, it is very rarely now that I will start a thread... I did post about Valentina being on the Mun and the Tech at KSP turned the radio off so they could enjoy the silence... and YET AGAIN... the thread was locked because it was ... sexist.... REALLY? Didn\u0027t Squad have a backlash for being sexist and not having females? Seems to have been OK then for anyone to make sexist posts either for or against females...\n\n...BUT.... (calming down now).... I, like a few others, will now not ever post a new thread because we know what will happen. I see the haters can post what they like, their threads are not locked... so, here I am in someone elses thread posting because I won\u0027t now ever start a new thread because I just KNOW what will happen.\n\nThe other mods are all fine.... but you know what... the bad mods make you good ones look bad too. That is just somethign you will have to live with.\n\nNow, let me repeat.... Squad = GOOD! Game = GOOD! Forums = NOT as much fun as they should be... MODS = ..... most are good.

NO game will ever be perfect... whether version 1.0.0 or version 9999.9999.9999.9999 .... for every 2 bugs they stomp, it creates 1 new bug.... for every 50 bugs created, it creates another 25 bugs in those areas where previously there were none... its a fact of life, pre version 1.0, the community here helped with the bug hunts... that is what \u0022early release\u0022and \u0022beta\u0022 means... version one means the game is ready to be played... NOT that there are no bugs... there will always be bugs... I still own a game which I bought on CD, it was a Starship Troopers game....

I keep it as a way to remind me that as long as a game loads, and works... mostly, then why complain... at least it works, unlike Starship Troopers....\n\nOK... got that, or do I need to repeat it a third time?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-29T12:23:27Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2015 12:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Red Iron Crown**"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T11:39:54Z","Content":"If I might respond to the original post:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The line between unfinished and finished software is getting increasingly more hazy.\n\nThis attitude by game developers is what I hate. Just because AAA game developers have the resources to pour into huge marketing campaigns for their ....ty, unfinished products, doesn\u0027t mean that is the way the market should be run from now on.\n\nApparently, in spite of asking us to pay for it, and announcing it\u0027s official release, SQUAD had no intention of delivering a finished product to their customers.\n\nImagine buying a new car, and having it fall to pieces while you\u0027re driving it home. You might be inclined to go back to the dealership and complain, but when you do they say, \u0022It\u0027s not our fault, the factory never finished building it.\u0022\n\nThat sums up my thought process, when 1.0 was released people expected a finished product, but what they received was a game not welded together properly.\n\nThe worst part of it is, instead of admitting they made a mistake, and simply asking us to hold off while they finish the game, SQUAD seems to think they can just \u0027patch away\u0027 their problems.\n\nAnd to anyone who thinks I\u0027m just waffling, all you have to do is look at the file structure for the game. There are unused and abandoned folders still sitting in the main game directory, that have never been removed. For some reason, they\u0027re still a part of the current game installation.\n\nA developer that doesn\u0027t even clean up even their basic file structure before announcing a release, is a developer who has no intention of releasing a finished product.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E (SNIP)\n\u003E OK... got that, or do I need to repeat it a third time?\n\nThere is a difference between unfinished, and broken.\n\nKerbal Space Program is *unfinished*. It continues to be developed, because it was never finished in the first place.\n\nStarship Troopers is *broken*. It was abandoned by the developer, because they couldn\u0027t make it work at all.\n\nDo you see the difference? It\u0027s a huge difference. While I might complain about an *unfinished* game, I don\u0027t give two ....s about a *broken* game."},{"CreatedByName":"TicTacToe!","CreatedById":44675,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T12:36:16Z","Content":"I think if the current releases we\u0027re seeing, that is 1.0 through to 1.04 had been released as beta versions (0.91 etc. or what have you), then most of the sharpened pitchforks would have been left in the shed.\n\nEven if it disgruntles you, if you bought the game in beta, or in alpha even more so, you kind of had to accept the fact that it was early access, and you should have read the label, your saves might break and other unfortunate things may happen. Most of the people (myself included) who have an issue with the current state of affairs is that you can\u0027t really get away with changing the definition of release-worthy software to include that kind of game experience fluctuation. \n\nLet\u0027s say hypothetically that 1.04 is the end of our \u0022post-release update turmoil\u0022 and that 1.05 is great and stable (I hope so!). If SQUAD had not jumped the gun and had instead stayed in beta, so that 1.04 in this scenario was, say, 0.99, then I believe the community would be largely pacified. We\u0027re your customers and a great deal of us forum-goers have been kicking around for at least a couple of versions, so essentially, if they had stayed in beta, they could have used us as an extension of the testing team to weed out all those bugs to bring up to the level of release-quality.\n\nAt the moment I think SQUAD have got themselves in a vicious circle because as good as the testing team is, it isn\u0027t big enough to pick up on everything, so each time SQUAD do a patch it\u0027s not tested enough, and because they have decided to release (prematurely, IMO), it gets whacked in the teeth with the \u0022This is a released game why isn\u0027t it top-notch\u0022 hammer, which to be fair, is perfectly expected. Really, I wouldn\u0027t even be bothered if hypothetical version 0.99 went straight to release with no changes, that just means the job is done!\n\nBottom line, people are getting annnoyed because the game has major bugs that exist on the core level of the game. After a 1.0 release, all the games core mechanics should be well-realised and stable, so future bugs are few and far between and only come from relatively trivial errors.

Once a game is released patches should be balance changes, maybe some new features added but at this point forward updates SHOULDNT be save breaking. Yes some of us like to build our ships on pretty thin margins so any small change to any factor may cause our carefully designed ships to not fly the way they used too, cant really complain about that, balance changes happen. \n\nOne of the big issues seems to be (with the community) every patch since \u0022release\u0022 has introduced multiple save breaking bugs, sure with all the possible system configs theres always someone whose hardware is set up a certain way that doesnt take an update well. But these werent few and far between, these were bugs that were easily reproduced and affected pretty standard rocket setups (heatshields anyone) on EVERY system. Now if this was still in early access not a big issue, its early access it happens. But this isnt Early access anymore, this is a release, amateur hour is over.\n\nThe other big issue that people seem to have is the out of nowhere rush from beta to release. This behavior has been seen many times in the past by other \u0022early access\u0022 games. This behavior is usually indicative of the developer running low on funds and pushing it to release for another cash grab. Squad can say whatever they want to try to mitigate our fears, but all the things their saying have been said in the past by other early access games as well. Im sure anyone who invests in early access games can think of other times theyve seen this. \n\nSo there was this \u0022random\u0022 push to \u0022release\u0022 (this game is still in beta imo), shortly after \u0022release\u0022 there was a huge announcement, I like to refer to it as the PS4 faceslap. Whoever in marketing though that would make for a dev note should be fired into the sun, using my sundiver series of solar perpetrators (sometimes the best stress relief is launching little green men into the sun). Suddenly \u0022release\u0022 made sense, cant port an early access game to consoles. Problem is how many times have early access gamers seen announcements for ports or sequels in the past while the game was still in dev. What usually happens? Development of the original is halted, sure theyll tell us their just working on the port and theyll get back to the main game. After that announcement I have never once seen a game go back into development (ive wasted way to much money on early access.... I may have a gambling problem lol). Squad can say whatever they want to tell us that isnt true, alls im hearing is the same crap ive heard a million times before. \n\nThe last big issue I can think of was this game was carried on the backs of the community, most dev games dont last this long in dev because the community falls apart and interest wavers. After all the years of Squad keeping the community in the loop right at the end they pretty much cut us out and pushed a buggy \u0022release\u0022, it was a big slap in the face, that will leave a bad taste in anyones mouth."},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T14:04:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Claiming my Valentina joke was sexist was a petty excuse, and now for you to claim that if could be construed in much the wrong way... seriously?\n\nI don\u0027t really see how someone could construe a thread that was basically [\u0022women talk too much, right guys\u0022](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126302-Valentina-is-a-woman-right) any other way."}]}
