Its a unique game that makes the player do actual engineering on complex systems. It was a great game around 0.24. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then we had the \u0022final\u0022 release. 1.0. Unfortunately someone missed Software 101 where \u0022beta\u0022 is a feature complete release, and after final bug fixes it gets released as 1.0. Meanwhile (as in at the same time), you can have an alpha release with new features, that then turns beta, and after testing becomes 2.0 . (with out without backwards compatibility as you wish). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead Squad has released a series of what are reallyalpha releases (new features) in their main line. This is frustrating for long term players, but much worse for Squad it will rapidly discourage any new players - the ones you were hoping would pay real money for the game and let you stay in business. This is not typical for games in production release- don\u0027t fool yourselves. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get the distinct feeling that a layer of pointy-haired management has been put in place on top of the good creative programmers at Squad. Whoever you are, its YOUR fault not theirs so stop shouting at them to fix the bugs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you aren\u0027t careful this is going to be a disaster for the company - which would be a shame - its one of the most creative games I\u0027ve ever seen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion - back off. Go to 0.9, fix the bugs and release it as 2.0. Then work on an alpha -\u0026gt; beta version with better aerodynamics, heat etc. Wait for modes to be compatible with that version, then in a year release 3.0 with the new features. Make arrangements with the modders to sell bundles of mods (like RO) as game add-ons through steam. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook - people make fun of me at work for how much time I used to spend on Kerbal, but I haven\u0027t played significantly since 1.0. I just dabble a bit with 0.9 RO because that is more stable than your main release.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nohelmet","CreatedById":99742,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T01:48:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really like it!
