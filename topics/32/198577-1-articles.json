I built the rescue ship with a klaw (jr) since I\u0027ve gotten contracts where there was no hatch on the target capsule. I get there, meet the target, and grab it with the klaw. (Which was stupid, in this case I could certainly have just EVA\u0027d the rescue guy over, but hey, it takes like a year to get to Eve and we were almost out of Scotch by then.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow the interesting part -- as soon as the klaw connects, my rescue ship final stage decoupler fires! All my engines and fuel and whatnot for the return trip are now drifting away, and I\u0027m left with this sad configuration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo -- what happened??\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy best guess, but it\u0027s just a guess, is that when you dock two ships together the \u0022control from here\u0022 point may change in ways I\u0027ve never really looked into, and in this case it changed to the to-be-rescued capsule, which had some state of \u0022all stages fired\u0022 and revised the entire state of everything to be \u0022all stages fired.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs that a thing that makes any sense, or could happen? Or if anyone else has seen something similar, what\u0027s behind this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vv3k70r","CreatedById":208078,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-08T09:27:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223890759\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022198577\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221607390768\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002278680\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chd\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, chd said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs that a thing that makes any sense, or could happen?

It happens when You fulfill assigment /part of assigment combined with staging. You can edit it in save game manualy or use KML to open Your gamesave - it detect those problems automaticly and allow You to fix them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut without fuel or engine You propably need another rescue ship?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this is funny part of the game when things dosent go acording to plan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
