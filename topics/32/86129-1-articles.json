My search method is to land the craft, EVA 10 or so Kms north and return, then EVA 10 or so kms south, then I fly the craft 10kms east and repeat. Im about halfway round now and I am wondering if the gaps are too big and I will miss seeing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E My graphical settings are probably middle of the road (Im not in game to check). Should I see it if I am 5 or more kms away (but moving around the view and zooming way out etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same question applies for when I try to find the desert KSC etc, Im not sure how low I should fly the search plane!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WWEdeadman","CreatedById":105591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-05T11:06:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst off I\u0027d put this in the questions section of the forum, but I\u0027ll leave it to the mods to decide about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for finding the Kraken on Bop: You can kinda see it from very low orbit, even though it\u0027s more like a bunch of pixels looking like a glistering in the distance from that hight. But you should be able to see it below you at some point if you are in a polar orbit. I\u0027ve definitely seen people find it from orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for Kerbins larger easter eggs (KSC2, pyramids etc) I\u0027d fly pretty low. If you can see stuff like the Iland runway you should be fine at that hight.
