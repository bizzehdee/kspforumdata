It was still a darn hard transfer, pitched down at about 25 degrees to remain in the upper atmo while at the same time raising the Ap so it fell way passed a Duna intercept. After many attempts I timed it so that once the engines finally cut out the last bit of Kerbins atmo pulled me back into a Duna intercept and the (very small) craft parachuted to a landing. It was a transfer that didn\u0027t ever complete an orbit, but as I said, only possible because of a bug in the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith current stock parts the best I\u0027ve managed is raising my Ap to around 100km and on such a wide orbit that the force of a loud sneeze is enough to complete the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T13:40:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s theoretically possible that the screenshot in the OP is legit without using infinite fuel. Due to the way KSP handles resources, each intake can store a small quantity of intake air. If you use the jets to blast your Ap out of atmo, shut off the engines, let the intake air gauge fill, then close the intakes, your ship will carry that air into vacuum where it can be consumed by the jets in a brief burst of thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExploiting this behavior can also allow a craft to achieve \u0026gt;70km Pe orbit using jets only. Landing on the Mun is a bit of a stretch though, the ship would need a pile of intakes and perform all burns when the vessel is traveling less than 2400m/s surface velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T13:53:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s odd that they say they landed on the Mun but the screen shot is nowhere near that..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"timsfitz","CreatedById":104387,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T15:23:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThought he meant Rapiers.
