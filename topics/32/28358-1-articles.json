They held NO information as to what source the problem was originating from as well as the steps they did to encounter it. The reason the released version was filled with bugs was because the community was basically demanding it be released with all the \u0022wah wah KSP no update\u0022 threads. Now, we\u0027ve got a bug-filled update, and all because half the forum couldn\u0027t wait a few weeks for their favorite videogame update. If this is to EVER change, the devs will need to hand pick the volunteers so that way the bug reports submitted are able to be understood. The problem with this, is that most people seem to think being one of the experimental testers is some kind of special treatment, so they whine about that.
