They are inspired by the original concept for the Space Shuttle, which consisted of two manned re-useable rocket planes. The booster was to act as the first stage, while the orbiter was to be the upper stage. The booster was eventually dropped from the design and replaced with solid rockets to save development costs.\u003Cp\u003EMy version acknowledges that any stages that are released before I make orbit are going to be lost when they fall back into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. Therefore, I use solid rockets as my first stage. The logic behind this is that I\u0027m expecting solid fuel to cost less than liquid fuel in the new patch and I expect empty solid rocket \u0022trash bins full of boom\u0022 to have limited recovery value anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe design shown in the album below consists of a solid-fuelled first stage and three liquid-fuelled fly-back stages.

I\u0027d agree; I\u0027m getting good results with powered-landing rockets which are an awful lot less hassle to fly. Cost-effective too since they\u0027re much simpler builds than spaceplanes.

In the real world adding nosecones does cost money and add weight :-) Since 0.23 at least they change the drag characteristics somewhat so they aren\u0027t completely useless. Yes, I agree your main point but do we really want KSP to become an atmospheric flight-simulator instead of a space-based one?
