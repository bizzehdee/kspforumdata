We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve completely rethought how Science Labs work now. Instead of merely boosting the xmit factor of a science experiment for a small amount (something that scientists can do now), and allowing you to restore inoperable experiments (also something scientists can do now), the Lab now works much more like a long-term research facility. Now, when you run experiments, you can transfer data to the lab just as before, but instead of a quick process for a small boost in the xmit factor, the data fed to the lab will generate a steady output of Science for a very long time, ultimately yielding far more science than transmitting or even recovering. This, of course, requires the labs to be manned by scientists, and have a steady supply of electricity. It should greatly increase the benefits of setting up orbiting science stations and surface bases, however, and also give you good reason to visit them every now and then. (The data does decay after a while, and the labs can only hold so much processed data before having to transmit, so don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t expect to be able to timewarp your way to infinite science).\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T20:53:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022searlefm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022searlefm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ebut this is a game about failing to make rockets how dose ... of the kerbals matter in any way?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI usually care very little about the gender in games, to me its more about how a charachter is done (if that charachter matters at all).
