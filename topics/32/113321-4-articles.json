A lot of the usual, overcooking the launch so it flipped, less than optimal launches leaving too much plane alignment to do.\n\nAnyway, first error that is on topic. Asteroid was coming over the top of Kerbin, roughly NE to SW. Took off, almost perfect alignment with the plane of the asteroid. Good high orbit, heading roughly SW to NE.... in the opposite direction from the asteroid. \n\nOK new launch, got an alignment requiring very little adjustment. Asteroid is still some time away from its PE. Go to the tracking station to accelerate time till the correct moment. Ship won\u0027t obey my commands.... why, I wonder. The claw won\u0027t open, the throttle won\u0027t throttle... then I realise. Ultimate rookie mistake.

After a few \u0027simulations\u0027 it became clear there wasn\u0027t going to be any sane way of getting all that payload up there without the mainsail engine. My intent was to take several crew (and one tourist who wanted to orbit Minmus to finish the contract) to boost their XP. \n\nSo I decided to use my unmanned Mun lander rocket to get some science, and stick a Kerbal in it. I knew if it could land on the Mun, it should be able to reach, land and leave Minmus. \n\nAfter making a few minor adjustments, adding Val, I set off for Minmus. The entire trip there went well, landed in a nice spot. Did a bit of science and returned towards Kerbin. \n\nMy initial return orbit was 42,000km a bit too high for the new update so I ended up coming out the other side in a big elliptical orbit. I few corrections on the apoapsis to get a better insertion and I was set... That\u0027s when I realised I forgot to take off the stayputnik. Like I said, this was originally an unmanned design.\n\nAn unmanned design that was never meant to return from the Mun. I\u0027d set it up to be able to take and send back science, so if I ever got \u0022transmit science from the surface of the Mun\u0022 contracts, I still had a capable vessel there to do it immediately. \n\nBy now you\u0027re probably ahead of me, we\u0027ve all done it at some point I\u0027m sure. What do you not need on a vessel that is not intended to return? Parachutes. \n\nUnfortunately I had left and reloaded the game before landing on Minmus, so the \u0022revert flight\u0022 option was not available to me, but that\u0027s okay, reverting is not the Kerbal way not with all this science. Fortunately, with the rocket being designed for Mun landing, there was quite a lot of fuel in the lander part left. So using it sparingly at first to help slow me down, then going all out to land I did manage to make a safe, if violent landing. \n\nThis only issue I had is that the landing was at 10m/s - which to me seems way too fast. In previous versions I\u0027m sure most if not all would have been lost. It could be a mod that affected this, I\u0027m not sure. But either way, it was a stupid thing with a fortunate ending."},{"CreatedByName":"rofltehcat","CreatedById":145224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T09:45:56Z","Content":"Fairing clips into parts of the space plane, pieces get stuck on deployment.
