Thats why I played 0.90 with DRE, FAR, Remote Tech, TAC life support and a bunch of other stuff. Returning from orbit used to be something that needed some thought and some proper engineering if you wanted to bring back more then just a capsule. With 1.0 I got excited about the implementation of aero and re-entry into stock.\n\nHowever now Im playing in 1.0.2 I find it near impossible to BBQ my crew on re-entry. Meaning that all my missions can safely return my crew guaranteed...no fun in that!\n\nGoal: Burn up an MK1-2 capsule on re-entry\n\nSettings: DRE, re-entry heat 120%, Aero heat production maxed at 5.000 (default is something like 3.250)\n\nAttempted re-entry orbit: 500kmx30km no heatshield, 500km 90 degrees straight down no heatshield, 1000kmx5km no heatshield\n\nThe capsule survived all re-entry attempts. The crew died from excessive G-forces on the last 2 attempts, but the goal of capsule BBQ still failed.\n\nDoes anyone have tips on settings, mods etc to make re-entry more deadly again. Pretty much like how it was in .90?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T20:41:10Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 08:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Desperado34**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCanadianVendingMachine","CreatedById":59684,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T17:52:25Z","Content":"Step 1: Go into your save game\u0027s settings (persistent.sfs)\n\nStep 2: Find ReentryHeatScale\n\nStep 3: Turn this up to 2.0, instead of 1.2\n\nStep 4: ???\n\nStep 5: Profit (or burn)"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T18:13:40Z","Content":"Or you can download and install [Deadly Reentry](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54954-1-0-Deadly-Reentry-v7-0-3-update-May-14-2015) updated to 1.0.x"},{"CreatedByName":"Sokar408","CreatedById":75557,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T18:18:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Or you can download and install [Deadly Reentry](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54954-1-0-Deadly-Reentry-v7-0-3-update-May-14-2015) updated to 1.0.x\n\nDeadly Reentry doesn\u0027t make any sense to me anymore.

Compared to the effort I have to go through to BBQ a capsule this seems odd.\n\nUpdate: changing ReentryHeatscale to 2 makes the above occurance even more absurd. I flew up a test rocket rather carefully and the fuel tanks exploded at 6km@320m/s. Rockets should be able to break the sound barrier, even at lower altitudes.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T18:34:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 06:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Desperado34**"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T18:44:43Z","Content":"1.0 was WAY more fun imo, both in atmo and in reentry heat (which was a MAJOR threat in 1.0, not in 1.0.2 though).\n\nI feel that 1.0.2 was a rushed decisuion based on a few complaints (some of them justified, most of them just coming from people who didnt like the new aero and didnt actually think it through as to why it was good/bad, just hated that old craft nolonger worked). 1.0.2 is in my opinion a step backwards more towards the souposphere, and its almost IMPOSSIBLE to overheat/burn unless you make some uber streamlined vessel and come in at interplanetary velocities. I did some aerobraking at jool, laythe and kerbin in 1.0, it was difficult but my SSTO made it to laythe and returned to kerbin ALIVE, this is reasonable, despite the fact that i needed multiple aerobrake passes at jool to save myself the fuel itd take to burn normally otherwise.\n\nThe new aero just feels almost like it was back in 0.90, drag values are so high the only way to burn up (even in a crappy craft) is to come in at outright stupid angles, or have some lucridious velocity that more likely then not cant even be achieved without using mods or cheating with inf fuel (you aint gonna get 20km/s velocities in any encounter without some cheaty mods/inf fuel). Pretty much 1.0.2 made overheating a very minor nuissance at best, ive yet to actually TOUCH a heat shield for anything as they are just unnecessary mass right now. With a SSTO that has wings you can just brake by pointing wings perpendicular to velocity, with anything else slap on 2-4 airbrakes and those will slow you down enough that even parachutes are redundant.\n\nBasically the more i think about it the more i see how nobody though 1.0.2 through, and honestly im STILL using 1.0 physics configs given how much more fun, balanced, and just tested the values were there. Reentry heat is now useless with the new souposphere mk-II, and while i wont go all out and say 1.0.2 is another 0.90 (which it isnt, its still better), i think 1.0\u0027s drag/aero made a more fun and difficult but not annoying gameplay."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T18:45:56Z","Content":"Kerbin is too small.\n\nThat is the problem.\n\nThe result is that orbital velocities are tiny, and the craft decelerate to safe speeds very quickly. Danger requires longer duration in the atmosphere at high velocities. This is why upping the heating kills spaceplanes. THEY have to fly longer at high speed in the atmosphere, so they can see way more heating than capsules.\n\nThe thing to do is to text scaled up Kerbin when that is available, and see what reentry looks like with a 2X kerbin, 3X kerbin, etc. (this is why those of us in the \u0022err on the side of realism\u0022 camp think the way we do---when yo make an arbitrary planet that breaks physics like kerbin, things don\u0027t work as one would expect.

The craft itself, however was not. The Columbia disaster had a failure in the HRSI section, which was for temps under 1533 K.

At first I thought that there was at least some gameplay value in the threat of re-entry heat, in that players would be encouraged to use capsules to re-enter and be unable to re-use their, say, Mun lander as a Kerbin reentry vehicle. So I ran some tests. I set re-entry heat to 100%, built a Mun lander that is totally not aerodynamic, slapped a parachute on it, launched past Minmus, set my periapsis to 25k altitude and grabbed some popcorn.\n\nThe only things that exploded were some externally mounted batteries. Everything else survived. Girders, radially attached tanks, exposed engines, landing gear, lights, etc.\n\nThen I repeated the test, but this time went past Minmus and burned TOWARDS Kerbin to simulate an interplanetary re-entry.
