I did some aerobraking at jool, laythe and kerbin in 1.0, it was difficult but my SSTO made it to laythe and returned to kerbin ALIVE, this is reasonable, despite the fact that i needed multiple aerobrake passes at jool to save myself the fuel itd take to burn normally otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new aero just feels almost like it was back in 0.90, drag values are so high the only way to burn up (even in a crappy craft) is to come in at outright stupid angles, or have some lucridious velocity that more likely then not cant even be achieved without using mods or cheating with inf fuel (you aint gonna get 20km/s velocities in any encounter without some cheaty mods/inf fuel). Pretty much 1.0.2 made overheating a very minor nuissance at best, ive yet to actually TOUCH a heat shield for anything as they are just unnecessary mass right now. With a SSTO that has wings you can just brake by pointing wings perpendicular to velocity, with anything else slap on 2-4 airbrakes and those will slow you down enough that even parachutes are redundant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically the more i think about it the more i see how nobody though 1.0.2 through, and honestly im STILL using 1.0 physics configs given how much more fun, balanced, and just tested the values were there.

I\u0027ve been messing around with a minimalistic test rig and the worst I\u0027ve been able to do to a mk1 pod was 472k coming down from a 950.6km x 1.8km orbit, and just under 411k from a 76km x -400m orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly, 1.02 happened when I was at work so I didn\u0027t get a chance to save a 1.0 copy and so lack a reference to the old config, and I miss having setting my ablator being part of the design considerations for a mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I see it\u0027s even worse than I thought -- an unshielded mk2 pod coming down from a 1000km x 20km orbit only pulled a max temp of 228.0k... \u0027turns out the heating\u0027s weak enough that starting temperature has a greater effect. Even rampaging down from 1000 x -495km only got a max temp of 457.8k.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T09:04:43Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 09:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Archgeek\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ENew observations\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fire-Dragon-DoL","CreatedById":113470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T09:21:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a bit concerned, I have basically no part exploding except for the \u0022connectors\u0022 between a small tank and a larger tank, they explode as soon as they hit any sort of atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought they were meant to be quite resistent.
