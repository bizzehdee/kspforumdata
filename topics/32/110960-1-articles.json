Kerbol has an equatorial radius of 261,600 kms, while our sun has an equatorial radius of 696,000 kms. That means the \u0022habitable zone\u0022 is much smaller, and if Earth was placed into Kerbol\u0027s system, it would probably be a bit colder. Now, looking at this habitable zone which I find not very easy to define, it is either very large or the planets are smushed in all around the habitable zone.

Minmus cannot be made of ice because I had a colony there and one of the thermometers read 278K, or 5C which water can evaporate at.

So is everyone else here. The planets in KSP with atmospheres can all hold their atmospheres because what matters is the gravity. They\u0027re really, really dense. You could theoretically have an object six inches across, with an unrealistic density that gives it about 9.81 meters per second squared gravity. It would be able to hold onto an atmosphere of 1 atm. That atmosphere would be much less \u003Cem\u003Emassive\u003C/em\u003E than Earth\u0027s, but still 1 atm, as in Kerbin\u0027s scenario. As you say, it could also end up like Mercury. IF Eve\u0027s oceans are made of something similar to water, then they would begin to boil somewhere on the planet if its temperature were raised barely two degrees (Eve\u0027s maximum temperature is two degrees below the boiling point of water at 5 atm, assuming the Kerbals measure in Kelvin). That is a very risky environment. One particularly hot day at the equator over ocean could set off a runaway greenhouse effect (oceans evaporate, increase air pressure, air traps more heat due to higher mass/density/pressure, increase temperature, more oceans evaporate, etc). I was also assuming Duna was in an ice age because one of the devs once posted that Duna was inspired by something about Mars in an ice age, I regret assuming that now. Either way, the ice has an effect on Duna\u0027s albedo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I do not consider myself an anthropogenic climate change denier, I consider myself an anthropogenic climate change skeptic.
