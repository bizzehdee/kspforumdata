I also seem to recall some question about the long term fate of pol\n\nI would like to clarify that all I am doing is guessing. So is everyone else here. The planets in KSP with atmospheres can all hold their atmospheres because what matters is the gravity. They\u0027re really, really dense. You could theoretically have an object six inches across, with an unrealistic density that gives it about 9.81 meters per second squared gravity. It would be able to hold onto an atmosphere of 1 atm. That atmosphere would be much less *massive* than Earth\u0027s, but still 1 atm, as in Kerbin\u0027s scenario. As you say, it could also end up like Mercury. IF Eve\u0027s oceans are made of something similar to water, then they would begin to boil somewhere on the planet if its temperature were raised barely two degrees (Eve\u0027s maximum temperature is two degrees below the boiling point of water at 5 atm, assuming the Kerbals measure in Kelvin). That is a very risky environment. One particularly hot day at the equator over ocean could set off a runaway greenhouse effect (oceans evaporate, increase air pressure, air traps more heat due to higher mass/density/pressure, increase temperature, more oceans evaporate, etc). I was also assuming Duna was in an ice age because one of the devs once posted that Duna was inspired by something about Mars in an ice age, I regret assuming that now. Either way, the ice has an effect on Duna\u0027s albedo.\n\nAlso, I do not consider myself an anthropogenic climate change denier, I consider myself an anthropogenic climate change skeptic. This is because I am willing to listen to and consider people\u0027s opinions on either side of the debate, and when talking about the subject I try to make my points as logically as possible. It is possible that Laythe has CFCs or some other strong greenhouse gas. I do not dispute the existence of greenhouse gases or their effects, it was not a joke.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T19:47:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 07:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Findthepin1**"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T19:46:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The planets in KSP with atmospheres can all hold their atmospheres because what matters is the gravity.

If the *average* speed is much more than that, there will be enough molecules exceeding escape velocity that, over billions of years, the gas will slowly be lost. The average speed of a gas molecule is given by the [root-mean-squared velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_speed), which is function of temperature and molecular weight. If we know the escape velocity and temperature, we can compute the minimum molecular weight molecule that a planet can hold onto.
