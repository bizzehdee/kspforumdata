That was when I bought the game as well. What that graph really shows is the power of advertising: in this case, the magic of the Steam ads the moment you log in. Graphs like that are probably hanging in every ad guy\u0027s office. Not to say that your assumption is incorrect. It probably is. But I think a graph for most games would look quite the same (except the huge, extremely popular multiplayer ones). I have dozens of games I\u0027ve tried for a bit and moved on, or never even loaded at all. I suspect we all do. You try something, and maybe it\u0027s not your cup of tea. Or not quite what you thought. Or maybe you think you\u0027ll come back to it later and give it another shot. There are plenty of reasons to move on to something else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo me, KSP is one of those games that either grabs you immediately (and won\u0027t let go), or not at all. Is there such a thing as a \u0022casual\u0022 KSP player? I\u0027m not so sure. It\u0027s sort of a way of life; bordering on obsession. If someone found the game too hard or not to their liking, I don\u0027t think seeing the numbers would help. But for someone who likes the game and wants to get better, more info would certainly help. As I said, I\u0027m not opposed to it. I just don\u0027t think it will be incorporated into the stock game anytime soon.

Graphs like that are probably hanging in every ad guy\u0027s office. Not to say that your assumption is incorrect. It probably is. But I think a graph for most games would look quite the same (except the huge, extremely popular multiplayer ones). I have dozens of games I\u0027ve tried for a bit and moved on, or never even loaded at all. I suspect we all do. You try something, and maybe it\u0027s not your cup of tea.
