It\u0027s not too hard to make what we call \u0022asparagus\u0022 staging, where a series of boosters are radially attached to a central core, and the outer layers (which also feed fuel to the inner layers) are ejected as they run out of fuel. It\u0027s basically the solid rocket boosters of the shuttle/energiya system taken to the extreme, although you generally use liquid-fuel engines for it. It\u0027s a bit harder to make a rocket that doesn\u0027t shed parts as it goes up, although it can be done. (A single-stage design just won\u0027t be as efficient.) Once you get the basics down, it\u0027s not hard to tune any booster design to have increased payload and/or a better range. The way rockets work, you can always go bigger (i.e., MOAR BOOSTERS) if you want to launch a bigger payload, because there\u0027s no real limit other than part count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake my \u0022Bucket\u0022 design, a 4000-ton rocket capable of placing a 500-ton payload into a circular low Kerbin orbit, or getting that object almost out of Kerbin\u0027s gravity well entirely (and therefore most of the way to, say, Jool):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vryUQRg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vryUQRg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt requires the KW Rocketry mod, since those rocket stacks are 3.75m tanks.
