I\u0027ve already gone into detail on rescaling the planets. If you make densities for planets correct without scaling them up, you end up with Kerbin that has no gravity. Planets are as close as they should be for their scale. They just look closer because of the scale. I\u0027m working on a game with some friends and The home planet is 1% the size of Earth, the moon is 1% the size of The Moon, and the distance is 1% the distance to The Moon.

Asteroids IRL that are targeted for Asteroid Redirect Mission don\u0027t have measurable gravity either, aside from the biggest ones for Asteroid Boulder Retrieval Mission, which in KSP terms would be G-class asteroids, and even then it would take days to fall from 10 meters up.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nine_iron","CreatedById":37971,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-06T12:54:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe greatest step towards realism would be to remove the time warping options...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-06T13:00:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nine_iron\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nine_iron\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe greatest step towards realism would be to remove the time warping options...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t tell if trolling or serious.
