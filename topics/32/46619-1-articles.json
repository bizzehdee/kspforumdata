During decent you\u0027ll notice that your velocity drops as you switch from orbital to surface relative velocity. This saves you fuel because you don\u0027t have to slow yourself down as much. In the same way, as you ascend, the body\u0027s rotation slings you forward and gives you an extra boost on the way up. In a retrograde orbit, that same velocity works against you, so your delta-v requirements go up by twice the body\u0027s rotational velocity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you were going into Jool orbit, Retrograde might be the way to go, like HavOc13 did, because then you can slingshot your way down using the various moons.

For planets, like Kerbal, this means the best way is to go Counter Clock-wise, as seen from above, because the planet is already rotating in that direction. If you choose to go Clockwise, you need to burn extra fuel to overcome the momentum imparted from the planet\u0027s rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Establishing an orbit with Moons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one really depends on your ultimate goal. If you are planning orbiting a moon (such as Mun) and want to go interplanetary, then it\u0027s best to capture an orbit that is counter-clockwise. This is because when you want to reach escape velocity (for the moon and planet) you get to use a lot of existing momentum - the orbital speed of the moon and your orbital speed around the moon. Note - doing this it\u0027s best to leave when the moon is between the planet and the sun if you are headed to an inner planet, or when the planet is between the moon and the sun when you are heading to an outer planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, if you simply want to establish orbit on a moon and return to it\u0027s host planet later, it\u0027s more energy efficient to go clockwise - as at Apoapsis you are going very slow. When a moon passes you (because it is going faster) your craft will have an easier time reaching an orbit by burning just enough to let gravity pull you along the clockwise side. Otherwise you have to use more thrust to overtake the moon and get a counter-clockwise orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about landing on a Moon? Well, again it depends on the particular moon. Most moons rotate so slowly that it doesn\u0027t matter - so you actually save fuel by choosing the best insertion orbit (in most cases, clockwise). But if the moon has a decent rotation period, then it\u0027s definitely best to orbit in the same direction as the rotation because the energy spent overcoming rotation (as in planetary take-off from before) is more than what would be used correcting a free return trajectory into a counter-clockwise orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor interplanetary insertion - always go for Counter-Clockwise. Yes it\u0027s true that you save a bit of fuel by allowing the planet to pass, and go clock-wise - but the distances are so great that you can make any reasonable correction burn to get the orbit insertion point you want in less than 20delta-v. Also, going counter-clockwise on a planet allows for one of the coolest orbital insertion maneuvers - Aero-braking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
