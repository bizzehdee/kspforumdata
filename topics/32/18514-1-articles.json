Many of the users here will not necessarily be of English-speaking background. As such, you\u0027re doing them all (and those of us who cringe at the poor English) a favour if you take the extra time (however long it takes, patience is key) to be 100% certain of the grammar and sentence structure. It\u0027s better than most, but if you ever have a look in any of the stickied threads, they speak in much more clear, concise and fluent English. It makes it easier for those of us who can to read it, and it also makes the machine translations have a better chance of not producing jumbled garbage, if the person feels the need to translate the topic using something like Google Translate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rich","CreatedById":17874,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-03T11:12:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, it is in the rules so we do not need a sticky for this.
