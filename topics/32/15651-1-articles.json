So I make an orbiting craft with ladders for him to grab onto in an attempt to get him down. During the mundane activity of waiting for their orbits to catch up, the pilot of the ship stepped out for a spacewalk. When I got the pilot back in the Kerbal I was searching for had disappeared! Now, I know there is a limit to objects, but those were my only 2 current flights! Is there a limit for the amount of Kerbils that can be in Kerbin\\\u0027s orbit or something?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Da_Dumples","CreatedById":32594,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-30T06:27:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou may have had some ship debris which counts as ojects, or he sneezed in his helmet and fell to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheDownloaderG3y","CreatedById":24212,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-30T07:58:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay on my PC the Kerbals are flying around in Space. :3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really think its funny to see a crashing Kerbal next to the Start Pod. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
