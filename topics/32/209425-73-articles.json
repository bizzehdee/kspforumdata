The next for you is as mentioned SLI support - and also consider the placement of the PCI-E 16x slot, some boards would put your graphics cards closer together than others. Then, while motherboards do vary in overclocking performance the effects are small, around 0.1 GHz of variation usually.

Any input on ASUS or Gigabyte?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEdit:\u003C/strong\u003E The reason I\u0027m not to worried about noise is because I live right next to the freeway and the train tracks, the noise is pretty constant and hasn\u0027t had any impact on my ability to sleep yet lol, but that being said I am still going to look for quieter running stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood to know about that M.2 slot I didn\u0027t know what that was about, I do want to run a SSD at some point if not right away so I can get good load times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have a case yet, since I am starting from scratch I figured I would pick a mobo with specs I like and then get a case that will fit it lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhich leads me to how exactly do I determine what will fit what? I\u0027ve kind of decided to go for a ATX full tower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain any ones opinions regarding manufacturers to consider or stay away from when it comes to mobos or cases is greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly because I got sick of ASRock\u0027s nonsense and took the cash refund and bought an MSI mobo with it, which has performed remarkably well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsus and Gigabyte are reputable manufacturers of other stuff, I don\u0027t see what could be wrong with their mobos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CaptainKorhonen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CaptainKorhonen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlright, I made some changes:\u003Cp\u003EIntel Core i5 4670K\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsus R9 270 DirectCU II\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsus H97 Plus Mobo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENoctua NH-U9B SE2 CPU cooler\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorsair CX750M V2 PSU\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EG.Skill Ripjaws 8GB RAM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAntec Three Hundred case\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B whatever HDD and DVD drive I decide to get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly costs 65\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C2\u00AC more than the setup I posted above so I could still afford it. I don\u0027t think I need the 270X as it seems that the standard 270 is easily overclocked to achieve similar performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE^2: Nevermind.

Swapped the PSU for a Corsair CX600W and the motherboard for an Asus Z97-K. As for the R9 280, I may or may not get one as I\u0027m already well over my initial budget. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
