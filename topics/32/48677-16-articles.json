But for yet unconducted experiments, it would not tell you, which they are, as their entries would only appear once you did them at least once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience results regarding plantary properties (e.g. temps, pressure and grav) should go to the map-screen\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s info buttons. Each result should feature its own entry in a sorted (and sortable) list, giving the retrieved value (e.g. 23\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C), the altitude and possibly also the co-ords. To unclutter the list, players should be allowed to hide individual entries (or discard them altogether): Select one or more entries and hit a button, labeled \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4(un-)hide\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4, which reveals all hidden entries, if none is selected.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
