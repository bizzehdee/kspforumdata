Do you think that there should be a friendly contest where HarvesteR will post what he wants each ship to achieve and then everyone on the forums can build them and have a chance of them being put into 0.17?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ddavis425","CreatedById":14725,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-07T21:29:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI voted for Squad to make them, because I\u0027d like to see the 0.17 ships to actually include the new parts that are coming \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Endeavour","CreatedById":21125,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-07T22:08:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a good idea.

However, if squad makes them they can incorporate things that has to do with the upcoming campaign and can use new parts. They can also put in purposefully bad ships to mess with the newbies \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m going to go with Squad making them.
