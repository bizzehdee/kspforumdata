I consider it a failure anytime a primary mission goal it not achieved. This can be as simple as trying to fulfill an orbit contract but failing to get the funds because I did something stupid like leaving off the antenna. I don\u0027t consider it a failure if something goes wrong in a test flight, because identifying potential problems and finding the solutions to them is the purpose of a test. I usually revert my test flights back to the VAB after I\u0027ve gained the data I need. I count it as a failure only if something goes wrong when I\u0027m flying a mission \u0022for real\u0022. I also don\u0027t need to crash or blow up to have a failure. If I complete 4 out of 5 mission goals, then not completing the 5th is a failure. I don\u0027t count game glitches or bugs as failures because those are out of my control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me failures can be in either design or execution. Failures in design rarely happen for me, perhaps 1 in 100 (after testing). Since I got past the initial learning curve, I can think of only a couple instances were I made a design error or miscalculation. For me, most errors occur in execution. For example, I have a hard landing and sustain damage, or I accidental stage when I wasn\u0027t supposed to. If I can work around the problem and still complete my goals, then I don\u0027t count it as a failure. However, if the problem causes the termination of the mission, or the scrubbing of some part of the mission, then clearly it\u0027s a failure. Although I usually use reverts to correct these mistakes, for the purpose of this poll I\u0027m counting those as failures. In that case I\u0027d say that I make some sort of mission critical execution mistake on perhaps 1 in 10 missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-29T02:10:13Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2015 02:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OhioBob\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T21:40:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy success rate?
