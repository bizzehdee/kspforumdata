I\u0027m the guy who did the Kessel run in 12 parsecs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, I\u0027ve played through the campaign, I think, 4 times now, in various versions. I\u0027ve returned Kerbals from the surface of Eve and Tylo. I\u0027ve visited every single planetary body, and returned Kerbals from everything except the sun and Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not to brag, just to show you that I\u0027ve basically done it all. But this was a pretty exciting mission, even though it all happened below 11,000 meters on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figured I\u0027d go hardcore mode on this run-through, so I have disabled save and reload. Also, science and money are somewhat reduced. So here I am, pretty early in the tech tree, and I need to earn 45 science so I can research the Stayputnik probe, and batteries, so I can at least fly by the moon. I\u0027m sort of stuck in a rut, is what I mean. I have already gotten all the science I can get from the atmosphere and from the space near Kerbin, so the only way for me to get science is to troll the various Kerbin biomes for science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027ve done the Highlands, Shores and Grasslands. The next nearest biome is the desert, and I had to fly all the way across the sea to get to it, with only the Wheesly jet engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI time-warped through some of it, I admit, but it was still strangely rewarding just to fly across the sea to a biome on Kerbin. It was exciting to go that far and land on basic wheels just to get 12 science from a few basic experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the good news is...
