There\u0027s no way they can afford to investigate each and every one of their customers: $40/customer does not stretch very far for the legal budget.

T2\u0027s product is closed-source, they do not publish the code or allow it to be examined for the same - they even expressly prohibit any attempt at reverse engineering.

And for all the assurances that we may receive (or think we have) from the current representatives of this company, what keeps the next one in power from enacting those terms in another way?
