Getting the stack to Eve takes some serious lift, but that\u0027s not really too difficult; it\u0027s just a matter of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second is the rocket plane. Make a spaceplane with plenty of wing area, and it can glide down. On the way back up, the wings are doing most of the work of offsetting the gravity, as long as you can get high enough to be out of the really thick atmosphere. Before the wipe, there were some good pictures of extremely large lifting-body planes using this method to escape from Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third option is to use mods. Not \u0022infinite fuel engine\u0022 sorts of mods, but things like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; The Kethane mod includes a jet engine that works in Eve\u0027s atmosphere, using raw kethane instead of fuel. It\u0027s not hard to make a workable spaceplane that works on Kerbin, and then substitute one jet engine for the other. Once you\u0027re in orbit you\u0027ll need to refuel, or transfer to a space-only vessel to come home. (My own return from Eve used this sort of design.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; There are mods adding zeppelin bodies and electric-powered propellers. Using these, you can easily get up above the thick part of the atmosphere, at which point the ascent is not much worse than doing it on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-10T21:15:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPol.
