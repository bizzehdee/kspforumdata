Coincidentally, at the same time, I read that atmospheric composition can be found out by looking at which gases can escape. I happen to have the equations for this bookmarked, so without further ado, here is some table of molecular weights and stuff! I scaled the distance from the sun up by 10 and the escape velocity up by \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A110 when I entered them into the equations, because otherwise pretty much nothing can have an atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oT6HiCw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022oT6HiCw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn conclusion, give Tylo an atmosphere plz.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-19T22:06:12Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2013 10:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Holo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadpangod3","CreatedById":58339,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T22:13:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think one of Jools barren moons needs an atmosphere, id love to see a Titan (isn\u0027t that the name of it?) type of atmosphere on a moon\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Holo","CreatedById":39606,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T22:25:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETylo is the barren one that\u0027s capable of supporting the most atmosphere, so it\u0027s the logical place to put it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadpangod3","CreatedById":58339,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T22:28:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think I kinda understand it, but whats CH4?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jfx","CreatedById":37282,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T22:43:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deadpangod3\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Deadpangod3\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think I kinda understand it, but whats CH4?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...Methane.
