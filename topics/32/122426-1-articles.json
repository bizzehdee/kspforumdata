I could be wrong... I might be misremembering one of the IRC chat things. Anyways, that was back in 2011 when I was just a forum lurker, and the snacks meme had yet to take off. IIRC, it really didn\u0027t hit full steam until 0.17ish, where it didn\u0027t come from any single source... I think people just heard \u0022snacks\u0022 and ran with it. Amusingly enough, if you search for my old posts in the suggestion forums back in 2012, you\u0027ll see me arguing that life support should just consist of \u0022snacks\u0022 rather than \u0022Life support should require a 200 page manual\u0022... which was about the time that \u0022snacks\u0022 as a meme really started to take off.
