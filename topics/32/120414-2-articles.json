Memory leaks in C# are quite rare. While they do happen, as with the temperature gauge, C# is a garbage collected language so any allocated memory is automatically released and recovered by the \u003Cp\u003Egarbage collector whenever the allocation falls out of scope. Unlike C\u002B\u002B where we had to manage our memory usage, it typically isn\u0027t necessary in C#. In non-GC languages like C\u002B\u002B we had dangling pointers and unreachable variables, but in languages like C#, Visual Basic, and Java, they get recovered the moment (technically, the next time GC is run) you lose track of them. The times when leaks do happen is when you have a loop running in a thread that doesn\u0027t end, as with the flashing temperature gauge. In that case the allocation never runs out of scope and rather than reusing what it had, it kept allocating new.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought so too.

Most of the memory leaks that I\u0027ve investigated in KSP have been caused by incorrect usage of the Unity API. Most objects in Unity have an underlying object pooling mechanism designed to reduce garbage creation (or shift it to scene transitions where the user won\u0027t notice the garbage collection running) and they have to be explicitly deleted, you can\u0027t rely on simply nulling a reference or overwriting it with a new reference as the object will still be referenced internally in the pooling mechanism. As an example of this, there is a memory leak in the engineer\u0027s report caused by it creating a new Unity.Mesh object for each \u0022fault\u0022 in the report and just overwriting the old references without explicitly deleting the old objects.
