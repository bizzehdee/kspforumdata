Awesome! I\u0027ve played with the new parts, and even without having done a mission, I think this is something that definitely should be made stock just because of the antennae and probe core. I see no reason why this must be kept out of the game. We all know the mod will end up going unmaintained after a few updates, just as the Bouncy-balls did. (Speaking of which, lithobraking would be aided very much by special landing-spheres using the old bouncy-ball module from that mod)\n\nThough I do have a complaint: There\u0027s not any tutorial on how to use it.
