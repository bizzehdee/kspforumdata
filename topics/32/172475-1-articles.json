Done the Retro Solar Rescue, the Jool 5, and several Eve land and return missions. Except for mundane and repetitive missions like rescues from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E and asteroid grabbing, I don\u0027t reuse rockets.

I\u0027ve never used a mod, spreadsheet, or calculator. I just use trial and error and guesswork based on experience. It was tough going at first, but it taught me a lot. And I would not trade those early experiences. Now, unless I\u0027m going to Eve, I just look at my rocket as I build it and I can kinda tell what it can do. You don\u0027t over-build, you try to make it as small as possible while\u00A0 still bringing everything you need and accomplishing your mission. I\u0027ve gotten good enough at it that I usually just make it or just miss it. And I\u0027m right more often than wrong. It always makes me feel good. And there\u0027s an element of mystery and excitement to every mission. Did I cut it too close? Will I make it, or have to mount a rescue? It\u0027s fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only drawback to this method is that my ships will almost never be as efficient as someone\u0027s with the information at hand, but I don\u0027t really mind that.

But I just never got around to it. I now moved on to New Horizons; where I\u0027ve again been demoted to rank amateur. And I\u0027m loving it. It\u0027s an absolute blast to me. Just a difference in play-style is all. However, if it were in the game, I would certainly make use of it.

However, if I were Squad, I would not put it in the stock game. You would immediately see videos posted with ships showing a certain Delta V amount, then making maneuvers and showing the numbers to be completely wrong. Veterans here on the forum would rise to their defense and explain why you can\u0027t account for everything and say \u0022you shoulda been around when we had nothing\u0022.
