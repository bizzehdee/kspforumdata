Modern fighters are unstable,I\u0027ts what makes them able to turn so quick ect.Without Fly by wire and hydraulics these planes IE The f16 could simply not fly theyd tumble out of control.So my point here is that i realized Bahh ill just add a anti sickness system.... but i realized that wont behave properly.... because it seamsto rember your roll and pich and yaw and as soon as you let go of the controls it will bring you back to how you were Before you touched the controls.... that\u0027s usefull in space but in atmosphear conditions you don\u0027t want the anti sickness system to keep reseting your noze and roll you want somthign that assists you in flight to keep the flightpath marker where you point it if you don\u0027t give input and you want it to help you manuver safely without exceeding G limits and roll limits ect.It might sound complex but if any of you have ever flown Falcon BMS you will know what i am talking about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow i was wonderign if it will be possible to have a fly by wire system later on? either by mods or added by the game devs? It would open up alot of space fighter designs that can also operate in atmosphere and space. Anti sickness for space works good enough.But we needsomthign for atmosphere flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-20T05:27:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe avionics version of the ASAS, the one shaped like a little nose cone, already does something like what you\u0027re talking about. When you stop exerting control, it just tries to keep the plane going where you\u0027ve already got it pointed. There\u0027s a little but of a lag, though, so it\u0027s not exactly what you\u0027re describing. Avionics also resists turning a little, which, as you way, helps prevent overly radical manuevering that might tumble the ship out of control. It\u0027s quite good and handy, I think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-20T11:14:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn short; we do not currently have a fly-by-wire system that allows for the ultra-maneuverable places. In future, I would love to see it, especially when we can make some incredibly speedy aircraft already.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theflyingfish","CreatedById":17741,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-20T16:49:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that the \u0022avionics package\u0022 just constrains the turning rate of the aircraft to somewhere around 5 degrees per second. It\u0027s basically an ASAS, but rather than keeping the craft pointed at a certain point it allows a small amount of wiggle room. Either that, or it regulates the maximum amount of AOA (angle of attack) to a very low amount. If it was moddable (it might be, I\u0027m too lazy to check) you could change it to allow a higher angle of attack or higher rate of turn. But if you do mod it, it would have to be tailored to each aircraft because different designs have different points beyond which their control surfaces no longer have any effect (the \u0022point of no return\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
