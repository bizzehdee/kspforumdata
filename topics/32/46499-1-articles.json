One of the things he mentioned was \u0022a system to allow experiments to output different results based on where you are on the planet\u0022. Now this on it\u0027s own doesn\u0027t mean much but if you extrapolate the way in which the game handles the data, one \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E envision the game checking the position of the craft relative to the planets\u0027 CoM and determining attributes valid for that location. Among those might be gravity, temperature, etc, but it\u0027s not out of the way to envision co-ordinates and terrain heights along with it, and if that\u0027s the case then that implementation couldn\u0027t be too far from doing the same, but in space!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know what your going to say. I\u0027m tying vague possibilities together to form a very whimsical whole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I would have to agree with you! In all likelihood the science stuff for landed craft will be tied to the planets texture and read based on the \u0027tile\u0027 of the surface your on (or closest to). But then, that still stores information about the planet in location coherently (the same cannot be said for the mish-mash way MapSat derives its data). So, whats stopping the next inevitable step towards storing terrain it in a way we can access it easily, maybe using a ray cast to the surface through he CoM, finding the closest \u0027tile\u0027 and reading it\u0027s beautiful terrain data, say from a mapping satellite? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been hoping, along with many others I imagine, for a long time for KSP to add mapping and in my eyes this is a lot closer than we\u0027ve been before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I can dream can\u0027t I.

The game was never designed to do anything so vicious and the mod does an excellent job hacking together the data to make a nice map. Unfortunately, as hacks tend to go it\u0027s complicated and CPU/RAM intensive, so it can easily blow up in your face with very small bugs if unmaintained (ring any bells?) and limits the use of time acceleration because that\u0027s just so much more strain on the already heavily loaded system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy I\u0027m so excited/hopeful about what Harv described for science is, if the game is storing data about locations on the surface coherently for specific \u0027tiles\u0027 it\u0027s not unfeasible to store a ton of terrain data in an easy to access format that doesn\u0027t involve all this interpolation about heights and distances ISA MapSat uses.

Hey, gimme your terrain data.\u0022 \u003Cem\u003EPop\u003C/em\u003E. And suddenly a pre-parsed map of that tile is now displayed in the game, no additional processing required because it was compiled back at Squad HQ. And lets say your higher up taking a bigger picture of the planet. ISA would have to do a tonnnnn more calculations because there\u0027s more map to be made. This system would just ask neighboring tiles to the one queried to hand over their data too. Cheap, simple, replicable, robust, and time acceleration safe (within reason).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut alas, I\u0027m rambling.

The closer you are the higher the resolution will be, up to a certain point anyway. One of the biggest images I\u0027ve seen is 2592x1296 Not sure what that equates to as far as km/m per pixel though. It is how ever enough to determine which landing sites are better than others.
