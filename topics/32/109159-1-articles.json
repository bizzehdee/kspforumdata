It\u0027s a matter of patience so that you are able to see tiny amounts of drift/tilt and correct them with a minimum of control input. The biggest cause of crashing RC helicopters are:\n\na) Not enough altitude for margin of error (Since you\u0027re trying to land, this isn\u0027t really something you can do anything about)\n\n![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) Overcorrecting when trying to recover from drift or tilt\n\nTo overcome these, make sure you have enough fuel to take your time when landing. To ease into it, try the following procedure:\n\n1) SAS lock on retrograde\n\n2) Trust the SAS while you burn to slow down your descent until you\u0027re at a reasonable altitude, and have around -5 meters per second surface speed\n\n3) Keep bringing down the speed until you\u0027re at 1 m/s\n\n4) SAS to stability assist\n\n5) Try to hover in a stationary position. Once you have that, tap ctrl, and it should set you down easily\n\nYes, you can probably go straight to landing from step 3, but if you learn to hover, you are able to do the rover drops later on more easily.\n\nA couple of tips:\n\n\\* If your craft is very input-sensitive, try to enable fine controls. I don\u0027t know about the default key for this, as I have mine mapped to \u0060\n\n\\* Before your landing legs touch ground, watch your navball, not your craft."},{"CreatedByName":"Daid","CreatedById":32171,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T11:10:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Except if you use too much thrust, and start going up again.
