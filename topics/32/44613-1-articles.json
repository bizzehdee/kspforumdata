It only makes sense, and I thought it was kinda obvious just from reading the patch notes (which EVERYBODY should read btw, it really saddens me when people get confused or upset with something that was changed in an update, simply because they didn\u0027t spend 5 minutes to read the patch notes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the chase camera in atmosphere was there ever since chase camera was put in the game, but it was given an incorrect name or was bugged somehow and was \u0022Orbital Camera\u0022 or something instead of \u0022Chase Camera\u0022 (thus why you probably thought it didn\u0027t exist in atmosphere until recently). I guess they fixed the naming issue in a recent patch.
