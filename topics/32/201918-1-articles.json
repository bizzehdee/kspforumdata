Just hold brake. The smallest rover wheels intended for probes are the only ones I will ever use because they are prevent me from going too fast and being killed after I fall. Sure, one my mk2 lander can rover I get 8m/s best but that\u2019s ok considering the alternative, constantly reloading when quick saves can cause unforeseen glitches.
