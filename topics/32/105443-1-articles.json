Looking around, it sort of seems that if I convert it to 1.0, I\u0027ll have to redo a lot of designs? Maybe start a new career mode and learn the difference that way?\n\nWhat do you guys who rushed out to use 1.0 think?"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T00:34:39Z","Content":"Not worth the hassle to convert - too many changes.

I landed everywhere and did everything. But long ago I accepted that this update, it\u0027s going to significantly change the game, so I quit playing for months up to this update and started a fresh new game with zero mods."},{"CreatedByName":"davidpsummers","CreatedById":108982,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T22:35:47Z","Content":"Tanks for the comments. I\u0027ve played around with space planes enough to be leary of the aerodynamic changes alone. \n\nBut I won\u0027t delete, I will actually keep my old game, and KSP 0.9, around in case I ever want to \u0022revisit\u0022."}]}
