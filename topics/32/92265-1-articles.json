Large SSTO rockets are superior to multiple stages for many reasons: easier to make fully recoverable, less risk of catastrophes (since you\u0027re not separating stages mid-flight), lower part counts, no debris, and better geometry for attachment of awkward payloads (like a space station). Unfortunately, that means you can\u0027t tweak the ascent in the design stage to mostly remove the need for throttle control, like you can for multi-stage setups.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd really, the delta-V is the entire point of the whole exercise, so you can\u0027t discount it like that. The logarithmic nature of the rocket equation means there\u0027s a HUGE difference in mass between a rocket that reaches a circular orbit on an optimal profile versus one that uses a less efficient ascent. If you\u0027re not adjusting your throttle for an ideal ascent, then you\u0027re forcing yourself to build rockets much bigger than they need to be to make up the difference, and that\u0027ll kill your payload fraction more than anything else.

Ignition usually at 50% throttle, then throttle up to 100%, followed by release of the clamps. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravity turn starts when velocity exceeds 100 m/s with a 2 degree pitch. Then i slowly pitch the rocket further over, reaching a 45 degree ascend angle at around 10.000m of altitude. The rocket continues at 45 degrees until the apoapsis is about 40 seconds in front. By pitching the rocket further towards the horizon and starting to throttle down i keep that 40 second distance as long as possible. When passing an apoapsis of about 60 km, the periapsis starts to rise above zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsually this gives you a perfect circular 85 km orbit (or higher if desired) without the need of cutting engines. As you gain horizontal velocity early with the constant thrust preventing the rocket to loose speed to gravity and drag, this way of launching seems to be very efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T12:37:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESelect the right probe core if applicable.
