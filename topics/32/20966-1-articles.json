This only occurs if I\u0027ve used the in-atmosphere timewarp, on any level (not just x4). This defeats the purpose of having the timewarp in the first place, because I know that if I\u0027m sending a rover to Minmus and i timewarp, I already know the mission is doomed when its time for re-entry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheDarkStar","CreatedById":37056,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-01T00:21:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA few things.
