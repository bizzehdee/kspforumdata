Durn. So the follow-up manned mission piloted by Bill was to do double duty; deliver a hab to get a base started next to the ADR, and take some parts to fix both the lack of fuel lines and the lack of power that had only become apparent when the ADR-1 was fired up for the first time. Well, I don\u0027t know if Bill got distracted by a loose packet of crisps floating around the lander capsule, because he usually nails his landings pretty well. Not this time. he landed with a little too much sideways velocity and one side slightly low, just sufficient to knock the ship into a spin and bounce it off the surface. Desperately, he tried to regain control, to no avail. Then he tried to make it to the hatch, but found himself pinned to his seat by the spin. Then... BOOM! RIP Bill Kerman, you will be missed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was decided to send up one of the rookie Kerbonauts, Wehrgel Kerman, in a simple one-man ship, with the sole objective of getting the ADR unit working. Wehrgel made a good landing a couple of kilometres from the ADR, then hopped his ship to within easy reach of it. Time to get out and fix things! But after an hour of trying one thing after another, nothing, fuel just would not transfer between the kethane processing unit and the fuel tanks on the ADR. Wehrgel reported back to KSC. Within half an hour, KSC had one less engineer in its ranks and was advertising the job. The engineering team rethought the ADR design from scratch, and triumphantly presented the directors with a design coming in at a little over five tonnes - about half the weight of the ADR-1 - and better balanced and more controllable to boot.; \u0027Build it;\u0027 they were told. Meanwhile Wehrgel settled in to wait for the new ADR to be sent up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome days later, the ADR-2 arrived, and landed a couple of kilometres from Wehrgel and the ADR-1. That was a bit inconvenient, but after checking that the ADR-2 was working as advertised, Wehrgel set about shifting both his ship and the ADR-1 closer to the ADR-2 - no sense risking the new unit! Once this was done, he set about cannibalising the ADR-1 to provide more solar panels and batteries for the ADR-2 as its one flaw was that it was still somewhat underpowered. Once that was done, Wehrgel admired his handiwork, then jetted up to go over to his ship - and flew straight through one of the solar panels, stunning himself in the process. Fortunately, he hadn\u0027t jetted too high, and landed with no more than a few minor bruises and a bit of a scratch on his faceplate. He then removed the directional solar cell units from his ship, replaced the broken unit on ADR-2 and stowed the spare on ADR-1. Next job was to refuel his ship, which had had barely enough fuel left for the trip back to Kerbin when it landed. This went without a hitch, so then it was just a case of waiting until Minmus\u0027 rotation was pointing Wehrgel\u0027s ship the right way, and launching straight up. A week later, Wehrgel Kerman successfully returned to Kerbin to a hero\u0027s welcome with the first sample to be returned from the surface of Minmus! Next mission will be the second attempt to land a hab unit on Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-17T23:50:31Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2014 11:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Esme\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eedited for typos\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T00:23:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI made this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i448.photobucket.com/albums/qq203/Richy_yvl/screenshot7_zpsb1f42821.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot7_zpsb1f42821.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially, it\u0027s a space station that can assemble itself in orbit to provide fuel, power, living space and a science pod all in one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T01:24:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI landed on Tylo using a combined transfer stage/single-stage lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/jltsiren/ksp/tylo_ship_4.jpeg\u0022 alt=\u0022tylo_ship_4.jpeg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing began with a stupid but harmless mistake.
