Quarter res textures, 1280x720, no AA, simple terrain and fast aero rendering (or something like that). It doesn\u0027t look bad on the 10.1\u0022 screen. Not wonderful, but not bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the launch pad with a 37 part rocket (just throwing one together real fast) it runs full speed through most of the launch, with a little slow down if viewing the ocean on most of the screen. Same up in orbit. We are talking maybe 25-35fps not viewing the ocean with these settings, around 15fps or so viewing the ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general it is pretty smooth. A really big rocket would probably bring the tablet to its knees, but the thing handled everything pretty well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did get a memory error when I went back to the desktop that system memory was low and windows had closed a bunch of running programs (email client, IE window a couple of other small programs), however it ran it within the 1.9GB of system available memory space (I didn\u0027t check how much was free while running, I suspect very little).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know that you could run mods in this memory space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing still ran though and was perfectly playable. It looked fine on the tablet. Not as nice as on my HP Envy 4t, and I doubt I could build 200\u002B part rockets like I can on my notebook, but you could probably do 100 part rockets okay (at a guess) and still be playable and NOT be odious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did notice it chewed battery power. In the half hour in the game it burned through about 10% of the battery life compared to a typical 4-6% in normal use. The back of the tablet was also modestly warm right over where I assume the CPU is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall layout and screen size wouldn\u0027t make KSP overly pleasurable, but if you need a KSP fix on the road, it\u0027ll do (with a wireless mouse anyway).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"barrenwaste","CreatedById":91899,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T05:16:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, I like that it\u0027s a portable game like that.

The Asus T100 is a 2-in-1 with a pretty nice dettachable keyboard dock.

Same mouse I use with my laptop for everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt isn\u0027t exactly playing ksp on a tablet at that point, pretty much netbook sized...but still very, very portable. I am still just in shock that it\u0027ll run it at playable settings and playable frame rates. I\u0027ll have to get it a bit more of a whirl with a larger ship at some point to see how it\u0027ll handle something in the 100\u002B part count range on a launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will say, the size makes it very akward to try to play with the T100 sitting in your lap, though I\u0027d say that would likely be true of anything sub-13\u0022 in size (my 14 inch Envy 4t is already kind of pushing comfortability sitting in my lap playing games, but it will span my lap and sit comfortably. The T100 kind of sits down in my lap if I am sitting cross legged, which isn\u0027t super comfortable).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a desk though and it works perfectly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do need to get a bluetooth game pad at some point for the thing, so that I can play some games with it as a tablet, that otherwise I\u0027d need the dock (for instance, I have FF7 PC re-release on the thing that I am having fun with, but I have to use the keyboard dock for controls, but if I had a game pad I could easily recline back with the tablet on my legs and game pad in my hands to play).

Nothing like I do on my desktop (i5-3570@4GHz and GTX750), but I think I\u0027ve hit up around 120 parts or so been been okay.

With possibly 2-4x the GPU power and at least a good 25-35% more CPU power (than my z3740) it should be able to run KSP pretty respectibly, at least if they come with 3/4GB of RAM instead of 2GB (might not be able to turn up anything past 720/768p with the GPU RAM requirements that would entail as just running the game stock uses something like 1.7-1.8 of the 1.9GiB of available RAM with zero mods at 720p). I think its a combo of GPU and CPU limitations (and RAM) here, but the much more powerful GPU should at least allow something like 768-900p at somewhat better detail settings (maybe still no AA, but maybe 1/2 res textures and medium details instead of everything turned to minimum). With the more powerful CPU, probably will allow somewhat smoother/closer to full speed physics (though that is maybe more of a GPU issue near planets) most of the time as well as somewhat larger part ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027ll still be nothing like a full laptop, let alone desktop gaming machine, but from \u0022okay and ejoyable\u0022 to \u0022nice and enjoyable\u0022. I do NOT think I\u0027d want to play this on a Bay Trail equipped laptop. The faster clocks and the slightly faster GPU would certainly help, but not nearly as much as the much larger screen will show just how low all of the details and settings are turned down to make it run okay (fine at 10.1\u0022, on 11.6-13.3\u0022...probably pretty yuck looking).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
