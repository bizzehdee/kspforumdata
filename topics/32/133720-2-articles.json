Everything was going well. Interplanetary probes to Duna and Eve were en route, and the Kerbin system had been conquered. Until I got a contract. Extract ore from Minmus and deliver it to Kerbin orbit.\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EEasy,\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EI foolishly thought, as I started planning. First, I built my mining lander. It was the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ESilent Eclipse,\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0a shuttle capable of hauling 1500 units of ore to Minmus orbit. I then landed it and started mining as I set up the rest of the operation. It was... a debacle. The\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ESilent Eclipse\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ewas unmanned and used 4 small drills, so mining took ages. I had power issues where only 3/4 drills could run at a time. Electrical storage was limited, and the only reason it ran through the night was through an accidental glitch.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was meanwhile preparing the station. I had a small station in Minmus orbit, and I added to it. I launched a double mission. One module had a few large containers to hold ore, the other module was a crewed capsule designed to dock to the \u003Ci\u003ESilent Eclipse\u00A0\u003C/i\u003Ewhen it returned to orbit. It had an engineer, giant batteries, and several solar arrays to fix the problems the ship had been having. It was at this point I realized I had used up all the Jr. Docking Ports on the ship, which was a problem since the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ESilent Eclipse\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Erequired one such port. I sent up a truss with many of the ports. Then, on that fateful day, the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ESilent Eclipse\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ereturned to the station. I docked it fine, and transferred the ore to the holding tanks. Due to me being dumb, in order to attach the upgrade to the mining lander, I needed to undock the tanks and move them. It was at this point I realized the upgrade module had no RCS, and was now floating freely. The\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ESilent Eclipse\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Echased after it as fast as a giant, lumbering ore tanker could go, but it was futile. I then tried to salvage the mission by redocking the tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it got worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my designing, I knew that the upgrade\u0027s batteries would be sufficient for both it and the tanker, and once it was on station power it wouldn\u0027t be a problem. I had no batteries on the tanks. I quickly tried to redock it, but to no avail, and I watched helplessly as its power drained to zero.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point, my engineer was freely floating in his capsule, no way of getting back to the station. My tank module, with the ore I\u0027d spent months mining, was slowly drifting uncontrollably away.
