You will anyway have to carry an large science rover.\n\nElse I agree with you about reusing the test accent stage and use two.\n\nNote if you have two cockpits on the rover you can save two copies of science to return, yes you can save in lab but you also use it to transmit. \n\nI here assume you use the lab for reusing the material lab and goo containers else it make lite sense, as normal transmit\u002B two returns will gather all science. I use an science storage module from mod instead."},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedCowboy","CreatedById":92106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T23:22:18Z","Content":"Wait, do I see the term \u0022Hyperedit\u0022 here?

You could even put wings on the rover to alow for a bit more down range control over where you land. Send your kerbal down in the rover (with engineer skill) in case you need to repair wheels after landing so he does not have to walk to it.
