That way, modders would have to update their packs to let them show in career mode, and would hopefully prompt them to mind the balance of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only situation I could see a problem with mods is in a competitive multiplayer environment, which to be quite honest is a long way away...
