The game would crash before you\u0027ve got a rocket that could ascend from that low... and then the prospect of getting that rocket to kerbin orbit, and then to Jool? nope, I say its definitely impossible wouthout cheats or non-stock parts (such as an air augmented rocket, or a nuclear thermal turbojet)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
