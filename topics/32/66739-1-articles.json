The Steam version allows you to use the In-game overlay from steam and take steam screenshots and upload them to the cloud. That is the only difference. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can copy the game file and make as many independent game files as you want. You can save as many versions as you want. If you already have a Steam account, it makes perfect sense. As of now the way you purchase it is permanent, as in no steam keys or transfers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can enjoy KSP with an average computer, but the experience is slightly better with a tricked out PC.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-25T20:58:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI never really had trouble with FPS in the demo, and I was actually on a weaker computer back then. In fact I never even experienced water lag if memory serves. The demo is less optimized, but its limitations on parts and the reduced number of celestial bodies reduce the amount of things KSP has to have in memory and effectively prevent you from building a rocket big enough to cause serious framerate problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Caelib","CreatedById":59329,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-25T21:11:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnless you\u0027re really strapped for money, I would highly recommend just buying the full game because not only is it going to run a lot more smooth than the demo, it\u0027s a lot more polished.

This is because the terrain quality has increased over the updates (and thus the gpu power required increases).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Econclusion : cpu/ram limited ?, sure it will be great. Gpu limited ?, be prepared to go beyond the minimum settings by manually fiddling with terrain settings in the .cfg limited in both ?, well if you can run the demo then you will make it.... otherwise if your demo is limiting then don\u0027t bother.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etrust me, having a laptop, I trusted people, just to find worse performance (sucky gpu)... too many people here have gaming computers....

If you have alot of parts on your rocket, this will eventually start to lag. And with the full game, you have an entire solar system to explore. This usually calls for bigger rockets than you need to get to the Mun, and thus more parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou never actually need 1000 part rockets though. They are just fun to build. (note: your computer WILL lag with a 1000 part rocket).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, I definitly recomend you buy the game. I has been giganticly improved upon since the demo, a ton of new parts, new planets and moons (including a second one right around Kerbin), and even half a carreer mode (it\u0027s in construction right now)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T16:46:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe full game contains \u003Cstrong\u003Emuch\u003C/strong\u003E more than the demo so you should reckon on specs at least as high as for that - although the 0.18 demo version doesn\u0027t suffer the \u0027ocean lag\u0027 bug of 0.23(.5). My machine played the demo fine despite not meeting the system requirements so I bought 0.22 and that was fine too.
