Go back to Gilly, where I\u0027ve already been, and transfer crew between vessels, which I\u0027ve already done. I think to myself, \u0022I\u0027ll just warp time and hopefully get that Jool or Bop contract\u0022. I do that, what do I see? Transfer crew between vessels around Ike, which I did ages ago. Warp again, \u0022Dock around Mun\u0022, already done that. It\u0027s giving me repeated contracts to do mundane tasks that I\u0027ve done before and I\u0027m not getting contracts to go any further than Duna, and it\u0027s really beginning to annoy me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corona688","CreatedById":2511,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-12T20:31:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOffering contracts to places you hadn\u0027t been before used to be a big problem.\u00A0 \u0022Landed on the mun?\u00A0 Great!\u00A0 We want Duna now.\u00A0 Your finances and tech level are irrelevant.\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWe believe in you!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSend little probes to places you want to go and it might take the hint.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s also that world firsts track/thingy in the admin building which increases the rewards for world records.\u00A0 That may help fund some exploration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-12T20:37:58Z\u0022 title=\u002212/12/2017 08:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 12, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Corona688\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mako","CreatedById":69375,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-13T09:55:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo add to what Corona688 said, if, instead of timewarping to get rid of unwanted contracts, you decline contracts the system will better learn your preferences and will generate less of the contracts\u00A0you don\u0027t want.
