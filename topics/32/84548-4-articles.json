There\u0027s a movie that simply forgets how space works beyond launch. We got shuttles with thrusters lit doing banking turns. The asteroid has strangely earth-like gravity when they throw the extension tubes for the drill aside. KSP taught me that space doesn\u0027t work like that.

Incoming spoiler alert (if you somehow haven\u0027t seen that movie from 1997!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole plot when they get on the asteroid goes like this: one of the shuttles crashed while the other survived. The crashed shuttle was intact enough that the 3 guys could get on the tank drill machine and pilot it all the way across the asteroid to the intact shuttle. About half way though this we get houston activating the nukes on the shuttles to blow up the asteroid before it can hit earth. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe get a whole scene where Bruce Willis convinces the cmdr guy to turn off the nuke. They succeed with 5 seconds to spare. This is where the plot hole is. 5 seconds later everything should have faded to white while we watch a mushroom cloud go off on the asteroid. Why? Because the other shuttle\u0027s nuke survived the crash! It is very likely that nuke survived because the armadillo tank thing from that shuttle survived. Yes. Michael Baysplosions forgot that he had a whole nother nuke worth of explosion sitting on that rock because hey... double up on everything right?

Not only was it completely bogus (He was nearly stationary relative to her, so he pretty much should have already been moving back towards her, even if his pack weighed two tons. A slight tug might not have done it, but she was giving him a good 15 seconds of focused yank, which should have been enough to shift a very considerable weight in space), but it could have been fixed very easily- just make the station have gained some spin from the debris strikes. It probably would have, too, especially if a module depressurized asymmetrically. If they\u0027d done that, not only would they have made it realistic for him to experience a force (centrifugal force) pulling him away from the station, but it would have added to the dizzying and disorientating mood of the film to have her trying to board the station while it was spinning (and deal with the forces while trying to get around inside) while probably keeping it easy enough to keep track of what was happening. \u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not just an example of movies forgetting about how physics works for creative license, its an example where the correct physics would actually have made a better movie.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edid not see the movie, but I could think of some physically correct ways of getting them in dramatic problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewe all know, if we set up a maneuver node for a rendevouz/docking, that our spaceship has some momentum relative to the target. now imagine, they had enough fuel to set up the correct maneuver, and right at the target, when they have to bring the spacecraft to a relative velocity of 0, they run out of fuel, drifting away again at very low speed. and then, in this situation, they could use their space suits to switch over to the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edoing it \u0022the kerbal way\u0022 would be even a bit more accurate (if it is possible to operate the ISS-airlock from outside) because docking is a maneuver which requres extremely high precision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe only thing would be: the majority of the audience would not understand (at first), why the highest efficiency of maneuvers is accomplished when they are really far away. maybe a few minutes of scenes during lectures where she was would help to give the audience a grasp of how mechanics work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"psyper","CreatedById":90641,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-02T08:18:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eperhaps flashbacks of when she was training and they are teaching her orbital mechanics\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-02T09:04:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerbMav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerbMav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENevertheless the director factored in the brains of his audience?! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Star Trek answer to this would be a special converter that takes the heat and does something with it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, or more probably believe the radiators was solar panels, they would be thiner than wings and black and satellites and IIS has solar panels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that the original matrix idea was that the matrix used human brains for storage or and part of the computing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was too complicated for the director who came up with the heat idea who is totally idiotic and most know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact I guess the average sci-fi viewer know more science than the average director.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ratchet freak","CreatedById":119895,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-02T09:17:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022psyper\u0022 data-cite=\u0022psyper\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eperhaps flashbacks of when she was training and they are teaching her orbital mechanics\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor just flashback of her playing KSP \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-02T09:48:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerbMav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerbMav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe Star Trek answer to this would be a special converter that takes the heat and does something with it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInconsistently, forgotten about whenever the plot demands it, and with implications that shatter the logic of the setting entirely if considered in any depth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cem\u003EStar Wars \u003C/em\u003Eanswer would be to turn a dumping-the-waste-heat scene into a very bad videogame tie-in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EBlake\u0027s 7\u003C/em\u003E would have just let everyone cook to death.
