At 36k, lock to Orbit prograde until you hit 100k AP (or fly it manually).\n\n5) Circularise at AP (although I\u0027ve heard thats inefficient).\n\nThats it! Ideally, when the marker switches from surface to orbit (about 36k) your rocket should more or less already be facing orbit prograde. You\u0027ll probably have to adjust inclination a bit, but other than that let it fly itself.\n\nIf you turn too slowly (ie have a large circularisation burn) turn down your engines thrust in VAB. If you turn too fast (don\u0027t make it) turn it up.

I\u0027ve read on these forums that taking vacuum dV and accounting for drag, you get an atmospheric dV 15 to 20% less.

By the time i finish this turn the ship already has ~100 m/s speed and an altitude of roughly 1200m. I turn off SAS and let it slowly do its gravity turn, lowering throttle so that my Ap also stays within less than a minute, usually keeping a 1.6-1.8 TWR does the trick. I don\u0027t touch anything except the throttle until i reach 35km altitude, when the surface speed switches to orbit. Note that when the switch occurs, the surface prograde marker \u0026 orbit prograde marker are nearly in the same place. There is little to no deviation between them. I\u0027ve noticed that this is extremely important. After 35km i turn on SAS (have a pilot follow prograde if available) and continue to burn with very low thrust until desired Ap.\n\nFor 100km Ap, the burn lasts throughout the entire atmosphere, then coast to said Ap and circularize.
