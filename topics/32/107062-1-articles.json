If I am correct MechJeb gives you atmpospheric dV, which is difficult to plan for during the building stage, so I\u0027ve been using the vacuum dV values provided by KER. I\u0027ve read on these forums that taking vacuum dV and accounting for drag, you get an atmospheric dV 15 to 20% less. Using your 3000 m/s, that would be vacuum dV of around 3.5km/s\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DJK","CreatedById":114951,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T23:41:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, 3000 dV vaccum seems a bit too little.. however, 3000 atmospheric is probably right. I\u0027ve been needing roughly 3680 m/s vaccum to 100x100 orbit (de-orbit burn included, roughly 45-50 m/s dV vacc), which translates to 3100 atmospheric.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy rockets have a 1.25 TWR on the pad and i do a 3-5 deg. turn @ 50 m/s. By the time i finish this turn the ship already has ~100 m/s speed and an altitude of roughly 1200m. I turn off SAS and let it slowly do its gravity turn, lowering throttle so that my Ap also stays within less than a minute, usually keeping a 1.6-1.8 TWR does the trick. I don\u0027t touch anything except the throttle until i reach 35km altitude, when the surface speed switches to orbit. Note that when the switch occurs, the surface prograde marker \u0026amp; orbit prograde marker are nearly in the same place. There is little to no deviation between them. I\u0027ve noticed that this is extremely important. After 35km i turn on SAS (have a pilot follow prograde if available) and continue to burn with very low thrust until desired Ap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor 100km Ap, the burn lasts throughout the entire atmosphere, then coast to said Ap and circularize. Note that when the Ap reaches 100km, the Pe is somewhere around 25km in the atmosphere already, needing less than 100 m/s dV vacc. to circularize. That leaves me with ~50 m/s dV to de-orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Violent Jeb","CreatedById":130681,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T00:00:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb will give both different readings atmo and vac so i\u0027m probably referring to atmospheric.

I always fly almost directly up or 5 degrees at the most during this time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the first 7000m (give or take), the average ship @1.5-2.0 will encounter 200-500 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B5m/s - almost half a m/s being wasted. If you go above this, the resistance makes the craft very hard to control (turn) with so much force acting against it. So anything above 200m/s during the first 7km is not efficient - so much so that I usually dial engines back to keep my speed under 200m/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the first atmospheric \u0022zone\u0022, the craft can still be quite prone to tipping if you don\u0027t have fins or SAS/monoprop. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter you\u0027ve cleared this you should have your Ap approaching 1 minute away - and climbing fast. \u003Cstrong\u003EThis is the key. \u003C/strong\u003EBurning with your apoapsis more than 1 minute away means that you are constantly burning in a less efficient spot (especially for turning). 1m is arbitrary, obviously the closer you can get to burning on the Ap is better but I find 1m gives you nice room for correction. As you turn, the time to Apoapsis will slow - keep turning until it remains under 1 minute. Usually by around 20km I am only 20-30 degrees from completely horizontal. At 25km your wind resistance has fallen to less than 1/10th what it was during the first zone, So it doesn\u0027t hurt you because you\u0027re saving big-time by keeping your turn within 60s of the AP at all times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find that by 40-50km, I have begun to fly \u0022into the red\u0022 on the navball, just to keep my time to Ap less than 60s.

At this time I cut the engines, and do 2 or 3 small burns within 10s of the Ap, directly horizontal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got a few different crafts up with VERY close to 3000m/s to 0.0 circular orbit, 70-73km.
