After almost eight hours of game play and nearly two hours of very subtle adjustments when within 100 meters of the target, just when I thought my ports were bugged, I switched to controlling from the station, made a very small SAS adjustment and wallah, it snapped to that glorious extended view that indicates docking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, let me know what you think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0v3z8SY.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220v3z8SY.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Landge","CreatedById":57671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T14:59:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E IMPRESSIVE SIR!

I was building my station and sent up my fuel reserve tank - big orange tank with a large RCS tank, battery, probe control and Sr. docking port on one end and a poodle engine on the other, with 4 docking ports on the side and 4 RCS thrusters near the docking port (poor thinking on my part). It seemed impossible to dock due in large part to the poor RCS placement: any thrust at all would throw off the docking port position. So I finally stopped, parked it about 100m from the station and undocked my empty crew module (escape pod/station keeping craft). I flew that over and easily docked with one of the side ports on the tank. With the new combined ship I disabled all the RCS ports on the fuel tank and the reaction wheel to turn it into dead weight. I then set it to control from my command pod and used it as a tug to dock the fuel tank in just a few minutes with an almost picture perfect approach. Lesson learned, the ship makes all the difference when docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately I may be back there again. I was already courting trouble bringing up the permanent habitat module to the station, it is intended to dock to my center axis and has the docking port, a hitchhiker pod and a cupola module. Problems already started in that the module was 2 tons more then what my delivery system normally carries (everything so far has reused the design and testing I did for the crew module) so after a failed launch I had to add an addition fuel tank for the booster. I got to the station a little light on fuel but in good shape. Because of the cupola on top the plan for docking was a bit different - I put a Jr. docking port on the side of the hitchhiker module so it could be carried into position by a tug. My tug was a mostly untested micro ship - a regular docking port attached to a small RCS tank lined with 4 RCS thrusters and solar panels, in turn attached to a tiny probe and battery and then a Jr. docking port. This way the tug could be used to clamp and tug with either port type, and served as an adapter when docked. There have been a lot of issues trying to do the docking mission - I didn\u0027t put a light near the port so its hard to see, I can\u0027t seem to get it set as a target until I\u0027m real close (which is an issue), and by itself the tug is so tiny that even with fine controls it whips around at the tiniest thrust. And the Jr. port is on the top, so it flys backwards if I want to use it that way (I think I can fix that with control from here).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AIux","CreatedById":80197,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T13:48:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also testing to see if my sig works, I know, I\u0027m sorry.
