All stock, no Mechjeb, and only burning engines at 100%. I achieved a circular orbit around Kerbol at an altitude of about 6,472,000 km (for reference, Kerbin\u0027s SMA is about 13,600,000km). I picked 6,742,000 because the orbital period is 1/3 of Kerbin\u0027s, which seemed like a nice number, and the radius was about half where I launched from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch, and escaping Kerbin all went to plan. There was a slight glitch in the mission when I realized my two radial-mounted RCS tanks weren\u0027t draining at the same time, throwing off the center of gravity. I had to purposefully drain them both to even things out, leaving me with just a single tank in the center for the rest of the trip (it came in quite handy later).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I got in my target circular orbit and ran some numbers, it looked like I might be a few hundred delta-v short for a successful return, but I decided to give it a show anyways. I burned to raise my Ap back to Kerbin\u0027s altitude, and got an intercept right where I thought it should be*. My Kerbin Pe was 65,000 km due to some inclination in the orbital plane, but everything else was right on. Once I got in Kerbin\u0027s SOI, I started burning to circularize. Once I started lowering the opposite end of my orbit towards home, my engines cut off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had run out of fuel with something along the lines of a 65,000 by 50,000 near-polar orbit around Kerbin. Luckily, I had that one full tank of RCS fuel left. Using just RCS, I dropped my Pe down to about 40k (nicely inside the atmosphere) and aerobraked the rest of the way down. By the time I was suborbital, I had no fuel and about 1/4 of a single RCS tank left. Cutting it close, but managed a safe splashdown with a MET of just over 100 days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just wish I had taken some pictures, but I did leave a set of empty tanks orbiting Kerbol below 7 billion meters, so there\u0027s something to remember the mission by. Attached is a pic of the ship that I was flying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*With a little bit of trigonometry, you can figure out exactly when to burn to get home. To go from a 6,472,000 km circular orbit back to Kerbin, start burning prograde when the purple KSC marker is around 4 degrees below the horizon on your attitude indicator. In the map view, Kerbin should be about 65 degrees ahead of you in the orbital plane, or about 115 degrees behind where you plan to intercept it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-11T22:29:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d already posted this as a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/19152-video-Kerbals-go-Clubbing-%28nightclub-now-with-rockets%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eseparate thread\u003C/a\u003E, so hope you don\u0027t mind me positing it in here too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission: Go Clubbing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epre-mission:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built a night-club on the launch pad using the aviation lights pack and made a vid. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FY3h6l.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FY3h6l.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMain Mission:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reaction was \u0022get that to Mun\u0022.
