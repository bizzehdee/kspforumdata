However, I cannot figure out the temperature of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere.

I also cannot figure out the method the wiki proposes. Does anyone have a set of equations that governs Kerbin\u0027s temperature? Right now, I am not including day night temperature fluctuations into this program.

Is there an equation which governs density? Also, to clarify, my program is not intended to determine heating on reentry. Instead, based on the craft\u0027s current orbit, my program will determine the best periapsis to change to for the least g-forces on reentry with a user defined amount of skip reentries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
