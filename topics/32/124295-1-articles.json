I imagine that this allows for the planning, building and execution of more futuristic missions, including the replication of various missions depicted in Hard-SF, STL interstellar travel-themed novels such as The Songs of Distant Earth or Murasaki. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I want to send 100 kerbals, let\u0027s say, to Nix, a planet with slightly higher gravity and the same atmospheric pressure as Kerbin, which orbits the Abbadon star. The kerbals will set up a colony, so they probably won\u0027t return, yes, this is an one-way mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is self-explanatory that the ship will have to be assembled in orbit. Everything else is open.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, what is the ideal type of ship which I could use in such an interstellar mission. This is supposed to be realistic, so no Alcubierre drives, Warp drives or Stargates. Should I use ion engines, the Orion drive (Yep, there\u0027s a mod for that), nuclear engines or convertional rockets?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1. Propulsion\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIon engines: In conjunction with a nuclear reactor, they will probably work, especially for the finer maneuvers - in interstellar space, the \u0022finer maneuvers\u0022 may still require hundreds of meters of DV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrion/Medusa/other big nukes: They have got lots of power, but the problem is that, since I want to keep it realistic, I don\u0027t want to irradiate Kerbin after departing (Unless I will decide that my storyline is that Kerbin is dying after a nuclear war and the colony consists of a few survivors, of course then there is no more point in not using an Orion drive in LKO.), this means that I will probably need another method of acceleration for leaving Kerbin orbit (normal nukes, chemical rockets or ion engines).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConvertional nuclear engines: Can maybe used for larger maneuvers or for acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChemical/Monoprop rockets: Giant rockets consisting of thousands of liters of liquid fuel and tons of SRB\u0027s will of course be the way of launching the whole stuff into space. Remember, the ship will be so big that one \u0022small\u0022 module will have to be launched with a rocket even bigger than the N1. Chemical rockets can be used for orbital maneuvers, chemical rockets or large monopropellant engines will be used to turn the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolar sails: I imagine solar sails can be used for the initial acceleration phase and for helping with the deceleration when arriving in the Abbadon system. After that, they\u0027ll probably be just dead weight, so they will likely be dumped. I say solar sails and not single solar sail because i will need lots of them to actually reach something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravity assists: The black hole...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerobraking/Aerocapture: Will probably not work because the ship is too big and will likely break apart during reentry, even with thousands of struts. If I will use it, then it will probably be in the final braking phase since aerobraking at interstellar speeds is not very healthy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Mission profile\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow should I combine the propulsion methods to create an effective mission profile? I could use a generation ship and a complicated route which takes up several thousands of years, but I could also accelerate to near-lightspeed and wait for a couple of months (which will turn into minutes for me because of timewarp, but still be extremely boring for the kerbals), and of course any profiles inbetween are allowed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI imagine that the solar sails will only be used as emergency propulsion if the main engines fail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA mission profile I have thought up of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship \u0022MSS Endeavour\u0022 will assembled in orbit from large modules which will be launched using giant rockets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship has a length of more than 1000 meters. The rear part contains of a large propulsion module which takes up the biggest part of the ship and consists of large stacks of orion engines as well as the nuke containers. Several acceleration stages consisting of massive SRB stacks as well as liquid fuel tanks are placed behind the nuclear stage that will be used for maneuvering within the Kerbol system. The propulsion module also contains a nuclear reactor that will be used in deep space when solar energy is unavaliable. The main propulsion module is separated from the middle part by a large shield that will protect the rest of the ship from irradiation. The middle module contains lots of ion engines for inner-system maneuvers and course corrections or as an emergency propulsion system. It also contains massive xenon tanks. The front part of the middle part contains life support systems, solar panels as well as docks and hangars for shuttles and landing craft. The front part of the ship is dedicated to habitats, laboratories, workshops, the bridge of the ship and farming and hydroponics modules. The ship rotates constantly to create an artificial gravity effect. The front part also includes solar sails which can be used if all means of propulsion will fail or to assist the convertional propulsion systems if a partial engine failure occurs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter being assembled and fueled, the ship will receive its crew and passengers. The spaceplanes that will be used to crew the MSS Endeavour will also be used for landing on Nix. After the final system checks are completed, the ship will be brought onto a higher orbit using the ion engines. Then, the first booster stage will ignite that will eject the MSS Endeavour out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI. The second booster stage will be used to lower the periapsis of the MSS Endeavour so that it will pass only thousands of kilometers above Kerbol\u0027s surface, where the third booster stage is ignited which will push the apoapsis above Kerbol\u0027s SOI. Maybe a flyby of some planet (maybe even Kerbin?) is made before the Orion drives are ignited. They will fire in turns so that acceleration will be constant, the crew maybe will be placed in hibernation if this is not possible since having quickly variable gravity is not very comfortable. After the ship is placed onto a trajectory towards the Abbadon system, the orion drive is deactivated and the crew can return to the habitat, which rotates to cause 1 g. Several years of flight time will pass until the MSS Endeavour approaches the Abbadon system. The orion drives are used for deceleration, and the periapsis around Abbadon is set very low to perform the opposite procedure as when leaving the Kerbol system. The main propulsion module is jettisoned to prevent irradiation of the system, it will plunge into Abbadon. The ship is placed on a trajectory which uses several gravity assists to further decelerate it until the Nix system is reached. The ion engines are used for orbital capture, maybe a risky aerobrake in which the irradiation protection shield is used as a heatshield, is used. After entering a low equatorial orbit, the depleted ion propulsion module is jettisoned. A probe is sent to decide whether Nix is habitable enough for the instant creation of a colony or if subterranean facilities or habitation domes need to be built first. If habitation domes or underground bases will really be needed to be built, the MSS Endeavour sends a signal to Kerbin and remains a space station in Nix orbit while the surface is explored by research teams and the crew of the Endeavour hopes for a second ship with supplies to arrive. If the planet is habitable and the air is breathable, the shuttles are sent down which contain various supplies to build primitive houses. The MSS Endeavour has got oxygen and supplies for up to 50 years after arriving in the Nix system. The population will be transferred to the surface within several years, and all empty modules are dismantled and used as construction materials for the surface colony. The MSS Endeavour is gradually dismantled while the population of the colony increases. If the foundation of a surface colony is impossible, the crew of the Endeavour will have to wait for the supply ship arriving from Kerbin and eventually exploit the planets of the Abbadon system to gain Oxygen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission can be aborted before reaching interstellar speeds and leaving Kerbol\u0027s SOI. The booster stages and the orion and ion propulsion systems are used to neutralize the velocity of the MSS Endeavour and bring it back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStoryline elements for an AAR:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Various factions on the station, maybe even resulting in the separation of the MSS Endeavour into two or more parts upon entering Nix orbit. Formation of various countries on Nix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Population explosion. Something went wrong and the kerbals started reproducing while still in interstellar space. The Captain calculates that there is not enough oxygen for everybody to survive until arriving in the Abbadon system. May involve mass executions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A self-destruct switch which allows the Captain to terminate the mission if a rebellion starts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Irreparable engine damage. The MSS Endeavour is stranded on a trajectory that leads into deep space, into the wrong star system or on a plunge into the black hole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A war breaks out on Kerbin while the ship is in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Life on Nix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A virus infects the population.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Aggresive, intelligent life in the Abbadon system. The crew and passengers of the MSS Endeavour must struggle to find a safe place in the system without being destroyed by a massive array of defense sattelites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think of my ideas?

It has a few drawbacks -- it introduces a resource-based \u0022Waste Heat\u0022 system that is separate from the native thermal model, it has a huge number of parts, which might be a problem if you are low on RAM, and how to make things work isn\u0027t always immediately apparent. However, it still has a reasonable implementation of nuclear fusion-based reactors and spaceship drives which can go the (interstellar) distance. Best choices are either the VISTA inertial confinement fusion drive or a fusion reactor with magnetic nozzle; either way can yield megameters of delta-V on a properly designed craft. Recent versions of the mod let you continue to thrust while the ship is unfocused, which is pretty convenient -- getting up near lightspeed requires that you burn for weeks and months rather than minutes and hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also suggest looking at the Deep Freeze Continued mod.
