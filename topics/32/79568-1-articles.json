I normaly hit the SOI at 3-4k orbital velocity. If I aimed for a very low pass that gives me around an hour or so to cross the SOI. If your ship cant bleed of 3kdV in an hour youve got seriously more patience than I do as your willing to accept a miniscule TWR. I recently designed a ship that took jeb to moho and back without useing nukes. Transfer and deceleration stages actualy used poodles of all things. Ship wasnt much more than a standard pod siting on a small fuel tank with a 909 on the other end by the time jeb got back but he was able to carry 3 goos and materials out there along with the other science packages.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T05:44:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022merendel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022merendel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E but he was able to carry 3 goos and materials out there\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMmm, three goos. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(Simpsons reference)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Landge","CreatedById":57671,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T11:47:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022technion\u0022 data-cite=\u0022technion\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell played on the landing.
