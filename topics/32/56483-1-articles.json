When a programmer initializes a variable, your computer allocates a certain number of bits for that variable (the number of bits depends on the data type, whether it is a whole number, a number with decimal places, a letter, or what have you). What an optimization might look like in this case, would be a programmer using a smaller sized data type (perhaps a 16 bit variable instead of a 32 bit variable) for the same variable, since that variable will never exceed the new (and therefore certainly not the old) limit (if you want to know how much a variable can hold, the equation is (2^(number of bits))). This reduces the amount of memory that the game takes up, and therefore (in a game like KSP) would allow the player to build and fly larger ships, cause bigger explosions, or whatever the optimized variable affected without lagging the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
