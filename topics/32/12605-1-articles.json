I sort of endorse this notion, but between the slapdash Wile E. Coyote engineering that this game explicitly encourages, and the Buzz Lightyear vibe of the characters themselves, this game has all of the slapstick of those old film reels of wacky (and unworkable) airplane designs that they always play when someone\\\u0027s doing a documentary on the Wright Brothers. I was looking at some sequence of screenshots, and I thought it would be a blast to put some of that rinky-dinky piano stuff to a clip of Kerbal creations blowing up, flying off in unexpected directions, falling over flat on the pad, and so forth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, I\\\u0027ve had launches where one of my boosters just falls off, FALLS THE F**K OFF, leaving me in a world of hurt and etcetera.

And now that I\\\u0027ve played with the fixed camera mod, it is really enjoyable to switch to one of those views and watch my whole rocket shake like a three-day drunk. One recent launch I did, I re-launched about six times with various canards and strakes tried out because inevitably, the moment I detached my SRBs my ship would enter a near-perfect axial spin, which I\\\u0027ve never seen happen before, and I COULD NOT get rid of it.
