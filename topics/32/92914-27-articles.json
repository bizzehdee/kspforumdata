You can mitigate this a bit by watching for your shadow. Make sure you\u0027re not coming down on the dark side or right at local noon. I use Kerbal Engineer and I ignore the height readings because shadows are more intuitive. This sounds like you\u0027re in \u0022orbit\u0022 mode instead of \u0022surface\u0022 mode. It\u0027s a very common problem. The game *usually* switches automatically but sometimes it doesn\u0027t. Weird.

I normally play with quite a few mods, but not whilst testing the basic game. I also have several hundred hours of play time* under my belt, and I know well about looking for ones shadow, and I was in surface mode - I always switch to that mode once my horizontal velocity is reasonably small compared to my vertical velocity. I repeat - the game NEEDS an altitude over surface indication of some sort, and a clear indication of whether ones vertical speed is negative or positive whether it be an on-board altimiter or an option to have Gene Kerman give you the readouts in a pop-up window if you request it. IMHO. *seriously. I know some of you can scarcely credit that anyone with THAT much experience can still find landing on the Mun a trial, but it is indeed so. Mind you, I did spend rather a lot of time happily puttering around Minmus by land in one game a couple of versions back (had a full-blown base and several outposts set up :-) ). Anyway, call me a slow learner if you will,but I\u0027ve only once reached Duna and Eve (both with probes) and recently a not very close fly-by of Jool recently. Minmus I have covered. I can do orbital rendevous passably well, now. Tackling the Mun feels like taking an X-wing against the Death Star to me. Well, not quite that bad, but I really do not like attempting manned landings there unless I know the site I\u0027m aiming for is more or less flat - because I\u0027ve already landed a probe there.

Similar to unlocking probe cores with SAS, you should have to try landing a few times without knowing your altitude before unlocking a radar altimeter. It could even be paired with a mapping science experiment part.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis works in .90. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37128-0-20-Bucky-s-Instruments-v0-0-4-RAD-ALT-and-VSI-update\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37128-0-20-Bucky-s-Instruments-v0-0-4-RAD-ALT-and-VSI-update\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fahmiy123","CreatedById":109858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T02:21:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kithylin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kithylin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnything above 200 part count is going to start eating in to your FPS, badly. This is a long-running flaw with the game. You have several options: 1.) Build a smaller ship with less parts, 2.) Invest in a haswell-core CPU (Intel, search into it) which seem to be the best for KSP, or get a slightly faster computer in general. My machines don\u0027t drop below 60 FPS launching unless I get in the 400\u002B part count region.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHere is my rig\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/10868141_10202920989658979_1255465957397246740_n.jpg?oh=6a12d3d28a5ad40acb9637ce0abf63f1\u0026amp;oe=5505C1A9\u0026amp;__gda__=1429749060_3b89fdd8f9f6487d7e58e5882d2e3207\u0022 alt=\u002210868141_10202920989658979_1255465957397246740_n.jpg?oh=6a12d3d28a5ad40acb9637ce0abf63f1\u0026amp;oe=5505C1A9\u0026amp;__gda__=1429749060_3b89fdd8f9f6487d7e58e5882d2e3207\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
