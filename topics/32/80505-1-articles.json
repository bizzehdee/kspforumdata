Of course, I\u0027ve never sent a Kerbal there because I know I couldn\u0027t get them back, so I don\u0027t actually know, but I can\u0027t see why it would kill anyone.

The planet/moon with the highest bodycount in my games would have to be the Mun, because I went there first and several Kerbals died in the process, and also because in my latest playthrough I was careless tried to land on the dark side without lights.
