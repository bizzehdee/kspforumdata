Fuel lines and struts were reworked, and it was time to launch for orbit. That wasn\u0027t difficult, and the last lifter stage was dropped on a just-about-suborbital path. The ship finished circularisation on the LV-Ns.

Apparently, I had gotten the wrong end of the tangent, and I didn\u0027t really have a Dres transfer window at all. So, I timewarped until I did. At this time, some kind of mystical event must have occurred, as the stars aligned and I had almost simultaneous Dres, Duna, Jool and Eeloo transfer windows. Unfortunately, having only one manned (and one unmanned) interplanetary mission under my belt and under 160 hours play time, I was in no way confident enough in my skill to launch three or more simultaneous interplanetary missions.

So, thinking that the near-identical gravity on two airless bodies was enough to imply identical descent paths, I detached the lander at a 10km orbit and began to descend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/2ZHr6l.png\u0022 alt=\u00222ZHr6l.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis didn\u0027t go as planned. After a couple of attempts, quickloading back to before detaching from the transfer stage, I decided that there was clearly some difference I wasn\u0027t seeing. I didn\u0027t particularly want to lower my orbit much further (7km is where the timewarp gets even further restricted for Dres), and I knew the ion lander had a lot of delta-v. I was also confident that it could ascend to orbit on its own. Furthermore, the transfer stage was only a little over half-empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/7Vc7Ln.png\u0022 alt=\u00227Vc7Ln.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I landed on it. No landing legs, a top-heavy ship landing directly on the end of a Jumbo-64 tank that can only really steer with RCS, but it still worked first time - for a given value of work. I forgot to retract solar panels when the at-that-point-completely intact ship fell over, and two of them were smashed off. I retracted the panels, undocked, rolled the lander into an upright position and deployed its landing legs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/jt8bvk.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jt8bvk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen Jeb took down a couple of reports, picked up a surface sample and planted a flag. Now it was time to test my confidence in the ascent. With twenty percent of the solar panels missing, could the DresIon lander get back to orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/pQMPPx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pQMPPx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was a bit of a chore, but yes.

Twice. The first landing attempt worked well, but the lander came to rest on a slope (what I didn\u0027t realize, until it actually touched the ground), from which I failed to launch again - after throttling up the lander tipped over and I could not get it upright anymore. Nevertheless, I retried (from a quicksave with lander still attached to my munar orbital station), and this time, although just landing a few meters from the previous spot, everything worked as planned, probably because this time I switched on thrusters before attempting the launch. Bob brought back some interesting surface samples, and nice seismic data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next target will be the twin craters. Afterwards I\u0027m going to refill the xenon and liquid fuel tanks of the munar orbital station.
