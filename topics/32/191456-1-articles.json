After almost a 1000 hours played and still played, KSP got me into watching history documentaries about space, watching Scott Manly documentaries beyond KSP, watching Neil deGrass Tyson stuff, reading things on line.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom all this reading and watching stuff online about space and spaceflight, IMO the greatest spacecraft in the history of mankind and the advancement of space is Sputnik. Sadly not an American craft.\u00A0While I am a proud American and the wonders of the American space program are truly wonders and incredible achievements, Sputnik is the true champ when weighing all factors such as politics, technology available at the time,\u00A0\u00A0being first and the affect on history. While landing on that moon is incredible no doubt, just seems sputnik made \u00A0bigger change in history than Apollo11.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout Sputnik, there would have been no Apollo11 mission or Atlas rockets or Centaur upper stages or a space shuttle.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that said about the greatness of Sputnik place in history am disappointed in the Sputnik representations in KSP (At least in career mode). The way Sputnik is done in KSP \u00A0in game career mode \u00A0\u0022Stayputnik\u0022 almost pointless because other better tech comes first and if try to use \u0022Stayputnik\u0022 right away as obtained, its almost impossible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSputnik was on a multi-stage rocket and there was an airfoil triangular\u00A0cap(Airstream Protective Shell)\u00A0around the dome payload . \u00A0KSP would have one believe that Sputnik was launched from the pad as you would see the ball satellite orbiting.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStaysputnik in KSP should at a minimum include a aerodynamic protective shell for launch, and the required radial/inline decouplers should be tech tree available same time as Stayputnik.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHail Sputnik\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022HighFlight-Sputnik5.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002275.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u0022900\u0022 src=\u0022http://fly.historicwings.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/HighFlight-Sputnik5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Naten","CreatedById":70923,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-13T00:30:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that the Stayputnik should have an option to have its mounting base act as a decoupler, much like the spherical pods from Making History.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-13T14:03:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I appreciate the sentiment, I think there is gameplay to be considered. The tech tree doesn\u0027t make much sense from a historical spaceflight PoV, what with manned command modules coming before probe cores and high-performance rockets before jets. It does however make sense from a gameplay PoV. It\u0027s not perfect for sure but as it is, it does give a pretty decent gameplay progression. Early on your challenge is to design a rocket that\u0027s structurally sound, aerodynamically stable, and has a streamlined payload; later on you get more complex challenges as for example the aerodynamics problem is no longer a concern what with procedural fairings and probe cores or pilots that can track prograde or what have you.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yeah, KSP is primarily a game, not a hardcore rocket simulator, let alone history of rocketry simulator. If it\u0027s gotten people interested in space exploration, rockets, and the history of how we did it IRL, then it\u0027s already done its job.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
