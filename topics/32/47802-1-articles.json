Lander lands, end of mission. IP ship reaches it\u0027s destination, job done. But some of them have functions that actively assist other ships, and don\u0027t have any set mission, just be there when you need them. So what\u0027s the most useful ship in your fleet?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have this problem where I focus both of my braincells on one problem, and forget about another problem entirely. This is usually in the form of launching a solar powered ship, and time-warping before I remember to extend the panels, resulting in a sleek, well engineered orbiting ship with zero power. Happens all the time. Or worse, I send up a ship with no power generating capability at all. But rather than revert my missions, I\u0027ve built and launched a few Orbital Recovery probes. They are just a big ball of RCS, RTG\u0027s and docking ports, that either reside on one of my space stations, or just floating about in their own orbit. When I find I\u0027ve left a ship dead in space, I send one of these probes over to it, latch on, give it a bit of power and some RCS if needed, and send it on it\u0027s way. I find them to be super useful, and use them more than any other utility craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made two models, a regular sized docking port one, and a large docking port one.
