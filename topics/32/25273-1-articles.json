Some people came up with the math. I would say that it might make sense with Pol but im not sure, certainly something you could experiment with to see how the Delta V works out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T17:47:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELaythe is so close to Jool that lowering your Pe in respect to Jool prior to the burn will not produce enough gain from the Oberth effect to make the exercise worthwhile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust wait until Laythe is at the right ejection angle for the transfer and make your transfer burn directly from low orbit around Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-04T11:13:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2013 11:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by RoboRay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T07:52:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat Roboray said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso questions like these can usually be answered by playing around with maneuver nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
