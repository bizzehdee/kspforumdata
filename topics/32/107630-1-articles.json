They have always taken us into consideration when developing the great new features and I think that is really amazing. \n\n[rant] I must say I am rather dissapointed that squad pushed the release through so hard. I can\u0027t imagine anyone in the community would have minded if they had waited another month or two (before starting to hype people) to bring out a release-worthy version. I THINK IT\u0027S A HUGE MISTAKE TO BRING OUT A GAME IN THIS STATE. Dice did it with BF4, Creative Assembly did it with Total War Rome 2 and it is always a big dissapointment for the new players. Admittedly SQUAD did a much better job than most producers but still, it just makes a bad impression upon all the new players. I mean two updates in, what, two weeks? It\u0027s ridiculous, almost as bad as the big game developers. Honestly, why not bring out a .99 version and let us dedicated beta and pre-beta players test it. Nobody in the \u0022outside world\u0022 would have known, no bad press, no complaint\u0027s and a week or two later they could have brought out a truly release worthy version. Isn\u0027t that what we have been doing all these years? The Dev\u0027s over at squad bring out a shiny new release with a few little problems, we tell them about a few things that we don\u0027t like, they tell us why they did it and/or fix it. Why give this release to the new, paying players. Now there\u0027s lot\u0027s of hate and animosity towards this lovely game. Which is quite understandable as this was the 1.0 release version and players have a right to expect a polished product. Simple things like \u0022Why don\u0027t we have suitable LF only tanks for our LF only LV-Ns? Why not let the 3 year old community help decide what the correct amount of reentry heating is? Why aren\u0027t there any dedicated radiator parts? [i find it silly that I have to cool my LV-N\u0027s with wings?! on my tanks/engines]) I mean I realize that it would have maybe taken a few weeks to do all this but it would have made a much better impression on new players.

I think you should, everyone should.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause it\u0027s the quietest I have ever seen it, sure there\u0027s old bugs but few are major, there\u0027s new bugs but again they aren\u0027t insurmountable, what we\u0027re mostly seeing are issues with installs, drivers, missing DirectX components, conflicts with other software...\n\nKSP is in *pretty good shape*.\n\nBut what we are seeing is complaints over *the aero and thermal defaults*, not bugs in these areas, they are working fine, but the defaults are not how some players would like.\n\nMost players *like* things like they are currently, and are adapting to the new systems and default values in the game, we\u0027re seeing players figure out how to orbit again, how to SSTO spaceplane again, and they are enjoying themselves.\n\nIt\u0027s a game, it\u0027s not a 100% accurate simulator and it isn\u0027t supposed to be, so rather than get worked up over it, play KSP, have fun, yes things are different, but it\u0027s far from broken ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAlso, far too many of these threads now, closing!"}]}
