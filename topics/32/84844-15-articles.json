These issues could be revisited during the next cycle, but since that update is \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E hyped, they take the back seat to more pressing issues and... they never get fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis makes things particularly difficult for modders, because we go months or \u003Cem\u003Eyears\u003C/em\u003E with frustrating bugs that are always promised for \u0022the next update\u0022 and never arrive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, please, instead of hyping the update and pressuring Squad, \u003Cstrong\u003Eask for a high-quality release\u003C/strong\u003E. Ask for updates which crush the outstanding issues lists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EBut Majiir, Rowsdower started this!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, he did.

We think it\u0027s great that the forum and by process, the community can hit such a level of excitement in this stage of development. As it is, there\u0027s lots of room for how it\u0027s expressed. Some may want to discuss features and impact on future/past updates and there are threads for that. Some just want to goof around and let off unbridled excitement through build changes and other newly released info. That\u0027s why this thread exists. While the devs are aware of what goes on throughout the community (and not just in brief, Franklin) and yes, we all have felt the other side of what hype can provide, I wouldn\u0027t say that speculation on release dates is something that truly affects the course of development. If anything, it\u0027s crunch related to making sure that we have a fully running update with as little bugs as possible delivered in a manner that\u0027s respectful of internal scheduling. When things don\u0027t go as planned, we get real bummed about it, but at the end of the day, an update\u0027s going to come when it\u0027s ready, not when anyone wants or expects it to be ready. The fork\u0027s got to come out of the cake (relatively) clean, if you will.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you mention below this with the \u0022things calm down\u0022 comment correlates to the workload everyone has building up to those times. Say, someone can have 1000 different issues to work on three days before release - it\u0027s an exaggeration, but that doesn\u0027t really sound calm, does it? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E It\u0027s kind of the same way on my end, too. Dealing with hype and expectation can be tricky, but we\u0027d rather the community show they care and bask in the excitement than be apathetic in any way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow can we all please move away from a bummer of a topic as marketing talk in this thread? We want the community pumped and having fun (yes, actual fun) everywhere, even in places we don\u0027t have a direct hand in.
