One I have thought about before. I like making replicas because I get more pleasure flying something that looks \u0027real\u0027. It takes a lot of imagination to use parts in new ways. And skill to put together. The performance of the rocket depends on what replica you are making. You cannot compare a replicas performance with that of a \u0027free\u0027 built craft.\n\n I don\u0027t think building replicas stops you being creative when \u0027free\u0027 building.

If I say that I feel that KSP without RO is pretty boring, I\u0027m only expressing my own opinion and I\u0027m not saying it\u0027s like that for everyone, just as he didn\u0027t say anyone who builds replicas is uncreative or whatever.\n\nPersonally I rarely build replicas and when I do, I try to match the spacecraft\u0027s performance rather than looks. For example, if I\u0027m making a Delta IV Heavy, then I won\u0027t even attempt to make all the tank colors match the real version. I just make all the tanks as big as they are in real life, put the same engines under that thing and then try to more or less match the weight and things like that. Looks are secondary. Though if I need to increase weight, I might add it in such ways that it would improve looks if I feel particularly motivated. Usually I don\u0027t."},{"CreatedByName":"SaturnianBlue","CreatedById":141267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T18:52:53Z","Content":"Personally, since I built lots of replicas, for myself it it a challenge to try and build something that looks like the real thing, while keeping up with scale and weight. You can apply what you learn from replica building when you build craft you have thought up. My MESSENGER spacecraft replica, despite using several mods, still made me think about how to use the parts in a way they come together (A Dawn replica with a similar set of mods provided a base for my experience!).\n\nIn short, replicas make me change perspective to try out something untried, making my ideas more creative.
