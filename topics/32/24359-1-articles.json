It costs far less fuel than a straight-up rocket to do it that way and makes re-entry much smoother as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If you want to get any sort of payload bigger than a peanut into space, however, rockets remain your best bet. Though there is a strange sort of cross-design compromise possible in KSP right now that you can\u0027t do in real life: link up a series of jet engines around the base of the rocket, and augment your lift with them. This generally works pretty well for mid-sized payloads. Look up Scott Manley\u0027s Reusable Space Program on YouTube to see a fairly good example of this in action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E As for exiting the atmosphere, I find the best method is to generally keep thrust fairly light in the lower atmosphere (no more than 100m/s below 2000m, 160m/s below 6400m, or 240m/s below 10000m), then perform a pitch-over at 10000m 45 degrees towards east and throttle up. From there, I monitor distance to apoapsis more than anything, keeping towards prograde and also aiming for 50s to 1m10s to apoapsis at all times until apoapsis is 60000m. Once I\u0027m that far, I start to ease back on the time to apoapsis, until it\u0027s at 70km and I\u0027m nearly at it. Circularizing is laughably easy this way, and the whole process tends to take just a hair shy of 4000dV.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-27T18:38:19Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2013 06:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SkyRender\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tommygunyeah","CreatedById":57083,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-27T18:32:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDepending on your weight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI usually go for a burn till 10km trying to stay within terminal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen turn 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 East and try to keep on my prograde after it passes that 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 mark.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet my Ap above 70km and then do my orbital burn just before my Ap.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"llamatoes","CreatedById":57750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-27T19:53:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use my engines to escape from kerbin\u0027s SOI\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eurybaric","CreatedById":33541,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-27T19:58:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s fine and all...
