By the time you have retro-captured , rendezvous or aero braked to your re-fueling point, and then to break that orbit all over again, you have wasted more fuel than you have gained overall.\n\nUntrue. If you build your ship to just have enough dV to get to Minmus orbit with nearly dry tanks, it will cost you about 4500\u002B1100 (orbit \u002B everything else to end up in Minmus orbit, ready to refuel). If instead you went to Jool, that would cost 4500\u002B1930. Going to Minmus to refuel saves you having to put enough fuel to get 820 more dV, which is a lot of fuel you don\u0027t have to lift off of Kerbin.\n\nAnd Jool\u0027s a bad case because you slow down for free so don\u0027t need as much dV total. When making a Moho, Dres, or Eeloo ship the savings is astonishing.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 2. **Land at the Mun , then land again, and again to explore more** - This one seems really efficient as your using 0 dV to arrive at a re-fueling point. Providing you landed at a rich drilling area.\n\nI never do this because you\u0027re wasting fuel lifting all that drilling and processing equipment everywhere. Better to make a ship that can hop 3-5 times and just make sure your last hop lands at your drilling/refueling base.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 3. **Refueling at a LEO station to then go interstellar -** Im not totally sure on this. If you can brute force rendezvous from the surface with pin point accuracy , topping off fuel can actually give you a pretty chunky net gain of fuel. If your rendezvous are sloppy and use like 6 burns, well not so much.\n\nI can rendezvous with an orbiting station with just a few dozen dV. However, bringing all that fuel way down the gravity well only to push it back up seems counterproductive to me. Better in my mind to bring the near-empty (and therefore much lighter) ship to Minmus to refuel.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Feel free to discuss, add your unique situations, and tell us did it give you the results you were looking for.

Alone launching all the fuel necessary for a space train from KSC is a massive undertaking which takes a lot less when done at Minmus.

This is perfect for Moho, for Jool, Dress and Eeloo you has to get into retrograde, not economical for Eve and Duna, NB watch out for Mun, it like to spoil your plan. \n\nAnyway, in the kerbal mythology Mun was the god of violent death, Seth or Mars for us, then the space age began this was shown as accurate, more kerbals has died on Mun than other places combined.

For how much less we can use the Kerbin chart here:\n\n[http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalAcademy/comments/1qu5jv/deltav_charts/](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalAcademy/comments/1qu5jv/deltav_charts/)\n\nIf you consider the type of transfer where you have a low periapsis over Kerbin to exploit the Oberth effect then whatever our destination we have to go through the Kerbin-Mun Transfer and/or Kerbin-Minmus Transfer nodes as appropriate. The saving is then the difference in delta-V needed to reach that node. That\u0027s 760 m/s for refuelling at Minmus orbit and 590 m/s at Mun orbit. A good saving on a typical interplanetary departure of 1000-2000 m/s.\n\nOf course that delta-V has to be made up for and more to get to Mun or Minmus orbit to begin with, but by requiring less delta-V on the spacecraft at once you require less fuel storage which makes the ship lighter, and then you can potentially reduce the number of engines and keep the same TWR making it lighter still.\n\nThe drawback to refuelling at the Mun or Minmus is you need to time your departure burn from their correctly to put your Kerbin periapsis in the right place for your interplanetary transfer burn. This can then constrain your departure burn date to be away from the optimum date in the transfer window. The effect is worse for a Minmus refuel than a Munar one, and either way it\u0027s generally bad for Moho which has short transfer windows but tolerable for other destinations.\n\nAs for refuelling in Low Kerbin Orbit, well while it\u0027s a reasonable place to refuel I don\u0027t much see the point of a fuel *station*. Ships small enough that the station could top up many of them are probably small enough to launch fully fuelled, while ships large enough that you can\u0027t launch them fully fuelled are probably large enough to drink all the station\u0027s fuel in one go and therefore you\u0027re just better off sending up a simple refueller to fill just that ship than running a station with all its extra complexity.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-14T12:38:48Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2015 12:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cantab**"},{"CreatedByName":"Caelib","CreatedById":59329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T12:44:32Z","Content":"I can sum it up in one word: OPTIONS."},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T12:53:59Z","Content":"Helps even more when you build the ship offworld ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nAs people have said, only lifting fuel for one direction of a return trip is a total gamechanger.
