This meant that I tried to send a small space station along with a small lander, this time though for minmus I decided to try my first robotic lander. Things went well, for the most part. Hope you guys enjoy the mission vid, and of course I would love any suggestion (especially regarding the engine choice on my lander probe)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q6dUakSbdNw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
