(My first was .14 IIRC)\n\nThroughout time I was usually 1 update behind. Most of the time it was due to waiting for my favorite Mods, and the fact that I normally lose most of my content and ships, etc.\n\nI am not on 1.02, an I must say for the first time I am disappointed, and considering going back in time. I truly hope that KSP does not continue in this same direction.\n\nLong story short, I finally updated because I wanted to mine surfaces, replenish supplies, set up bases, etc.\n\nHere is a short list of my current gripes and complaints:\n\n- Glowing space craft representing heat damage. Even after pressing F10, half the time certain parts are still a hue of red. Okay, so it is a minor annoyance.\n\n- Current Atmosphere and flight physics. 0.90 with FAR in my opinion was the best yet.\n\n- Lack of control surface options. Why can\u0027t you any longer control deflection, and the amount of input?? Only have the option to activate or deactivate a function is extremely annoying.\n\n- The new graphics seem even more cartoon-y. I am not sure how to word this properly, as KSP has always (obviously) been cartoony. That isn\u0027t my complaint. My complaint is that many of the new objects just have a dull-ness to them\n\n- Rapid updates! What is up with this? We are already on 1.04, when 1.0 came out only 2 months ago! 4 updates? Really? How are mod\u0027s supposed to keep up with that?\n\nAnyways... These are just a few of my complaints and thoughts.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestion as to what I can do to improve my experience? Essentially I LOVED .90, and I really wanted some of the features of 1.0\u002B (mining, thermal radiators, etc).... Unfortunately, at this point I feel like I have to choose between the two.\n\nWhat are YOUR thoughts and experiences? Lets make this a group discussion. \n\nThanks! Fly safe!\n\n-Justin"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T19:41:34Z","Content":"1.0.2 is the worst of the recent lot IMHO, due to memory leaks and other issues. 1.0.4 fixed at least 1 of the memory leaks and has a more rational heat/aero model.

It is ridiculous to have my craft look like a glowing checker board as one wing panel is about to fail (and glowing bright red) meanwhile the one right next to it, or opposite of it, can be good as new. It seems as if not long after STEAM got ahold of KSP, and traffic really started building, did things start to feel rushed. I actually really liked .90 and it gave me confidence that when they did release a finished product, it would be along the same lines.

(My first was .14 IIRC)\n\u003E Throughout time I was usually 1 update behind. Most of the time it was due to waiting for my favorite Mods, and the fact that I normally lose most of my content and ships, etc.\n\u003E \n\u003E I am not on 1.02, an I must say for the first time I am disappointed, and considering going back in time. I truly hope that KSP does not continue in this same direction.\n\u003E \n\u003E Long story short, I finally updated because I wanted to mine surfaces, replenish supplies, set up bases, etc.\n\u003E \n\u003E Here is a short list of my current gripes and complaints:\n\u003E \n\u003E - Glowing space craft representing heat damage. Even after pressing F10, half the time certain parts are still a hue of red. Okay, so it is a minor annoyance.\n\u003E \n\u003E - Current Atmosphere and flight physics. 0.90 with FAR in my opinion was the best yet.\n\u003E \n\u003E - Lack of control surface options. Why can\u0027t you any longer control deflection, and the amount of input?? Only have the option to activate or deactivate a function is extremely annoying.\n\u003E \n\u003E - The new graphics seem even more cartoon-y. I am not sure how to word this properly, as KSP has always (obviously) been cartoony. That isn\u0027t my complaint. My complaint is that many of the new objects just have a dull-ness to them\n\u003E \n\u003E - Rapid updates! What is up with this? We are already on 1.04, when 1.0 came out only 2 months ago! 4 updates? Really? How are mod\u0027s supposed to keep up with that?\n\u003E \n\u003E Anyways... These are just a few of my complaints and thoughts.\n\u003E \n\u003E Does anyone have any suggestion as to what I can do to improve my experience? Essentially I LOVED .90, and I really wanted some of the features of 1.0\u002B (mining, thermal radiators, etc).... Unfortunately, at this point I feel like I have to choose between the two.\n\u003E \n\u003E What are YOUR thoughts and experiences? Lets make this a group discussion. \n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks! Fly safe!\n\u003E \n\u003E -Justin\n\nI agree with you, but I want to point a few things out.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E - Glowing space craft representing heat damage. Even after pressing F10, half the time certain parts are still a hue of red. Okay, so it is a minor annoyance.\n\nYou forgot to mention that the (ugly) glow doesn\u0027t properly update and the glow persists even after the part has completely cooled.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E -...0.90 with FAR in my opinion was the best yet.\n\nThen you obviously haven\u0027t seen the new beautiful FAR which uses voxelization to compute aerodynamics instead of the old and flawed system that didn\u0027t couldn\u0027t take part clipping into account (interestingly enough, the 1.0 aerodynamics use a buggy and rushed version of FAR\u0027s old system of part-based aero calcs).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E - Lack of control surface options. Why can\u0027t you any longer control deflection, and the amount of input?? Only have the option to activate or deactivate a function is extremely annoying.\n\nTweakable control surfaces is a FAR feature (but is badly needed in stock).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E - Rapid updates! What is up with this? We are already on 1.04, when 1.0 came out only 2 months ago! 4 updates? Really? How are mod\u0027s supposed to keep up with that?\n\nExactly. 40% of my mods still haven\u0027t been updated, so I\u0027m stuck on 1.0.2. They should have taken a month longer on 1.0.4 to make sure it was not as terribly buggy and cobbled-together as it is now, but to be honest it would probably make little difference :^).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-03T16:30:37Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2015 04:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mythbusters844**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T16:29:40Z","Content":"First things first, upgrade to 1.0.4 or .3.\n\n1.0.2 aero was a step back. 1.0.3/4 aero is a step... in a different direction. I\u0027d say forward, though a lot to the side. The new aero is more challenging, more difficult to live with, but once you master it, it opens up new possibilities that simply weren\u0027t there before.\n\nYou will need to use parts you didn\u0027t use in the past - even ones that didn\u0027t exist. You will need to change your tactics, relearn a lot. But once you do, the effects are very satisfying. I believe that update was well worth the broken mod compatibility.\n\nAnd yeah, a lot of old players will whine about it - for precisely these reasons: that their old tricks based on the game\u0027s former shortcomings don\u0027t work anymore. That they can\u0027t point their SSTOs into the sky and have them in orbit with no effort - that they currently require a rather peculiar trajectory with a lengthy horizontal segment and even a bit of descent. That they crash or burn up at reentry of 30 degrees and need to relearn the maneuver.\n\nAnd yes, there are still bugs and problems, but less than there were - and less of the exploitable kind."},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T05:29:51Z","Content":"I agree with the sentiment of the OP. My fully modded 0.90 install is the best KSP experience I\u0027ve had so far.\n\nFrom a stock standpoint, 1.0.4 is better than 0.90, but not amazingly so. The new features in 1.0 had already been done better by existing mods (although the new heat system sounds like it now goes beyond DRE and could be awesome once they get the values right). Additionally, for every 0.90 bug they fixed, it seemed like they added a new issue, resulting in the whole 1.0.x mess.\n\nOnce Squad stops drastically changing things with supposedly minor updates and the mods are updated accordingly, I have no doubt that a fully modded 1.0.4 would be better than 0.90, but we\u0027re not quite at that point yet. I have a hunch this won\u0027t happen until after 1.1 though since it sounds like Unity 5 will drastically change things yet again, and a lot of modders will likely wait and see what that brings before putting in a lot of work.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-04T05:32:35Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2015 05:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius**"},{"CreatedByName":"Korizan","CreatedById":142032,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T13:33:45Z","Content":"The OP\u0027s Title should say \u0022Some general thoughts from a Beta player\u0022\n\nAnd from there it should go along the line of I remember when.....\n\nAnd I can\u0027t help but compare the beta version with the current version because I refuse to move on.\n\nSide Note\n\nAnd modders will update their mods or they won\u0027t.\n\nA modder has zero requirements to update.\n\nKSP has zero requirements to wait on a mod to catch up, they can update the game whenever they want.\n\nYes I use mods but not many of them.\n\nWhy because I learned a long time ago that you choose your mods very carefully or except that you will forever be several versions behind the game and will be forced to live with the bugs until your favorite mod author has the time and the desire to update their mod.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-04T15:32:52Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2015 03:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Korizan**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jwmflying14","CreatedById":65900,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T15:42:47Z","Content":"Thank you Koran for your constructive input. (Or lack thereof)\n\nFirst I\u0027d like to iterate that I can, and will, write my own posts regardless of what you think. Although you might have discovered KSP in beta, many of us have played sine before there were even such thing as mods. So get off your pedestal and hear someone out once in a while.\n\nI do not refuse to move on, in fact after the input from the truly constructive comments here, I installed 1.04 and admit it is at least a little better. That being said, if you had been around prior to beta, you would know that the releases between say .24 and .25 were much smoother. From my point of view, everything was more collected and less rushed. It almost seems as if after steam adopted it, Squad started to see dollar signs, and started rushing products. I am by no means saying that IS what happened, but it sure is interesting that we had better and more stable releases BEFORE the game was even in BETA. Almost ad if it was a work of love, turned into corporatized business. (I am not saying squad doesnt deserve it, they do. In my opinion the work they did and breakthroughs they have made, should earn them millions, as I would have payed much more than what I did back then. That being said, I also only feel that way because of their dedication I have seen through all the early pre-beta versions. This new method of doing things, isn\u0027t what we are used to.)\n\nOh yes, I would like to point out that if I WERE to retitle the post as \u0022beta player\u0022 I would be lying as Beta is VERY recent to some of us that have been playing much longer.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-05T15:48:27Z\u0022 title=\u002207/05/2015 03:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jwmflying14**"}]}
