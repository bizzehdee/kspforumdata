Again, due to a Unity rendering glitch, the eclipse shadow is only rendered a few hundred meters around the camera, so it appears as a disc on the ground around your ship. I suppose an eclipse on Minmus is also possible, but much more rare because of the inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ted","CreatedById":26298,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-04T03:24:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve seen it happen as well, I didn\\\u0027t actually realise what had happened until the sun suddenly appeared ~15 degrees above the horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImage:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsStyle_spoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022 tabindex=\u00220\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hNY5V.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hNY5V.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Felix","CreatedById":13184,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-04T09:35:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ted\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ted\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve seen it happen as well, I didn\\\u0027t actually realise what had happened until the sun suddenly appeared ~15 degrees above the horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImage:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hNY5V.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hNY5V.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EForget solar eclipses, I need the craft file for that plane RIGHT NOW.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ted","CreatedById":26298,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-04T11:19:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Felix\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Felix\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EForget solar eclipses, I need the craft file for that plane RIGHT NOW.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComing right up!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI must warn you though, it needs a few mods to work properly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, I used \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=8021.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMechJeb\u003C/a\u003E for the information about the orbit/surface, it\\\u0027s not necessary really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe struts that are at the front of the plane are from the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=3891.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EProbodobdyne Construction Kit\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I edited the .cfg file for the torodial aerospike engine to give it a better burn rate, this plane should function just as well with other engines however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncluded were also triple parachutes and a stronger strut for strengthening several connections around the spaceplane, I took these out though as they weren\\\u0027t really necessary.
