They are also quite frequent because all 3 bodies are on the same ecliptic plane. However, it doesn\\\u0027t necessarily cause a darkening of the scene because of the way Unity renders ambient light.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/qBSBDqBF10U?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nYou can also experience an eclipse on the Mun, when Kerbin comes between the Sun and the Mun. Again, due to a Unity rendering glitch, the eclipse shadow is only rendered a few hundred meters around the camera, so it appears as a disc on the ground around your ship. I suppose an eclipse on Minmus is also possible, but much more rare because of the inclination."},{"CreatedByName":"Ted","CreatedById":26298,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-04T03:24:09Z","Content":"I\\\u0027ve seen it happen as well, I didn\\\u0027t actually realise what had happened until the sun suddenly appeared ~15 degrees above the horizon.\n\nImage:\n\n\u003E ![hNY5V.png](http://i.imgur.com/hNY5V.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Felix","CreatedById":13184,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-04T09:35:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\\\u0027ve seen it happen as well, I didn\\\u0027t actually realise what had happened until the sun suddenly appeared ~15 degrees above the horizon.\n\u003E \n\u003E Image:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E ![hNY5V.png](http://i.imgur.com/hNY5V.png)\n\nForget solar eclipses, I need the craft file for that plane RIGHT NOW."},{"CreatedByName":"Ted","CreatedById":26298,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-04T11:19:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Forget solar eclipses, I need the craft file for that plane RIGHT NOW.\n\nComing right up!\n\nI must warn you though, it needs a few mods to work properly. \n\nFirstly, I used [MechJeb](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=8021.0) for the information about the orbit/surface, it\\\u0027s not necessary really.\n\nThe struts that are at the front of the plane are from the [Probodobdyne Construction Kit](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=3891.0).\n\nAlso, I edited the .cfg file for the torodial aerospike engine to give it a better burn rate, this plane should function just as well with other engines however.\n\nIncluded were also triple parachutes and a stronger strut for strengthening several connections around the spaceplane, I took these out though as they weren\\\u0027t really necessary. They were part of the [Kosmos](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=7178.0) pack and you can add them yourself if you want.\n\nHope you have fun with the plane, it handles quite well with SAS on or off (I\\\u0027d advise leaving it on though, aerospike engines are quite lethal) and can get you into a nice orbit. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
