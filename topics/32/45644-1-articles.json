If you are just going to land, fly around a bit, and then land again it will work just fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re hoping to land, take off, and re-orbit, odds are you wont do so well. Reason being that due to the thicker atmosphere, and having only rocket engines available, the optimal launch trajectory is a pure vertical ascent until you pass through the thickest part of the atmosphere. Wings don\u0027t really help with that and just weigh you down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you are using an expendable probe, it really doesn\u0027t matter too much. As for useful tips: for just flying around keep your rocket throttle low, a plane flying around at 5 atmospheres of pressure has a somewhat lower terminal velocity on eve than what you\u0027d expect on kerbin. Also, you don\u0027t need that many solar panels. In fact you could probably replace all of them with a single RTG and be able to fly around at night as well, and with a better frame rate.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-11T22:36:06Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2013 10:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by PotatoOverdose\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattig89ch","CreatedById":33288,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-11T23:04:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the support!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m actually experimenting with the idea of using rover wheels that tough the ground after I retract the gear.
