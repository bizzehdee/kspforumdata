Debris form space falling into oceans, forests, lakes and rivers. That may pollute them and destroy ecosystem. This will heavily backfire kerbin\u2019s society. Poisonous liquid fuel may evaporate and mix with atmosphere. This may cause acid rains and a lot more catastrophes. \u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Plastic, metals from fuselages may decompose and spoil the soil it will lead to horrifying consequences like extinction of species.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanger in and from space may appear. Despite that lots of debris burns up in the atmosphere some stays in space. It may fall down on the surface due to orbital decay. That would cause a metal rain. As a result- a lot of casualties. But for now, it makes even more danger in space. Debris clouds form in orbit. They may strike and you won\u2019t even notice how quickly your spaceship blends with all debris.\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerbals launch rockets every day. But how does this influence Kerbin? Because rockets are not made of nothing, Kerbals may face lack of resources on Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, after you\u2019ve read the article I may suggest you 3 things.\u003Cbr\u003E\n1.Terminate all debris lying on kerbin (boring)\u003Cbr\u003E\n2.Launch manned mission to destroy orbital debris (cool)\u003Cbr\u003E\n3.Download BD armory or any other mod that adds lasers and shoot down all debris from ground (AWESOME)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope you liked this article!\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut can I take a bit of your time?
