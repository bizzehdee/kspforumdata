In particular, I began playing with skids made of I-beams and structural panels. I haven\u2019t really seen skids in KSP before, and thus, had no idea how to make them. So, I began running through prototypes, testing all sorts of skid configurations, trying to find the lightest, most durable, and least draggy setup. Through this testing, I found something odd. One of my skid configurations did significantly better than all the others I tested:\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is one of my standard skids:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wyWB89m.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wyWB89m.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here is the odd skid:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vyFeINt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vyFeINt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can see, my standard skid only started moving when the engine thrust reached 18.7 Kn. By contrast, the other skid design started moving at about 13 Kn of thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you spot the difference? The standard skid is resting on the flat side of skids, while the other skid is resting on the vertices of the skids.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn reality, between dry surfaces, friction does not depend on contact area. If you decrease contact area, you decrease the area for friction to act upon, but you also increase the pressure on the area. Turns out, this decrease of area is exactly canceled by the increased pressure. Thus, the force of static friction stays the same for a given mass, no matter how you vary the contact area. Most of the time. I\u2019m sure there are cases where this isn\u2019t true, but for the most part, it is a good approximation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what\u2019s going on here? Why does reducing the contact area appear to lower the static friction in KSP?

However, in cases where only the vertices of a part touch the ground, the force of friction is drastically reduced. Why is this? My guess is that since the plates are perfect shapes, their vertices essentially have an infinitely small contact area, confusing KSP\u2019s friction calculation in some way. Then again, an edge of a perfect shape should also have an infinitely small surface area, and as you saw from my second test, the edges produced the same force of friction as the flat plate. So, at this point, I really have no idea what could be causing this.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that isn\u2019t to mention all of the other oddities I noticed during these tests. For example, the jittering plates in my first test. This jitter seems to increase with the number of parts touching the ground, but why? The parts are very sturdy: After all, they are steel plates fixed to a single steel beam and thus, they don\u2019t move very much when put under pressure. Despite this, friction causes them to jitter, causing all sorts of random movements in the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn top of all this, it seems friction on terrain differs significantly from friction on the runway! For one the static friction is much higher (Which makes sense, grass/dirt/sand would exert more friction than flat concrete). Additionally, the jittering is much, much worse on terrain. Parts will quite visibly jolt back and forth. However, this jittering will completely stop once the craft reaches a certain speed.\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--- Final Words ---\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers. While I did learn a little about how contact area effects friction in KSP, these experiments have revealed a bizarre world of KSP that I\u2019ve never noticed before. A world where the simple act of sliding metal plates against a flat surface creates jittering, phantom forces, and physics-defying skids that glide effortlessly across the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn that note, I want to encourage you all to help me explore KSP\u2019s friction. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/w1udftmyyh7iutl/KSP_Friction_Test_Rigs.zip?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload my test rigs and try to replicate my results.\u003C/a\u003E Conduct your own experiments.

From this, it appears that the mass of the part(s) that contacts the ground plays a big part in what forces it experiences. A heavy object resting on a part with low mass will jitter and walk around, while a massive object resting directly on the ground won\u0027t.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe more I think about it, the more I\u0027m leaning towards stock-joints being the problem. If I recall correctly, the strength of the joint depends on the mass of the part, right? That would explain why a part with less mass would exhibit this behavior, while one with a large mass would not. I\u0027m thinking that because the joint of a small mass part is weaker, it exacerbates some kind of bug in the stock-joint that causes the part to jitter when in contact with a force.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm... More experiments are definitely necessary. I wonder if this behavior still occurs when a part is resting on top of another stationary part instead of the ground?

For example, when the thruster is exerting a force slightly greater than static friction, I get the jittering behavior. In this case, the physics inaccuracies you talked about would cause the parts to randomly wobble slower than the craft, causing them to exert their static friction and \u0022stick\u0022. When the craft reaches a certain speed, the jittering and random turning stops completely.

This value is critical when trying to stack objects. Friction comes in two forms, dynamic and static. \u003Cspan\u003EStatic friction\u003C/span\u003E is used when the object is lying still. It will prevent the object from starting to move. If a large enough force is applied to the object it will start moving.
