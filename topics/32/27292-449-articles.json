Removed some of the intakes. Changed the top wings for a sturdier version and added elevons to them. Moved the landing gear so I could rotate before having to be flung off the end of the runway. Added some more RCS jets (was missing one DOF, making docking very painful). I added two more tail/wing structures to push the lift vector back a little more. Now, it works much better. Actually, I find I have a lot more LFO when I reach orbit now that I am getting the hang of getting a space plane to space.

But I\u0027ll get to that. The other day I deployed an interplanetary capable Kethane scanner from a cargo bay (even though it almost got stuck), which I was kind of proud of. Just think of the launch costs I could save by adapting more payloads to cargo bays! Well, you guys probably already know that. But I\u0027ve been pretty slow on actually *using* spaceplanes for anything other than playing around or dropping off / picking up small contract satellites in LKO. The small engine / tank will get it on an escape trajectory from Kerbin and the ion drive has enough juice to take it probably clear out to the Jool system if I wanted to. Actually that\u0027s not a bad idea. It was originally going to Gilly, and still might, but I\u0027m putting that mission off for now as a whole. I just don\u0027t see any purpose in reaching my colonization efforts in that direction at this time, so I\u0027m headed to Ike instead. But not with this probe, I just wanted to share that. I actually have a Kethane scanner already in orbit of Ike, it went out with my Duna colony missions and had plenty of DV left over. I figure if I put a self sustaining fuel depot at Ike I can take less extravagant ships for a detour on the way to Jool. I\u0027m thinking long term cost of sending massive rockets out that far.

Here is the Refueling Depot station and Kethane refinery, all this is empty except the descent engines on the refinery to save on the cost of getting it out there. Here\u0027s where I stopped thinking things through. I sent up a transfer stage (shown in bottom pic) to dock with this and push it out that direction because there was no way I was engineering all that into one payload AND getting it safely to orbit. They\u0027re almost guaranteed to be functional together because they were designed together, but sent up in two pieces. I\u0027m also not completely sure what I was thinking when I made that hazardous looking docking assembly. Actually I do, I think that design is vestigial from when I wanted the refinery itself to fly back up to dock with the station, but decided that was silly and just slapped a decoupler in there to get rid of the reaction wheels and docking port once on the ground. There is now a separate ship that will arrive after this to transport the refined fuel (liquid fuel, oxidizer, monoprop, and xenon) from the surface to the orbital station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2014-10-2204-41-12-80.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2014-10-2204-41-12-80.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I didn\u0027t think about was flex due to the idiotic way I made that docking assembly. As soon as I tried to turn the whole thing around, things got squirrely. So I sent up a refueling ship which was needed anyway since I burned a little more fuel than I planned while getting the transfer stage into orbit. I tried for a while to build an SSTO for this job, but I\u0027m just not comfortable with more than doubling my highest mass spaceplane and getting it off the ground yet. The only reason the refueling ship was even manned was because I was going to send up a box of KAS struts and the pilot was to attach them to the weak points of the assembly, a dual purpose mission. BUT, I forgot to send the struts. So the refuel was fine but I still had the same problem... Enter the new and improved V3m-X, now with a small liquid fuel drop tank, a KAS box, and docking capabilities. By using the cheap drop tank to cruise up to around 18km on Kerbin while carrying more oxidizer than before (and running on airbreathing mode until 28km / 1700m/s), I am able to get into a stable ~150km orbit with an extra ~200DV, which is very useful on such a short range craft. (If I use the drop tank I have about 550 DV during final rendezvous approach). The drop tank is actually more of a throw tank, it sits on a decoupler in the cargo bay with 45 units of liquid fuel piped to the tank directly behind it, and when its empty we simply pop the cargo bay and fire off the decoupler and two separatrons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2014-10-2400-19-35-65.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2014-10-2400-19-35-65.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo without further ado here is the cluster **** I created...

The redesign of the Auk-IV did not go as planned; I wound up with a craft that was four tonnes heavier and far less capable than the original, which made it as far as 30 kilometers before flaming out but only made it that far by my lighting the nukes at takeoff for extra thrust. I did calculate that I didn\u0027t have enough thrust for the increased mass - I guess that shows that the calculations were sound. I\u0027ve also been plagued with ongoing issues with my mouse on that particular box and they were really hitting hard last night, so construction itself was a chore (middle click is fine, right click is fine, left click either doesn\u0027t register or registers twice - and it\u0027s a brand-new mouse, which I got because the previous one was doing the exact same thing; changing USB ports didn\u0027t help).
