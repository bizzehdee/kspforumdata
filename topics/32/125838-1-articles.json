For new facilities it can appear in general, and in contextual facility upgrades, it will look at the composition of the vessel to see what crew it thinks the vessel might need. This is based on the crew capacity, and the presence of things like labs, ISRU, or command modules. It will only ask for personnel that are easily transferable to the facility, either by being assigned on a mission on the same planet as the facility, or by idling in KSC.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt can even ask for tourist visitations to existing stations on contextuals, if there are active or offered tourism contracts with itineraries that pass through that planet.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T21:52:44Z","Content":"\nArsonide, is it possible to have some more reasonable tourists contract ?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI usually get some which want to land on Eve then go to Vall and do a Duma flyby.
