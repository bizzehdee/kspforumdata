There is a mod for that, that lets you slide the navball to the left or right. Very usefull. But when it comes to EVA missions how do you guys go about it? In my experience the kerbal tends to be in the way more often than not. When playing with KIS i can imagine this a real pita. But even collecting science and resetting experiments on EVA can be a bit of pain. Is there a first person mod or something like that, that helps with the EVA stuff? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Thank you"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T13:25:32Z","Content":"Huh, I\u0027ve never had a problem with the Kerbal on EVA being in the way, except once with an early version of KAC I accidentally attached a pipe to the Kerbal\u0027s head.
