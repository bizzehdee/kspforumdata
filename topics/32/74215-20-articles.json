Me I don\u0027t mind the light version of the texture compression, I still find it beautiful..

This might be a result of how memory space is allocated and a reflection of how uncompressed textures in the 32 bit environment waste memory space.. I say it that way because with texture compression I was able to take my normal 2gb mob load on 32bit and see it load to 1.6gb under 64bit.. actual performance difference? virtually none.. unless you smashed a 1400 part rocket into the ground.. then you will see how quickly the 64bit recovers from the chaos vs the 32bit.. its\u0027 quite noticeable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"koksny","CreatedById":65152,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-17T20:47:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have been working on the decouple force in x64 version for quite few days, here are my conclusions for now:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIssue is related to decouple() function itself.

After getting home I ran through several test with a 25\u002B decoupler vessel with various Ejection forces and it seems that ejection force is unrelated to the decoupler issue. (tried activating decouplers with staging for awhile as well, no luck there either) It seems that I was able to get about 1 in 5 decouplers to activate by right click though. So I think that at least narrows down that the decoupling method/module is working but often gets some sort of error with the 64 bit unity player.. I also took a look at my output log as well, outside of a few odd errors (Hyper-edit, Distant object enhancement) the only thing I found was this type of line:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EPart KW1mDecoupler cannot load module #1.
