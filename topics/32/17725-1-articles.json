If so, how much?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would just think that like most engines like cars, jets, etc... full throttle really burns a lot more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question being though also if it should burn the same amount of fuel per the same amount of force.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eie\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10 units of force burns 10 units of fuel/min\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5 units of force burns 5 units of fuel/min\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr should it be\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10 units of force burns 12 units of fuel/min\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5 units of force burns 5 units of fuel/min\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere in the 2nd case, full burn does give more thrust, but wastes 2 units of fuel. That extra is basically wasted because the engines are just going berserk turning a fraction of the thrust simply into heat rather than force of thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe currently it\u0027s basically like that. In my opinion, it seems more like engines burn way more fuel when at full.

Before .16 engines used a fuel burn rate. For .16 they switched to Specific Impulse. The problem is that a line of code was left in that lets the fuel usage be modified the square of the throttle or something, I don\u0027t remember exactly. But basically at 100% thrust it works correctly. However, at 50% thrust it should use 50% of the fuel usage but instead it\u0027s using like 25%, and at 10% thrust it\u0027s using even less, it\u0027s only using 1% fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not hard to build rockets that get to orbit with plenty of fuel left over , it just takes some practice in design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Znath","CreatedById":38611,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-26T02:58:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhere is this fix for the fuel thing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess it does make things a lot simpler for it to just always be 1:1 on a linear progression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was mostly just curious about how real engines work in this regard.
