There\u0027s something special about a superheavy lifter firing up on the pad (especially with the new smoke effects) and dropping off hundreds of tons of spent boosters and stages on it\u0027s way to orbit.\n\nThat, and rockets are simpler, easier and faster for getting stuff to orbit than spaceplanes. Right now rocket launches are cheap enough compared to the availability of funds that there\u0027s not much incentive for spaceplanes unless you enjoy the challenge.\n\nPlanes do have their place when exploring Kerbin, but the lower speed and limited warp options mean these missions take much more real time and I end up constantly having to make small corrections when flying my aircraft which gets quite tedious.

I hate the spaceplanes, but it isn\u0027t Squad\u0027s fault. I hate every single flight simulator or flying game I\u0027ve ever played.

Even in real planes, I used to get annoyed by \u0022features\u0022 like electric flaps that take the pilot\u0027s sense of touch out of the equation. I\u0027d get all sorts of data from the feel of the airflow as I pulled that big manual flap handle.\n\nOnce, I got a bug stuck in my pitot tube during landing. When I took off the next day, my first indication something was wrong was when the feel of the runway in my butt said I was going faster than the airspeed indicator claimed. [edit: yes, I checked the pitot during preflight, but the bug went in too deep to see. Took an air compressor to clean it out, and there was almost an inch of bug remains stuffed in there.]\n\nPilots of airliners and fighters may not have this fetish, but I have the soul of a bush pilot. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T22:38:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 10:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Beowolf**"},{"CreatedByName":"OrbitusII","CreatedById":57305,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T22:37:02Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been a longtime fan of rockets because they\u0027re much easier to design and use, but in recent months I\u0027ve gotten more invested in plane design.\n\nAlas, I have yet to construct a cargo SSTO, so I voted rockets solely because they\u0027re my only way into space at this time."}]}
