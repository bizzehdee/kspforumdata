I\u0027ve done it a couple of times with parts that were prety much what you\u0027d expect from an early mun landing, just more of them. I just designed a squat lander that could self launch from kerbin and put itself in orbit around mun. I then took that design and mounted it on top of a launcher and transfer stage and sent it off to jool. The greatly reduced lander (after looseing all its radial stages during landing and asscent) hooked back onto the transfer stage with a docking port and returned to kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally the only hard part was controlling the touchdown. Gravity is high enough that its tricky finding just the right amount of throttle to come down slowly but not too slow. Even a second or two of underthrottle can pick up enough speed to break something. Fuel margins are also tight enough that you cant hover for long looking for an ideal landing site if you come down on a slope. otherwise all you need is a craft with 5.5k dv or so with a TWR in the 1.5 range or better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont go back there often though. the planet is just to much a pain to land on to make a ground base viable when there are much better targets for that kinda thing nearby.
