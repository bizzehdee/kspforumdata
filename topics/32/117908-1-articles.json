{"TopicId":117908,"ForumId":32,"TopicTitle":"Kerbal Astronomy 101","CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T21:50:37Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T21:50:37Z","Content":"[![OOqL3cv.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/OOqL3cv.png?1)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/160017-threads-of-the-month-may/)\n\nThe first time I played Kerbal Space Program, one of the things that I though was a little odd is that we can go to the Tracking Station and immediately zoom in on all the planets and moons and see what they look like. We can also read many precise facts and figures about them. We can do all this before we launch our first rocket.\n\nThis got me thinking about what the solar system would look like if we were restricted to Kerbin based observations. How big and bright would the moons and planets be, how much detail could we see through a telescope, what phenomenon could we observe? In other words, what would be the state of pre-space age astronomical knowledge? If we assume that Kerbal and human technology developed along the same or similar path, then Kerbal understanding of their solar system at the start of Year 1 would be much like human understanding of our solar system in the 1950s.\n\nBelow is my interpretation of the information that would likely be known to Kerbin-bound observers. Much of the information, such as apparent magnitudes and sizes, is computed from given data. Some of the other information is speculation, but I try to provide the justification for such speculation. Although all the phenomenon that I describe, such as eclipses and transits, would exist in a real solar system, they are not necessarily depicted graphically in the game.\n\nMany facts and figures, such as orbital parameters, would be well known, but other physical characteristics, such as the size and mass of a small and distant body, would be known to much less certainty. I\u0027ve tried to imply the degree of confidence in a particular value by the number of significant figures use. There are likely some things that Kerbals would be completely wrong about, but I\u0027m not willing to speculate that far.\n\nSun (Kerbol)\n\n**Diameter:** 523,000 km  \n\n**Mass:** 1.757\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003E\u00D7\u003C/font\u003E10^24^ kg  \n\n**Rotation period:** 20 days  \n\n**Luminosity:** 3.161\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003E\u00D7\u003C/font\u003E10^24^ watts  \n\n**Surface temperature:** 5,840 K (from game files)  \n\n**Atmosphere:** Yes, hydrogen?\n\nThe Sun is the dominate body at the center of the solar system. It contains 99.97% of all the [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass) in the solar system. It has the color and [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature) of a [G-type main sequence star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-type_main-sequence_star). However, because of the scaled down size of the Kerbal universe, its [luminosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity) is only 1/18^th^ of what would be expected given its size and temperature. By measuring the value of the [solar constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_constant) at Kerbin, astronomers can compute the Sun\u0027s luminosity. The solar constant is defined in the game\u0027s configuration files as 1360 W/m^2^, from which a luminosity of 3.161\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003E\u00D7\u003C/font\u003E10^24^ watts is calculated. This would normally imply a surface temperature much cooler than is presumed to be true. It is also presumed that the Sun\u0027s [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation) peaks in the [visible spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum), as would be the case for a G-type star, rather than in the [infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared), as would be the case for a low luminosity star.\n\nThe Sun is an average of 13,599,840 km away from Kerbin, a distance that Kerbals define as their astronomical unit, or 1 AU. From this distance the Sun shines at an [apparent magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude) of -26.7, the same as Earth\u0027s sun. The solar disk in Kerbin\u0027s sky subtends an angle of 132 [arcminutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute_and_second_of_arc), more than four times the apparent [angular diameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_diameter) of Earth\u0027s sun.\n\nIf Kerbals have come to discover the science of [spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_spectroscopy), then they likely have some knowledge of the [chemical composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_composition) of the Sun. If so, then Kerbals have knowledge that we don\u0027t. Chemical composition is something that is undefined in KSP, thus we a left to only speculate about what might exist. Of course it is reasonable to assume Kerbals would figure out that the Sun is composed mostly of [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen), just as all stars are.\n\nOn the Sun\u0027s surface are areas of solar activity that appear relatively dark when seen in white light. These [sunspots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot) appear, disappear, and change in shape over time. By following their motion it is determined that the Sun\u0027s [rotation period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_period) is 20 days. (Sunspots may be illustrated as static in the game, but we know in real life they change.)\n\nMoho\n\n**Mean distance from Sun:** 5,263,000 km  \n\n**Orbital period:** 102.6 days  \n\n**Diameter:** 500 km  \n\n**Mass:** 2.53\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003E\u00D7\u003C/font\u003E10^21^ kg  \n\n**Rotation period:** 56 days  \n\n**Albedo:** 0.10  \n\n**Effective temperature:** 163 ^o^C  \n\n**Atmosphere:** none  \n\n**Satellites:** none\n\nAlthough Moho is one of the brighter planets in Kerbin\u0027s sky, its closeness to the Sun can make it difficult to observe. At its greatest [elongation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elongation_%28astronomy%29), Moho is never more than 28^o^ from the Sun. Like the real life planets Mercury and Venus, Moho is seen to pass through [phases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_phase), appearing full when on the far side of the Sun and a crescent as it nears Kerbin.\n\nThe problem with observing Moho is that, at the times when the sky is dark enough to effectively observe it, it is never high above the horizon. This means that it must be observed through a thick and turbulent atmosphere, which degrades a telescope\u0027s ability to resolve small details. Moho\u0027s disk subtends an angle that varies between 5.2 and 14 arcseconds. When highest in the sky and best positioned for observation, Moho\u0027s apparent diameter is about 8\u0022. Given this small size and the poor [astronomical seeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_seeing), it is unlikely that anything more than brightness variations are visible on its surface.\n\nWhether or not visual observations of Moho are of adequate quality to deduce the planet\u0027s rotation period is unknown. However, if Kerbal [radio astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_astronomy) is advanced enough, measuring the [Doppler effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect) of radio waves bounced off its surface can provide this data. It is likely Kerbals know that Moho\u0027s rotation is very slow, making less than two rotations every Moho year.\n\nIt\u0027s possible for astronomers to measure a planet\u0027s [albedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo), the fraction of sunlight that it reflects, from the known amount of sunlight that hits it and the amount they see reflected off of it. We can\u0027t do that, but we can compute a planet\u0027s brightness if we know its albedo (we\u0027ll just pretend that Kerbal astronomers did it the other way around). The albedo of each body is given in the game\u0027s configuration files. It\u0027s uncertain if the value given is [geometric albedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_albedo) or [bond albedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_albedo). Geometric albedo is used in brightness calculations and bond albedo in temperature calculations. Since we don\u0027t know, we\u0027ll assume the same value for both. In Moho\u0027s case, its albedo is 0.1.\n\nMoho is at its brightest when full, at which time it can reach an apparent magnitude of -2.4. At greatest elongation it dims to about magnitude -1.3. At this time Moho is bright and conspicuous enough in the evening or morning sky that it was likely known in ancient times.\n\nKnowing the amount of solar radiation Moho receives and its albedo, astronomers can compute its [effective temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_temperature), which roughly approximates the global average. Performing these calculations show that Moho is hot, with an effective temperature of 163 ^o^[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius). Further calculations show that the maximum temperature at the [subsolar point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsolar_point) should be 360 ^o^C.\n\nPlanetary [atmospheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere) can be detected by the dimming of starlight that occurs when a planet\u0027s limb [occults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occultation) a star, or by the silhouette the atmosphere produces when the planet [transits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_%28astronomy%29) another body. These techniques would reveal to Kerbal astronomers that Moho has no atmosphere.\n\nFurthermore, the ability of a planet to retain an atmosphere can be computed from its [escape velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity) and temperature. In KSP, the celestial bodies have been scaled down in size to facilitate better game play, with an apparent scale factor of 0.1 on diameter and 0.01 on mass. To determine the fictionalized ability of a KSP planet to hold onto an atmosphere, we should scale them back up to the size of their real world analog, and then perform the computation on the analog. Doing this for Moho shows that it is too small and too hot to retain an atmosphere of any significance.\n\nThe mass of a planet is computed from its gravitational effects. The handiest method is to measure the distance and [orbital period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_period) of a satellite, then insert these two figures into the proper equation derived from the [law of gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation), which gives the mass of the parent body. Since Moho has no [natural satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite), its mass is calculated from the effect of its [gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity) on other bodies.\n\nEvery so often Moho passes in front of the Sun as seen from Kerbin. During these transits, Moho is visible as a black dot silhouetted against the face of the Sun. These events occur at varying intervals, with a normal of 7 transits occurring every 13-year period.\n\nEve\n\n**Mean distance from Sun:** 9,833,000 km  \n\n**Orbital period:** 261.9 days  \n\n**Diameter:** 1,400 km  \n\n**Mass:** 1.224\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003E\u00D7\u003C/font\u003E10^23^ kg  \n\n**Rotation period:** 22.4 hours  \n\n**Albedo:** 0.45  \n\n**Effective temperature:** 9 ^o^C (atmosphere)  \n\n**Surface temperature:** 135 ^o^C ?  \n\n**Atmosphere:** Yes, carbon dioxide?  \n\n**Satellites:** 1\n\nEve is the brightest planet in Kerbin\u0027s sky. Through a [telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope), Eve is seen to pass through phases because its orbit between Kerbin and the Sun makes different amounts of its illuminated hemisphere visible at different times. When full, Eve shines at an apparent magnitude of -3.9. It is brightest when at about a 40% crescent phase, shinning at magnitude -4.9 (the same as Venus at its brightest). Eve comes closer to Kerbin than any other planet. Its disk subtends an angle that varies between 12 and 79 arcseconds. At greatest elongation, Eve is 46^o^ from the Sun and has an apparent diameter of 31\u0022.\n\nEve is the second largest planet by both [diameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter) and mass, with only Jool being larger. Its [density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density) is nearly 1.5 times that of Kerbin, easily the highest density among all planets. This suggests that Eve\u0027s interior must contain a large [core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_core) of heavy elements.\n\nTelescopic observations of Eve reveal the presence of a thick atmosphere. However, the question that remains is whether or not there is a thick [cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud) deck. Eve\u0027s albedo is 0.45, which is much higher than expected from its darkly colored surface. This suggests that much of the planet is covered by clouds, even though these clouds are not depicted in the game\u0027s graphics. The amount of cloud cover is unknown, but an albedo of 0.45 is on the low end for most cloud types, suggesting that the cloud cover may not be total. It\u0027s possible that portions of the surface can be seen through gaps in the cloud layer. Furthermore, [radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_astronomy) studies, if sensitive enough, might also reveal some large scale structure. Perhaps Kerbal astronomers have been able to patiently piece together a crude map of Eve\u0027s surface.\n\nWe know from the game that the [molecular mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_mass) of Eve\u0027s atmosphere is 43 g/mol, suggesting that [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) is likely the major constituent. It is probable that spectroscopic observation of Eve\u0027s atmosphere would find evidence of this carbon dioxide.\n\nEve\u0027s effective temperature is 9 ^o^C, which is a theoretical estimate of the cloud layer temperature, but this tells us nothing about the surface temperature. It\u0027s possible that some combination of infrared and/or [microwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave) observations has revealed that Eve has a much hotter surface, resulting from the [greenhouse effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect). Note that most infrared wavelengths are absorbed by [water vapor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor) in the atmosphere. Kerbals can get around this by having their infrared telescopes carried aloft by balloons.\n\nLike Moho, every so often Eve passes in front of the Sun as seen from Kerbin. Transits of Eve are rarer than transits of Moho, with only 6 or 7 events occurring every 75-year period.\n\nGilly\n\n**Mean distance from Eve:** 31,500 km  \n\n**Orbital period:** 18 days  \n\n**Diameter:** 26 km  \n\n**Mass:** 2\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003E\u00D7\u003C/font\u003E10^17^ kg  \n\n**Rotation period:** unknown  \n\n**Albedo:** 0.15  \n\n**Effective temperature:** 40 ^o^C  \n\n**Atmosphere:** none\n\nEve\u0027s moon Gilly is the smallest known moon in the solar system. At its brightest it shines at magnitude \u002B5.0. At most times Gilly is below the threshold at which telescopes can resolve its disk, though at its closest to Kerbin, it can be seen to subtend an angle of 1.5\u0022. Estimates place its diameter at about 26 km. Because Gilly\u0027s gravitational effects are small, its mass is not well known. The rotation period of Gilly has not been determined. It is theorized that Gilly may be a captured [asteroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid).\n\nKerbin\n\n**Mean distance from Sun:** 13,599,840 km  \n\n**Orbital period:** 426.090 days  \n\n**Diameter:** 1,200 km  \n\n**Mass:** 5.2917\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003E\u00D7\u003C/font\u003E10^22^ kg  \n\n**Rotation period:** 5^h^ 59^m^ 9.425^s^  \n\n**Albedo:** 0.35  \n\n**Effective temperature:** -23 ^o^C (atmosphere)  \n\n**Surface temperature:** 13.5 ^o^C average  \n\n**Atmosphere:** Yes, nitrogen/oxygen  \n\n**Satellites:** 2\n\nKerbin is the third largest planet in the solar system, and the third in distance from the Sun. Its location places it well within the Sun\u0027s [habitable zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstellar_habitable_zone), where temperatures are warm enough for liquid water to exist on its surface. Global temperature extremes vary from 41 ^o^C at the equator, to -35 ^o^C at the poles. The globally averaged temperature is about 13.5 ^o^C.\n\nKerbin has a thick atmosphere that contains [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen). The average molecular mass of Kerbin air is approximately 29 g/mol, suggesting that it is likely an earthlike nitrogen-oxygen mixture. Kerbin\u0027s albedo is 0.35, which is much higher than expected from the [reflectance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflectance) of its surface. This suggests that cloud cover factors significantly into Kerbin\u0027s albedo. Kerbin\u0027s effective temperature is -23^o^C, indicating that there is a substantial greenhouse effect warming its surface.\n\nKerbin has no [axial tilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt) and its [orbital eccentricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity) is zero, thus the planet experiences no [seasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season) of any kind. From any specific location on Kerbin, the Sun is seen to follow the same daily path across sky. The entire globe experiences equal periods of daylight and darkness throughout the year. Kerbin\u0027s [solar day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time) is exactly 6 hours long. The [equators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator) of Kerbin and the Sun lie in the same [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_%28geometry%29), therefore making it possible to use a single [celestial coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_coordinate_system) for bodies orbiting Kerbin and those orbiting the Sun.\n\nKerbin has two natural satellites, Mun and Minmus. The gravitational interaction of Kerbin and its moons allow the masses of all three bodies to be precisely determined.\n\nMun\n\n**Mean distance from Kerbin:** 12,000 km  \n\n**Orbital period:** 6.4345 days  \n\n**Diameter:** 400 km  \n\n**Mass:** 9.760\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003E\u00D7\u003C/font\u003E10^20^ kg  \n\n**Rotation period:** 6.4345 days  \n\n**Albedo:** 0.10  \n\n**Effective temperature:** -2 ^o^C  \n\n**Atmosphere:** none\n\nMun is the second largest and brightest body visible from Kerbin, second only to Sun. Its disk subtends an angle of 115 arcminutes, which is nearly four times the apparent diameter of Earth\u0027s moon. Like Earth\u0027s moon, Mun is seen to pass through [phases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase). At full phase its apparent magnitude is -15.2, or about 10 times brighter than a full moon on Earth.\n\nAssuming Kerbal [visual acuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity) is similar to humans, significant detail can be observed with the [naked eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_eye). Through a telescope Mun is observed in stunning detail. It is so close by that, assuming an [angular resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_resolution) of 1 arcsecond, surface features as small as 55 meters can be resolved. Mun is [tidally locked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking) to Kerbin and always keeps the same face pointed toward its parent planet, thus only 50% of its surface is visible from Kerbin. The features of Mun\u0027s far side are a mystery.\n\nBecause Mun\u0027s [orbital plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_plane_%28astronomy%29) lies within the plane of Kerbin\u0027s orbit around the Sun, eclipses are a regular occurrence. [Solar eclipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse) occur every new phase and [lunar eclipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_eclipse) every full phase. Because Mun\u0027s apparent diameter is smaller than the Sun\u0027s, solar eclipses are annular (they can also be called *transits*). Lunar eclipses, however, are total. One consequence of the unusually perfect orbital alignment is that the central path of solar eclipses is always along Kerbin\u0027s equator. Partial solar eclipses are never visible outside of about \u00B145^o^[latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude) of the equator.\n\nMun\u0027s effective temperature is -2 ^o^C, though actual surface temperatures should vary considerably depending on location. The computed temperature of the subsolar point is 120 ^o^C. Observations show that Mun has no atmosphere, as expected based on its temperature and small size.\n\nMinmus\n\n**Mean distance from Kerbin:** 47,000 km  \n\n**Orbital period:** 49.875 days  \n\n**Diameter:** 120 km  \n\n**Mass:** 2.646\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003E\u00D7\u003C/font\u003E10^19^ kg  \n\n**Rotation period:** 1.870 days  \n\n**Albedo:** 0.50  \n\n**Effective temperature:** -39 ^o^C  \n\n**Atmosphere:** none\n\nMinmus is the third largest and brightest body visible from Kerbin. Its disk subtends an angle of 8.8 arcminutes, which is about 1/4^th^ the apparent diameter of Earth\u0027s moon. Like Mun, Minmus passes through phases. At full phase, its apparent magnitude is -11.4, which is about the brightness of a gibbous moon on Earth.\n\nMinmus\u0027 disk is easily resolved with the naked eye. Without optical aid it is likely that a keen-eyed observer can detect albedo variations on Minmus, but probably little else. Through a telescope, Minmus is seen in a resolution similar to viewing its full disk on your computer screen. This is adequate to resolve surface features as small as 225 meters across. Unlike the tidally locked Mun, Minmus has a rapid rotation, thus allowing its entire surface to be seen from Kerbin.\n\nBecause Minmus\u0027 orbit is inclined to that of Kerbin, solar transits and lunar eclipses are less common than they are for Mun. Minmus lies too far away from Kerbin to experience total lunar eclipses, but Minmus does occasionally pass through Kerbin\u0027s [penumbra and antumbra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbra,_penumbra_and_antumbra) shadows. Lunar eclipses and solar transits occur at a frequency that produces an average of 1.5 events of each type per year. Although the frequency is the same, lunar eclipses are routinely visible to a larger population than are transits. This is because they can be seen from anywhere on the nighttime side of Kerbin. Solar transits, on the other hand, are visible only from within a specific path across the globe. Observing a transit may require transportation to a faraway and remote site.\n\nSince Minmus reflects more sunlight than Mun, it has a lower effective temperature of -39 ^o^C. The computed temperature of the subsolar point is 89 ^o^C. Observations show that Minmus has no atmosphere.\n\nDuna\n\n**Mean distance from Sun:** 20,726,000 km  \n\n**Orbital period:** 1.881 years  \n\n**Diameter:** 640 km  \n\n**Mass:** 4.515\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003E\u00D7\u003C/font\u003E10^21^ kg  \n\n**Rotation period:** 18.2 hours  \n\n**Albedo:** 0.17  \n\n**Effective temperature:** -58 ^o^C (atmosphere)  \n\n**Surface temperature:** -12 ^o^C daytime ?  \n\n**Atmosphere:** Yes  \n\n**Satellites:** 1\n\nBecause Duna is a [superior planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_and_superior_planets), i.e. its orbit lies outside that of Kerbin, it does not pass through phases in the same way as Moho and Eve. Duna is never seen in less than a 76% gibbous phase. Duna is full when it and the Sun are on opposite sides of Kerbin, an alignment called [opposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_%28planets%29). This is also the time that Duna is closest to Kerbin, reaches its maximum brightness, and can be seen high in the midnight sky. Duna\u0027s apparent brightness at opposition varies between magnitude -1.7 and -2.5, depending on Duna\u0027s distance from the Sun. Duna\u0027s brightness decreases dramatically when not near opposition, dimming to as little as magnitude \u002B1.5 when farthest from Kerbin.\n\nWhen at its greatest distance from Kerbin, Duna\u0027s disk subtends an angle of just 3.7 arcseconds. At opposition, however, Duna\u0027s disk grows to a size that subtends an angle of between 16\u0022 and 22\u0022. The larger apparent size is seen during the more favorable perihelic oppositions, which are those that occur when Duna is near its [perihelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perihelion_and_aphelion). Perihelic oppositions occur about once every 15 years.\n\nThrough a telescope, many light and dark markings can be seen on Duna\u0027s surface, as well as white [polar ice caps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_ice_cap). With astronomical seeing limiting resolution to 1\u0022 features as small as 30 km can be seen. By following features on its surface, Duna\u0027s rotation period of 18.2 hours is precisely measured. Since this period is approximately the length of three Kerbin days, each night Duna will show a face that is about 1/3^rd^ of a rotation different than the night before.\n\nDuna retains a substantial atmosphere. It has an effective temperature of -58 ^o^C, though its surface is likely warmer. We can probably assume that Duna\u0027s daytime surface temperatures would be revealed by infrared observations. Duna\u0027s albedo is 0.17, which suggests it has little cloud cover.\n\nIke\n\n**Mean distance from Duna:** 3,200 km  \n\n**Orbital period:** 18.2 hours  \n\n**Diameter:** 260 km  \n\n**Mass:** 2.78\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003E\u00D7\u003C/font\u003E10^20^ kg  \n\n**Rotation period:** 18.2 hours  \n\n**Albedo:** 0.14  \n\n**Effective temperature:** -56 ^o^C  \n\n**Atmosphere:** none\n\nIke is the fifth largest moon in the solar system, but the largest in both diameter and mass when compared to its parent planet. Ike is about 40% of Duna\u0027s diameter and 6% of its mass. Ike orbits closer to its parent than any other moon. Duna and Ike are tidally locked to each other, with each keeping the same hemisphere facing the other.\n\nIke is the only moon beyond Minmus that is commonly visible to the naked eye. At perihelic opposition, Ike shines at magnitude -0.4, which is about 1/7^th^ the brightness of Duna. With Ike and Duna separated by as much as 3.7 arcminutes, it\u0027s possible to spot them as separate bodies. One has to wonder if ancient Kerbals would have correctly interpreted the movement of these lights as one body orbiting the other, and what influence this may have had on their early models of the solar system. Humans had to wait for [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei)\u0027s telescope before a similar observation could be made.\n\nThrough a telescope Ike\u0027s disk is seen to subtend an angle that ranges from 1.5\u0022 to 8.8\u0022. This is large enough to observe light and dark patches on its surface.\n\nThe regular movements of Ike result in some interesting events that are visible from Kerbin. A *transit* occurs when Ike moves across the disk of Duna. A *shadow transit* occurs when Ike\u0027s shadow moves across Duna. An *occultation* occurs when Duna covers the disk of Ike. And an *eclipse* occurs when Ike moves into the shadow of Duna.\n\nDres\n\n**Mean distance from Sun:** 40,839,000 km  \n\n**Orbital period:** 5.204 years  \n\n**Diameter:** 280 km  \n\n**Mass:** 3.2\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003E\u00D7\u003C/font\u003E10^20^ kg  \n\n**Rotation period:** 1.6 days ?  \n\n**Albedo:** 0.12  \n\n**Effective temperature:** -118 ^o^C  \n\n**Atmosphere:** none  \n\n**Satellites:** none\n\nDres is a small planet that varies in apparent brightest from magnitude \u002B6.4 to \u002B3.5. It can be seen with the naked eye during oppositions but is unspectacular. Its disk subtends an angle that ranges from 0.9\u0022 to 2.7\u0022. Through a telescope it is large enough to be seen as a tiny disk, but too small to observe any surface features. A small brightness fluctuation occurs every 1.6 days, indicating that there may be a patch of lightly color material on its surface that regularly passes into view as the planet rotates. Because Dres\u0027 gravitational effects are so small, its mass is not well known.\n\nJool\n\n**Mean distance from Sun:** 68,774,000 km  \n\n**Orbital period:** 11.37 years  \n\n**Diameter:** 12,000 km  \n\n**Mass:** 4.233\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003E\u00D7\u003C/font\u003E10^24^ kg  \n\n**Rotation period:** 1.67 days  \n\n**Albedo:** 0.52  \n\n**Effective temperature:** -170 ^o^C  \n\n**Cloud temperature:** -100 ^o^C ?  \n\n**Atmosphere:** Yes, hydrogen?  \n\n**Satellites:** 5\n\nJool is by far the solar system\u0027s largest planet. Its mass is more than 16 times the mass of all other planets and moons combined. Its diameter is ten times Kerbin\u0027s diameter. Despite its great size, Jool is significantly less dense than the other planets. This suggests that it has an entirely different internal structure, consisting not of rock and metals, but of highly compressed lighter elements. The term [gas giant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_giant) has been coined to describe Jool-type planets.\n\nDespite its great distance from Kerbin, Jool is so large that its disk subtends an angle of 29\u0022 when farthest away and 48\u0022 when closest. Jool\u0027s size and high albedo makes it the second brightest planet in Kerbin\u0027s sky. Jool\u0027s apparent magnitude ranges from -1.6 to -3.0.\n\nWhen viewed through a telescope, all that can be seen of Jool is an impenetrable veil of clouds. This cloud surface is green in color with varying light and dark shades forming horizontal bands and swirls. If Jool has a solid surface, it is presumed to be deep beneath the thick atmosphere. Jool\u0027s effective temperature is -170 ^o^C, though astronomers may learn through infrared studies that its cloud layer is considerably warmer. The higher than expected temperature would suggest that Jool emits heat of its own.\n\nOf considerable interest when observing Jool is its family of moons. There are five in total, listed in order of distance from Jool: Laythe, Vall, Tylo, Bop and Pol. The three innermost are large enough to be planets in their own right. All three are bright enough to be seen with the naked eye, though their closeness to the much brighter Jool makes this very difficult. When observing these moons through a telescope, one can frequently see transits, shadow transits, occultations, and eclipses.\n\nLaythe\n\n**Mean distance from Jool:** 27,000 km  \n\n**Orbital period:** 2.45 days  \n\n**Diameter:** 1,000 km  \n\n**Mass:** 2.94\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003E\u00D7\u003C/font\u003E10^22^ kg  \n\n**Rotation period:** 2.45 days  \n\n**Albedo:** 0.3  \n\n**Effective temperature:** -160 ^o^C  \n\n**Surface temperature:** \u003E0 ^o^C ?  \n\n**Atmosphere:** Yes\n\nLaythe is Jool\u0027s closet and second largest satellite. It is comparable in size to Kerbin, having 83% of Kerbin\u0027s diameter and 56% of its mass. As seen from Kerbin, Laythe\u0027s apparent magnitude varies between \u002B4.4 and \u002B3.0. Its disk subtends an angle that ranges from 2.4\u0022 to 4.0\u0022. Laythe is in [orbital resonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_resonance) with Jool\u0027s second and third moons, Vall and Tylo. The three moons orbit in a 4:2:1 resonance.\n\nBecause of its small apparent size and lack of large-scale surface variation, a telescopic view of Laythe probably appears rather featureless. However, this doesn\u0027t mean that astronomers are clueless about its surface composition. Different surfaces (soil, ice, water, vegetation, etc.) have different spectral reflectance signatures. Since Laythe is almost completely covered by a global ocean, it\u0027s possible that Kerbals would detect evidence of this liquid surface in the light that it reflects. It should also be noted that Laythe\u0027s albedo of 0.3 suggests that clouds contribute significantly.\n\nThe presence of liquid on Laythe\u0027s surface requires a substantial atmosphere and sufficiently warm temperatures. Observations would confirm the existence of the atmosphere, but Laythe\u0027s effective temperature is only -160 ^o^C. If the liquid on the surface is water, then Laythe requires a source of internal heat, possibly generated by [tidal heating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_heating). Laythe is undoubtedly the subject of much discussion among Kerbal planetary scientists.\n\nVall\n\n**Mean distance from Jool:** 43,000 km  \n\n**Orbital period:** 4.91 days  \n\n**Diameter:** 600 km  \n\n**Mass:** 3.11\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003E\u00D7\u003C/font\u003E10^21^ kg  \n\n**Rotation period:** 4.91 days  \n\n**Albedo:** 0.5  \n\n**Effective temperature:** -169 ^o^C  \n\n**Atmosphere:** none\n\nVall is Jool\u0027s second moon by distance and third by size. From Kerbin, Vall\u0027s apparent magnitude varies between \u002B4.9 and \u002B3.6. Its disk subtends an angle that ranges from 1.4\u0022 to 2.4\u0022. Through a telescope, Vall appears as a tiny featureless disk.\n\nVall\u0027s high albedo and low density differentiates it from Laythe and Tylo, and suggests that Vall is likely composed of a substantial amount of ice. If Vall\u0027s interior is tidally heated, it may contain subsurface liquid water. Vall shows no evidence of an atmosphere. Calculations show, however, that Vall is capable of retaining at least some atmosphere. Its close proximity to massive Jool means that Vall is almost certainly tidally locked.\n\nTylo\n\n**Mean distance from Jool:** 68,500 km  \n\n**Orbital period:** 9.81 days  \n\n**Diameter:** 1,200 km  \n\n**Mass:** 4.23\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003E\u00D7\u003C/font\u003E10^22^ kg  \n\n**Rotation period:** 9.81 days  \n\n**Albedo:** 0.1  \n\n**Effective temperature:** -153 ^o^C  \n\n**Atmosphere:** none\n\nTylo is the largest satellite in not only the Joolean system, but the entire the solar system. Its diameter is equal to Kerbin, but it has only 80% of Kerbin\u0027s mass. From Kerbin, Tylo varies in apparent brightness from magnitude \u002B5.1 to \u002B3.8. Its disk subtends an angle that ranges from 2.9\u0022 to 4.8\u0022.\n\nClose up views of Tylo shows what appears to be small variations in surface brightness between its eastern and western hemispheres. It might be possible for astronomers on Kerbin to detect these very slight changes as the planet rotates. If so, following these variations would confirm that Tylo\u0027s rotation is tidally locked to Jool. Tylo is certainly large enough to retain a substantial atmosphere, but none has been detected. It is the largest solar system body not to have an atmosphere.\n\nBop\n\n**Mean distance from Jool:** 128,500 km  \n\n**Orbital period:** 25.2 days  \n\n**Diameter:** 120 km ?  \n\n**Mass:** 3\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003E\u00D7\u003C/font\u003E10^19^ kg ?  \n\n**Rotation period:** 25.2 days ?  \n\n**Albedo:** 0.25 ?  \n\n**Effective temperature:** -160 ^o^C ?  \n\n**Atmosphere:** none\n\nBop, the fourth moon of Jool, is in a highly eccentric and [inclined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_inclination) orbit. Its maximum brightness at opposition is magnitude \u002B7.9. Bop is too small for telescopes to resolve its disk. It is assumed to be tidally locked to Jool.\n\nFrom its measured brightness and small gravitational effects, astronomers can make a best guess estimate of Bop\u0027s diameter and mass. Furthermore, stellar occultations by Bop can provide additional information about its size, though these events happen rarely. The characteristics listed above are a fictionalized example of the type of uncertain numbers that astronomers might derive.\n\nPol\n\n**Mean distance from Jool:** 180,000 km  \n\n**Orbital period:** 41.8 days  \n\n**Diameter:** 100 km ?  \n\n**Mass:** 2\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003E\u00D7\u003C/font\u003E10^19^ kg ?  \n\n**Rotation period:** 41.8 days ?  \n\n**Albedo:** 0.4 ?  \n\n**Effective temperature:** -160 ^o^C ?  \n\n**Atmosphere:** none\n\nPol, the farthest moon of Jool, is in a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit. Its maximum brightness at opposition is magnitude \u002B7.8. Pol is too small for telescopes to resolve its disk. Like Bop, Pol\u0027s size and mass are estimated from its brightness and small gravitational effects. Pol is assumed to be tidally locked to Jool. It is believed that Pol and Bop may be captured asteroids.\n\nEeloo\n\n**Mean distance from Sun:** 90,119,000 km  \n\n**Orbital period:** 17.06 years  \n\n**Diameter:** 400 km  \n\n**Mass:** 1\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003E\u00D7\u003C/font\u003E10^21^ kg  \n\n**Rotation period:** unknown  \n\n**Albedo:** 0.5  \n\n**Effective temperature:** -182 ^o^C  \n\n**Atmosphere:** unlikely  \n\n**Satellites:** none\n\nAmong the orbits of the seven planets, Eeloo\u0027s is the largest, most eccentric, and second most inclined. The orbit is so eccentric that Eeloo\u0027s perihelion lies inside the orbit of Jool. As seen from Kerbin, Eeloo\u0027s apparent brightest varies from magnitude \u002B7.5 at its farthest to \u002B4.5 at its closest. Eeloo\u0027s disk subtends an angle of between 0.7\u0022 and 1.6\u0022.\n\nWhen near its closest distance to Kerbin, Eeloo can be spotted with the naked eye. Through a telescope it can be resolved into a tiny disk. Eeloo shows no features or brightness variations, thus its rotation period is unknown. Eeloo has no known satellites and its gravitational effects are very small, thus its mass is not well known. Eeloo\u0027s composition likely includes a substantial amount of ice.\n\nEeloo\u0027s distance from the Sun and high albedo makes it the coldest place in the solar system. Its effective temperature varies between -167 ^o^C at perihelion and -192 ^o^C at aphelion. No atmosphere has been detected but, because of the very cold temperatures, the possibility of a thin atmosphere has not been completely ruled out.\n\nImagery\n\nAs a final exercise I Photoshopped some images that depict what I think the moons and planets would look like from Kerbin. I sized the images so that the image resolution matches normal naked eye or telescopic resolution. For example, naked eye resolution is typically 1 arcminute, so Mun, which has an angular size of 115 arcminutes, was sized to be 115 pixels across. For telescopic views the resolution is 1 arcsecond. Of course it is possible to increase magnification, but this won\u0027t increase resolution. You\u0027ll just get a bigger and fuzzier image, much as would happen if you simply zoomed in on the images below.\n\n[Composite.png (750\u00D71500) (braeunig.us)](http://www.braeunig.us/KSP/Astronomy101/Composite.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-06-02T04:04:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2024 04:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jun 2\u0022\u003EJune 2\u003C/time\u003E by OhioBob**"},{"CreatedByName":"GarrisonChisholm","CreatedById":146403,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T21:59:13Z","Content":"Awesome work Bob!

The Wiki seems to limit itself to things that are actually in the game. To say something like \u0022at perihelic oppostion Duna shines at magnitude -2.5 and subtends and angle of 22 arcseconds\u0022 is just hypothetical and is not something that is depicted in the game or that can be experienced while playing the game.
