As a consequence, I got pretty good and building boosters and upper stages. After delivering a module, I usually deorbit the upper stage, but I saved a few of them in lower orbits for later. They have enough fuel and RCS to be used for some other mission. What have use used your upper stages for, besides their original purpose?

The problem is that if you have struts connecting two parts of a craft that decouple, although the struts do break so the decoupling works, they don\u0027t just break off from one of the two halves, they break off from BOTH, leaving a bit of strut debris. Now, if the only place you strut is on the lower stages that fall back down, then that\u0027s not a problem. But if you have to strut together upper stages that don\u0027t fall back down, for example you\u0027re doing an Apollo style mission and your lander and command module need to be separable, then all those little bits of strut debris stick around.
