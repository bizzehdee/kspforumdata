Since most of my learning in KSP has been through trial and (violent) error, I haven\u0027t really resorted to watching the Youtube for tutorials, with the exception of docking. As I originally came into KSP through the (0.13?) demo, and then through a .15/.16 version of the game on a borrowed computer I had never dealt with it. Then I purchased the game for myself in .19 and I just couldn\u0027t figure out docking for the life of me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I haven\u0027t heard him mentioned, but before I\u0027d heard of Manley, I had been watching \u0027KSP with Stomp,\u0027 and it was his videos that showed me some of the finer points of docking. The guy\u0027s also got an excellent speaking voice and some entertaining videos to boot. Unfortunately, he dropped off the face of the Earth a couple months ago and I\u0027ve heard nothing of him since. Having recently started watching Manley\u0027s videos, I can say they\u0027re both on par with each other for entertainment value, although Stomp doesn\u0027t have the added physics explainations or Scottish accent (both of which I enjoy).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-12T07:45:37Z\u0022 title=\u002207/12/2013 07:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by espm400\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4 IN 1","CreatedById":1540,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T04:39:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile I learn most of the things from the forum, Scott videos helps me to build my first Mun lander that didn\u0027t blow up before landing lags is a thing, his video also helps me a lot on proficient my docking skill.
