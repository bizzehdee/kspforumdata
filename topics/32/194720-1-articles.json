(this is even MORE true with modded parts like the Air-Augmented rockets from, I think, Mk2 Expansion: which, realistically for a ducted rocket,\u00A0perform better at high speeds not only in terms of Thrust, but \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have engines you only ignite at high altitude\u002Bspeed (or simply don\u0027t throttle all the way up until you reach high speed/altitude due to heating issues, aerodynamic stability- particularly with dynamically unstable designs that become less stable at higher speeds, or not having your wings rip off due to aero forces in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E!) then the Shock Intake curve suddenly looks a lot more appealing: note these curves are for constant altitude- the Shock curve ends up being flattened (in terms of rate of IntakeAir production) by reduced air density at higher altitude...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther things notable:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The Divertless Radial Supersonic Intakes appear to have the smallest performance-drop of any intake other than the Shock Intakes between Mach 3 and higher speeds (the slope of their curve is much more gradual, even controlling for their lower peak), making them often the second-best choice for high-speed planes (as well as great for fine-tuning *precisely* how much intake you have, so you don\u0027t have any more than needed...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Engine Pre-coolers have, surprisingly (and unrealistically, given the whole POINT of using them in real life would be\u00A0high speed\u002Baltitude performance) a steeper curve relative to the amplitude of their peak than the Adjustable Ramp Intake (aka the stock RAM-effect intakes).\u00A0 This makes them more poorly suited for high speed/altitude operations, at least as intakes (again, this is unrealistic- and the dev\u0027s ought to rebalance these to make them more useful).\u00A0 That being said, form-drag (from frontal cross-section mainly) becomes much more punishing at higher speeds, at least in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E, so they actually do work well at high speed planes- but for all the wrong reasons (in real life, Pre-Coolers aren\u0027t even intakes at all, but allow you to cool/compress airflow before it reaches the engines so they \u0022think\u0022 they\u0027re actually operating at lower speeds/altitudes.\u00A0 This would be easily simulated in KSP by simply having them decrease the airflow speed and altitude any engines they are connected too \u0022see\u0022- and indeed this is EXACTLY how they used to or still do work in KSP-Interstellar, which included special code to make pre-coolers work realistically: at least in older\u00A0versions for sure...)\u00A0 In real life, they would produce a lot of intake Drag (as you slow the airflow more) and provide no direct intake functionality- yet be CRITICAL for a horizontal-takeoff spaceplane ascent...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- On the topic of pre-coolers, again: there has been some mention that they are highly heat-conductive (wicking heat away from engines), yet this is somehow a BAD thing (as it causes them to absorb more heat from the atmosphere).\u00A0 It seems to me most players don\u0027t understand the Stock heat conduction system well, or how to use this properly.\u00A0 The best parts to attach pre-coolers to (on the other side of the engine) are large, heavy parts with a lot of cross-sectional area (so these parts in turn can pass the heat they absorb from the pre-coolers to other parts).\u00A0 This is entirely because the Stock heat model assumes an entire part is all at a constant temperature, to make the calculations manageable.\u00A0 Anyways, this makes good parts to attach Pre-Coolers to things like the long Mk2-Mk1 adapter, the Mk2 Bicoupler, the flat (rear) end of Mk3 parts, or especially large cross-section mod parts with inline 1.25 meter nodes (like the \u0022Stail\u0022 to 2.5 meter adapter with shoulders in OPT Aerospace, or the Mk4 Adapters in Mk4 Expansion...)\u00A0 The parts they are attached to should, ideally, in turn be attached to even larger parts (like a\u00A0Mk2-3 adapter in front of a Mk2 Bicoupler).\u00A0 The key is to wick heat away from the pre-coolers as quickly as possible so they can wick more heat\u00A0away from the engines in turn.\u00A0 Not that engine overheating is THAT big of a problem in Stock (except for with the NERVA nuclear rockets- a part intake air precoolers would be USELESS for in real life, unless you were air-augmenting them... Or modded nuclear turbojets, like those in Mk2 Expansion- where at least the use of pre-coolers is realistic)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The Small Circular Intake has a relatively flat curve that LOOKS like it would be well-suited to high-speed operations: but in reality they tend to explode at high speeds, as they have terrible heat-tolerances...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-13T23:00:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2020 11:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
