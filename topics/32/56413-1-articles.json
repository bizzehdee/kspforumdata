Basically, a lot of spaceplanes use jets to build up speed and an LV-N in orbit, but getting from one to the other can be problematic since the LV-N\u0027s thrust sucks. My 25-ton spaceplane originally put two of those radials on the back as well (angled so that their nozzles were exactly inside the jets), to be used briefly to get to orbit. (Then I installed the HOME mod, which has a similar 110kN radial engine with only 0.5 tons of mass but less thrust vectoring. So now I use those, and I\u0027ll probably switch to SABERs in 0.23.) I\u0027d also use them on my very heavy designs just to add better steering to ships relying on engines with weak vectoring, but the flywheel change makes that unnecessary now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"makinyashikino","CreatedById":96244,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T23:23:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spatzimaus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spatzimaus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the radial engine is extremely useful for three reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1\u0026gt; It\u0027s a 120kN engine for 0.9 tons, which is not the worst ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; It\u0027s got great thrust vectoring (3 degrees)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3\u0026gt; You can mount it anywhere\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah it has good Thrust, but the ISP on it is TRASH, it\u0027s like using a mainsail for interplanetary travel, it\u0027s incredibly inefficient.
