Far enough you can\u0027t even see anything, yet the system still wastes resources on calculating it which \u00A0slows things down. Players actually used to move away from complex vehicles during reentry, to turn off the plasma and bring back the framerate up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere should be a compromise with distance involved. Increase it if you will, but don\u0027t make it infinity. It serves no purpose and ruins framerate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"swjr-swis","CreatedById":152460,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-30T14:11:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a heads up: it\u0027s unclear what you are suggesting/asking here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nDo you want the VFX to disappear, just at a different distance?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOr do you want the background calculation of the VFX to stop as soon as they disappear?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second one sounds like a no-brainer and I\u0027m in favour of stopping the game engine from calculating stuff it is not actually using, especially when it\u0027s just visual stuff that has no effect on the physics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first one I\u0027d like to be a slider of some kind in the graphics settings - let us adjust ourselves the max distance at which the VFX are rendered.
