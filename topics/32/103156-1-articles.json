A combination of both engines might be a better lifting design.\n\nThat\u0027s not quite true, the KR-2L do generally have better ISP in atmos too, despite their stats.\nThe S3 KS-25x4 has a listed ISP of 320 atmos and 360 vac, the KR-2L is 280 and 380, making the first sound better for atmos work. However, this is not binary, where a switch between ISPs happens at edge of the atmos. In fact, the KR-2L reaches an ISP of 360 by 8km! Meaning that it has better ISP everywhere except the first 8km. Admittedly, with a big rocket, you can use a lot of fuel by 8km, but the better TWR makes up for that over a whole launch.\n\nSo, for a heavy lifter, there really is no reason to use the S3 KS-25x4 over multiple KR-2Ls, apart from part count.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E May I ask what parts those are connecting either the Mainsails or KR-2L\u0027s?\n\nFor the KR-2L\u0027s I use a \u0027Mk3 to 2.5m Adapter Slanted\u0027 with a \u0027C7 Brand Adapter Slanted - 2.5m to 1.25m\u0027 on top. These are half-clipped into a S3-7200 tank, along with a fuel duct. \n\nThat\u0027s for aesthetics, though the tanks are obviously useful.

I\u0027m recording it here in case anyone else is interested, sorry to go off topic. \n\nI built two ships. Both with 8000kN of thrust and 24 x S3-14400 tanks. One with S3 KS-25x4s and the other with KR-2Ls. I wanted to see how they compared to 10km and 100km orbit. \n\nHere\u0027s how they compared:\n\n**S3 KS-25x4**\n\n![Dmik9H9.png](http://i.imgur.com/Dmik9H9.png)\n\n25 engines give 8000kN thrust.\n\nVehicle weight: 2217t (1968t fuel \u002B capsule etc)\n\ndV: 4746 atmos, 5340 vac at launch\n\nAt 10km\n\ndV: 2832/3186\n\nWeight: 1205t\n\n100km Orbit \n\nCouldn\u0027t get it to orbit, out of fuel. Flew like a drunken pig, probably not helped by the minimal gimbal range. Had to add reaction wheels (also added to other craft for fairness) just to keep it vertical. \n\n**KR-2L**\n\n![xNuZepw.png](http://i.imgur.com/xNuZepw.png)\n\n32 engines give 8000kN thrust.\n\nVehicle weight: 2182t (1968t fuel \u002B capsule etc)\n\ndV: 4317 atmos, 5858 vac at launch\n\nAt 10km\n\ndV: 3024/4104\n\nWeight: 1363t\n\n100km orbit \n\nFlew nicely to orbit, helped probably by high gimbal range. \n\n1092dV left\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn all ways, the KR-2L ship out-performed the S3 KS-25x4 ship. It weighed less, used less fuel to 10km and to 100km orbit. It handled better. There are attachment points on the bottom of the engines. It even looked better. Much quieter too.\n\nI know you wouldn\u0027t usually take S3 KS-25x4 to orbit so that\u0027s not a great test but the 10km results are significant."},{"CreatedByName":"Johnny Wishbone","CreatedById":118096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T12:02:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E For the KR-2L\u0027s I use a \u0027Mk3 to 2.5m Adapter Slanted\u0027 with a \u0027C7 Brand Adapter Slanted - 2.5m to 1.25m\u0027 on top.
