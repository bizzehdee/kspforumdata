As the school where I am teaching bought some Arduino boards half a year ago, this could be a chance to finally learn to program the little buggers. If it turned out ok, I could invest in hardware myself, otherwise no harm would be done. Initial tests quickly decided that a throttle could be build in about 10 minutes, using already supplied code from zitronen. But his program hinted at several other interseting functions, so I started planning, buying, wiring, coding and learning a lot about the Arduino, eventually ending up with this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i278.photobucket.com/albums/kk100/kanonfutter/KSP%20Controller/P7014868_zps226781ca.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022P7014868_zps226781ca.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis controller is made of an Arduino and the aforementioned Dual Shock that gave its life for the advance of all Kerbalkind.

Also, a few buttons is missing in above table, but the principle is far more important than the actual numbers. Had I needed more buttons, I would have torn apart a keyboard from a junkyard, locally they go for around \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C2\u00AC4. Anyway, it is fairly straightforward to solder wire to the points, and then to the relevant pushbuttons. Two microswitches sit on either side of the small wooden stick that controls RCS forward/back for a digital joystick.\u003Cbr\u003EMy workbench:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i278.photobucket.com/albums/kk100/kanonfutter/KSP%20Controller/DSC_0004_zps3f44a78a.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DSC_0004_zps3f44a78a.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EMounting is done after painting, so the board is lifted on blocks covered in cloth. I have no acces to PCB, so the resistors are soldered to nails in a chipboard. Surprisingly, it works. I am very happy I invested in ten different colors of wire, though. Note the wires soldered to the gamepad as described above.\u003Cbr\u003EThe onedimensional roll stick was made of a 10k potmeter, springs from a couple of ballpens and some wood:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i278.photobucket.com/albums/kk100/kanonfutter/KSP%20Controller/DSC_0007_zps334c331e.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DSC_0007_zps334c331e.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAssembly like this:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i278.photobucket.com/albums/kk100/kanonfutter/KSP%20Controller/DSC_0016_zpsdb9e92ec.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DSC_0016_zpsdb9e92ec.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIt is a bit hard to control, I think that a better rounding of the bottom would have been good.

The box itself is wood, the top is paneling of some kind bought cheap in a DIY shop (a miscut, got 50 cm x 150 cm for \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C2\u00AC4), spraypainted with grey primer.\u003Cbr\u003EFor code, I took zitronens code and modified it to my own use. As they are, they are hardly useful for anybody, but a few things to note:\u003Cbr\u003EThe switches are set in groups in parallel, each with a unique resistor. That makes it possible to read a value on an analogue pin and assign the relevant controls for the activated switches. In order to activate diodes, a given control is activated when the circuit to the analogue pin is broken. \u003Cbr\u003EI bought my meters as very cheap (\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C2\u00AC3) analog meters 0-1 mA. The turned out to react nonlinear to a PWM pin, so I made a few readings of PWM vs meter and made a 5th order polynomial fit. Works fine. Additionally, the radar altitude is on a logarithmic scale in the code to cover precision at low altitude with higher range.\u003Cbr\u003EThe change in acceleration is checked by storing current acceleration every 100 ms. The program checks against the previous value, and if the difference is above 0.1 G, the warning led is turned on. I tried to make and exception if the throttle had been moved, but for some reason it does not work. Investigations pending.\u003Cbr\u003EChange in battery level is done against last packet, and divided by gametime since last packet.\u003Cbr\u003EThe ascent warning is done in a piece of code like this:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E if (WarnSelect == true \u0026amp;\u0026amp; 6*planet[planetSelect][1] \u0026gt; VData.Alt){ //-----------Only for low altitudes\u003Cbr\u003E if (VData.Vsurf \u0026gt; 1.1*sqrt(912400/planet[planetSelect][0]/pow(2.718,(-VData.Alt/planet[planetSelect][1])))) {\u003Cbr\u003E digitalWrite(VHLED,HIGH); //------too fast\u003Cbr\u003E digitalWrite(VLLED,LOW);\u003Cbr\u003E }\u003Cbr\u003E else if (VData.Vsurf \u0026lt; 0.9*sqrt(912400/planet[planetSelect][0]/pow(2.718,(-VData.Alt/planet[planetSelect][1])))) {\u003Cbr\u003E digitalWrite(VHLED,LOW); //-----too slow\u003Cbr\u003E digitalWrite(VLLED,HIGH);\u003Cbr\u003E }\u003Cbr\u003E else {\u003Cbr\u003E digitalWrite(VHLED,LOW); //-----just right\u003Cbr\u003E digitalWrite(VLLED,LOW);\u003Cbr\u003E } \u003Cbr\u003E }\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E  int planet[5][2] = { {66,3000}, {293,7000}, {1874,10000}, {100,5000}, {99,4000}};\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Ethe planet[][] array is acceleration of gravity divided by ground level pressure, and scale height ot atmosphere, by planets with atmosphere.

I had to get wire, resistors, leds, everything. I did not know about cheap alternatives to the original Arduino brand (Mulbin uses a Fundino with good results). Further, I changed design a couple of times, so I have some stuff left over. That, and bying locally, ended up at a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C2\u00AC150 price tag. If you go EBay and have a bit of equipment to start with, I reckon it would be half that. I plan to do an upper bar for controlling action groups and a couple of displays, and I think I can do that for \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C2\u00AC50, even including a clone of the Mega board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@smalldiaphragms: There is absolutely no space left under the hood. I mounted everything on the backside of the panel for easy acces and hardware debugging, so the area in the middel is the Arduino, below the blue buttons is resistors for the swithes, above them resistors for leds, the entire right hand side is the gamepad and my joysticks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor some reason yellow notes have problems sticking to the surface.
