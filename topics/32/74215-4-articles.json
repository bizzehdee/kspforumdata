It seems like the 64 bit Unity player still has some work to to go with compatibility with certain graphic cards and driver sets. Plus there are some graphical glitches that need to be sorted out before a supported release. The glitch with the Astronaut Complex is one such example (speaking of which, this seems like a video buffer bug with the x64 unity player, such as the program not flushing the buffer out like it should.
