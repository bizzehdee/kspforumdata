It does make tinkering a little tedious, and I\u0027ve found HE enourmously enhanced my gameplay just for tinkering purposes (now in 1.1.2, I\u0027m back to getting to orbit, then editing the save file to change the reference body and SMA... a little more tedious for tinkering, easier than all the timewarping to windows and all the stuff to get to a planet to test though... like I did with my first duna missions)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#2) This may be true for Dres, but there\u0027s no moon with an atmosphere, some of the aerostuff is fun, but then you may say that can be done on kerbin... there\u0027s nothing to really *do* anywhere except see the sights, and conquer the challenges.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#3) Is this not true of Mun and Minmus, or do you consider those two more detailed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you don\u0027t run career saves, then you should have no problem starting a sandbox save and just time warping to the time and through the transfer... if something else strikes your fancy, it doesn\u0027t have to be in the same savegame, you don\u0027t have to put off the timewarp to a transfer window or through the transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway... I do play career a lot, and the reason I haven\u0027t visited Dres, Jool, or Eeloo/the outer planets (OPM mod)... is time and the transfer windows. I don\u0027t like timewarping doing nothing in career when there\u0027s other stuff I could be doing... so... my eve mission is just arriving now, my moho mission just got back, my dres mission is nearly there, my jool missions are still on the way (the probes are nearly there, the kerbals just left kerbin and will take a while), my Duna mission is awaiting the return window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only planet I\u0027ve been to and back from is moho.. because its the shortest, and the transfer window happens the most often.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo me, the main thing that puts me off from launching or completing interplanetary missions (outside of sandbox), is the transfer window. When I think of all the time my kerbals will spend there waiting for the return window as well, I then want to make it a more substantial mission, which rapidly snowballs into a very major effort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wonder if a planetoid at L4/L5 would be a good addition as the next step after mun/minmus, but before Duna/Eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the transfer would be quite different from what one does for other missions (making its \u0022training value\u0022 dubious), the advantage would be that there is no transfer window... you can depart at any time for almost the same dV (exactly the same if it has absolutely 0 inclination and eccentricity)... just like Mun and Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt could at least get players comfortable with going farther away from kerbin, and the more complicated way that one returns to kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think we\u0027re of a very similar mind here, KerikBalm. I\u0027m not playing much KSP these days but when I did play, I preferred a career-alike style of game, regardless of which game mode I was actually playing. I too dislike timewarping ahead, doing nothing - at least for interplanetary length journeys. And like you, I have that hankering to make the mission more substantial, which then becomes a bigger effort than I really have time to put into. I guess I could run single missions in Sandbox but then I hit that psychological \u0027why bother\u0027 barrier. Set up a proper interplanetary mission, land kerbals on another world - then pick up some rocks, look around for a bit and timewarp till its time to go home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027ve taken the lazy way out. I\u0027ve put probes around Moho, Eve and Duna and I had some in transit to Dres and Jool on a couple of (now abandoned) games. So I can \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E interplanetary, I\u0027m just not particularly motivated to do it with kerbals. The idea of doing a proper,\u003Cem\u003E The Martian\u003C/em\u003E style epic journey to Duna always seems way more appealing in my head than it does when I open the VAB and have to get started.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnswering your queries:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.\u00A0 Yes - finding transfer windows is part of it but more generally, it\u0027s the lack of guidance (transfer windows are helpful but can be ignored with sufficient delta-v) and general discoverability for interplanetary missions. As you pointed out, you can depart for the Mun or Minmus at pretty much any time you like - and it\u0027s not too hard to figure out what to do just by playing with the Map, especially now with the improved tutorials. That discoverability doesn\u0027t really extend to interplanetary flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.\u00A0 Agreed - it\u0027s all about the journey rather than the destination.

Less exotic than other planets perhaps, but let\u0027s consider for a moment that before you reach space, KSP is already an incredible engineering, exploration and flight simulator, with a rich and fascinating environment to navigate. Games are all about escapism - exploring the surface of Kerbin could be a game all by itself.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen I started playing KSP, I was particularly fascinated with the movie Apollo 13, and wanted to try recreating the crafts, vessels and transfers of the Apollo missions. I think this is probably a good approximation for the expectations of many first-timers coming to KSP. Even if KSP was still just the Sun, Kerbin and Mun you could spend thousands of hours and still not see or do everything it has to offer. My point is, you set and pursue your own goals in this game, so if reaching Mun and returning is the pinnacle of your achievements, that could actually be the \u0027end game\u0027 scenario for many players.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne thing I have noticed is that since Career was released, I\u0027ve felt pressured to play KSP \u0027properly\u0027 by primarily playing Career mode. Gradually I\u0027ve come to realise that this actually puts a real damper on my creativity and enjoyment of the game, because it\u0027s so constrictive about what missions you conduct and where you can afford to get to. For many players who didn\u0027t experience pre-career mode KSP, I suspect that they also (wronly in my view) assume that Career is KSP as it\u0027s \u0027intended\u0027 to be played, and this assumption is just another way of piling bricks on that learning-curve-cum-wall.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLastly, going interplanetary doesn\u0027t need any mods - I\u0027ve been to Eve, Jool\u0027s moons, Duna and Dres all in stock crafts (admittedly not in career mode/since 1.0). I haven\u0027t often returned from those places, and it was a hell of a learning curve to understand how inefficiently I was doing this, but essentially it was just a question of bolting on more fueltanks until I had enough to get somewhere and then messing around with the manoeuvre planner until I got an intercept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Curveball Anders","CreatedById":107529,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-17T11:56:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222586430\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022139943\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221463481555\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022156079\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kertech\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Kertech said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel it\u0027s docking that holds people back, you could build an interplanetary vessel as soon as you have docking ports in career mode!

I didn\u0027t even know what dv was, so of course I couldn\u0027t return to orbit. Like Rocketeer, on my rescue mission I strapped on moar boosters and had at it. With success came stupid courage. I went to Moho with the rescue ship.... and couldn\u0027t make orbit, so moar boosters.

After the first initial difficulty hump of getting to orbit, followed by getting to Mun/Minmus, the next step desired is interplanetary.
