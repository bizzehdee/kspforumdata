Atmospheric values will have to be in a range. They always were before, of course. The \u00224500\u0022 value for Kerbin was really more like \u00224500-5000\u0022 depending on TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you have TWR, drag, how far you must divert from ideal ascent to avoid flipping out, and who knows what else? I think 3500 is a good benchmark, but really I think we should be designing our craft to get wherever they must go from LKO, and then do the rest by trial and error (oh so much error).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T11:39:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve just been subtracting 1000m/s from the old maps for ascent from Kerbin, works well enough for reasonably aerodynamic craft.
