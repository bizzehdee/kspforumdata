Trouble was I;d put the thing together in too much of a hurry, and only realised when well on the way to Minmus that it lacked a few things. Like extra batteries, or some solar panels. So no reaction-wheel control. And I\u0027d fluffed my trajectory a bit, so was low on both fuel and monopropellant. Free return, or try landing anyway? Land! Within minutes I\u0027d made another fluff - forgetting that I had no SAS due to the lack of electrickery, and not keeping my eyes on the game, the ship had slowly rotated and was now trying to escape Minmus rather than land on it. kill engines, and re-evaluate. Can we still make Kerbin? Really not sure.. howsabout MNimus? Well, it;s rather tight, but with a \u0027suicide burn\u0027 landing we should just be able to do it. So, down we went. Except I had misjudged, but didn;t realise until a tad too late to push it back into a Minmus orbit. Main engine fuel ran out somewhere between 1 and 2km, so I was using attitude thrusters for all they were worth, and trying to ignore the fact that the ship still had 30ms-1 sideways velocity, whcih would normally be sufficient to cause a catastrophe all by itself. The ground was closing fast - I didn\u0027t think we were going to make it. So I ordered one of my Kerbals to EVA, thinking I might save at least one of them with their jetpack. Too late! BANG! The EVA\u0027d kerbal was launched into space, and I winced every time he hit the ground, expecting him to die every time. But no! He actually survuved! I;d no sooner got him onto his feet when, enter stage left - the nose of the ship hove into view, sliding along the ice and ground to a halt just metres from my much-bounced Kerbal. Two landing legs were damaged and the main engine plus monoprop tanks had gone, but I discovered later that the legs could be repaired, and I flew some spherical monoprop tanks up from Kerbin. I salvaged solar panels and some batteries from obsolescent gear cluttering up the terrain near my base, and managed to use the ships reaction wheels and thrusters to get it onto its legs. Shortly thereafter, it successfully returned to Kerbin with Science! I only realised later that the sideways velocity was probably what had saved both the ship and my poor bruised Kerbal - if they\u0027d hit at 90 degrees to the surface, theyd almost certainly have been destroyed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-09T19:27:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d say one of my most memorable accidental wins was this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn my first trip to Duna (my first manned-interplanetary trip, in fact), I got myself into an eccentric orbit around the planet, and detached my lander.
