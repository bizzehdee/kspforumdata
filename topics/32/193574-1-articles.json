After restarting the game, I want to undock again, first null reference exceptation, then Stack overflow, this time it didn\u0027t crash.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI start asking\u00A0discord for help, on guy suggest to remove autostruts, so i did, but the most bizarre stuff is coming.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, I undock and the two module separates, but when i switch, I could only switch between the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003Essto\u003C/abbr\u003E and the base. The two base modules separate further, i even turn one of the module, but it is still one\u00A0craft. I timewarped and what, the hitchiker module\u0027s parts starts disorts, it crash into the lab. And worse is that no matter how many time I quickload the same thing happens and the base won\u0027t undock, the game just keep saying Null Reference or Stack overflow. I decide to change to other bases/ stations and attempt undocking, but it was normal, i switch to a future save where the base was aligned, but I can\u0027t undock that base.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth from the quicksave base and the future base starts with the hitchhiker module before the science module docks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI first suspect the stack separator, terminated the stack separator and the same thing happens to the base. Another thing to suspect is the hitchiker module since it was mostly fixed, I can\u0027t turn that module. The last suspect is the cargo bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLog:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/128lbVBjugsjNHsK-bK2ycEphFuanqUrB/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/128lbVBjugsjNHsK-bK2ycEphFuanqUrB/view?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuicksave ( where all the madness come from an undock button):\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KgcmCKquiwq7Iau6JiOG0067wxofsZnm/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1KgcmCKquiwq7Iau6JiOG0067wxofsZnm/view?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-04T01:28:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2020 01:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Sirius K\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"releansol","CreatedById":153963,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-09T12:30:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe this helps (for me it has)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022137308\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed8776821202\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/133971-win-kml-persistence-file-editor/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:211px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arthur106","CreatedById":203096,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-10T21:51:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t have any luck with KML when I had a similar problem with docking ports.\u00A0 Basically, I had ship A and ship B docked together and couldn\u0027t undock them.\u00A0 I created a temporary save file with new versions ships A and B on the launch pad.\u00A0 Then I went into the problem save file, deleted the entire code blocks of Ship A and Ship B, then pasted in the A and B code blocks from the temporary save file, changing the ship positions to match their desired locations.\u00A0 It was a headache for sure, but it fixed my problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost save files are going to have dozens (or more) of vessels and it will be hard to find your ship.\u00A0 You can make this easier by going into KSP and renaming the problem vessel something unique like \u0022myvessel123456789\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-11T04:41:44Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2020 04:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by arthur106\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"archiebald","CreatedById":195579,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-10T23:14:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKML has an auto repair function that works a lot of the time, but sometimes it cannot fix the issue.\u00A0 However, it is still useful for diagnosing and pinpointing the error even if you have to manually edit the savegame (which you can do quite effectively in KML as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
