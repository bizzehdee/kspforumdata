The fuel tank ratios were specifically calculated to achieve it\u0027s mission. In this case, to be able to achieve orbit with the Apollo missions. It was then constructed to those design specifications. Had they realized in the design phase that they, for whatever reason, needed 20% more oxidizer and 20% less fuel in the first stage they would have adjusted the internal tank geometry to accommodate that alteration. They would not have thrown up their arms and said \u0022Well guys, our pre-packaged ACME brand tanks are the wrong size, somebody better tell Kennedy that we\u0027ve got to scrap the moon mission.\u0022 NASA didn\u0027t operate that way, the Soviets didn\u0027t operate that way, and SpaceX doesn\u0027t operate that way.\u003Cp\u003EAgain, no one is asking for this to be changeable in flight. That would be completely unrealistic, I agree. However, in the design phase (AKA VAB/SPH), there\u0027s no reason that the internal tank geometry couldn\u0027t, and wouldn\u0027t, be modified to suit the particular mission that tank is intended for within the volume limitations of that particular tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, consider the possibilities of using a single tank holding liquid fuel, oxidizer, AND monopropellent as a service module, as was done with the Apollo missions. That\u0027s what tweakables should ideally allow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy comments were purely from the construction side, not flight side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy analogy is not irrelevant. As you pointed out, the Saturn V was designed to achieve a specific heavy-lift role. To that end, its tankage, engines, and electronics were custom made for each rocket in the series as NASA and contractors made small changes. That is not Kerbal Space Program. We take pre-built parts, slap them together and hit the go button for space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAllowing tweakables to change the internal tank sizes goes against that pre-built mentality that the game is built around. I mentioned the car modifications because I feel this is a similar mindset. Most people don\u0027t go to a shop and custom-build their gas tank, even for one-of cars. They buy pre-built fuel cells and find a spot for them in the car. Need two kinds of gas? Then buy two cans, because it\u0027s a lot easier and cheaper than trying to split up the one you\u0027ve already got.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I am for allowing us to change what fuel types are allowed in each tank. You can store almost anything in a tank, assuming that it\u0027s been properly purged and filled according to spec (magic handwave), but I feel that changing the internal tank structure gets too far away from the pre-built mentality. If the developers do want to allow changing tank internals, then I hope it costs a boat-load of money, because it would balance out that kind of power.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-13T23:23:36Z\u0022 title=\u002212/13/2013 11:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by csiler2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Egrammar\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycix","CreatedById":76916,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T23:25:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut if you are building your own tanks anyways, it\u0027s not that hard to change the length of each can.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"csiler2","CreatedById":62800,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T23:37:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Psycix\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Psycix\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EResizing a fuel tank is not hard.\u003Cp\u003EYou use the same end caps, plumbing and intertank structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing that is different is the length of the cylinder walls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can use the exact same joining techniques and assembly process.
