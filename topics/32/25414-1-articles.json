I mean, the Kerbin texture was updated from that ugly puke-green grass way back in 0.14, and then once again in 0.18, but there\u0027s still no visual change in the space center?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr is it just because the devs are waiting to change it when they introduce the new buildings?

Until then, you can just say that the grass around KSC is more yellow because it constantly gets killed by rocket exhaust and radioactive nuclear engines destroying the DNA of the grass itself \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RazorWolf19","CreatedById":62293,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T15:20:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s an interesting way to think about it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E. However, I think you misunderstood me. When I said that the space center scene hasn\u0027t been updated, I didn\u0027t mean the actual space center in-game, I meant the selection screen when you start the game (where you can choose the VAB, SPH, Launchpad, Runway and Tracking Station facilities).
