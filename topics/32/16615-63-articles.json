It looks great on the dark side, but to see it on the day side after every single Apollo astronaut says you can\u0027t see stars on the daylight side of Earth or the Moon without optics. It just goes against the principles of the way the eye works...

( it has the most moons so it would make the most sense in my mission to go there.) also, theoretically speaking, it\u0027s so lightweight it may be able to land on multiple moon\u0027s in one mission, maybe even all of them in jool\u0027s orbit, as long as one of them isn\u0027t the water moon \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SLAMS","CreatedById":27519,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-11T00:13:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nhnifong\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nhnifong\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPower landing on kerbin is tough because the drag tries to flip you over, and the gravity is quite high, If someone doesn\u0027t come up with a drag solution I\u0027ll just have to put my Eve landing legs on the top.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolution, use \u0022backwards\u0022 fins on your lander that separate after landing.
