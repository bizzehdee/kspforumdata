I want to apologize if I have offended you with my previous comment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirstly, in real astronomy, astrometrics, let\u0027s say that Jupiter had a moon, Europa, that was equivalent to Laythe (I sure hope \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/126740-gaarst/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022126740\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/126740-gaarst/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Gaarst\u003C/a\u003E isn\u0027t going to read this). There aren\u0027t any real way for this to happen, and to show you this, I will use the two probable things that could contribute to Laythe and you\u0027ll see why they cannot happen...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nJupiter is actually a brown dwarf (this means it is hot enough to generate infra-red and invisible spectrum light, but not hot enough to generate visible light). This would provide enough heat to make a moon warm enough to support a liquid water ocean but creates another problem. That moon would not have enough light to support having blue skies. If Jupiter did give off enough light to create blue skies, it would fry that moon because its orbit is way too close (supposing we are talking about Europa) to the planet - or at this point - star, since it would no longer be classified as a planet. It would also mean at night, we would see a second sun in our sky. The Earth would never have another dark night again...\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe second possibility would be that the inner core of the moon, using Europa, has a hot molten core and much of its mantle would have to be molten too. The problem with this scenario is that the crust would be nearly too warm to support liquid water (it would evaporate whenever it hit the surface, think the volcanoes near Hawaii or any other body of water... or even Yellowstone National Park in the U.S. - this cauldron actually is evaporating the large lake that sits on top of it. What water does remain has a high salt/mineral content.\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nWith the case of the Yellowstone cauldron, the water that still exists is extremely salty/full of minerals. It is a heavy water. In this scenario, this is probably the type of water that would exist.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe atmosphere would be very turbulent as upper layers rapidly descend because cold air does just that. Warmer air, heavy in water vapor content, rapidly rises. You\u0027d have a lot of storm activity and clouds, thus rarely having a blue sky. Think of the cloud thickness of Venus for a good approximation.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStill would not have a blue sky because of the distance from Europa to the sun. At best, you might have the pre-twilight sky (supposing you do not have cloud cover).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI hate to tell you this, but Laythe simply could not happen in real life as it is in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-25T15:14:26Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2016 03:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by adsii1970\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-25T15:14:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222822633\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022150793\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221477403558\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002289014\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022adsii1970\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, adsii1970 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, I know...

Therefore, I\u0027d situate the Kerbin system in a rather small spiral galaxy (everything is too small, so why not galaxies?), maybe a bit closer to the centre than the Earth system is (bulge appears \u0022taller\u0022, so it could mean it\u0027s closer).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout the dense planets, I don\u0027t know why they are so dense.

Being unwilling to learn is one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy guess is that Laythe used to be a Europa-style moon, with a big layer of ice coating it. For some reason, there was a gravitational disturbance which sent it flying close to Jool; very close. So close that the gravitational pull\u00A0of Jool almost ripped it apart (tidal forces). This immense strain on the planet\u0027s core could have been sufficient to heat it enough to trigger intense volcanic activity, heating the planet. The heat could have been enough to melt its ice layer, releasing gasses that formed an atmosphere.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe problem with this theory is that I have no idea of the actual number involved, especially if a major tidal event could have such effect. I know that tidal heating is a thing (tidal forces exert forces on a planets interior, heating it by friction) but I don\u0027t know if it can happen at such scales.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIo is very similar to this case (tidal forces of Jupiter and the other 3 Galilean moons heat it, giving it an intense volcanism) but it is still far from being as hot as Laythe. Though Io\u0027s tidal heating is regular, while what I described is an exceptional event, this could be enough to justify the difference, but it also means that Laythe will eventually freeze again. (Note that tidal heating is the main argument for Europa having a liquid ocean below its surface, though we\u0027re still far from having a surface ocean and a thick atmosphere)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222822747\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022150793\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221477407799\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002289014\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022adsii1970\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 minutes ago, adsii1970 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirstly, in real astronomy, astrometrics, let\u0027s say that Jupiter had a moon, Europa, that was equivalent to Laythe (I sure hope \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/126740-gaarst/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022126740\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/126740-gaarst/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Gaarst\u003C/a\u003E isn\u0027t going to read this).

For some reason, there was a gravitational disturbance which sent it flying close to Jool; very close. So close that the gravitational pull\u00A0of Jool almost ripped it apart (tidal forces). This immense strain on the planet\u0027s core could have been sufficient to heat it enough to trigger intense volcanic activity, heating the planet. The heat could have been enough to melt its ice layer, releasing gasses that formed an atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem with this theory is that I have no idea of the actual number involved, especially if a major tidal event could have such effect. I know that tidal heating is a thing (tidal forces exert forces on a planets interior, heating it by friction) but I don\u0027t know if it can happen at such scales.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIo is very similar to this case (tidal forces of Jupiter and the other 3 Galilean moons heat it, giving it an intense volcanism) but it is still far from being as hot as Laythe.

Thus, we can expect a lot of tidal heating. This, earlier in Laythe\u0027s history, would have led to rampant volcanism (similar to Io). As gravitational influences from the other Joolilean moons perturbed Laythe\u0027s orbit, it moved a little farther out, experienced less tidal heating, and volcanism ceased. However,when they were active, volcanoes spewed greenhouse gases such as CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E, water vapor, and methane into Laythe\u0027s atmosphere. This means that, even though Laythe is far from Kerbol, it traps most of the heat it recieves and is warm enough to melt its icy crust. After Laythe became habitable, lithopanspermia may have spread life from Kerbin to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
