It\u0027s a challenge, with possibly very large rewards. For a software engineer, that\u0027s irresistible.

It would be a MASSIVE amount of coding, and not the fun kind either.

The scanning, mapping, and resource distribution are the big ones. After that, its just a matter of part configs and coordinate lookups. If you wanted, you could use the kethane API to make that entire resource chart pretty easily, I think. All that would be missing are models for various drills and refineries. (I am not trying to bash kethane at all, or saying that it was trivial to do. I\u0027m just saying that expanding it into a larger resource system is trivial, given what it has already accomplished.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I think that they changed their mind. And I think they KNEW people would be unhappy, and of course they don\u0027t want to intentionally cause unhappiness. So, they must have some reason to do so. I imagine its probably because multiplayer, if it is going to be implemented well, really has to be in the core game.

Its really frustrating watching these threads go off on tangents while you know it only hurts our chances in the future to get tidbits of info from them. I know for a fact the tone throughout this thread is not helpful for anyone. If a Dev actually started reading this they would probably just stop after seeing some of these absurd comments.

All this is literally coming after KerbalKon which they gave us like 48 hours of constant streaming with so much interaction with devs. No game that i know of has this type of development interaction in the world. That is why I have been sticking with it. Its like a full on experience. Whats more if the community members don\u0027t like something in the game (or lack their of) then Squad has given us other outs by the ability to heavily mod the game. Each update they usually throw many things in for the modders. It is seriously possible to add this resource system that everyone is complaining about. I think all of the fellas making such a fuss need to relax. Lets get a grip and look at the situation (Situation being listed at the top of this paragraph). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn top of all this, the major complaint i think im taking away from this thread is the gripes about resources. Have the complainers actually watched the video? I saw it and my take from it was this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey began exploring the resources system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey got so far on it that they sent a screenshot of it during a squadcast. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomewhere along the line it became clear that the system being developed (in its current form) was not what the dev team desired. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the dev team didnt like the resource system (in its current form) they put it on back burner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther priorities are being implemented before they come back to the resource system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResource system will be something different then before likely easier and better thought out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to me, i dont see what is wrong with what they did. They started making the system and didn\u0027t like it. Clearly they arent going to release what was...because it was not what they liked. To me it seems like the complainers are seeing the above like squad is just flat out dropping resources which was not what was said. And if they dont think that then they are upset over the fact that they liked what the screenshot contained and are upset that it wont be included like it was but stock. And if you saw the screenshot they released in 0.19, i dont see what is stopping a modder from putting it in. Squad clearly didn\u0027t like the system so they arnt going to make that stock. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think a lot of this energy would be better served if the people would get together and make a mod instead of flat out insulting the developers of the game for not doing something they already did but didn\u0027t like (If that makes sense). At the very least i would hope my post brings some perspective to people. Its not all lost for a resource system and i guarantee the devs are thinking of better stuff more to their liking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry about grammar and whatnot, i wrote this with one eye open as its 5 hours past the time I usually sleep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETl/DR: Clearly Squad loves it community, relax, the devs will come back and put in a resource like system in which they enjoy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedCowboy","CreatedById":92106,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T09:05:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am probably just a small % of the community, (baby boomer), but I think Squad is doing a great job at developing this game!

The negativity from some people that I\u0027ve seen in this thread is frankly disgusting! Kudos to the rest of the community that \u0022get it\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is a pre-release, early access, unfinished, extremely cool game. Squad have always been perfectly clear that it\u0027s far from finished, and that the features list constantly evolving over time (which goes both ways, features added, features changed, others delayed or even removed). There is absolutely no dishonesty, misleading, unethical, or any other sort of bad behaviour coming from them over features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad quite clearly do value and listen to the community, but that\u0027s the community as a whole, not individual community members trying to dictate what they are going to work on next. Resources might seem like the most important next feature to you, but you are not the community, and you don\u0027t actually know how difficult it would be for them to implement resources right now, or even exactly what their long term plans for resources are. The KSP development team is TINY, yet some community members seem to expect them to produce features at the rate of a vastly bigger team. All that we know for sure is that we\u0027re probably not going to get resource mining in the next couple of releases, but that further into the future is yet to be fully defined. Developing with a small team makes it essential to focus efforts in relatively narrow areas, and that frequently means that some things need to wait until the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrankly, I\u0027m happy for Squad to focus on getting career mode fleshed out, boosting performance significantly, and generally squashing bugs. They appear to have a pretty damned good set of immediate priorities for KSP, things which matter, things which make KSP better for everyone. Once the current priorities are sorted out, they will move on to the next set of features, and that could easily bring resource mining back to the table. Until then, quit moaning and quit being negative, it\u0027s a horrible waste of energy that serves little to no purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP 0.23 could be a complete product with just a small amount of polish. It would represent good value for money. For those of us that have bought in early, we\u0027ve pretty much all had our money\u0027s worth out of KSP already, and each new release is just a lovely bonus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, well done, Squad, you\u0027re doing a fantastic job with KSP, I\u0027m an extremely happy customer, and I don\u0027t see any signs of you doing the wrong thing, or becoming the evil corporate empire. And, shame on those of you who are being outright nasty to Squad, it\u0027s uncalled for, unproductive, and just wrong. You were never promised or guaranteed any specific timescale for resource mining and processing, and I don\u0027t think that it was ever even guaranteed as a future feature, just something that was being considered (and probably still is).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T09:42:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ilikemoneygreen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ilikemoneygreen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E heck we get full notes from each dev on what they did that week... .....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo game that i know of has this type of development interaction in the world. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurely to squad, we are the fanclub.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A fan club who they like to watch, give news to, and collect ideas from.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
