After trying - unsuccessfully - to salvage my save for the last three days I\u0027ve now given up and resigned myself to that save being lost forever. Since I\u0027m on steam and it auto-updated I can\u0027t revert to 1.0.2. Quite frankly I can\u0027t see myself continuing to play this game from this point on forward.\n\nI\u0027ve expected Squad to do extensive bugfixing for 1.0.3. Especially since they stated time and time again that 1.0.3 was delayed due to the testing effort done by the test team. Instead what we got was a half baked new heating system that doesn\u0027t work and leads to stuff exploding even while sitting on the launchpad. We also got lots and lots of new bugs, while some of the pre 1.0 bugs are still in the game. That the update also breaks existing save files is just the icing on the cake.\n\nYou should never ever release an extensive overhaul of existing systems on a \u0022dot\u0022 update. Doesn\u0027t matter how much the community whines, complains and begs. Especially if you are a small developer and don\u0027t have the resources to hire a 200\u002B people testing team. Push it to 1.1. offer a closed and/or open beta. let the modders and the community help you find and solve your bugs. Then release it.\n\nAs it stands we\u0027ll probably need a version 1.0.5 and 1.0.6 or even more versions until the new heating system works entirely. This means that fixing pre-existing bugs and issues will likely be postponed even further (if they are fixed at all). That is if we\u0027re lucky and there\u0027s no new addition to the game that strikes the fancy of one of the devs and makes them abandon fixing critical bugs for implementing a half-baked heating system upgrade and a handful of poorly done radiators. I\u0027m not looking forward to all the new and interesting kinds of bugs that\u0027ll never get fixed once they switch to Unity 5.\n\nI have no words for how Squad handles maintenance of the core game except to say that they\u0027ve done poorly over the last few months. I can\u0027t see myself continuing to play a game that breaks core gameplay and existing saves with what - by all intents and purposes - should have been a maintenance release and doesn\u0027t even put the time and effort in to make sure things work.\n\nSquad in the future if you do something like this\n\n- announce it well beforehand for gamers to be able to prepare themselves\n\n- offer a closed beta program to modders prior to release so that modders can update their mods and make sure that their code doesn\u0027t break stuff further\n\n- in fact you should always have a beta access program for modders\n\n- offer beta access to players or MVPs to broaden the testing group. Let the community help you find and squash bugs\n\n- if the update breaks existing games give people notice or even better give people the ability to revert to previos stable releases.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nMost importantly: Actually fix the issues people report to you. These forums are full of reports of \u0022legacy\u0022 bugs that have been a part of the game since one beta version or another. Some people have already resigned themselves to the fact that some bugs will probably never get fixed. The fact that a \u0022stock bugfix modules\u0022 mod exists is telling and should tell you that you\u0027re not doing your job actually maintaining your game.\n\nThat a mod like \u0022stock bugfix modules\u0022 exists should also tell you that people - including myself - love your game enough to put up with all of those issues and actually take fixing issues into their own hands. If your game weren\u0027t that great people wouldn\u0027t even care enough to bother fixing your stuff.\n\nDon\u0027t squander all of the passion and love for your game people have"},{"CreatedByName":"Tankman101","CreatedById":144359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T09:58:53Z","Content":"I don\u0027t get the whole \u0022Mechanics shouldn\u0027t be changed on a \\_\u0022 theory.

Unless it is absolutely necessary and there can be no way around it. If you communicate a release as being purely maintenance you should never ever use it to do a major overhaul of an existing in-game system. The reworked heating system they\u0027ve introduced with 1.0.3 potentially breaks many many mods and actually broke a lot of existing game files. \n\nThis has lead to people not being able to play for days or even weeks until all of the mod developers have caught up with the changes introduced in a patch that was communicated as a bug fix release. This has also led to people actually losing their whole progress (potentially hundreds of hours of gameplay) due to save files that are now broken beyond repair. If by some reason you still think you need to do it you damn well make sure that everything works.\n\nThis doesn\u0027t mean that you should never update your game and \u0022forever ride a wave of mediocrity\u0022 as you so melodramatically put it. It just means that you have to plan your release schedule (and effort) accordingly.\n\nA major rework of an existing in-game system should never be done like the way Squad introduced their new heating system. Without any prior warning or announcement and with no way for people to test it and plan for its eventual release.
