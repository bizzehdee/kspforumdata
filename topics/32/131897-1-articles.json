If the root and CoM are very close together as they are in small ships there will be very little to no wobble when a craft rotates. (Even a stationary craft in orbit will rotate once every orbit relative to the parent body.) In large ships relative to the CoM and parent body the root is changing in altitude and velocity which will result in changes in Pe and Ap. The further the CoM and root are apart the larger the individual differences will be. In low orbit the wobble will usually be only a few metres but on interplanetary encounters you could completely miss (or hit \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:0.0:\u0022\u003E) a planet/moon.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo minimize wobble try to design your large craft with the root and CoM as close together as possible.
