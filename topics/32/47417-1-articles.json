The craft was losing altitude, and I managed to land on the island runway, but I landed on the mountain. I EVA\u0027d Bill and he fell down the mountain. After falling and tumbling for 10 seconds, the screen went black and the instruments showed up. The reading kept rolling down from 999,999,999 KM up to 111,111,111 KM up and then stopped at 666,666,666 after rolling through a couple times. I freaked out and exited KSP. After entering again, I went to the tracking station, I clicked on my lander. I focused on the lander, and it was 80,000 KM into space. Bill wasn\u0027t in it. What just happened?
