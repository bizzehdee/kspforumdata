If the gravitational interactions are simulated to an extent, we can have star systems orbiting one another to an extent... hmm. I doubt they\\\u0027ll bother with making a whole entire galaxy, but it would be absolutely awesome if they made it procedurally-generated -- say, when you start up the game, the positions of stars are determined, as well as the number of stars, their mass and type, etc. This would give the game a fair loading time on first load, depending on how many stars it is able to generate. Kerbin, the Mun and Kerbol would be in a static place; a starting point. Then, as you approach a star system, say using a FTL drive, as you\\\u0027re warping towards it, the game uses this time (while your ship is \u0027on rails\u0027 in the limbo of space) to decide whether or not the star has planets, their size, the type of planet, their orbit, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, a procedurally generated galaxy... no doubt we\\\u0027d have some oddities then.
