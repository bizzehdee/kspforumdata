Like just about everyone else, I was super-psyched for the 0.22 update, and to try out SCIENCE. But, having tried it, I discovered that (for now anyway) I\u0027m really just a sandbox kind of guy. I like setting my own goals, and having a full toolbox full of gadgets to muck about with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime I\u0027m thinking of starting a new 0.22 sandbox campaign called Insta-Death, in which my poor Kerbals actually have to suffer the fate of my game-playing decisions and actions. No \u0027Revert\u0027 button, no going back to a saved point, just a lot of new craters and space junk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could see this getting really frustrating, especially once we get into interplanetary exploration (oops, landed on Duna a little hard... time to start over again!), but I think it will be an interesting experiment and will probably make me a better pilot/aerospace engineer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have experience playing in this style?

I somehow managed to detach both the heat shield and the heavy rover just before hitting the water, engage the ascent engine to stop the descent and actually getting back into orbit (with some RCS assistance). Even though the mission was not successful, it was a lot more fun than if I had actually landed.
