But you gotta start somewhere and honoring the old KISS principle, it was found that a Rover could be attached and released by the means of a common small docking port. While experiments in the VAB started with the trusty old Firebrand, it was soon decided to utilize the Lensman instead, as this has substantially more \u0027horsepower\u0027 and payload capabilities. The question if the Rover will survive a launch in the open, just slung low, under a beam, was asked and answered positively.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPlans for a Mun mission were quickly put together. There is really no need for symmetry, the Lensman_G handles it anyway, but the more the merrier, so it was decided to take two Rovers. This would also provide means to transport Kerbals back to the rocket, if one of the Rovers should break down. It would also provide Rover adventures for everyone, in the six-strong crew (Lensman_F and Lensman_G can take a crew of eight).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot2842j.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i445.photobucket.com/albums/qq176/Vermil_01/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot2842j.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Rover is just dropped down onto the Mun surface, from low height. Here we see the first team enthusiastically board their vehicle for some quality Mun exploration, the kind of we\u0027ve never been able to before. The Rovers are four seat, but it has been decided to crew them by three and three. This means that a stranded crew can be picked up by a solitary driver and carried back to the rocket in one single trip, if the need arises.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot2851j.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i445.photobucket.com/albums/qq176/Vermil_01/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot2851j.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Rover clearly changes the experience of the Mun, as it\u0027s now possible to move around over wide areas and take in the dramatic landscape in a way that was not possible before.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot2882j.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i445.photobucket.com/albums/qq176/Vermil_01/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot2882j.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs long as the sun is above the horizon, the primitive Rover has potentially limitless range.

Though one thing my rover experience has taught me is that while deployable solar panels are great for recharging the batteries quickly, the limitations on movement mean they are only useful when you have reason to bring the rover to a complete stop. Might I recommend fixed solar panels? While they do take longer to fully charge, they are constantly active, even while the rover is in motion. The wheels might drain charge faster than those fixed panels can replace them, but the wheels need not be continuously accelerating either: rovers can coast a long way on their momentum, especially when going downhill, and the rover can charge itself up in motion by letting gravity and inertia do most of the work of keeping it going along.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T19:48:55Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Alchemist\u0027][URL]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okCvnFoUups\u0026feature=youtu.be[/URL][/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat is AWESOME! \u002BRep to you.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T19:49:45Z","Content":"\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/4Ow7qoy.png[/img]\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DunaticFringe","CreatedById":146646,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T19:53:59Z","Content":"\nI had a contract to plant flag on the Mun.

I had a few tourist contracts for suborbital hops, a haul contract to take a Hammer to 60km with a reasonably low speed, and two landed parts tests - specifically the small heatshield and the Thumper. This rocket has empty tanks, apart from the solid rockets, and can fit all six tourists and a pilot.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]http://i.cubeupload.com/PnW41Z.png[/img]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]http://i.cubeupload.com/Dx9NXi.png[/img]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]http://i.cubeupload.com/5TO4ui.png[/img]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs it approaches Kerbin at high speed, due to its sharp descent, it needed a little something to slow it down - another Hammer. At about 12km, I fire the retrorocket and descend on a pillar of flame, then the four radial parachutes take over the landing.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]http://i.cubeupload.com/5nUKmv.png[/img]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]http://i.cubeupload.com/hnHdgY.png[/img]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd here\u0026#39;s the end of the second flight, with another six tourists and one pilot, and another heart-stopping braking procedure. Works though. Under 15k funds for a six-tourist suborbital is pretty profitable, really. And it\u0026#39;s got no expensive LFO engines. All solids.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway, using the money earned from this and other contracts, I\u0026#39;ve now upgraded my astronaut complex, runway, and tracking station for the first time this career. Of course, in order to launch this and to have all those contracts at once, I had to upgrade my launchpad and mission control once each, too.\n"}]}
