I have seen threads about weather, light speed, other races, and the likes. But then I remembered the name of the game, Kerbal Space Program. True things like weather would be nice, but what purpose would it serve? Same for alien races. The program is centered on making a space agency from scratch. Getting to local targets and moving out into the solar system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they, (Squad) does add these things, they should be selectable in the options area. Like weather on/off, aliens on/off and the likes. Most of these computers used by the average user I don\u0027t think will be able to handle the load the extra things can put on it. My machine can barely handle 20, it usually loads the mods I use, but will crash after 3 launches. I have taken to copying the program several times and having different versions for different things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game in whole is pretty damn good. Making an agency from nothing and not using certain mods that make things easier is quite challenging. I for example have a moon launch under way. I am not using warp, and the mission is still on going. This can take time, but it\u0027s kinda cool. IMO, I am not even close to space shuttles yet. In fact I\u0027m not sure the moon landing will work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust thinking out loud.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
