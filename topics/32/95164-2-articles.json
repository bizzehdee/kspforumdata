I found the game about 7 months ago and found it very difficult at first, with tutorials I slowly learnt how to build and maneuver my crafts and I was very pleased with myself when I managed to finally land on the Mun. The game frequently crashed, but it was an EA game so I wasn\u0027t surprised. After a week or so of playing I started to install mods and spend more and more time playing KSP. The game was still crashing a lot but I assumed the bugs would be fixed with each update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere were many little bugs, but I bore through them and played the game. With each update the game didn\u0027t get any better and seemed to develop more and more bugs, it seemed that every bug that was fixed brought out 10 more bugs. Buy 0.24 I finally had a somewhat stable game running in x32 with about 25 mods running with it.
