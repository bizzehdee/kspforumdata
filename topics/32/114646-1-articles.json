The chutes on the final landing stage seem to cause no problems but the chutes on the lifter stage are just a death blow to my framerate. This is new, I didn\u0027t have this problem in 1.0.2\n\nAnyone else notice?\n\nEdit-\n\nalso if someone could tell me why my spoiler tag doesn\u0027t work, that would be great\n\nSecond edit- \n\nAdding struts and other stuff to the rocket took upward of 20 seconds per click, clicking the menu to change category, clicking the part, clicking on the ship. 1 minute per strut.\n\nThen when I launched it went back to being full ~60fps\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T12:51:14Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 12:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mastikator**\n  \nupdate"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T12:14:50Z","Content":"Yes, this is a known problem.
