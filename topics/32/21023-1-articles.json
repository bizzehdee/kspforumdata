Is it because I\u0027m using larger tanks and engines to account for the extra weight? Small rockets I have no problem with but the second i start slapping large parts like 3 man landers and large fuel tanks, it\u0027s feel like I\u0027m trying to launch a boulder over a house with a rubber band. I need suggestions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW my standard orbit procedure is to use up my SRBs, wait til my second stage gets me to 300 m/s, turn 45degrees along the 90degree til my height gets to 95km, then tilt to the horizon and burn til I reach a stable orbit. Maybe I\u0027m using too much fuel? What tanks/engines do most of you use to launch sizable payloads long distance?

Just add up the delta-v numbers along the path to figure out what is required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best advice: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Have a well defined mission goal so you can calculate what your required Delta-V for that mission is. Going to the Mun/Minmus are nearly identical in Delta-V requirements. However, going to Duna and back is completely different from Eve, or a moon around Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Start with the smallest possible lander required to get the mission accomplished. Having final stages that are too large just compound problems for your rocket as each stage gets progressively larger, and in effect, less efficient. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Radial stages are by far more efficient than vertical stages. Have fuel lines feed from outer stages to the inner ones. There is a balance between how high you can stack fuel tanks before they get too heavy for lift off vs having not enough fuel to reach orbit. Start with 1 large engine and then try to support it with higher ISP rated engines (in radial stages) even if they have less thrust. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why the Kerbal Engineer Redux is such a great mod. It figures out the delta-v automatically for each stage. Using this in combination with a delta-v map will allow you to know, without testing, whether you have a shot at pulling off your mission with your current design. If you want to land on the mun and don\u0027t have about 700m/s of delta-v in your lander stage, chances are, you ain\u0027t making it. If you dont have about 4500-4700m/s of delta-v total between your launch stages, you won\u0027t reach orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI threw this simple design together as an example of what you might want to start with. Edit: It\u0027s important to note that there are 2 sets of radial stages (each with 3 engines) , they have fuel lines that feed inwards and detach separately when each set empties. This is the efficient way to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiftoff! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4qGxq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224qGxq.jpg\u0022\u003E Orbiting the Mun. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DX24W.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DX24W.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-01T17:52:00Z\u0022 title=\u002210/01/2012 05:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 1, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Ziff\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Peppe","CreatedById":51446,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-01T17:55:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThrust just gets you moving.

More thrust than that will often be wasted in atmosphere if you over throttle (you accelerate into your terminal velocity).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout doing a lot of math you can ballpark your thrust to weight by comparing the thrust / 10, example for your stage one it is 155. compare that to your total mass.

Very good control could get it down to like 4500 m/s. This is a little harder to calculate, so to ballpark just add more fuel tanks if you come up short in a stage. Its more efficient if you can drop empty fuel tanks on the way up, but if not you can always add more fuel and more engines (thrust) to keep your thrust to weight positive (above 1, but again target 1.5 - 2 for ascent). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you are in space you can get away with much lower thrust.

Dunno why. It entails the following. Once you have your travel and lander stage set up and working, you then set about designing your launch and orbit stage. For this, I have a central single large engine (or cluster for small rockets). I mount another set of engines around it. \u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;efficency. by=\u0022\u0022 using=\u0022\u0022 the=\u0022\u0022 fuel=\u0022\u0022 feed=\u0022\u0022 method,=\u0022\u0022 you=\u0022\u0022 maintain=\u0022\u0022 a=\u0022\u0022 supply=\u0022\u0022 for=\u0022\u0022 next=\u0022\u0022 stages,=\u0022\u0022 but=\u0022\u0022 continue=\u0022\u0022 supplied=\u0022\u0022 boost=\u0022\u0022 to=\u0022\u0022 prevent=\u0022\u0022 dead=\u0022\u0022 weight.=\u0022\u0022 when=\u0022\u0022 tertiary=\u0022\u0022 jettison,=\u0022\u0022 ignite=\u0022\u0022 your=\u0022\u0022 primary.=\u0022\u0022 secondaries=\u0022\u0022 have=\u0022\u0022 full=\u0022\u0022 tanks=\u0022\u0022 because=\u0022\u0022 they=\u0022\u0022 got=\u0022\u0022 from=\u0022\u0022 tertiary.=\u0022\u0022 same=\u0022\u0022 run=\u0022\u0022 secondary=\u0022\u0022 go=\u0022\u0022 out,=\u0022\u0022 primary=\u0022\u0022 is=\u0022\u0022 still=\u0022\u0022 fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/9299-Asparagus-Stalk-Booster-%28Longer-Thrust-from-Efficient-Fuel-Lines%29?highlight=innovative\u002Basparagus\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEd Kieth\u0027s Innovative Asparagus Stalk Booster\u003C/a\u003E is described in \u0026lt;/efficency.\u0026gt;\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ETom \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ELogsdon\u0027s\u0027Orbital Mechanics: Theory and Applications\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E and pretty much nowhere else.
