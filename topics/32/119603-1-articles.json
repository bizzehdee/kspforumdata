Maxing out building upgrade costs makes them effectively unobtainable, forcing the player to make do with the tier one buildings for the duration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I understand the OP correctly, this \u0022cheat\u0022 involves unlocking a whole load of tech, such as docking ports, undercarriage and airplane parts. Gathering enough science to unlock all of that stuff on hardcore custom difficulty takes a long time.
