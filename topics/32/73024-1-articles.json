We call it the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, and it basically says that the fuel you carry to propel yourself also has to be propelled in order to be used. This results in a very unfavorable exponential curve wherein you end up using more fuel to push the mass forward the further you want to go.

Even if KSP\u0027s parts didn\u0027t have a mass greater than osmium (the densest material known to man, incidentally), they would still not fare that much better than Earth rockets in trying to reach 7,660m/s with a single stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrDam","CreatedById":93049,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-22T07:09:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo make things simple , the Earth\u0027s minimum velocity of orbitation are 7.9km/s ... for kerbin that are about 4.5km/s ? and that\u0027s doesn\u0027t deal with the velocity loosed by the atmosph\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A8re of Eart\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-22T07:23:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DrDam\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DrDam\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETo make things simple , the Earth\u0027s minimum velocity of orbitation are 7.9km/s ... for kerbin that are about 4.5km/s ? and that\u0027s doesn\u0027t deal with the velocity loosed by the atmosph\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A8re of Eart\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELKO velocity is ~2.3Km/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELEO velocity is ~7.5Km/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrag and Gravity losses on kerbin amount to about 2.2Km/s stock, and about 1.2Km/s with a more realistic drag model.
