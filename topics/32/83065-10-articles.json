We already have the physics model in place and some are happy with that for the way they play, and we have a mod (FAR, NEAR, or whatever else is out there) for people who want a more realistic flight model. What if there were both in the stock game and the player was able to pick what one they wanted to use? Remember they people on the forums represent a small minority of the player base, and those that want a proper aerodynamic model make up an even smaller percent of an already small percent of the player base. Making a game that only pleases 1% of its player base is a very bad model to follow, but likewise pleasing the majority is never a good idea either.

I noticed this when people asked for an engine that could switch modes to make space planes with and the same people complained that the RAPIER was too powerful, yet it was what thy were asking for to being with. Also the same goes for the asteroid pack and wanting bigger parts, and I am sure there have been complaints about the contract system as well.
