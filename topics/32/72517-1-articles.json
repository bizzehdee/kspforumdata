I was doing a resupply to my space station in LKO with 5 fresh crew, a small tug to leave up there and a boatload of RCS fuel - I don\u0027t know the total mass but it was pretty heavy. The small docking port on the station sticks out on a boom of three fuselage sections, and the command pod on the shuttle has a shielded docking port on it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormally when I dock I get within about 4 clicks, fire towards the target at 30m/s and stop about 150m away. Then comes some hopeless flailing about while I eyeball the shuttle\u0027s orientation before switching to docking mode, and even then I can sometimes still burn a ton of RCS getting lined up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis time was different. I managed to get an encounter 300m away, braked within 30m, spun smoothly into the right orientation first try, set the docking port as my target, had to make only little corrections to get everything to line up on the alignment indicator (awesome mod by the way), approaching at 1m/s. A few tiny RCS tweaks and about 90 seconds after braking to meet the station I tapped the action group to open the shielded port and switch the lights on and had a perfect, and I mean perfect, docking. Perfect speed, perfect alignment; the magnetic coupler could have been turned off entirely. Just instantanous tap and dock with almost zero wiggle. It was amazing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the way back down I accidentally deorbited the shuttle\u0027s hitchhiker container with one of the crew still in it.
