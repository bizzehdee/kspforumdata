Far from \u0022redundant\u0022; it\u0027s the only tank available that can share space in the stack with an engine. This makes for more compact staged designs than can be achieved with cylindrical tanks, and that\u0027s important in landers.\n\n I\u0027m cool with cloning it or retasking something else... but I use the round-8 and there\u0027s nothing else that can do what it does.\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"timandy1","CreatedById":140459,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T21:58:28Z","Content":"I Vote to save the LFO donut!"},{"CreatedByName":"KN_Namida","CreatedById":90069,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T22:22:23Z","Content":"Count me in as well.
