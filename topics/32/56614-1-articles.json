If it\u0027s a terminal descent for the module they\u0027re on, they stay deployed--no point in complicating things with retraction motors if the whole thing\u0027s gonna burn up/crash, right? Likewise, if they\u0027re on a descent stage for a two-stage lander, and the ascent stage has its own solar arrays, they stay deployed \u0022to simplicate and add lightness,\u0022 as Colin Chapman put it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, any solar arrays that actually need to be used again *after* entry are closed before entry and stay closed until touchdown (or at least full parachute deployment, on one-way atmospheric probes to the inner planets). It\u0027s an engineer thing--keep it as simple as possible to meet the specs. IRL, you might even choose to include a second set of post-landing solar arrays, letting the cruise-phase arrays break up during entry and deploying the post-landing arrays... well, post-landing, IF that\u0027s seen as less of a complexity/weight penalty than outfitting the cruise-phase arrays to retract and then deploy again. (And don\u0027t laugh--getting solar arrays to fold back up to restow themselves is a pretty difficult task. Ever try folding a road map back up one-handed? That\u0027s basically what you\u0027re doing. Deployment is relatively easy. Restowing is hard enough that when they replaced the Hubble\u0027s solar arrays on the first servicing mission, they didn\u0027t even bother trying to restow them--even though it WAS equipped to do so--they just rotated them to not interfere with the Shuttle when they captured it, then disconnected them while still deployed.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
