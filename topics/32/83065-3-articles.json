The idea of a trip to Mars which would expose the crew to more than a year of radiation has been discarded by NASA because it would expose the astronauts to an unacceptable cancer risk. \u0022Total\u0022 realism would have to deal with it.

Forget all the discussion about how jets are represented in the game. An aircraft that carries the weight of jet engines and fuel plus liquid fuel rockets and their fuel and achieves orbit without dropping anything is unrealistic. A spaceplane carried to the upper atmosphere by a carrier aircraft and refueled before injecting itself into orbit is, OTOH, more realistic, but also requires changes in the game as we can\u0027t currently fly a detachable spaceship while also returning the carrier aircraft to the airfield.

However, that requires a better docking system which doesn\u0027t wobble and some KAS/Infernal Robotics analog which allows in situ assembly and disassembly. On top, we have multiple launches. Some players might find launching a lot of standardized rockets which work perfectly over and over as something fun. Some other players do not.
