I haven\u0027t been around much the past year or so. As for donwloading, I\u0027m not even going near that server until tomorrow when the rush is done, and the fact my weekend starts then....I sense a distinct lack of sleep in my near future lol. I am not complaining about the downloading at all, it is something I expect when there is a new update, been playing since 0.15 and every time have had trouble getting it until a day or two later, but well worth the wait \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerrM\u00FC","CreatedById":78387,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T00:46:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4m sorry, that some people still have problems with the download, but I have to be cruel and say:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4m playing 0.24 for 2 hours now, and I am pretty impressed.
