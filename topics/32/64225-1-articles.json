The result is that the asteroid tumbles past Kerbin in a random trajectory. This may in very rare cases lead to collision courses, yes. And maybe once in a blue moon an asteroid will auto-capture itself into some form of orbit that lasts a small while before a close pass by one of the moons ejects it again. Most of the time though I\u0027ll wager you\u0027ll be scrambling to try and intercept an asteroid passing through somewhere between Mun and Minmus on a highly inclined, very fast hyperbolic trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInteresting will be to see what happens with asteroids you don\u0027t capture. Since the game will keep spawning more over time, you might end up with quite a lot of them in a solar orbit intersecting Kerbin\u0027s.
