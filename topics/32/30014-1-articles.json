Sorry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am fed up with the feeling of having rockets and space stations made of rubber. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFact: there is no way to apply a significant torque to any part of a rigid object in space by applying a force at a given point of this object. Not sure whether my english is ok here so I can rephrase it: if you push an object in space you don\u0027t bend it, you move it or you turn it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is absolutely no reason (except collisions of course...) why any rocket or station should bend or dismantle in space. We should be able to build space station as big as we want, to build rocket as long as we want without worrying about their integrity as long as we managed to bring them to space. We should not have to use several docking ports or quantum struts, this is nonsense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I can go even further in this direction : rockets sould be completely rigid objects, not sets of objects linked with springs. This spring model is (I guess) complex, unrealistic, brings nothing to the gameplay, and most likely increase the risk of bugs (explainable spinning or wobbling...). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would be more than happy to get your opinion and the opinions of the dev on this point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sapphire","CreatedById":67918,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T15:58:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe the issue with this is that the problem is caused by the game\u0027s engine, which Squad doesn\u0027t make.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T16:02:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually there are many reasons, and if you\u0027d taken a look around the forums you\u0027d have seen a few already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStructures can bend in space if an uneven force is applied, such as from misaligned engines, as the parts further from the center of thrust have their own mass and inertia.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAttachment nodes are as stiff as the Unity game engine currently allows, until Unity makes them more rigid they will still flex.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EASAS will over-correct and cause oscillations, making your station harlem shake to pieces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou cannot have the multi-part craft that help make KSP the fun game it is and still expect absolute rigidity, not currently anyway though that will change in the future, so use struts to reinforce your craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust because you don\u0027t see the reasons why craft wobble doesn\u0027t mean they don\u0027t exist \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, closing for now, this subject is getting somewhat stale.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
