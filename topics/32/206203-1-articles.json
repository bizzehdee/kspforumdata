I saw a big boom when I turned one of my trucks 180 degrees inside its own trailer (I jackknifed the trailer, or it would have if I had turned on same vessel interaction), then decoupled the trailer. It exploded and started spinning around. That\u0027s different though, more of a Kraken thing since there were hundreds of parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThe Kraken\u0027s \u003Cs\u003EScania\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0Kania!\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I agree with The Aziz. The biggest part probably has the biggest explosion. I recommend fuel tanks. They are some of the biggest parts and contain tons of flammable materials.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
