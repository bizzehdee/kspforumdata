For example when I highlight one of them instead of that piece being highlighted it now highlights the 4 boosters that are connected to it. This results in a major failure when trying to launch the rocket, it basically just sits there on the launch pad with each phases doing nothing as I try to launch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to fix the issue I\u0027ve been having to start the build over from scratch. I hope the way I explained it makes sense, if not maybe I can make a video of it happening and post it for review.

There is a known and in my opinion quite serious bug that can occur when using symmetry that I think may be at the heart of this - that comment is a guess but if you know about, keep a look out for and ultimately avoid the symmetry bug you\u0027ll avoid most of the assembly bugs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made this video showing the symmetry bug back in 0.20.2, sadly, the bug remains in the current version of KSP \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/b7yQZsatPnM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xub313","CreatedById":57408,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T20:44:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s a staging issue, you can Ctrl \u002B click to select individual parts in the staging editor.
