(Except for blatant game bugs). That more than anything else ramps up both the challenge and the sense of achievement, when you know that one false move will at best mean flying the whole mission again, and at worst means a zillion credits go up in smoke or a bunch of Kerbals die. On the minus side I find it slows my progress down a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next most important thing, for real difficulty, is probably a modified solar system. Preferably something that either adds significant inclinations, or makes Kerbin a moon with no moon of its own, or even both. Either way it makes transferring to other worlds considerably more complex. And if those worlds are new too, then you don\u0027t know how to land on them.

To address the science and tech tree issue, probably the best way is a modified tech tree that will require a lot more science to unlock everything. Dropping the science gains is likely to make the early game too grindy, although if I\u0027m using extra science parts such as DMagic I drop the science gains enough to compensate for that. And you\u0027ll want the comms system on its strictest settings and a life support mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut no reverts and modded solar system are my big two.
