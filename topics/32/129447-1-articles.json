Since the beginning, I felt the game is meant to be played as a space program, not a space mission simulator. So it\u0027s logical to have multiple missions at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot forcing myself, I find that an approaching window triggers the desire to go to that place, as soon as you start to go interplanetary. Further more, if you use play with space stations, you usually have to refuel them, collect science or manage crew rotations, so you need to use every transfer window. For example, When I played the beta as science game mode (easier for newbees), after visiting Duna, I wanted to go to Eve. But the window was in more than a year away. I noticed that the Jool window was in 20 days, so I dropped the Eve mission and build a big mission to Jool (a 13 flights space station assembled around Laythe to explore the whole Jool system). I played 2 full weeks on that mission (design \u002B exploration). As there was an Eeloo window few days later, I sent a exploration vehicle there too. As the voyage was long, I had a chance to go to Duna again. And finally, as 1.0 was approaching, I never find the time to get there \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt feels the game is meant that way, but offer very few tools to do so. There is no KAC-like feature, and experience, science system and many contracts are very \u0022Kerbin centered\u0022. The Tracking Station is also missing some kind of grouping objects by \u0022mission\u0022 (BTW is there a mod for that ?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW, recently I did a test mission to Jool in a creative game, I found the game much easier and quicker to handle as there was nothing else to bother than the mission. KAC was only comfort an not a necessity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my question is how do you play KSP ? Despite its name, do you feel the game is designed to be played that way ? What features on that matter do you think the game lacks ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hannu2","CreatedById":154334,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-07T09:14:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI play multiple missions when I came to interplanetary phase.

It takes so many years between maneuvers. Actually I have sent a probe to Neidon in all versions since Neidon came in OPM but I have always changed to next version and started a new game before probes have arrived.
