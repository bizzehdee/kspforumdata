It shows Vall being flung off very fast. 1:20 is the time it leaves Jool. Barycenters by the way is where objects orbit each other. The Moon orbits Kerbin\u0027s barycenter, which is in the center. Charon, a moon of Pluto, orbit\u0027s a barycenter outside of Pluto. This makes a binary system. The barycenter for the Joolian system is in the middle of Jool. But, when nbody physics is added, the gravity of Tylo and Laythe move the barycenter out of Jool, making all smaller moons including Vall orbit this barycenter. Since the barycenter is close to Vall, it travels really fast near this barycenter. It gets flung out with gravity."},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T00:33:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Vall should have been ejected from the Jool system.\n\nOut of curiosity, has anyone done the math on this?

I don\u0027t want to comment on the accuracy of those simulations or statements, but my gut instinct on the Joolian subsystem is that even if it\u0027s unstable, it should be a relatively simple matter to re-order the muns so that they aren\u0027t flinging the light ones out into the main system. Perhaps by sorting \u0027em by mass, with Tylo on the inside, then Laythe, then Vall... \nAnyhow, I think the weird density issue pales compared to the lack of inverse-square light falloff.
