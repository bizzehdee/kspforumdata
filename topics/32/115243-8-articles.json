Yes the autopilot was falsely handeled by the crew before someone else points that out ... but it was the autopilot.

My being disabled means I appreciate the help of Mechjeb. Even if you don\u0027t use it, most say they appreciate the work of the modders.\n\nLive and let live.\n\nWhen .90 came out, and before Mechjeb was updated, I did decide to put my Sputnik into orbit by hand, you know, to welcome in the space age for my Kerbals. I did it, piece of cake, and WHY was I able to do it? Because Mechjeb taught me how to do it, mind you, it was a funny orbit... but any crash landing you can walk away from is a good one... same for my Sputnik orbit.\n\nI then launched Jeb into orbit by hand, and got him down again safely.\n\nThose two events taught me one thing... for basic seat of your pants flying, its easy. But anything beyond that, I need mechjeb.\n\nOne other thing it taught me... or rather, maybe its because of Mechjeb that I figured out, recently, that I have been playing it all wrong. You see, I never uses SAS or anything like it, so, when playing without Mechjeb, my rockets acted more like a skyrocket with no steering wheel... holding a course was impossible... so, I \\*needed\\* Mechjeb.\n\nBut now, knowing what I do, I probably could pilot a ship to the moon, well, at least a probe, landing is a whole new kettle of fish.\n\nSo... I\u0027ll admit it... using Mechjeb means you learn, but it doesn\u0027t really teach you about flying a spaceship at all... only the basics... THAT would be a good start for noobs... learn the basics. \n\nMechjeb is an AID.... not the answer to everything. I fully intend to take over from Mechjeb at some point in the flight for all my unmanned flights so I can learn to do it myself... even with the disability I have (double vision caused by MS) ... but that is one thing... is NASA cheats, then so will I for all the basic routine flights.

KSP has no function to tell me where I am in my orbit or what my inclination is. I play with mods that give contracts that want VERY specific orbits. VERY.

(hi red shirt) I started without MJ and sloppily learned to orbit and reenter. Once I watched MJ in action a few times I learned how to do these things better. I can, I just usually don\u0027t. The thing is, many times MJ does not behave as expected. For instance, I used the stock Kerbal X for a Mun landing and return. The only change I made was adding MJ (obviously) and radiators because the new areo/heat is killing me - and Jeb way too often. So course corrected for 50k closest Mun approach after transfer burn, warped to the change of SOI node, and what do I find? The ship is on a collision course. Maybe, if you understood the options better with MJ you could fix this. I don\u0027t. You can\u0027t just raise the Pe. So I manually burned to a Pe of 15k. On the return trip, MJ wanted to kill us all, I had just enough fuel to manually set a Pe of 35k for reentry. MJ is a great tool sometimes. Sometimes it is not.
