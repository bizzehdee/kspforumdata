Ofc it isn\u0027t realistic, that\u0027s the point. Mixing jet and faring parts works to give you some way to go for aircraft even though they have little actual use at this point.

It\u0027s just a little more inefficient.\n\nGenjerally, the tech tree this time seems to be much more centered around improvements than logical and connected progression, at least in the early game.

I wonder."},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T20:12:29Z","Content":"I agree with what tater said, the current paradigm is not ideal. Right now career mode gameplay is mostly a grind to unlock the tree with a few moments of brilliance thrown in where you\u0027re able to cobble together a mission with limited parts. Once you\u0027ve unlocked the tree, you\u0027re basically back to sandbox as by that point you\u0027ll be making so much money it becomes meaningless. The only really expensive items are the building upgrades, rockets are dirt cheap by comparison (even interplanetary missions). The difficulty settings don\u0027t actually affect the difficulty of the game, they simply make it more grindy and tedious since you have to do more to unlock things, no additional skill is really required.\n\nAs far as the tech tree is concerned, there\u0027s a couple of bizarre decisions even very early in the tree. First off, the Flea is useless due to its pitiful ISP compared to everything else. The only reason to ever use it is for your first mission, and even then you could just walk your kerbal around the pad and get enough science to unlock the superior in every way RT-10. Next, why do you start with the biggest 1.25m engine and the smallest tank for it? Were they trying to prevent you from building large rockets early on by invoking the stupidly low part count limit? Further, you don\u0027t even get a decent upper stage engine until a 45-science node. Those are my biggest peeves with the current tree.\n\nAs far as fixing the whole paradigm, I think that first of all the career mode needs some kind of overarching goal for players to strive for, not just unlocking the tech tree, the tech tree needs to be a means to an end and not an end in itself. I think the game needs to be divided between contracts and missions, where contracts are optional side tasks to earn more funds/rep, and missions are part of the main overarching goal.\n\nParts should be unlocked/upgraded using funds, and science should be a special currency used as part of the main missions, or better yet do away with science points entirely and have each science experiment be a unique data point that gives different benefits, i.e. you do experiments with probes on another planet to unlock manned missions to that planet. Anomalies should also be integrated, I really liked Nightingale\u0027s anomaly explorer contracts and feel that something like that would be a great overarching goal (I\u0027m pretty sure this idea was proposed by NovaSilisko awhile back and I\u0027m surprised it never really went anywhere despite the anomalies present in the stock game)."},{"CreatedByName":"Gfurst","CreatedById":126201,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T20:15:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I really don\u0027t know what all the fuzz is about.
