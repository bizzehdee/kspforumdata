Navigating the path from the rungs on the side of the crew cabin and fuel tank to the angled ladder \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eis a bit tricky...one must let go, then walk a bit along the horizontal rungs (\u0022front porch\u0022), then grab the angled \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eladder.

The descent stage of the LM has a \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecruciform arrangement of fuel/oxidizer tanks around the descent engine (FL-T200 tanks and an LV-909 engine). The \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eareas between the tanks are filled with RCS tanks and assorted equipment and science instruments, giving the descent \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Estage an octagonal layout, as is only natural for a properly-built descent stage. The descent stage also has \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebatteries (located on the tops of three of the tanks, mostly to help fill an unsightly gap), and an OKTO probe \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebody on top of the fourth tank. I had a hard time making an ascent stage that would have enough fuel, but still \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elooked nice. It would be nice if KSP had some round radially-mountable fuel tanks in various sizes. So I made \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edo with an X200-8 tank, which has way more fuel and weight than is needed (and that\u0027s why I pumped off about half \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eof its initial load into the S-IVB tank to lighten the lander).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bnQr7VO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bnQr7VO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sides of the \u0022equipment bays\u0022 of the LM are walled off a bit with solar panel packages, which you can \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejust picture as general purpose equipment containers. But which CAN be deployed to recharge the batteries, in \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ean un-Apollo-like manner.

BUT, I was getting some weird clipping happening when I built this rocket, and the ASAS unit and docking port on top of the LM were clipping into the coupler (so that the coupler appeared to attach to the top of the lander can instead of to the top of the docking port as expected). I didn\u0027t argue with the VAB strangeness, but when I try to rebuild this connection now (I did a quick rip-apart of the ship in order to answer your questions) the coupler mates to the docking port as expected. This will make a wider gap than shown in my old rocket, but will work fine (and may solve the weird problem I had with the engine shroud jamming on the top of the LM at separation).
