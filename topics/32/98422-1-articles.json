After .90 I actually started a few new careers at first on different settings to see how the rewards played out. I know a lot of people have felt the funds/science ratio is off, but mainly I found its just the funds that are lagging. The best place I found put funds penalties down to 50%, Rewards up to 150%, and starting cash up to 100,000. It took a lot of the grind out of it but still things don\u0027t quite feel right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo my mind, as they balance things, a nice rule for a median setting would enable you advance after 3 of a given type of mission. Once you\u0027ve done 3 successful sub-orbital missions, you should have the cash and science to go orbital. After 3 orbital flights you should be able to mount a Mun mission. Then Minmus, Asteroid, etc. There are people who have been playing like unlocking the tech tree is beating the game but I personally feel like you should have the current tech tree pretty close to maxed after you return home from your first interplanetary mission. That way you have all the tools you need to rock a Jool-5 or Eve and back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother random note on this but I kind of wish the transponder was a part and not a strategy. Like you place it on your module and you get 15% back for a flat fee of 1500 funds or so. Especially when you\u0027re loading up a huge mission paying a max of 6% at launch and getting back 15% only what comes back is not really that great. It would make more sense if we had stage recovery, but barring that I think a flat fee would scale better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-01T03:17:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am enjoying flat-out normal with all checkboxes off except saves and reverts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI almost don\u0027t do science at all, unless there\u0027s a contract for it and then it\u0027s just to do the contract.
