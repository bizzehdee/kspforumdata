I do like it from orbit, though! No tiles and whatnot. I decided to take a LEM down to land and see the surface for myself. I picked the Sea of Instability for my landing site and burned into my Powered Descent. First off, I did like how tall the mountains were. It required a 30KM orbit to feel nice and safe while in the orbital phase of my mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I neared the ground, I saw all the boulders and all was going well.
