The forum is full of complaining and everyone only mention the bad points totally forgetting about the good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd about this topic - in my opinion this update is the biggest update ever, because we\u0027ve got not just a big amount of new features - we\u0027ve got completely new game! We need to learn everything again and I\u0027m not saying it\u0027s bad - it\u0027s good. I\u0027m sick and tired of the old aero where I had wierd planes flying the wierd way (personally I had big problems with building planes with the old aero). Now I build something that looks like a plane - and it\u0027s magically flies! Fantastic! And The same with rockets: you build enormously huge rocket with the most non-aerodynamic shape and make it into orbit as easy as a straight-shaped rocket. It\u0027s not fair, is it? And now you need to put all your engineering skills into rockets to not overbuild it and to fit everything you need for a mission in a limited space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rakutenshi","CreatedById":40086,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T08:28:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love the more is less approach to wings now. It\u0027s just my opinion, but I hated the \u0022lets just stack more wings on it\u0022 approach to spaceplanes. Glad to see the increased drag/lift ratios on the wings making the darts more viable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esee lots of people who can\u0027t get their old onionwinged SSTOs to orbit any more, but with the new lifting body mechanics and all, delta winged muscle planes are the way to go it seems.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Col_Jessep","CreatedById":4071,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T08:29:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aerindel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Aerindel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E1.02 is awesome and has never been more fun.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.02 makes my game crash when I reenter with a large SSTO plane due to a memory leak.

In 0.90 everything could be solved with a delta v calculator, and you could completely neglect other aspect of design. You had enough dv, and you could be sure, that your rocket will work. Now the game is more multidimensional, you need to take into account drag, center of weight shifting, steering authority, structural integrity and more.

KSP is far and away my favourite game, and 1.0 (and subsequent patches) have made it even more fun than before.
