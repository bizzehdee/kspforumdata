Because of the 10:1 scaling issue you can build up more than half the necessary orbital speed using only jets, so it\u0027s pretty easy to get to orbit with even low-end parts once you know what you\u0027re doing. It makes a very good starting point for people who haven\u0027t tried spaceplanes yet; a lot of people really overbuild on their first attempt, simply because with rockets bigger usually IS better. (You should have seen my own first attempt. It was horribly overbuilt.) Of course, looking at your wings you\u0027re clearly clipping some parts, so it\u0027s hard to really gauge how heavy your design actually is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hard part comes when you try to add more to it than that basic orbital capability. Adding anything beyond that baseline requires a substantial investment in weight, which in turn requires more engine power and fuel to carry it, which quickly spirals out of control. Common culprits:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; A lot of spaceplanes use an LV-N instead of an aerospike so that they can fly to other planets; besides the fact that the engine alone weighs 2.25 tons, an LV-N has too little engine power to get you to orbit if you\u0027re carrying enough fuel to actually get to those other bodies (or even Mun/Minmus in some cases), and that means stacking on some other low-efficiency propulsion as well just for the transition to orbit. (In 0.23 you\u0027ll be able to use SABERs for this, which\u0027ll help quite a bit.) Also, a 60kN engine like an LV-N can only hit a TWR of 2 on Mun if your design is 18 tons or less; any heavier, and you\u0027ll have problems taking off from Mun (or landing, for that matter), which really limits your destinations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; If you want to get all the way to Laythe, even an LV-N won\u0027t really be efficient enough unless you\u0027re very careful with your slingshots or remove absolutely every nonessential part to save weight. Now you\u0027re looking at putting ions on your design, which requires not only xenon and ion engines, but plenty of power generation as well (something a simpler spaceplane has no need for). Solar panels don\u0027t weigh much individually, but to get enough power to run two ions at full power you\u0027ll need a pretty good number of panels, plus batteries and possibly an RTG for emergency eclipses, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; If you want to land on airless bodies, you need to either add a set of downward-firing rocket engines, or else add landing legs and ladders so that the plane can land on its tail. I personally prefer the second option, but either way will cost you about a half a ton of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; Then there\u0027s all the miscellanea. Science gear, lights, extra flaps for maneuverability and easy takeoffs on places like Laythe, docking ports, ladders, maybe a winch, RCS for docking, that sort of thing. Again, individually these don\u0027t weigh much, but it all adds up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Also beyond a certain size you start needing struts to hold it all together rigidly, but for now those don\u0027t add mass.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; And finally, payload. A spaceplane that just gets a single kerbonaut to orbit is nice for bragging rights and all, but it\u0027s nothing you can\u0027t do far more easily with conventional rockets and they\u0027re capable of much more. But if you make one that can deliver a pair of ion-powered mapping probes capable of reaching Jool\u0027s moons, or carry kerbonauts to and from a space station, or that sort of thing? Now the design is useful, but this sort of thing has a tremendous cost in weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo all of that on one design, and the weight really starts piling up. Once you get above about 25 tons a 2-jet design just won\u0027t cut it any more, so you add a third jet, which adds another 1.2 tons and requires even more jet fuel... and then we hit the intake issue. To get enough intakes to lift a heavier design to orbit you either have to abuse the clipping exceptions, make a really ugly design, or use mods with bigger intakes (like B9) that have worse mass efficiencies, and that only gets worse once you add that third engine. In the end, you get something like my personal spaceplane, weighing in at about 34 tons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qKHCx2D.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qKHCx2D.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s pretty, can fly to Laythe and back, handles beautifully in-atmosphere, and lands on airless moons without a problem. But it\u0027s definitely NOT small, especially not the version that carries those probes I mentioned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, it\u0027s good to make those small spaceplanes at first. Just don\u0027t expect that to really work in the long term for all the things you\u0027re going to want to do.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-12T12:06:45Z\u0022 title=\u002212/12/2013 12:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Spatzimaus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NQMT","CreatedById":79402,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-12T12:34:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESimple, hey?
