If, like Glushko, you don\u0027t think that you can build large engines, then you will probably go for clusters of small engines, because you can actually make the engines work (in theory). As a nice bonus, you can use the same engines on upper stages without them being hideously oversized, which in theory will save you money. If, on the other hand, you\u0027re the United States and you figure that there\u0027s no issue with a million and a half pound engine, then you will probably go for big engines because standard theory predicts fewer bigger engines will generally be more likely to work out, all else being equal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut there\u0027s no notion of reliability in KSP (and thank God for that, in my opinion; I get plenty of excitement from\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edesign\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0and\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eplanning\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0issues, without adding parts randomly failing.

to tone it down (the mod has had plenty of downloads).\u00A0 Clearly, lots of other people love it just as it is (see the discussion in this thread).\u00A0 The nice thing about KSP is that it\u0027s

This is because KSP does not deal with different propellant mixtures; everything is storable hypergolics (so perhaps the RD-275 is a better counterpart, really), and because KSP does not have large high-thrust solids to make a central sustainer viable in 3.75m.
