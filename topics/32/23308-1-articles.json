Building a flight escape system for spaceplanes is far more difficult than a launch escape system for rockets- you can\u0027t add too much weight or you\u0027ll unbalance the craft, it can\u0027t be too large, and the cockpit often has important components like docking ports or, even worse, the cockpit can be an integral part of the plane.

Part of the issue is that depending on how you design it, it may have a completly different flight profile than another plane (depending on how much thrust it has). I tried for a long long time to get one to work and it finally worked because I got my TWR up enough to keep the assent profile roughly lined up (only 10 degrees lower) than where the craft was actually pointing. If you have a low TWR on assent then the plane tends to have a velocity vector that is significantly lower than where your nose is pointing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the plane I built and figured out how to fly. It carries 6 Kerbals in the crew compartment and 3 pilots. The only non stock parts are MechJeb2 (to hold headings) the crew tank (because it looks cool) and 2 modular multi wheels. The flight profile is set Mechjeb to 90.5 degrees (because the stupid runway does not point exactly 90 degrees) with 15 degree up. Once the plane is off the ground (it lifts off slightly after the end of the runway) switch to 90 degree heading with 60 degrees up. At 10,000 meters pitch to 30 degrees. When the air intake is down to .75 switch to 20 degree angle. Once the air intake is .12 fire up the rockets. when the air is down to .1 cut the air jets and cruise up to altitude and circularize. I am left with about 400m/s Dv when all is said and done. You have to make sure that CoG is always in front of CoL and take into account how the fuel is being burned so that it is still (very slightly) behind after all fuel is spent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I try to deviate from this assent plan by much I end up failing.

You should do it at the highest height your jets will function which will depend on the ratio of intakes to jets and can be anywhere between 30km and 10km (although if it\u0027s that low you\u0027re probably using rubbish intakes, the ram intakes are the only ones worth bothering with currently).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
