Instead I hope that there will be some small hobby projects which try to be as realistic as possible and try not to be famous or suitable for everybody. As accurate model of Solar system as possible (and possibility to use custom settings for planets and orbits too), N-body trajectory modeling, possibility to plan and build space programs and ships (more procedurally), FAR-level aerodynamics, highly optimized self made physics engine, sophisticated trajectory prediction and mission control and executing tools, procedurally generated details on bodies (of course not real surface models of bodies), accurate gravity model of non-spherical bodies and much nerdy micromanagement engineering details which can ruin your mission. Graphics could be simple OpenGL stuff but planets should have 3D surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrbiter with a VAB/SPH is what you (and I, for that matter)\u00A0probably want, although on multiple platforms. \u00A0Would also be nice to have something that resembled, even slightly, an\u00A0actual space program management sim. \u00A0RP-0 comes pretty close but it is still marred by the \u0022side quest generator\u0022 of KSP\u0027s \u0022career\u0022 mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGod, career mode is such a mess... \u00A0It always comes back to that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, yeah, I would love to see that sort of project come about. \u00A0A real indie project that wasn\u0027t worried about \u0022ease of access\u0022 but laser-focused on getting the details correct. \u00A0Realism Overhaul has really shown me the light; I want more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
