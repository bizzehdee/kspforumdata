I\u0027ve been playing with RemoteTech lately and the list of ComSats is getting a bit long. I can\u0027t just turn off unmanned probes because I have ships using those satellites of course.\n\nIt would be nice to have the folders for the tracking station, but it would also be nice to control the folder in the map view for visibility. So I can choose not to see the orbits of those satellites as well. I have a feeling kind of change would require an overhaul to the visibility toolbar, but in map view it is currently broken anyway since you can\u0027t click the buttons, and they said they had to redo the GUI for Unity 5, so what better time?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T20:38:04Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 08:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T15:56:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E list of ComSats is getting a bit long.
