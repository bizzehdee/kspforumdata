That was being played on Duna, with the background noise from the game being played, ambient noise, etc. That\u0027ll static it up a bit. Being a little bit of a game dev/programmer, inside KSP\u0027s code/files, there HAS to be the plain OGG file for the beeps. I found it at one point, but skipped past it, and then my brain realized I skipped past it and couldn\u0027t find it. I know that it was static-ed by the maker (Nova, I believe), but possibly we could find a slightly clearer version in the game files.
