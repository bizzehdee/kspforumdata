What was most annoying was the way the parachutes broke physics (and because of that, my lander).\n\nI\u0027m fine with the idea that Duna\u0027s thin atmo means very little aerobraking and very little drag force from the parachutes. That\u0027s OK. So the obvious answer is to deploy the chutes early and often, while the lander is still buzzing along at high speed. And yet -- yank! The lander flies apart.\n\nNow that\u0027s the bit where the physics are broken in a way that damages the game. Even though the lander is moving very fast, the air is so thin that there should be almost no force from the parachutes. And yet, the force is apparently enough to rip the lander apart -- even though if it did hold together, it wouldn\u0027t have been enough to slow it down much at all.\n\nWill that be fixed in 1.0?"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T02:31:27Z","Content":"You just need to add drouge parachutes to slow it down befor the amin deployment.\n\nRath-Because why not copy Rune\u0027s ending thing"},{"CreatedByName":"Landge","CreatedById":57671,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T02:39:31Z","Content":"Some pics would help. I\u0027m assuming you are using a drogue chute or two. It also helps to use your rockets to slow your descent before the main chutes fully open. If you still are having spontaneous disassembly try using 2 or more struts to hold the chutes to the ship better. Attach the struts to the structure surrounding the chute first then the other end to the chute\u0027s outer ring."},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T02:46:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You just need to add drouge parachutes to slow it down befor the amin deployment.\n\nThanks, but:\n\nA) I did have drouge chutes; what killed the lander was when the XL chutes popped\n\n![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) After a lot of repeated trials I landed it eventually, mainly using just retro.\n\nI\u0027m not looking for tips on how to survive landing on Duna, but thanks for offering. I\u0027m pointing out that the entire situation is completely non-physical. With such a thin atmo, there should be almost no drag from the chutes at 25km altitude no matter that I\u0027m traveling at near orbital velocity or not. And the game models it that way, when it comes to the drag of an open chute.\n\nBut the shock of opening is what blows the ship apart, and there is no physical justification for that. It seems like the chute opening shock is tied to speed but not the density of the atmosphere. Or something like that, anyway. And that\u0027s what I\u0027m hoping gets fixed."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T03:04:18Z","Content":"Parts and aspects of the game are being tested, revised, and balanced as we speak.
