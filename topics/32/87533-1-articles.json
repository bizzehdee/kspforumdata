I do think that some of the stratagies need a bit of tweaking as a few are a bit too powerful. On the other hand some of the changes slated for the next version may limit those powerful ones to endgame, may make them a bit better. I also think that the launchpad and runway need to have their durability upped a bit so they dont spontaneously combust to normal usage.

It would be one thing if the devs pulled a DF9 and said thats it were done, heres the tools to fix it yourselves. Considering the moding comunity this game has KSP might survive that kind of crap but it would be a blow. However since the game is still in development and some of these systems have slowly been coming together over the last few patches I expect that many problems will be resolved as the game marches on to a release state. Thats the nature of development, sometimes you have to put in systems that start out only half funtional and broken so you can build on them later (or figure out now that they dont work so they can be redone)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T21:20:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI play career most of the time and I am more or less hapy with it.
