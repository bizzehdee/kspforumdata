my opinion, the biggest obstacle to people advancing to interplanetary flight in this game is that it\u0027s hard and those who don\u0027t advance don\u0027t find enough enjoyment in that type of challenge to make it worth their while to do it. \u00A0As an aero engineer, I find it fun because sending up planes and rockets was all I ever wanted to do as long as I can remember. \u00A0I was willing to endure any amount of higher math in order to attain that goal - and calculus took several attempts for me before it finally clicked. \u00A0When I hear people complain that \u0022xxxxx is too hard\u0022, what I really hear is \u0022I don\u0027t enjoy xxxxx enough to invest the time required for me to learn it\u0022. \u00A0Of course, I believe that nearly anyone can learn nearly anything, if they have the correct motivation, and no, that isn\u0027t a threat. \u00A0Some of \u003Cs\u003Eus\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0you guys learned how to dock real easy and never looked back, some of us too a bit longer, but clearly some others have never really mastered it, and I would wager that many of those are very smart individuals who are very capable in some other things that some people who can dock in their sleep are not. \u00A0As a side note to those having trouble with docking, I highly recommend the built-in docking tutorial. \u00A0Made things a lot easier for me once I realized

not docking - it\u0027s time management. \u00A0KAC (Kerbal Alarm Clock) helps me with this a ton! \u00A0KER, obviously makes it much easier to build a ship by performing all of the mundane calculations of delta-V for you, and MechJeb provides some basic automation that existed in the US space program since day one, so it would be nice if KSP included some of these features. \u00A0Of course, Squad says they left these things for the community to improve, and obviously the community has really stepped up, but maybe Squad could do something to make installing mods easier? \u00A0Oh -

came to KSP after many years of playing Orbiter, which tries to be as realistic as possible. \u00A0Which is actually quite depressing for somebody who grew up watching the Apollo program on black-and-white TV and expecting to be living on a Jovian moon by now. \u00A0To me, KSP is pure fantasy, but still gives enough lip service to real spaceflight that it allows (witch a willing suspension of disbelief) me to live out all my old dreams of large-scale\u00A0interplanetary colonization. \u00A0Thus, I did my 1st interplanetary trip within a just a couple weeks of getting KSP, once I\u0027d learned how the game works. \u00A0I was already familiar with the orbital mechanics involved so that wasn\u0027t a stumbling block to me. \u00A0The hard part was just making the game give me the information necessary to design the type of ship I wanted and know it would work. \u00A0I was used to having scads more information as part of the stock interface in Orbiter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEver since then, all I\u0027ve been doing is more and more extravagant interplanetary missions. \u00A0I\u0027ve even added OPM to have more places to go, and have sent fairly large invasion fleets to most places. \u00A0Now I\u0027m thinking about going to other star systems. \u00A0But I must say, after several years of doing such things, I\u0027m quite tempted to do my next game as more of a stay-at-home. \u00A0Maybe make an undersea base. \u00A0Maybe devote a lot of time to messing with KerbinSide, now that 1.1.x allows me to use it. \u00A0I know much more about the far side of Sarnus than I do about Kerbin \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022

I do and that\u0027s cool. \u00A0In fact, that\u0027s the best thing about KSP, that everybody can approach it differently and do whatever the Hell they find enjoyable. \u00A0One of my favorite YouTubers is Bagel Rabbit, who freely admits he\u0027s hardly ever\u00A0been to even Mun, yet he makes wonderful ships that qualify as works of art, which I find amazing. \u00A0And it is for this very reason that I fundamentally oppose any and all attempts to incorporate more so-called \u0022realism\u0022 features into KSP, because they limit the wonderful array of options open to players. \u00A0If you want to pretend you\u0027re really playing Orbiter, then knock yourself out with mods to do that, but don\u0027t cram them down the throats of people who\u0027d rather not play that way. \u00A0I was MUCH happier using FAR and DRE when and if I wanted them (which was most of the time, to be honest) than I am now that they\u0027ve semi-become stock, simply because that\u0027s cut down drastically on all the weird and wonderful things people used to make. \u00A0I say, to each his own. \u00A0My way of playing is not for everybody and vice versa. \u00A0Vive la difference!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs such, while I do find the subject of this thread interesting, I sincerely hope that nobody reading it feels in the least bit inferior because they choose, for whatever reason, to NOT do interplanetary missions. \u00A0From a gameplay perspective, there\u0027s no real difference between going to Minmus\u00A0and going to Eeloo except the trip takes longer. \u00A0You make all the same maneuvers for both. \u00A0So if you can get to Minmus, there\u0027s really no further challenge in the orbital mechanics part of the game, so why bother unless you just really want to see what a planet looks like up close? \u00A0Why not instead do something different that presents a new challenge, or is just entertaining in its own right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"White

I have landed probes on Duna (and Ike) once, and done nothing else interplanetary unless a quick jaunt out for solar science counts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI play with KER and KAC, so finding and utilizing transfer windows is no trouble for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy haven\u0027t I gone further, done more?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, I semi-like playing in career mode. I like the progressive unlocks, and I like being constrained by money. At the same time, I generally find the contract system to be a grind (though I haven\u0027t experienced it much past 0.90).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, I always have grand plans. I want an orbital station with regular resupply runs (using TAC-LS) from my spaceplane of choice. I want a Mun fuel refinery and orbital station (also with resupply runs). I play with RemoteTech a lot, so I also want strong com systems in the Kerbin system and also around Duna, Eve, and Jool. I want to transition to primarily using spaceplanes, with rockets only for putting up massive payloads that won\u0027t easily fit in cargo bays. You get the idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird, I tend to play KSP off-and-on. I play a lot of KSP, but I get tired of it and do other things/play other games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFourth, I like mod-sets. One run I\u0027ve had was with KSP Interstellar. Then one on RSS (which I\u0027ll go back to when I get my real computer back). So on and so forth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, as a whole, I tend to get bogged down a bit in the home system, then take a small break after my fifth or tenth or fiftieth orbital rendezvous, and then SQUAD comes out with a new release and I just chuck it all and start over again.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf we didn\u0027t have another feature-rich release for about a year or so, I\u0027d probably actually finish some of my plans.

Grandiose plans \u002B gradual progress \u002B huge list of complex mods = it takes me a very long time to get anything done. By the time I start looking at interplanetary missions, I\u0027m burnt out on the game and need to take a break... or I\u0027m irritated the game still can\u0027t handle my planned vehicles/missions without lagging to a crawl and/or crashing every five minutes... or a new version drops and it\u0027s time to start over... or most often it\u0027s all of the above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sereneti","CreatedById":163637,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-18T06:57:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmy first Mun-drone go interpanetary ... on acident \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\ni want to orbit the mun, and i miss that ...
