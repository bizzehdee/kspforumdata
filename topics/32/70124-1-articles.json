Why else go to a planet if not to do experiments? (Yes, okay, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s KSP, we go because we can and because it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s pretty. But still!) The lander needs to be able to bring back a lot of science data if nothing else. Bringing back the experiment itself would be nice, but the data is the most important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3)Possibly the most important of all: the lander needs to look sleek and at least halfway believable. It follows from this constraint that she needs to be as light as possible. The heavier the craft, the harder it is to push it all the way into orbit and out to Eve and the less believable it gets. Also, a hardened pod is absolutely required. No saving weight with external command seats. No one in their right mind would consider going to orbit sitting on the outside of a rocket, especially not on a hostile world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4)Optional: try to do it without the parts (or more precisely, engines) released in ARM. Not strictly necessary, but some of the new parts seem just a tiny bit too powerful. Using ARM to push it into orbit and (possibly) for the interplanetary stage is fine, but preferably not for the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving set these limitations for myself I discovered over the course of the following months what a cold and ruthless **** Eve can be. As if added gravity wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t bad enough, that atmosphere is a KILLER:confused:.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP being what it is, limitation number 3 was by far the toughest one. I can throw together an Eve lander without many problems, but they look like absolute behemoth monstrosities that should never even have made it to Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut after literally months of building, designing and calculating (I actually learned a ton about the laws and equations governing rocket engineering), dozens of tests - both on Kerbin and a few on Eve itself \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 about four complete design overhauls and having to come up with an entirely new staging concept, I finally managed it: a lander that can go down to Eve\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s surface (sea level) and get a single kerbal back to a 100000m orbit, and which looks like a ship that someone with half a functioning brain would actually consider boarding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Orpheus Mk IV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe comes in at 160 tons and a smidge without all the peripherals (landing gear, science pods, parachutes, etc) and uses a modified 4-way symmetry asparagus design, with some added functionality to counteract that early loss of thrust that almost all asparagus designs suffer from and which is so incredibly important on Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t post pictures right now since I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m at work (and I also need to figure out how to post pictures/albums since I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m a total forum n00b) but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll try to show you guys how she looks and performs later. I still need to design and build a way to get the Orpheus into orbit and an interplanetary stage to get her to Eve, but I plan to fly the actual mission this week, so expect pictures by then!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy flying, may your engines never overheat, your Isp always be high and your TWR always be greater than 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECirocco\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfterthought: MY GOD it took so much time, so much curses and frustrations, even leaving KSP for a while thinking it wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t possible to design a sleek-looking Eve lander that gets to orbit from sea level, but she got there in the end.
