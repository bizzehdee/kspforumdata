You\\\u0027ll want to time it so you\\\u0027re pretty much horizontal around 50-60km. You can aim higher, it depends how high you want to establish your orbit. Just remember you will keep burning and climb up to it by building horizontal velocity.[/li]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[li]When approaching horizontal attitude, reduce thrust so you\\\u0027re just pushing the Apoapsis ahead of you, perhaps gaining on it slowly, but not pushing it any further away.[/li]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[li]Keep adjusting your attitude to point at the horizon. Keep low thrust. As long as you keep apoapsis slightly ahead of you, you will be climbing. If you have a longer way to climb, you can push apoapsis further ahead: just don\\\u0027t let it get too far away from you, or you\\\u0027ll get too elliptical, and that means cuttiing the engines for a while.[/li]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[li]The trick to finish it off is to reduce thrust so you approach and hit apoapsis at your target altitude with zero thrust. Since you\\\u0027ve been burning horizontally the whole time and slowly gaining orbital speed, it should be pretty much circular when you get there.
