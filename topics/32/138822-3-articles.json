The chance that all the ones you are highlighting are actually crateres is essentially zero, and then that leaves no room for any lakes that arent craters anywhere on Kerbin; they are candidates sure but I figure we should assume without more data that, due to mere statistical analasys, only the more obvious ones should be considered craters or related to craters.

Geography has features within features within features. I\u0027m working on a huge scale with some of my ideas, but that doesn\u0027t mean than everything inside the area I\u0027m naming is \u0027claimed\u0027 and can\u0027t be further dissected.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, consider for a second how many craters there are on Mun, and how small it is compared with Kerbin. Mun has (probably - it\u0027s a game after all) been subjected to the same bombardments that Kerbin has. Why, then, should craters on Kerbin be particularly scarce, especially since so far we have no strong case for either weather or plate tectonics on Kerbin. (Note: I\u0027m not saying we should discount the possibility of those processes, but so far I\u0027ve seen nobody post a theory of plate boundaries or a water cycle).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-16T00:18:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2016 12:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by The_Rocketeer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nosirrbro","CreatedById":69814,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-16T00:28:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222583922\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138822\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221463357085\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002281727\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The_Rocketeer\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n25 minutes ago, The_Rocketeer said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/69814-nosirrbro/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002269814\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/69814-nosirrbro/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@nosirrbro\u003C/a\u003E, I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve said anywhere that anything was categorically a crater, what I\u0027m suggesting is that there are a lot of places of Kerbin that could be supermassive impact craters, and backing up \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022154251\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@bewing\u003C/a\u003E in saying that there are a large number of possible crater locations.

However, using the tactic of making my statements seeming like just a random assumption can be used both ways as well you know, \u0027well its probably just a crater\u0027. Now, if were done with the statement manipulation, I can certainly say some things about how many of the structures could have formed naturally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Em6lQ/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. That looks like normal tectonic continent formation to me, it appears the two continets seem to be moving away from eachother and in doing that created a depression, leading to an inland sea. The spain looking peninsula looks very much like it used to be connected to the area below and to the left to it and got ripped apart from it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. While there is a curve in parts, the right side seems relatively not too much part of it. This one does seem relavitely possible , however a rather cracled tectonic area over here plus some water erosion seems as a seperate possible explanation. Also, the central \u0027peak\u0027 seems much to large, spread out and variable to be from an impact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Especially with the central peak being offcenter and most of the \u0027edges\u0027 being mountain ranges that extend quite far, this one does not seem plausible and is a case of mountains whos edges when a point is placed on them form a half circle, and not an impact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. This one actually has legitimacy, it is very possible this lake was formed by an impact, especially with what looks similar to a central peak. It is also possbile that it formed just as any normal one does, a slightly lower part of land gets eroded by water, further deepness sends streams heading towards it speeding up its erosion, etc. If any of these were to be an impact, it would be this one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Probably the\u00A0least likely of them all, there see ms no indication of an impact on half of the indicated outline and the central peak is actually lower than its surroundings. General random mountain formation explains this one away easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. To me this looks more like four mountain ranges forming independantly that, since they are 4, make 4 points on their edges that you could theoretically turn into a circle. But none of the ranges would extend as far as they do if it were an impact, and in the places where a range isnt present the altitude is quite low. This one and 4 seem to be automatically disproven due to a lack of any real evidence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7.The long chain of mountains and small curves on the side seem to be two large condinents with relatively flat sides colliding with alot of force, and at the ends part of the continents appear to have moved a little more forward than the others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd im not trying to destroy any creativity, however this thread is about a science and in science there must be scrutiny.

Well the planet (at proper 10x scale) is really dense. Denser than Earth in fact. That implies a large iron core. Kerbin\u0027s iron core must have been created by a Mun-forming impact much like the Earth\u0027s large iron core was created by a Moon-forming impact. When the two impactors collided to form Kerbin, the large iron cores mixed together while the mantles and crusts of the two planets mostly went into forming the Mun. This would have the side effect not just of making a large iron core, but making a large and hot iron core. This would make the insides of the planet hot (and also produce a magnetic field to shield the\u00A0life we know to exist on Kerbin from the hazardous solar radiation). This hot planet would thus have plate tectonics, just like Earth.

No meteorites have ever altered Kerbin\u0027s surface geography, no volcanoes have erupted, no tectonic plates have subducted. Rivers do not flow, and rain does not fall on Kerbin.
