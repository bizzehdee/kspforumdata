It\u0027s mild and doesn\u0027t really cause any issues for a while, but if you keep doing this a bunch of times it can start to eat away at your framerate, which can generally only be resolved by closing and reopening the whole game.\n\nSo just try and not \u0022waste\u0022 test runs, or plan to restart the game before you do anything complicated."},{"CreatedByName":"Fearless Son","CreatedById":133397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T00:35:24Z","Content":"There can be circumstances where you might choose not to revert. Maybe you transmitted a bunch of science before the crash, and the amount you go outweighed the loss? Cold-hearted, but something that might enter consideration. Maybe you completed a contract, but had a soft-crash afterward? You might choose to recover what you can and cut your losses rather than go back and try the whole thing again, particularly if it was long and complicated and you did not relish the thought of doing the entire thing over."},{"CreatedByName":"hugix","CreatedById":55379,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T00:59:54Z","Content":"I pretend that each mission is a simulation.
