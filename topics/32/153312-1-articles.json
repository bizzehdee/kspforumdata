As far as KSP is concerned, I have it on my Mac, and that\u0027s great. I could never justify a reason to also get it for my PS4... Why?

That\u0027s actually pretty cool, and I\u0027d fully support the idea of a Switch port having optional support for full keyboard controls. Currently, the only use so far for keyboard support has been the ability to type stuff for text entry boxes, not for controls, but the fact that support is there means a developer \u003Cem\u003Ecould choose to support it\u003C/em\u003E optionally.
