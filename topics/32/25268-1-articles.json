I would also like to see some sort of bonus metric based on numbers of parts and fuel consumed/unconsumed. Maybe they made a ship with a lot of parts but really dialed in their fuel requirement. This also assumes that they are not permitted to intentionally raise/lower their orbits in cycle so as to consume extra fuel.

One of them is likely to be we enjoy complicated and technical things and we also enjoy sandboxy type games. KSP is a good marriage of the two. However, I think what your intent with this project is, is to provide your students a glimpse in to the real world application of math and physics. That\u0027s fantastic and I think KSP is a pretty decent way to do that. But I would stress that without taking the time to introduce your students to real orbital mechanics and stepping them through calculations and how the calcs can apply to KSP and predicting the nature of your flight, then I think the ultimate intent of your project is going to be completely lost and at the end of the day all you are doing is asking your students to play a game. You don\u0027t necessarily need to even get them to do the math themselves- just show it to them step by step and in the order in which you would normally do the calcs. Show them the rocket equation and show how changing different components of them will effect the behaviour of the rocket. Step them through Hohmann transfer orbits and the reasons for using them. Help them to understand why they raise and lower their orbital nodes at opposite nodes so as to conserve fuel and maximize delta-v expenditure.

I\u0027m planning on breaking the students into teams to compete in a \u0022space exploration race.\u0022 Based on just a few days of playing around with KSP, I\u0027ve put this together as a first pass \u0022guide to the project.\u0022 I\u0027d love to get input on what needs adjusting based on those who are considerably more experienced than I. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe project brief is located at: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.aplusphysics.com/projects/kerbal.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.aplusphysics.com/projects/kerbal.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for any help / guidance you can provide!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--FizziksGuy\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the perspective of a college level physics student, after looking at the project brief, my only major critique is the apparent amount of work the students will have to do for each report. After all, if they feel like it\u0027s too much work they won\u0027t enjoy it. If they enjoy it, then they will most likely learn it better because they will be interested. For example, making them break down each stage will get redundent quickly and will be nothing more than filler-work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said I think it\u0027s fantastic that you\u0027re bringing the highly-educational side of KSP into a classroom enviornment, as this is the type of thing that can truley draw interest into a field of science.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"paleorob","CreatedById":60059,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T03:58:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe don\u0027t have physics at the school I teach at, just upper level biology and AP Chem.
