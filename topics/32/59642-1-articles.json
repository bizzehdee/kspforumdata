Some of you may get some use out of this, others maybe not. I figured it\u0027d be nice to throw it up here, as I\u0027m sure I\u0027m not the only one having problems remembering what I\u0027d already done. The matrix was hard to layout, since I\u0027m tracking 3 levels of data (altitude location, biome type, experiment), but I figured this would suffice. If anyone has ideas on how to better this spreadsheet without over-complicating it, I\u0027m open to anything. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo work the spreadsheet, simply type an X (case doesn\u0027t matter) to check off any cell that represents data gathered or experiment you did. This will turn the cell from red to green, marking it as completed. Tabs on the bottom for each Primary celestial body, secondaries (moons/satellites) are on their respective host-body tab (EXCEPT for Kerbin\u0027s moons, because they had way too much data and I didn\u0027t want to scroll down forever).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a link:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArFxNRliTeZddEsxYmhDOGt2MXJzWVZ6Rl9sMFU3V2c\u0026amp;usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArFxNRliTeZddEsxYmhDOGt2MXJzWVZ6Rl9sMFU3V2c\u0026amp;usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OC31GUV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022OC31GUV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EColumn A shows the different \u0022locations\u0022 (altitude layers, light blue cells), and is then subdivided by each biome type.
