That seemed kinda wrong, like I was desecrating something sacred and would be forever shunned as a consequence. It\u0027s interesting to see that some of you do prune stock parts, I might consider it now, but there is something that I can\u0027t quite put my finger on which makes me hesitate from doing that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like Squad to put more focus into optimizing the parts somewhat. B9 for all its 176 parts weighs in at 73MB whereas squad\u0027s 165 parts are 396mb (just looking at the size of their Parts folders and counting .cfg files in Parts), so B9 although I consider it a part heavy mod doesn\u0027t get trimmed. The optimisation that B9 did is just another reason why I count that mod among the greatest of mods and I wish other mods would follow his example. For example Kethane only add 15 parts but it\u0027s 102mb and many parts have similar textures so I\u0027m sure it could be better optimised. I\u0027m not sure how easy the stock parts are to optimise as a lot of the parts have unique textures, but I hope that where they can (ie fuel tanks with same textures) they will at some point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T11:24:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a few other considerations, like do the advancedCanards really need 2x4MB maps?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve run a rather longwinded binary file comparison on image files in my Squad folder ( not just parts - but I\u0027ve already removed a bunch of things ), and it looks like there\u0027s about 130MB of duplicates.

With every part being placed in its own folder with its own texture, it doesn\u0027t take long for resources to be used up with duplicate textures especially if those parts use a lot of large textures where you load everything that is available at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo fix that problem would require a complete rework of how parts are loaded into KSP as well as to allow the sharing of textures by more then one part to avoid duplicate in memory. That would requiring placing all parts in one folder, all textures in one folder, and using a distinctive names for each part with internal information in that part as to which texture it would use upon rendering. Not good solution as it would render all parts obsolete and force complete replacement of existing parts and their mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA more efficient alternative would be to compile a parts list with matching thumbnail pic for display in the VAB building and load each parts as they are selected for construction or when a saved rocket is loaded for use.
