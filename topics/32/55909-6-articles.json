It does sound like there might be less benefit from spamming air intakes, though that wasn\u0027t specifically the purpose. Chief among the possible changes that would make a jet seem stronger is the fact that resources are properly pooled, so if a jet engine needs X intake air, it can take some of that air from one intake, more from another intake, etc. Previously, for each engine tick, the engine needed to get all of its intake air from a single intake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the science changes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure how they interact, and I\u0027m sure they do, but transmitted and returned science appear to have different diminishing returns. Do one of either, and you\u0027ll have most of the science you can get from that experiment in that location using that method. So repeat transmissions are mostly dead. Not a big deal to me, I had already stopped using them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, unless you have a lab module you can use to reset the experiment, the goo and materials science parts can only be used once (used as in you transmit or take the results, I\u0027m pretty sure you can reset it if you discard the results). While I considered this change possible, I wasn\u0027t expecting this, and it\u0027s going to have a serious impact on some of my missions. I\u0027ll deal with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe science lab, in addition to letting you reset those two experiments, basically reduce transmission losses. If you\u0027ll be returning the results, it appears to provide no increase in the science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn EVA\u0027ed kerbal can take the results from an experiment and store the results in a capsule. This allows for full science return from landers that are discarded before the rest of the craft returns. Small catch, it seems that multiple experiments of the same type don\u0027t store together, though I\u0027m not sure if this is one-experiment-type only, or one experiment-type-per-biome. If it\u0027s one-experiment-type-per-biome, that will increase the difference in science returns between manned and unmanned missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t see any of the changes, but one of the streamers also said that the devs had rebalanced the research amounts of the various experiments, possibly to make up for the reduced returns that the other changes will cause, possibly just to change the speed that players could go through the research tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, Minmus got biomes, eight of them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lazarus1024","CreatedById":65276,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T16:09:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am deffinitely the most excited about all of the science changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus with Biomes, is pretty huge to me.
