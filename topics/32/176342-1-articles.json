For the longest time I have noticed that, when using Mk2 and Mk3 cockpits, the view from the windows just seems kinda odd, as if the terrain was somehow scaled during rendering. Because of this I have a hard time judging distances, lining up turns, and landing crafts that use Mk2 and Mk3 cockpits when flying them from the in-cockpit view. However the Mk1 in-cockpit view just seems a lot more \u0022normal\u0022, and I have a much better time flying planes that use it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was just wondering, is this a me issue or have other people noticed this? Is this issue somehow caused by FOV, and could this be solved with a very-wide monitor setup?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yea I know that you can zoom in/out while using the in-cockpit view, but no zoom level seems to make the Mk2/Mk3 view look \u0022normal\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MDZhB","CreatedById":99243,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-03T01:27:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you\u0027re not in IVA, you can change the FOV by holding down alt and scrolling. I don\u0027t know it it works in IVA though. Maybe this can fix the view for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
