I also drained fuel from the upper tank to balance out the added weight of the fairing when it was used (within a couple kilograms, at least). \u00A0Just to keep extra variables out, I also disabled the reaction wheel on the probe core when it was used. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bottom 2.5m tank and Reliant provided the thrust. \u00A0On each test, I set the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to hold radial out, and fired the Reliant\u00A0with only the bottom fuel tank available. \u00A0I then saw how high each rocket would go after burning through the bottom tank.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#1, the plain Terrier, only made it a little over 9,000 meters,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#2, the Terrier with fairing, made it over 11,000 meters. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#3, the probe core, made it over 13,000 meters!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#4, the probe core with fairing base, ended up very close to #3. \u00A0So the fairing base appears to have no special aerodynamic effects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nResults: \u00A0It looks like parts in front do not fully occlude trailing parts if there is a smaller-size part in between.\u00A0The lower tank may be getting \u003Cem\u003Esome \u003C/em\u003Edrag occlusion, but definitely not as much as if the stack was uniformly 2.5m wide. \u00A0So all else being equal, it\u0027s better to avoid the \u0022hourglass\u0022 shape. \u00A0Using an interstage fairing considerably improved drag, though surprisingly, the net effect was not as good as a pure 2.5m setup. \u00A0Thus, besides their weight and cost, fairings don\u0027t appear to be a perfect option occlusion.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s also worth mentioning that,\u00A0even when I did NOT reduce payload weight to compensate for the fairing, it still made the Terrier package\u00A0go higher. \u00A0This suggests that interstage fairings are probably a good idea, at least as long as the fairing base is staged low enough you\u0027re not hauling it to Tylo and back or something.
