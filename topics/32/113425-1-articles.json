I\u0027ve got a small two-seater orbital skiff with a rear-facing harpoon gun that I call the H-Wing. It rendezvous with a piece of debris, snags it with the harpoon, tows it into a suborbital trajectory, detaches, and speeds itself up until it\u0027s in orbit again. Works remarkably well; I\u0027ve gone from over 30 pieces of debris in low orbit to just 14. Soon the nearby skies will be clear of everything except Starbridge Station and the H-Wing Supply Depot (with extra fuel, spare harpoons, demolition charges, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T21:18:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERight click the debris icon at the top of the tracking station map, now only debris is shown.
