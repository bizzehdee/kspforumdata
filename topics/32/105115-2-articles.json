I see nothing in this release to make it fundamentally different than any previous. Sure, there may be more features than average, but that makes it bigger rather than different. Since there is no real difference in the process, I expect no more than I did from previous releases. The longstanding bugs will remain (ie the ones we are so used to we don\u0027t notice anymore). Some recent bugs will have been squashed, but there will also be new ones. There will be no \u0027balanced\u0027 gameplay, nor will the aero physics deserve to be called aerodynamics. It\u0027s just another features update.\n\u003E From watching the view numbers on Youtube and other social media, I don\u0027t think I am alone in this opinion. I don\u0027t see a rush of new customers asking about KSP. I see a steady flow of die-hard KSP fans having the same conversations they did last year, and the year before that.\n\nBut there is something radically different to previous releases.

The speed, the addition of last minute features, the media review of beta builds, the hype machine ... we have all seen it many times before and should not expect anything really different. I\u0027d like to see squad bring in some people to shake up their process and really focus on polishing KSP into a more finished product. At a minimum, someone should tie up the obvious loose ends and deal with the texture management and quality issues.

This is a game that has been under constant development for years, and will remain under development after; by your logic, the fact that this game will keep being added on to would mean that \u00271.0\u0027 wouldn\u0027t be ready potentially for years. As far as glitches go, in an era where games like Battlefield 4 and Assassin\u0027s Creed Unity exist, I hardly agree that glitches somehow prevents this game from being \u0027finished\u0027.

These internal elements ensure fluidity and such contours were important for the artist even though they were becoming less significant for other Impressionists. Thus Starry Night\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s composition was distinct from the Impressionist technique of the 19th century.\n\n[http://www.artble.com/artists/vincent_van_gogh/paintings/starry_night/more_information/analysis](http://www.artble.com/artists/vincent_van_gogh/paintings/starry_night/more_information/analysis)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T08:53:30Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 08:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by r4pt0r**"},{"CreatedByName":"Corw","CreatedById":7116,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T08:56:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E No clouds?!

Not enough places to explore, lack of clouds, lack of unity 5 and 64 bit.
