As much as possible, we want to ensure existing functional designs will still perform acceptably. It would be no fun to find out your spaceplanes aren\u0027t controllable anymore because of the new system. That wouldn\u0027t be an improvement at all from a fun point of view.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you think Squad should drop backwards compatibility with the new aerodynamics?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u003C/strong\u003E Harvester added an update on the blogpost, link is above in the first sentence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUpdate:\u003Cp\u003EFrom the comments it\u0027s evident that some clarification of what \u0027preserving functionality in old designs\u0027 should be taken to mean. First of, we don\u0027t expect any of the planned changes should require breaking the craft file format in any way, so this is a minor concern already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut most importantly, the only way to really judge whether the new system is an improvement over the old one is to compare both under equal circumstances, and for that we need a control. The stock crafts are coming in very handy for this. We know how they handle in the old system, and for the most part, we like how they fly (with some exceptions which do need improvement).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point is, the stock craft are our measuring stick for comparing, tweaking and tuning the many variables of the new system, and for that reason they must stay, as much as possible, compatible. This does not mean we aren\u0027t willing to compromise on a few designs if others are performing better (not in terms of service performance, in terms of feel when flying). But take for instance, the change over to the new lift model. There is one constant which is used to scale the lift coefficient of all wing sections, defined in the part cfg, so that it translates into a nice, controllable flight model. How do we tune something like that? We have to have some reference to compare it to. For now, this scale was set so the takeoff speed of most craft remains unaffected. This means the new lift model is producing values in the same order of magniture as the old one, in one particular situation, so we can start from there to have a solid basis to tune from. We will probably end up tweaking this value further based on feedback during testing, but the importance of having a basis for comparison can\u0027t be understated when working on something like this. On my first attempt, this value was set to 1.0, and ships simply exploded on physics start, because the forces were orders of magnitude off. Without a benchmark, it would have been very difficult to even find out what should be changed to fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, the short version is: don\u0027t worry too much about us worrying too much about backwards compatibility. It\u0027s not even likely to be such a big deal after all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is only my opinion but it feels like he missed the point of people wanting to drop backwards compatibility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT 2:\u003C/strong\u003E Maxmaps verifying things on twitter.
