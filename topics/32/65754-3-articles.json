However, IA-32 processors from the Pentium II onwards allow for a 36-bit physical memory address space, using Physical Address Extension (PAE), which gives a 64 GB physical address range, of which up to 62 GB may be used by main memory; operating systems that support PAE may not be limited to 4GB of physical memory, even on IA-32 processors. However, drivers and other kernel mode software, particularly older versions, may not be compatible with PAE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome operating systems reserve portions of process address space for OS use, effectively reducing the total address space available for mapping memory for user programs. For instance, 32-bit Windows reserves 1 or 2 GB (depending on the settings) of the total address space for the kernel, which leaves only 3 or 2 GB (respectively) of the address space available for user mode. This limit is much higher on 64-bit operating systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMemory-mapped files are becoming more difficult to implement in 32-bit architectures as files of over 4 GB become more common; such large files cannot be memory-mapped easily to 32-bit architectures\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AConly part of the file can be mapped into the address space at a time, and to access such a file by memory mapping, the parts mapped must be swapped into and out of the address space as needed. This is a problem, as memory mapping, if properly implemented by the OS, is one of the most efficient disk-to-memory methods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESome 64-bit programs, such as encoders, decoders and encryption software, can benefit greatly from 64-bit registers, while the performance of other programs, such as 3D graphics-oriented ones, remains unaffected when switching from a 32-bit to a 64-bit environment.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome 64-bit architectures, such as x86-64, support more general-purpose registers than their 32-bit counterparts (although this is not due specifically to the word length). This leads to a significant speed increase for tight loops since the processor does not have to fetch data from the cache or main memory if the data can fit in the available registers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E64 bit isn\u0027t that big of a deal performance wise under most applications, it\u0027s the address space. 32bit already handles 64 bit length floats, and internal and external busses are larger than 32bits, even on 32 bit systems, so operating on 64 bits of data on a 32 bit machine doesn\u0027t mean it will always take twice as many clock cycles as a 64 bit machine. Modern cpus use all sorts of tricks to handle a variety of data, including double floats, quite efficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"6.forty","CreatedById":97939,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-17T03:21:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MalfunctionM1Ke\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MalfunctionM1Ke\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI DONT want KSP to be ported into a 64-bit engine if it is not running stable.\u003Cp\u003EThats what everybodies opinion should be on the Topic and it is definetly the one of the devs, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell written code should really require little to no \u0022porting\u0022.

Recompiling for 64-bit will not (necessarily) make it any faster. I don\u0027t know about Mono, but for .NET, the 64-bit JIT isn\u0027t as good as the 32-bit JIT. Also, you (necessarily) use more memory, because pointers (at least) get bigger.
