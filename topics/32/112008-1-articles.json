I\u0027m pretty sure these are a reference to the F1-B rocket engines being used by Dynetics to develop an advanced booster for NASA\u0027s SLS. The F1-B will be a modern version of the old F-1 rocket engines used on the Saturn V moon rockets.\n\n![Z91.jpg](http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Z91.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Sgt.Shutesie","CreatedById":141397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T01:17:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The KS-25 bit in the Twin Boar and Mammoth are both from the RS-25.

I was playing around with Ven\u0027s Stock Revamp and he did that (Un-intentional plug to his mod). I played around with the KS-25 engines and they perform really well and they work great for shuttles, especially in the look department. No more Skipper bits sticking out of my shuttles. Take a look for yourself. And on a shuttle note, the S-Wings \u002B front S-wing bit could be a bunch bigger(The length needed for a shuttle look with 2 mk3 monoprop tanks and a large Mk3 cargobay) then perhaps scaling down the tail. Tweakscale is my buddy ATM though for Shuttles though."},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T01:38:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The twin-boar uses two KR-1\n\nI guess I missed it being renamed in 1.0.\nUh, and the F-1B\u0027s unlikely to happen.
