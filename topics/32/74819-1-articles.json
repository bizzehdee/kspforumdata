By default Kerbal Alarm Clock backs up your save any time you let it switch you to a different ship. These backups are stored in your save\u0027s folder with fairly self-explanatory names. With KSP closed, first make a copy of your current persistent.sfs, then make a copy of the appropriate backup (probably the one with the newest date) and rename it persistent.sfs.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HeadHunter67","CreatedById":74121,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-12T03:18:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis doesn\u0027t happen by a quick \u0022accidental\u0022 tap of F9.
