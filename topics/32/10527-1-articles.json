This video was made using MSI Afterburner\\\u0027s Screen Recorder, Kerbal Space Program (Version 14.4) and Sony Vegas Pro 11.\n\nIt is important to note that much of this video has been clipped and edited, sped up and cut for viewing pleasure. The actual time to launch into a 100KM orbit without time-warps and video edits is roughly 13 minutes. This video has cut the time from Lift off to final MECO into only a few minutes.\n\nKerbal Space Program can be downloaded at: [http://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/](http://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/)\n\nMods can be found on the forums, along with this Shuttle.\n\nThe actual liftoff was done using MechJeb\\\u0027s Ascent Autopilot, so a HUGE special thanks to Universal Mechatronics for their MechJeb plug-in. Doing this without Mechjeb\\\u0027s AR202 would have been impossible.\n\nOrbital Characteristics:\n\nApokee: 100,321 meters.\n\nPerikee: 100, 243 meters.\n\nInclination: 0.1 degree\n\nPeriod ~ 32.7 minutes\n\nSemi Major Axis = 650km\n\nMajor Axis = 12100"},{"CreatedByName":"chillman1212","CreatedById":16988,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-13T01:15:33Z","Content":"nice video!
