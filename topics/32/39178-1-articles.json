Even when the shuttles were launching for the most part news channels maybe gave it a 30 second mention. Though the local channels here in FL did a little better, but mostly towards the end of the shuttle program. A majority of people don\u0027t give it another thought most of the time. Similar to how most people view air travel and don\u0027t think twice when they hear a plane over head (I still look up and watch planes as they fly over head from time to time). IMO It\u0027s a sad that people are more focused on what\u0027s going on with celebrities (movie stars, athletes etc) than in things that could possibly change things for the better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me, while it might not meet the expectations of where we should be, I think the space program (not just NASA but all the commercial ventures as well, national and international...SpaceX, Orbital, Sierra Nevada/Dream Chaser, Planetary Resources, Reaction Engines Ltd/Skylon for example) is just as exciting, if not more so, as there is more opportunities for more people to get involved. Several companies have plans for Mars regardless of government involvement, short of paperwork for flight permits and such. The Mars One project, which IIRC is planning on launching something in 2018 give or take. Their plan is to run a reality tv show that follows the progress of training/qualifying applicants to go to Mars, then following them as they travel to and setup \u0022camp\u0022 there. It\u0027s basically written so you know going into it that it\u0027s a one way trip. Not to say that some other company won\u0027t provide transfer service back to Earth, but Mars One won\u0027t be.

It doesn\u0027t matter what we might be able to assemble in orbit if we can\u0027t get the pieces off the ground in the 1st place. Earth\u0027s not-insignificant gravity well, lined as it is with substantial aerodynamic drag, is a tarpit out of which every single lugnut and washer for every vehicle, station, or base must be forcibly dredged. That\u0027s what\u0027s keeping us stuck on Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConventional rockets ain\u0027t gonna get us there; they have known limits that physical laws will never change. There are scads of alternative ideas for getting stuff to orbit, some more plausible than others, but no matter how you slice it, none of them can deliver more than an Airstream trailer to orbit at one go, even if they actually work, and it would take hundreds, if not thousands, of such launches to create a ship like Project Orion. And then hundreds more to carry up enough people to make the trip worthwhile.
