The article is from two years ago, but I wouldn\\\u0027t be surprised if it were still up to date.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically what it says is GPU acceleration only works on Nvidia GPUs, and that it is faster there than on the CPU largely because CPU computation is artificially slowed-down (or intentionally unoptimized, whichever way you want to put it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022http://www.realworldtech.com/physx87/5/\u0022 data-cite=\u0022http://www.realworldtech.com/physx87/5/\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhile as a buyer it may be frustrating to see PhysX hobbled on the CPU, it should not be surprising. Nvidia has no obligation to optimize for their competitor\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s products. PhysX does not run on top of AMD GPUs, and nobody reasonably expects that it will. Not only because of the extra development and support costs, but also AMD would never want to give Nvidia early developer versions of their products. Nvidia wants PhysX to be an exclusive, and it will likely stay that way. In the case of PhysX on the CPU, there are no significant extra costs (and frankly supporting SSE is easier than x87 anyway). For Nvidia, decreasing the baseline CPU performance by using x87 instructions and a single thread makes GPUs look better. This tactic calls into question the CPU vs. GPU comparisons made using PhysX; but the name of the game at Nvidia is making the GPU look good, and PhysX certainly fits the bill in the current incarnation.\u003Cp\u003EThe bottom line is that Nvidia is free to hobble PhysX on the CPU by using single threaded x87 code if they wish. That choice, however, does not benefit developers or consumers though, and casts substantial doubts on the purported performance advantages of running PhysX on a GPU, rather than a CPU. There is already a large and contentious debate concerning the advantages of GPUs over CPUs and PhysX is another piece of that puzzle, but one that seems to create questions, rather than answers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003EEDIT:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewording\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Aramchek_","CreatedById":12588,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-29T13:23:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know all about physx, I r a gaming enthusiast, I am comfortable with it benifiting people with nv cards as I have one as many people do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI notice some ati/amd people here though too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhysx is not the only option to gpu physics however, there is also direct compute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever the unity engine uses physx, and if the engine supported doing it on the gpu it wouldn\\\u0027t hurt anyone to have it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for making a difference, it\\\u0027s about a 10 fps difference if you have a dedicated card, and in a game like this that is so heavily based around physics it could provide a fair bit more of a boost than that to anyone who could take advantage of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe argument that \u0027if it doesn\\\u0027t help everyone\u0027 is kind of moot, different cpu\\\u0027s and gpu\\\u0027s will give different performance anyway, each architecture has it\\\u0027s strengths and weaknesses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m not trying to be argumentative by the way, this is just how I see it, if it were in the engine, why not use it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Endeavour","CreatedById":21125,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-29T13:45:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wish it used the Gpu for physics.
