For my returns to Kerbin, I usually drop the bulk of my spacecraft after getting close to terminal velocity. My lander/pod will usually separate itself quite some distance from the ejected stage before the chutes open, and the ejected stage will almost never survive. On one of my return missions this week, I splashed down and recovered, then noticed in the tracking station that something did survive. So I looked, and the whole darn stage survived, unscathed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Actually looking at the timestamps on my screenshots, it landed before the ARM update, by a day or two.
