Seems straight foreward enough, until you start running into quad-coupled LV engines having better performance than their larger cousins. It also specifically doesnt care how much it weighs, as that is the next point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust to Weight Ratio is a term you see fairly often on these forums, but for engines specifically the TWR defines an absolute upper boundry to where they can land or take off from. It also gets used as a shorthand for other aspects, but it ist to be confused with...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust to Cross Section ratio. Basically, how tall can you make a rocket who\u0027s entire bottom is made of that engine? The LV45 has less power than a skipper, but it has a higher thrust by cross section and a better ISP, which is what makes LV45 and LV30 clusters so popular.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISP is the last sandbox point- how much fuel do you need to carry to get where you need to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn carear mode, the tech tree is considered a balance point by some- a common defence of the SLS parts seems to be \u0022but they\u0027re at the end of the tech tree,\u0022 and that real life technological progress is a justification to obsolete earlier engine designs. I disagree that carear mode tech can justify overpowered parts, but the tech tree is still something to pay attention to... as a tutorial.

A more \u0027conventional\u0027 tutorial would have probably worked too, but it would be exceedingly long and pretty boring. Plus, I think a game should always give players means to discover it by simply playing, and this is what we set out to do with R\u0026amp;D.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think any player, veteran or first-timer, would enjoy sitting through an overly long \u0027lesson\u0027 on what each part does. And more importantly, they wouldn\u0027t get to experience first hand the problems that some parts exist to solve. If you\u0027ve never experienced the problem of tall ships falling over on the pad, then you won\u0027t fully appreciate the fact that launch clamps exist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, the R\u0026amp;D system works to let everyone experience the process of gradually developing your space program, learning as you go how to overcome the problems you encounter. For new players, this allows them to get into the game without having to sit through an introduction, and for veterans, the restrictions are also a good thing, as they set them (or rather \u0027us\u0027) up with new challenges that require us to come up with new ways to tackle old problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tech tree is meant to balance Expected Player skill. That\u0027s why the small, well rounded LV engines are presented to the new player first, while additional complications like air breathing engines are delayed. The aerospike is rarely worth using outside an endgame eve surface return or Jool datum return, so it shouldn\u0027t clutter up a newbie\u0027s engine tab until their tech tree is complete, despite it\u0027s otherwise lackluster performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich leaves the most speculative balance point, Cost. There\u0027s been prices in the VAB since forever, but noone has any idea how budgets will work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy theory for Budgets is that they will be a limit-per-launch, but not carry over between launches. (beyond success bonuses/failure penalties) If this is correct, Price would be balanced against Part Effectiveness, from the sandbox balance points. A skipper is more expensive than a LV45, but cheaper than 4 LV45s and a rockomax-to-4-engine adapter. An SLS engine would be even more expensive, but not to the point that it\u0027s cheaper to make an asparagused monster to get the same payload to orbit. Having Cost reinforce Part efficiency would balance various designs by capability- an asparagused monster for X budget has similar capability to a powerful cluster of high tech parts for the same budget- and if you dont have enough budget, getting beyond kerbin SoI may be beyond your capability, even with a fully unlocked tech tree. This is the very problem NASA has in real life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could be wrong about budgets- but noone else knows either. to claim some unknown system will balance a part has to be some kind of logical falacy.

Engines using kerosene are not very efficient, but because kerosene is cheap and easy to handle, it\u0027s more feasible to build big powerful engines using it. Engines burning hydrogen are more efficient but also more expensive to use. Lower stage engines are designed to be more powerful and achieve better Isp at sea level.

Realistically, these should have good Isp both at sea level and in vacuum, at the price of being more expensive for their thrust than upper stage engines. Because costs are not a factor in the game at the moment, we should reduce the vacuum Isp of these engines to make upper stage engines more useful.

Big engines can often be made more efficient than smaller engines.
