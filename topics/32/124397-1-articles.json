The Mk1 and Mk2 (fuel tanks specifically) carry the same amount of fuel. However, The Mk1 parts are lighter for the same thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I get that the Mk2 parts have lifting body, but if you look at the end sides of the Mk2 tanks, you can see what looks like a hollow space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnybody think that that should have some fuel in it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-SPAddict\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T01:47:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI view it more as different looks, and look at the bright side, you can clip a mk1 LF tank inside a mk1-mk2 adapter without violating volume logic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen again, i really shouldnt say anything about fuel, since i habitually clip fuel tanks, even into each other, to get the desired range in a very small size/shape as i like compact vessels, and big stuff is reserved for capital ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, realistically the mk2 parts should have around twice their current fuel, and around twice the mass, but i dont mind, i can always clip mk1 parts inside mk1 parts and get said result.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GeneralVeers","CreatedById":148918,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T01:47:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENope.
