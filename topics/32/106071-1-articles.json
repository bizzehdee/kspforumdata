I was curious about how to make the mk1 capsule re-enter correctly and whether it is indeed bugged.\n\nI\u0027m using the parts I have to hand in the early game, so I did what I could to shift the centre of mass of the capsule upwards to keep it stable. I sent the capsule on a sub-orbital flight to complete the *escape from atmosphere* contract. I turned off SAS after final stage burnout, and allowed the capsule to enter a slow tumble.\n\n![F3kTv8r.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/F3kTv8r.jpg)\n\nThe tumble corrected itself after the capsule started to encounter significant drag.\n\n![ZPebD0m.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ZPebD0m.jpg)\n\nIt remained stable thereafter.\n\n![7lq5RFH.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/7lq5RFH.jpg)\n\n![J4GhSjg.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/J4GhSjg.jpg)\n\n![u7EL65h.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/u7EL65h.jpg)\n\nIt looks like I need something to ballast the capsule to keep it stable.

Because of the high heat tolerance of capsule parts, it will also survive if you use the right reentry angle and such (30km periapsis, tested from LKO and a bit higher, have not tested from Munar return yet).\n\nA capsule and heat shield, no other parts, yield similar results, though the impact will kill it.\n\nA capsule, parachute, and heat shield yeild a less stable result. In fact, as near as I can tell, it wants to fly backwards, and stops only because that would mean turning far enough that the parachute is no longer occluded, which pushes the parachute back towards the center, resulting in an entry just far enough off of retrograde to burn up the parachute."},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T19:42:31Z","Content":"That\u0027s because the heatshield is massless which, IMHO, requires a hotfix.
