I know I know KSP on consoles \u0022boo blah boo\u0022 whatever. I started playing KSP probably about four years ago now but haven\u0027t been able to play for about the last year due to a shot PC so I haven\u0027t even been able to enjoy 1.0. However I have a PS4 and greatly anticipate the release even if I have to buy the game again as KSP is one of my favorite things. (up there with TES IV Oblivion... /Fallout 4 hype).
