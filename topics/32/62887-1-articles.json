I mean, I love mods for the added capabilities they give you, and just for the variety of rocket parts. Then I\u0027d go build huge fleets of ships with complex, interrelated missions, investing scads of time in the game, and BOOM! It would all get wiped out by the supernova of a game update. The problem with updates when you\u0027re using lots of mods is that usually all the mods have to be updated to be compatible with the new version of the game, and with each other in the new version. Sometimes mods just don\u0027t get updated at all so you\u0027re screwed there. And sometimes the modsmiths introduce major changes to their mods to coincide with the new update, which are incompatible with ships using the old version of the mod. You can\u0027t keep using the old version of the mod because it won\u0027t work in the new version of the game, or won\u0027t work with other mods that were updated, or something. So basically, heavy dependence on mods is poison while the game itself is still in major development.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a result, I\u0027ve gone back to doing things almost all stock. I only have 2 major mods I use anymore: Kethane and KAS. Without Kethane, there\u0027s a real limit to what you can do in space and KAS allows much more versatility with Kethane, so I consider both these mods as essential parts of the game. Fortunately, both mods are maintained by the same guy, Majiir, who is very prompt in updating them for the new game version, so I feel pretty safe in using them. Otherwise, I just use mods that add instrumentation or other interface enhancements, such as Kerbal Alarm Clock, RCS Build Aid, Navyfish\u0027s Docking Indicator, Kerbal Engineer, MJ, and now the toolbar for them all. None of these will break your save so you can do without them for a while if updates are delayed or never happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bottom line is that now I have neither fairings nor massive 3.75m and 5m rocket parts. So I\u0027m doing the usual stock thing of ugly, lumpy asparagus blobs of orange tanks. And no more big wings from B9 or Pwings, so my airplanes are covered with mosaics of little stock wing parts. I\u0027m not proud of this--I used the fairings and big rocket parts to avoid doing this--but at present it\u0027s pretty much essential to surviving game updates.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Comrade Jenkens","CreatedById":59544,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T17:09:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVaries.

I do use an asparagus-like staging scheme, but I never exceed four side rockets, and my preferred configuration actually looks just like a Falcon Heavy, usually with smaller rockets to either side which drain into the big rocket, so that I can have all that fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I design, I do several test flights and I look for various criteria. One thing is, if it\u0027s a heavy payload (say a science orbiter with 3-man capsule and nukes) I simply abort the launch if I can\u0027t make 200 m/s by 10,000 meters. That is kind of an indicator to me I\u0027m shy on lifting power. So I will add two side rockets (in the Anvil series I use the 2m boosters, otherwise if I\u0027m going Rockomax I just make another 2m stack).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I\u0027m still dragging at 10,000 meters, I add two more boosters. What I usually do if I\u0027m up to four liquid side-mounted boosters, there is a pair that drains to the center, and if I need two more, those two drain to the \u0022last\u0022 two. I make the first pair of boosters bigger, as big as they need to be to get to where I\u0027m going (in this scheme I usually toss them by 5,000 meters). The idea is simply throw away as much weight as I can until I get over the atmosphere. So that second pair (the last to drop off) I sometimes make smaller. I don\u0027t do math for this, but I observe which thing gets me further. Once I have a scheme that works for me in the current game I stick with it. I have been using Anvils because struts do not get preserved in the sub-assemblies, and I hate re-strutting a booster. I\u0027d rather build it again from scratch, so the fewer struts I need the better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, if my booster isn\u0027t going around 1000 m/s by 30,000 meters, it\u0027s not going to space today. I usually do my gravity turn starting very slowly around 25,000-27,000 meters. If my rocket isn\u0027t doing 600 m/s by the time we clear atmosphere, and around 1400 by the time I ditch my final ground-level booster, I start over. So by the time my \u0022top\u0022 stage, the last-but-payload rocket fires, I expect to be around 50,000 meters, with my apoapsis above atmosphere. If that isn\u0027t happening, I go back and fiddle with more fuel, and more things to throw away sooner.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T20:43:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow that I\u0027ve moved over to RSS/FAR/DREC my rockets tend towards aerodynamic/realistic.
