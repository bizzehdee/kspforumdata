The K2 guys ran out of fuel 15m above the surface, and K4 lithobraked half their descent stage to pieces before the bottom four ROUND-8 tanks were added! And now, Mr. engineer, *tell me how 40 units of fuel could have been added to that stage with any other tank?* Imagine Oscars down there... there would be no clearance at all!
