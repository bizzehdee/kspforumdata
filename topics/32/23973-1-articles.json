I suffered some file corruption of my older game folders and game saves and even screenshots. Lost most everything Pre-17 that I hadn\u0027t already uploaded to Photo-bucket. I\u0027m including some of the few images I have of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022Falcon XLS\u0022 was a design which used mostly stock parts. But I did add MechJeb to it in it\u0027s final version. I also used an old set of parts that I -think- were part of the Silesko pack or something similar. Specifically they were part of a pack that allowed you to recreate a sort of \u0022Von-Braun\u0022 style rocket (like the 50\u0027s/early 60s concept art from before they finalized the Saturn designs). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI originally used the old Mark 1 command pod. But when that was no longer available the ship became a one-man ship with one of the airplane cockpits. This was cool with me, as the IVA is fantastic on it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s the pics - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Hb62JDv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Hb62JDv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DWKnSxI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DWKnSxI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jPkTexd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jPkTexd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zEkoimF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zEkoimF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see - I was going for that \u0022old-fashioned\u0022 look.

One of two - and they\u0027d be really nice to have as well.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway - the one bit of kit I cannot seem to find are those cone-shaped tanks you see in the above pics. Everything else I can find or their are good equivalents for. But not those. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Dxpc3yc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Dxpc3yc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love to find the original craft part files for those. They\u0027ll likely use the old fuel system so they won\u0027t be compatible. But I think some editing of the CFG file would take care of that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone recognize the bits I\u0027m talking about? She was a good reliable ship capable of getting all the way to Duna.
