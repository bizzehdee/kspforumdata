I think 2.5 minutes sounds like a very long time for loading the game, especially if you are using a mod that keeps crashing the game every few launches due to memory leaks, which was the case for me with the ball bearing/multiwheels mod ever since .22 or so. And this is why I also prefer stock parts since they just dont stop working. Multiwheels mod has not even been updated since .21, so there is a good chance this issue will never be fixed either. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-07T23:57:26Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2014 11:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by boxman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Comrade Jenkens","CreatedById":59544,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-07T23:55:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had two long breaks from KSP and I\u0027m well into the third.
