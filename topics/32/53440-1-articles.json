Specifically, that satellite has three ScanSat sensors surrounding a Kethane scanner, so I need to put one in orbit around every planet before sending a manned mission there, just to know where the biomes and Kethane deposits are. I\u0027ve got a launcher that stacks four of these on top of a nuke-propelled transfer stage; last night I put one on each Laythe moon other than Bop, then crashed the transfer vehicle into Jool itself (release the Kraken!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe burn times get a bit ridiculous, but I just leave KSP running in a window while I go do other things for the time it takes to burn.

The biggest problem I have with spaceplanes is simply fuel supply; it\u0027s hard to make one that can carry enough fuel to get to Laythe, even on an LV-N (which that design has) without several refueling stops along the way. So, I\u0027ve put those ions on to allow the plane to make a really long burn for interplanetary transfers. They don\u0027t add much weight to the design, and can make a huge difference in capabilities. The burns get ridiculously long, of course, but again, I do something else while I wait.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the hybrid ions get used in most of my other designs; they\u0027re ISP 900 in space, although they consume more fuel types (which lowers the effective ISP a bit) and use electricity.
