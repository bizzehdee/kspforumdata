Once I unlock the Mammoth I just can\u0027t resist using it...\n\nSometimes when I overbuild a rocket, the mission expands. Like a couple days ago, when I started a new career game and sent Val to the Mun for the first Mun landing. The rocket had so much extra d-v that she decided to go to Mimnus too. Mission control was a little surprised, but you know how it is.\n\nAfter that, that model of rocket was reused several times, always on Mun/Minmus combined landing missions. It pulled in some really big science numbers."},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T19:50:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Has anyone else found themselves dogged-determined to spend Huge amounts of time to make a bad idea work rather than just start from scratch or wait?\n\nI once launched a rocket upside down because having the crew pods at the bottom made it easier for a large crew to board (this was before you could load crew while in the editors).
