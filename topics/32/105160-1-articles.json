They smell, smear, leak and make too much noise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t like talking to people because most of them are really disagreeable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to take each of you guys at squad by your smelly, sweaty hands and shake them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven though it would mean touching you... I know.. disgusting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to tell you guys something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven though you might reply and start a conversation. Well shut-up and listen! I didn\u0027t write this for a chat. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you feel some need to reply.. keep it short and don\u0027t expect a response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to tell you that I love KSP. Best game ever. Played it for longer than any other and I\u0027ve played a lot cos I\u0027m really really old. The only things I say to people nowadays is usually something like \u0022Get out of my garden!\u0022 or \u0022Go and play some where else!\u0022 or \u0022Well it\u0027s MY ball now!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI paid for it. not enough, but I paid for it. I think it was less than 20 quid. If you guys bring out any official expansion packs, I\u0027ll pay for them too. I\u0027ll pay more than I paid for the game. I\u0027ve been playing it for around three thousand hours and now 1.0 is coming out so there goes a load more of my time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo thanks Squad. Thanks for making KSP and giving me something to do that doesn\u0027t have to involve being sociable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet on those expansion packs. I want to give you more money. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting to feel like I cheated you... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee what I mean, you guys haven\u0027t even replied and you are already making me feel bad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T15:06:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell said.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the hard work, Squad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daveroski","CreatedById":93896,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T15:17:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, I don\u0027t think I have ever been entertained so well and for so long but for so little money.

I\u0027ve bought several AAA games and I\u0027ve felt cheated, but I bought KSP in a steam sale for about 12 quid and I feel like I cheated the devs. I totally agree with the OP for wanting to shake hands with the devs, even though it involves physical contact with humans, and give them money. Keep up the excellent work SQUAD!!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
