Initially, I bummed out because i figured I\u0027d do sandbox and immediately would build *awesome* spaceships with mods and all. It wasn\u0027t particularly fun, successful or satisfying. So the game lay dormant on my harddrive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Here\u0027s it: The reason I got hooked, was I finally approached the game as an \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eexploration\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E. I started taking one step at a time. Focusing only on the next step.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI play 100% stock except for KVV to make occasional portraits of my rockets. I navigate and fly my rockets manually, with help of SAS and navigation modes. I progress gradually towards a new planet/moon by explorative missions, develop rockets by guessing requirements and test them as well as possible on Kerbin, get additional knowledge/confirm with\u00A0unmanned probes which try land and return. Then it\u0027s the big event, the manned landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I repeat the manned landings (for new areas and new things to try)\u00A0and progressively tweak the rocket to work better and better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis iterative, progressive adventure of exploration, which starts by just going up a bit and dangling down again in a parachute, is the entire game content for me. The reason I enjoy KSP. My main and only game objective. And I don\u0027t do try\u0026amp;reload gameplay. I do use F5/F9, but rather conservatively. And I\u0027m very concerned about the safety of my Kerbals. I keep them alive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see others play the game differently, using mod components\u00A0that allow them to do all kinds of things, using Mechjeb to fly\u00A0and Hyperedit to test, and I think to myself, - hey, it\u0027s a software toy, let them play any way they want. But I do suspect some are\u00A0missing a huge deal. And I do suspect it\u0027s a big pity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, I still think it\u0027s awesome to see the ways some people have found to play this game. Like land trains, aircraft design and Star Wars. But it feels to me they are actually exploring in a similar way to what I do. This game is made like a software toy. That\u0027s its big strength.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut for one of OP\u0027s points, I do lack obvious next goals. Eve is it currently, but it appears a bit too challenging so far. Currently I\u0027m not working on it, focusing more on exploration of worlds I routinely land on. And I do think there\u0027s a - for a designed \u003Cem\u003Egame -\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ecurious lack of progressive intermediate challenge goals between Duna and Laythe, and between Laythe and Eve. The gap between Laythe and Eve is particularly big, I feel. (Of course, if you use mods, mechjeb and hyperedit, I\u0027m sure it\u0027s very possible, and would require much less hard work, but it would spoil it for me.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-26T09:30:26Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2016 09:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Vermil\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-26T12:31:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne hopes the devs will return to adding celestial bodies once 1.1 hits and the memory limit isn\u0027t so onerous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-26T13:51:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222474324\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022134857\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221458995494\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002212858\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n27 minutes ago, Red Iron Crown said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne hopes the devs will return to adding celestial bodies once 1.1 hits and the memory limit isn\u0027t so onerous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI second this, and oops, I\u0027ve accidentally tagged \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/66485-squad/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002266485\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/66485-squad/\u0022\u003E@SQUAD\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0themselves\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI understand not wanting to crowd the system, but there are definitely some things that could be added.

have to admit, when I downloaded the demo over the Christmas holiday (and somehow got the old .18 demo), I had a chance to re-experience a more \u0022pure\u0022 kerbal experience. \u00A0I still prefer the modern game (and the unforgiving nature of a \u0022real\u0022 atmosphere makes me highly recommend KER to beginners) and won\u0027t be uninstalling mods anytime soon, but it did help to come down to kerbals, boosters, and more boosters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing that the demo really brings is the part limitation. \u00A0With the full suite of KSP parts, there is nearly always a bigger engine to lift whatever you want efficiently. \u00A0With the demo, it pretty much comes down to asparagusing parts over and over until you have enough delta-v. \u00A0Then there is the issue of not knowing your amount of delta-v and simply overbuilding so you can get to the Mun and back. \u00A0There is a fundamental disconnect between players and Squad over this, but I suspect that 1.1 will finally admit to the amount of delta-v in the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I would recommend that even the most hardened KSP players consider trying the demo* once again. \u00A0Try to

you into your KSP obsession, go visit what it was (even Scott Manley mentions in a recent GDC video with the kerbal animator that \u0022kerbals made KSP take off while Orbiter stays obscure\u0022). \u00A0There is no reason to give up the modern game that allows you to put a flag on every planet, just don\u0027t miss the extra experience with the fun little game that was (hint: a great time to
