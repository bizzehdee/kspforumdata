So after tinkering around on it for a bit more I think I have found the solution and even got a bit more dV as a result. Now I have around 11,341dV in the lower stage and 922dv in the upper with 1.07 TWR when looking at the Evesetting in KER (1.78 TWR at the launchpad). It has all the science, accept for the nose cone, accessible from the ladder, and it will be jettisoned from the craft with the ladders (except for a thermometer and grav scanner). I am not sure as to how many chutes I will need to place on this craft since Eve is much more dense than Kerbin and Duna, I am guessing not a whole lot due to this fact but ideas are welcomed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i61.tinypic.com/2yvv2n6.png\u0022 alt=\u00222yvv2n6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot much changed from the other version....well just a few more spikes and separators to lighten the craft as things empty.

I may put 4 of the midsize srb\u0027s on it as well, but I am not sure about the weight so maybe the smaller ones would be the better route. I am also thinking of doing something like I did with my old Mun tour bus and just build my own, then I can put more heat shields on it hopes of getting on the ground. The reaction wheels are there to stop the swaying while staging, although I might get rid of the center one since I have a vectoring engine. I also had winglets on there but took them off, if I do put them on I will still have one control wheel in the center, again to help stay steady while staging. I may work on those tomorrow though as the engine clusters were a pain to pipe in a semi logical order. I am trying to get to 1.2 twr for Eve but that is a hefty goal I think, but I will not give up without a fight (or cussing and swearing).
