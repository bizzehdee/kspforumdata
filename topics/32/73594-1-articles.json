My gaming desktop hardware consists of an 8-core AMD 8350 and 16GB of DDR3 1800 ram running on an ASUS Crosshair Formula V motherboard. Windows runs on a 120GB Intel 330 SSD, with my apps installed to a Samsung 840 Evo 1TB SSD (I\u0027d keep the VM here too). Would the bottleneck be through the Hyper-Visor or just windows background stuff? I figure if I throw 8GB of RAM, 60GB on the Samsung SSD, and 4 cores to the VM that it should run pretty snappy. Not sure how to allow the VM hardware access to the EVGA graphics cards though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Duke23","CreatedById":96591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-30T20:00:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the SSDs it probably wouldn\u0027t be as big an issue but unless something has changed that CPU should get you slightly better performance than my FX-4350 as far as KSP goes. Which still leaves a little to be desired on high part count ships and stations not considering still running Windows... I wouldn\u0027t personally run any game in a VM unless I absolutely have to because there always seems to be a performance loss even when the VM is 98se or something. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen again a lot of that is probably due to the way the CPU and GPU especially is accessed by the VM so maybe you wont have that issue depending on your setup. I\u0027ve found a dual boot system often runs games much faster on the Linux side though, even if you have to cheat with WINE.
