Its status is currently like every other game on the premiere day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere won\u0027t be any major updates in quite some time. And the likelihood that \u0022quite some time\u0022 extends into \u0022ever\u0022 is rather high - slow-going projects tend to fall behind the times and get canceled, abandoned and die, as technological progress outpaces them by so much that whatever they tried to achieve is long obsolete when they are still ways from release. The Duke Nukem Forever syndrome - it was supposedly rewritten from scratch four times, for the simple reason by the time the game was halfway complete, it was so far behind the \u0027industry standard\u0027 there was no other option but to scrap it and try again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOTOH currently the PC development (in general) has slowed down.

But - I don\u0027t think it\u0027s the case. I believe there will be a breakthrough - there always are, and we\u0027re long due for another one. Something like Quake, which started the era of 3D first person games (not just shooters). (Wolfenstein 3D and Doom, were revolutionary but it didn\u0027t cause THE breakthrough). Or the Orange Box (Half-Life 2 \u002B Portal \u002B CounterStrike Source), which brought an entirely new standard of graphics and gameplay dynamics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think No Man\u0027s Sky was set to be the next revolution - its promises were everything that would be needed to boost PC into the new golden age.

They are about the thing that Hexen and Heretic were in the Doom era.
