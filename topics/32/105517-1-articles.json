I appear to be missing something that I guess should be obvious... but isn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, Ore, there\u0027s three stages of data collection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Stick the big antenna in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Go over the surface with the little antenna, manually checking areas you\u0027d like to land for lat/long (which you have NO idea of where you are via in game controls...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Go hit a biome with the little guy (landed or below 1000m) for a more discreet amount of information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, now you\u0027ve got your big old drill truck and you\u0027re trying to go somewhere just *tasty!* to drill up some ore at. You have no idea where you\u0027re going because unless you\u0027ve got the big old satellite array ON that vehicle, you can\u0027t see the overlay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t turn on the overlay in map view unless you\u0027ve activated it on your ship... or you\u0027re in the Tracking Station, so you\u0027re probably not quite sure where to use your Narrow Band scanner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than \u0027eyeballing it\u0027 from one ship and landing in another, is there some way to mark a target area/position for ore collection?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
