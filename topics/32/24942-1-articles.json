Have Squad actually made the Kerbals feel for their comrades or was it just a weird quirk. Whatever it was, it was really heart string pulling for sure. The sadness was tempered though by having the other guy have a party in the bottom seat lol... Swinging his arms and probably singing bawdy rugby songs too. I was sure he was singing \u0022I SURVIVED\u0022 at one point lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s weird how you get attached to these little green guys....
