That would make planning gravity assists so much easier. As it is now you only see the position if your maneuver node happens to enter the SOI, so I wind up just fiddling with the maneuver nodes until it happens to enter the SOI, using the orbital periods of the moons to kind of guesstimate about where they\u0027d be."},{"CreatedByName":"heng","CreatedById":126869,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T14:02:55Z","Content":"you could just open a sandbox and timewarp there...\n\nAFAIK the way KSP is set up means, the dates are interchangable. \n\ncorrect me if i\u0027m wrong"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceChipmunk","CreatedById":142023,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T14:27:00Z","Content":"You could use the Transfer Planner mod to work out when the best time is to transfer to the SOI of the planet, then tweak it slightly to pass the moon. The transfer Planner also shows you the dV needed for just a fly-by without capture."}]}
