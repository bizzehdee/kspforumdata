Project Longshot consisted of probe body, some science equipment and a metric ****ton of fuel tanks connected to a single NERVA. Entire ship weighted just about 70 tons. I was planning to check how fast i can get it going beyond Eeloo orbit. To do that i intended to use every possible gravity assist along the way, shed as much weight as possible with staging, and give the final push with ion engine. I got to good start with a Mun slingshot - but then 0.22 rolled in, i got busy with SCIENCE! and kinda forgot about my poor probe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thunderstar","CreatedById":64703,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T14:22:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eout of the sun\u0027s SOI? no sadly it\u0027s imposible,i mean you can obtain escape velocity but you can\u0027t leave the system, the SOI of the sun is infinite, that means you\u0027re never going to escape the sun, so recreate voyager is impossible in ksp\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T14:27:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022thunderstar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022thunderstar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eout of the sun\u0027s SOI? no sadly it\u0027s imposible,i mean you can obtain escape velocity but you can\u0027t leave the system, the SOI of the sun is infinite, that means you\u0027re never going to escape the sun, so recreate voyager is impossible in ksp\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaaaw it\u0027s possible.
