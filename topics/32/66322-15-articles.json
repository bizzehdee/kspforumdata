They\u0027re just sensor blips. The reason for that is the ability to give you 5-15 blips at once and constantly spawn more at zero performance and RAM impact. Only when you start tracking them do they become real, and you cannot enounter anything not tracked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) I haven\u0027t seen a limit imposed in any video. Though the most I\u0027ve seen people track at once were 7 or 8 or so. Keep in mind the answer to question 1... having more and more physical asteroids in the solar system will degrade performance over time, so if you want to lock every rock that ever spawns, be prepared for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) They have a stat called signal strength that starts full and degrades as time passes while they are not tracked. If signal strength reaches zero, the blip despawns forever. So yes, if you un-track something that hasn\u0027t been made a part of a player vessel via clawing it, it will disappear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.b.) What happens to rocks that people have once docked with, then undocked again? For example those moved into Kerbin orbit and left there? I don\u0027t know what happens if you un-track those. Or if you even \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E un-track those.

A Kerbal implementation of the SLS parts might have provided a 3/4 2.5m tank (Rockomax-48, reskin of the KSPX part yet to be implemented) together with a unique adapter and matching 1.25m motor parts, rather than baking them all together in a single object. Similarly to that, I would have liked to see the 4-cluster 3.75m piece turned into a 3.75m to 4x2.5m cluster adapter and separate new 2.5m motor parts. As it is I\u0027ll likely be deleting these welded clusters to keep them from using memory - rather be using scratch-built boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brdavis","CreatedById":88788,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-25T14:38:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bomoo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bomoo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs it is I\u0027ll likely be deleting these welded clusters to keep them from using memory - rather be using scratch-built boosters.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s really one of the beauties of this game - I can do it any way I please \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.
