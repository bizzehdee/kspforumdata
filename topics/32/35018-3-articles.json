Such a technology would make researching Kerbol\u0027s system very easy and therefore very boring. At least I like to plan and make transitions, landings and ascents by using limited delta-v instead of flying freely to any planets in system. I think that it would be impossible to create thousands of really different and well detailed planets by using some kind of computer algorithm. At least it would need supercomputer\u0027s memory and computing speed.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere does that assumption come from that it would require vast amounts of computational power to add more planets to the Kerbal universe? It wouldn\u0027t require tons of power to have a bunch of additional planets, seeing as how they\u0027re \u0022on rails\u0022 and exempt from physics calculations, and the terrain meshes only load when within a certain distance of them, similar to how the ships themselves load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoreover, the whole idea behind FTL is that it would make the distances between star systems possible to traverse, but that doesn\u0027t mean exploring the local system would become trivial, because theoretically you couldn\u0027t use such a drive in the local system anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m all for FTL, and I wouldn\u0027t mind skipping the actual travel time in order to make other systems additional \u0022scenes\u0022 in the game, as the Kerbol system is now. It would be fun if it were a little more complicated to set up the transit between systems though. No reason it should be as easy as plopping a couple of maneuver nodes and burning.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Subcidal","CreatedById":20751,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-11T09:14:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo stargates, Please no stargates. I like the fact that I have to design something to get to where I want it to go. To be able to just walk through a stargate removes like 99% of the value of the game to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I have no problem with Eve\u0027s color, Though I do think it\u0027s mass and size should be tweaked to be a bit more venus like. I also don\u0027t see a problem with making it extremely hard to land on, despite how close it is. In general I think it should be a bit more Venus-y, But not too much. And having a planet that\u0027s extremely hard to land on that\u0027s further out doesn\u0027t necessarily make it all that much harder to get to for \u0027advanced\u0027 players. If you\u0027re trying to land on the hardest planet, travelling between/to them is the least of your worrys. It\u0027s the descent, landing, and ascent that\u0027s the challenge. Getting there and back is the easy part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hannu","CreatedById":60596,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-11T09:35:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course you can generate low detailed planets, like current KSP planets, with a simple algorithm and get whole galaxy with billions planets with different sizes, colors, surface roughnesses, and gas pressures. But I think that it would not be very interesting if planets lacks of fine details. Producing fine details, like weather, small scale topography, all kind of stuff on surface etc. is very hard. You must precalculate whole planet, which needs insane amounts of RAM and storage memory, or create details in real time, which means huge computing costs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI prefer that Squad should develop current planets instead of create a lot of new ones which are practically similar except size, color etc. On every real planet there are different regions but KSP\u0027s planets have maybe couple of anomalies and couple of interesting topographic places. I have driven hundred kilometers on Eve\u0027s surface and there was not any interesting details. I would like to see rivers, lakes, stones, small scale hills, rains, sunny times etc. and take into account their effects to kerbals, vehicles (for example cooling, wet soil ..) instead of ten new detailless planets of moons. KSP have already small, medium, large and impossible celestial bodies. Easy, hard, and impossible places to visit etc. Plain planets and mountainous moons. Places with different atmospheres. In my opinion there should be more variables before increasing number of celestial bodies would be reasonable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is true that FTL can be limited to interstellar transitions. But game\u0027s current simplified physics model can not handle really different solar systems, for example multiple stars, twin planets etc. which would be interesting challenges to orbit planning. Other solar systems would be very much like Kerbol\u0027s system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
