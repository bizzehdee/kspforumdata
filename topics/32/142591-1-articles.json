And since I\u0027m in the middle of an 18-minute nuke burn to Moho, I thought I\u0027d post this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you make a maneuver node, and edit it, you can of course grab the prograde, retrograde handles,or whatever handle, and adjust the burn. OK, I get that. And if you pull the handle out further, the amount of the burn will accelerate faster. That is, close to the middle, it increases the burn very little, but if you drag it all the way out, then within seconds you\u0027ve created a burn that will intersect the nearest black hole. Close to the middle of the handle, very little change, further out (or in), much more change.\u00A0That\u0027s all fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the problem: You can also do fine adjustments to the node by using the mouse wheel. Move your cursor over the desired direction (prograde, retrograde, whatever) and roll the mouse wheel. Fine idea, but there is something weird about it. If you scroll slowly, you can make fine adjustments, but if you scroll faster, it seems to have some kind of acceleration applied. Slow scroll will increment, say, 2 or 3 m/s per \u0022click\u0022 (not mouse click, wheel click, the click your wheel makes, you know), but if you scroll faster, it increases to something like 10-50 m/s per click, or even hundreds of m/s per click.\u00A0And frankly, it drives me nuts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact it\u0027s worse than that. Sometimes you scroll one way and it really increases the burn, then you try to correct back the other way with the wheel, and it doesn\u0027t... it only increases it a small amount, even when you scroll fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince the mouse wheel is supposed to be for fine tuning the burn, it should not have this acceleration applied. One \u0022click\u0022 should always be a small, consistent\u00A0amount of change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave I explained this adequately? I hope so. Let me know if you have any questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-27T09:05:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI totally agree, and this is why I never fine tune a maneuver with the stock maneuver node gizmo/widget/whateveritscalled.
