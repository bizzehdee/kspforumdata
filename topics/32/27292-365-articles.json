Due to recently researching and unlocking the FL-R10 monopropellant tank and the cylindrified one, I compared the prices and mass-fractions of the monopropellant tanks (other than the largest, the R1). The FL-R10 is the same price as the roundified, but has a lower dry mass and carries more fuel, so I replaced the roundified tank on my RescuerB standard orbital rescue ship with an R10. The R25 has twice the price and fuel quantity of the R10, but three times the dry mass, and the cylindrified is the same price and dry mass as the R25, but with one and a half times the fuel.
