The new stock aero, though, feels off to me. I don\u0027t know how to explain it, but 1.02 stock feels much more difficult to maintain control on rockets than FAR ever did. In .90 FAR, I could launch single-stack rockets with no fins easily, but in this new stock I\u0027ve been having trouble keeping any rocket (with fins, no fins, fins up high, fins down low, reaction wheels, RCS, etc...) from flipping straight over. \n\nI also have trouble getting anything other than the 3.75m parts into orbit. My 2.5m designs flip wildly at around 15km, and I haven\u0027t gotten a 1.5m stack past 30km Ap. I don\u0027t know what the difference is between FAR and this new stock, but new stock is absolutely more difficult than FAR ever was, for me. That said...I do actually like the new aero.

I tested for about 8 hours yesterday with several different engine mix and configuration that I could for a small 25 ton spaceplane to try and get into orbit and found that in no way could I do it, and I was building spaceplanes extensively since .20. I literally can\u0027t get anything into space unless it is using 8 RAPIER engines and 8-10k units of LFO, which pretty much makes mark2 parts useless.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T20:30:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 08:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wren**"},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T20:33:50Z","Content":"\u003E I encourage people to stop speculating and stop going off perception and to *actually test stuff.*\n\nAnd that is exactly what I have done. I have even brought some of the craft forward from vanilla .24 to compare with 1.01/02. Things I thought flew well with NEAR in .24, .25, and .90 fly even BETTER in 1.0.1/.2. I have had to redesign some of my rockets as it has been interesting watching the cartwheeling rocket of spectacular failures (same thing happened with .90).
