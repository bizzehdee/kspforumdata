The first few (low-tech) contracts were completed with simple LFO rockets and such, but once I reached the second tier of techs I designed my ultimate satellite: two ScanSat sensors (Hi/Bio/Anomaly), a Karbonite scanner, a thermometer, an antenna, ten 1x6 solar panels, a bunch of batteries, and enough Xenon to give me ~27km/s dV. Best of all, it fits in one of the half-sized Mk2 bays (and masses 3 tons) making it really easy to lift with my small spaceplane, so it\u0027s dirt cheap to get to orbit despite a hefty 80k cost per satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I had that designed, I could complete a given satellite contract with ease and then move it into a convenient polar orbit for mapping once that was done.
