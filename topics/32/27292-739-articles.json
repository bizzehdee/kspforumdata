Yes, I too wish to experience dancing between gravity assists in the Jool system. So I finagled together 5.3 tons of seriously overdesigned hardware.

Pointing the other way we have three ion thrusters, our antenna for sending back lovely pictures to KSC, a full array of orbital rated science plus an atmospheric package to get a taste of Jool itself. You might notice the airbrakes. It\u0027s my first time incorporating them into a design - I figured they\u0027d give me more control in Jool\u0027s atmosphere and may lend me some forgiveness during aerocapture and aerobraking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tested its reentry capabilities by sticking it in a highly eccentric orbit just shy of escape velocity, waited for Apoapsis, and brought my Periapsis down to like 12km. By the time I hit atmo I was going almost 3.5km/s. And it didn\u0027t die! And when I had the airbrakes out it decelerated at a whopping 5-10 g\u0027s. This kind of drag control leads me to believe it might be wise to come in a little more shallow in Jool\u0027s atmosphere than I think I\u0027d need, because I can always ramp up the drag as long as I\u0027m still going to escape atmo on the other side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4,200 dV, 0.14 TWR for this baby. Now obviously ion engines are pretty power hungry as far as the base game goes. Around Kerbin the gigantors can handle the power demands, but that performance is going to go down a lot out by Jool - which is why I have three. Got a fair sized battery, and one RTG to make sure the probe doesn\u0027t die completely. But as insurance against those moments on the dark side of a planet where you HAVE to make a burn, we have a power cell and enough liquid fuel/oxidizer to run these ion engines for about 40 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also designed, and have yet to test, an intermediate stage to give this prize project a 2,500 dV boost from LKO to Jool with four LV-N\u0027s and a sufficiently respectable TWR so I don\u0027t have to make multiple passes around Kerbin to reach escape velocity. The whole package massed about 32 tons, which fits beautifully within the capabilities of my current standard Launch-to-Suborbital launch vehicle (which routinely launches 39 ton orange-tank ferries) and is a completely recoverable launch stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel like I\u0027m getting the hang of this game.

The four tourists were transferred to the now-obsolete two-man minishuttles, and our actual employee took the science from the lander can and transferred it to the Triangle prototype that had come up when I was first developing that spaceplane. I also shuffled fuel around, draining excess from the minishuttles and refilling SixFerry\u0027s tanks from the stations main reserve. The tourists already aboard moved into SixFerry, along with Bill. I might see if I get two more Minmus tourists in a contract that comes up soon, so I can send SixFerry off full, instead of with only four passengers. Anyway, I began to fly back the minishuttles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/5MYKFf.png\u0022 alt=\u00225MYKFf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/3wkRWj.png\u0022 alt=\u00223wkRWj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo rather simple glides later, and the four tourists were home. The reason that the minishuttles are now obsolete is of course the fact that I now have a reliable spaceplane to get to and from Stopover - so I don\u0027t need to keep other ways of getting down around. The shuttles were a good solution for the tech level, but their use is now too expensive to justify (compared to a spaceplane flight), and their part count means it\u0027s better for my system to get them off the station rather than those simpler drop-pods that are still attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/6i8NoT.png\u0022 alt=\u00226i8NoT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/m6WfvE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022m6WfvE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/qB9TlP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qB9TlP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime, I also took on an orbital rescue contract. I sent up the Triangle to rendezvous, and it just so happened that the capsule in which the engineer was stranded was in fact a Mobile Lab. Now that I have Actuators (and thus the Claw), that saves me the trouble of putting one up. There\u0027s also one over in a retrograde orbit about the Mun, so in a future mission, I can drag that to a suitable location. Perhaps to Minmus, and there make it the core of a station. As for the rescuee, their landing was fine, if a little close to the end of the runway. I didn\u0027t have wheels on the ground until I was less than a kilometer from the end, so that would be why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/h0TfBo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022h0TfBo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I made an adjustment to the course of a satellite probe that is heading off to fulfill a contract in Minmus orbit, and perhaps afterwards some temperature measuring at Minmus. Additionally, I noticed one of my new contracts is an interplanetary tourism contract. But, I\u0027d rather finish a thing or two in the local system (at least set up an orbital lab to process data) before I go to Duna and Ike... but I suppose I already have plenty of funds, so I can just accept it and make it a reasonably long-term goal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-11T22:20:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJeb, Bob and Bill boarded the \u0022Glory of Kerbin\u0022, fueled the vessel up to 90%, made a testflight to 5000 km Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill decided to take a look for the engine department after a 350 second fullthrottle burn of 12 \u0022Nerva\u0060s\u0022...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really don\u0060t think he\u0060s having further familyplans...\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/37c8M5M.png\u0022 alt=\u002237c8M5M.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen he came back he just mentioned: \u0022Well, looks like we have to throttle down for the very long burns, we will see...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah: \u0022What?
