Interestingly, as I kept climbing higher, my orbit kept expanding as if I were traveling at that speed. Yet my ship wasn\u0027t traveling at that speed... It seems the game calculated the mach effects and the orbit based on this \u00221911.9 m/s\u0022 figure while the actual flight continued as it should. (well actually, the flight didn\u0027t continue \u0022normally\u0022, my camera was horribly offset and the ship jiittered up and down a lot but it was semi normal).
