It doesn\u0027t need to be much if the decaled polygons are only ever viewed from close up. The deeper into the scene they can be seen, the bigger the offset has to be as the Z buffer looses precision towards the far plane. The loss of precision isn\u0027t noticeable with simple texturing, but z fighting causes pixels to blink with even tiny movement so it can be disturbing even at a great distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@sal_vager I haven\u0027t had an opportunity to start the game since your post, but you do seem to imply something...
