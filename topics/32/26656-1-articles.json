The bottom is left behind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you pick them they are the right way up, however if you put them on sides of crafts or even below for dropping landers or probes and the bottom of the triangle is toward the probe they will follow the probe, if they are atatched to an engine this will not work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas messed up with this two times. first was an mission to Eve and Gilly, nuclear powered trasfer stage with mapping and four probes. Released one probe for Eve landing, decopler the wrong way so engine did not work, well I used my transfeer stage to get an landing intercept on Eve released probe 2 and went back in orbit, probe landed successfully. Off to Gilly with the last probe who was mounted on top so decopler should work. transfer stage went out of fuel so I put it on impact corse with Gilly, released last probe, [ to switch to probe, then pressing space and separate probe and parachute from engine, as probe could also be used on Eve. All three parts impacted Gilly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater I send an 6 transfer stage with 6 probes to the Jool system, all seperators was the wrong way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T12:21:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TaVXBHW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TaVXBHW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least it wasn\u0027t much of a problem here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
