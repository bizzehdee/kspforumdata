Woo!\n\n*Iamsodarncool* \n\nMax has tweeted extensively in the past about how consoles are bad and why the PC is such a great platform for something like KSP. I expect Sony is paying them to do this.\n\n*Maxmaps* \n\nThey aren\u0027t! I\u0027ve tweeted about bad practices in console gaming but we would never jump into something like this if we didn\u0027t believe in the platform. Sony have cleared any doubts or worries we may have had about it, and have treated us well. Plus, it works really, really well on the DualShock 4.\n\n*brunothemad* \n\nThis has potential to greatly expand the audience, which I think is awesome. But 1.0.3?!\n\n*Maxmaps* \n\nWe\u0027re thrilled to grow the KSP family, of course. And 1.0.3\u0027s doing pretty well so far.
