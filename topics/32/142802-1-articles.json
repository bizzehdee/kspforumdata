In my 0.90 career save, I had not one mod, and I successfully did things such as landing on Ike, landing on Duna, several dockings including\u00A0docking a 4-port-at-once connection to add the solar panels I forgot to add to previously add to a space station ready to be sent to Laythe (I hadn\u0027t unlocked the Senior ports yet, so I decided to go for a multi-port connection, which I happened to need to use),\u00A0sending a space station to Laythe orbit and bringing back the Interplanetary Transfer Ship that brought it there to Kerbin, building a 5 ton 3-stage-to-orbit rover-jetpack, using the same ship that just got back from Laythe to bring that rover-jetpack to Dres (after said ship was refueled), landing on Dres twice with said jetpack before ditching the empty jetpack and bringing its kerbals home with said Interplanetary Transfer Ship, capturing an asteroid (accidentally into a retrograde Kerbin orbit), switching the direction of said asteroid\u0027s orbit to prograde with a second craft I brought to its retrograde orbit and lowering its apoapsis through aerobraking, docking a beautiful space station that wrapped around the asteroid in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, and\u00A0sending two probes to Jool, one of which ran out of fuel and was ejected by Tylo into an extremely eccentric solar orbit diving close to the sun, while the other I added extra fuel that allowed it to land on Bop on an extreme slope,\u00A0using the .625 meter engine attached to a 1.25 meter fuel tank on the extra fuel tank I had added\u00A0for it to not fall over (but Bop\u00A0was too serene and beautiful at the time for me to take it off from). I also landed a spaceplane on Laythe, which didn\u0027t have enough fuel because I hadn\u0027t unlocked turbojets (it used basic ones) and because and\u00A0it was untested on Kerbin except in agility tests\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWas that horrendous run-on-sentence and that extra tidbit enough to show that KSP on consoles should be fine without a delta\u00A0vee readout? \u00A0(sorry, that sentence did come out a bit rude, I apologize for it)\u00A0Some people have become too reliant on delta vee mods, but newer players on consoles may find their ways to do without it just by playing sans the option of using one. That is of course only until a delta vee readout is added in stock (if it ever is), but until then, many a player shall be fine without it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DD_bwest","CreatedById":164906,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-30T22:10:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni just finished doing everything you can do without using any mods as a way to get ready for it. \u00A0its all duable, but some things are frustrating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni suspect we will get a large group of new comers screaming for a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E readout\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-30T23:05:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you can plug numbers into a calculator (or use a sliderule, I\u0027m not picky), you can usually find out how much delta-v you have. \u00A0I like side-dropped kickbacks, which make the calculations difficult, but could probably come up with a descent approximation. \u00A0I would much rather know the delta-v as I quickly built a rocket like the way KE tells me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect most players will want mods. \u00A0They will hear about delta-v and wonder why they are allowed to know how much delta-v a burn takes (and how much is left) but not how much is left in the rocket. \u00A0The will see a youtube with scatterer(?) and chatterer and wonder why vanilla KSP is less exciting. \u00A0They will want that *one* (or more)\u00A0part that is missing. \u00A0But really, I suspect that the worst of these is the delta-v.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is a common refrain for consoles. \u00A0I can\u0027t begin to recommend one of my favorite games of all time (Elder Scrolls V: Oblivion) because it is so incredibly broken out of the box and *needs* mods to fix it (there are also tons of mods to improve it, but the character advancement is *broken*. \u00A0There are also plenty of bugs fixed by the community). \u00A0I suppose Squad merely has to look at Minecraft. \u00A0If that (extremely mod heavy) game can live without mods, presumably so can KSP. \u00A0I just can\u0027t recommend playing it there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-30T23:15:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wonder if my kids would play it more if it was on their XB1.
