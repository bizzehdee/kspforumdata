But when you want to burst in any other direction, you realize how hard it is to get a sense of directions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless I missed something obvious, I think that the orientation system could be easily improved. Here are some suggestions, in case one of the game designer read this thread:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A way to switch between orgital map and ship view without changing camera direction\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A way to display ship direction vector in orbital map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A \u0027space\u0027 navigation ball. In my opinion, the current navigation ball is great when the ship is taking off, landing or (arguably) is in low orbit. But when your are far away from any planet, it does make very little sense. The meaning or the horizon, or the \u0027north\u0027 when you are half way between kerbin and mun is confusing, to say the least. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis \u0027space navigation ball\u0027 would display directions of fixed axis in space, relatively to the sun: the direction of the axis perpandicular to the orbit of Kerbin around its star, and two other fixed directions perpandicaular to that one (in the plan of the orbit of Kerbin), that could be immediately identifiable both on the navigation ball and the orbital map (axis would be displayed). This space navigation ball could also display the position of the closest planet and possibly the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course I am not suggesting to remove the planetary navigation ball. It should be possible to switch between them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this is clear enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would be happy to have your comments.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ted","CreatedById":26298,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-18T13:49:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you\\\u0027re in space you can use the prograde(yellow circle) and retrograde(greenish circle with a cross) to help you with navigation, prograde will increase your apoapsis, while retrograde will lower it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I get into space and out of Low Kerbin Orbit, I tend to ignore everything on the navball but those two symbols.
