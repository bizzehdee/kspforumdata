I forgot to add a solar panel to the lander, so it couldn\u0027t last long on its own. The ascent stage was also improperly assembled, so the engines received no fuel from the tank.

For some reason docking in orbit had reversed all of my control surfaces and Infernal Robotics areas of activity (meaning I could not retract the docking arm back into my docking bay), but not my gyroscopes or SAS! Worse, it had also somehow managed to open one of my airbrakes, so every time I pressed the action group, one would open and the other would close. The end result was a horrific spin that only got worse when I tried to use SAS and which didn\u0027t respond to my controls they way I expected at all. To top it off, none of these problems were obvious in space aside from the docking arm, because everything that was wrong had to do with aerodynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the time I figured out everything that was wrong, I was 5km above the ground. By the time I actually managed to click on and close the errant air-brake, I was 2km up.

Having no idea about transfer windows back then, it was a very very close, lucky and insanely inefficient encounter (burned through ~150tons of fuel) -\u0026gt; the monster came in very fast and the poor crew had to endure some rough g-forces. What can\u0027t be seen on the pic is that it started spinning on reentry, I could only stabilize it by opening the chutes very early. I still wonder why it didn\u0027t break apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NFfRk3b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NFfRk3b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother pic from leaving Kerbin orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SCoWQ4r.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SCoWQ4r.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-18T13:09:09Z\u0022 title=\u002208/18/2014 01:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by LordFjord\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SiliconPyro","CreatedById":19734,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-18T13:16:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had several moments where I was amazed my Kerbal survived, but this is the one I managed to record:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/dbLrwT70J90?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cirocco","CreatedById":100285,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-18T13:29:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUp to this day, my completely stock runway-Duna surface-runway SSTDuna takes the prize for me.

Add to that that the plane was INCREDIBLY tail-heavy at this point because of all the empty fuel tanks and heavy (nuclear) engines in the back, and you can imagine that the last few minutes of this trip were the most nerve-wracking of my entire KSP career.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen that plane made a full stop on the runway I felt like I had just won the olympics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efull story and mission report is here (shameless self-plug):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83711-To-Duna-and-back!-in-a-spaceplane!-without-refuel!?p=1224245#post1224245\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83711-To-Duna-and-back!-in-a-spaceplane!-without-refuel!?p=1224245#post1224245\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-18T13:34:41Z\u0022 title=\u002208/18/2014 01:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Cirocco\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vicomt","CreatedById":93574,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-18T18:44:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor JDCollie (and anyone else interested), here\u0027s my Badass (lol) SSTO\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/MR7h1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
