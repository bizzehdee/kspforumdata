Ejected the Flying Ant Safety Glider from the rest of the plane when I had a problem (unrecoverable spin caused by engine flameout, fuel tank separated from decoupler and removed half of the left hand wing) and proceeded to burn the engines to descend with a great rate of speed. Pulled out of the screaming dive at roughly 460m/s and carried myself a long way back toward KSC. As I\u0027m hurtling toward the KSC and I\u0027ve run out of fuel, my safety glider showed its true colors, proceeding to infiniglide at roughly 2000m at a speed of 60m/s. From flight trials, I knew about the infinigliding quirk, and had a plan in mind to land safely: I designed it to eject its wings and parachute in, much like a rocket does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI leveled myself toward the runway, the control tower on my right, craft placed strategically at the four corners of the runway so I knew where to aim. At 2km the loading lag hit as I reached physics range, my Flying Ant screaming for the runway at 60 meters per second, still holding 2km altitude and travelling smoothly. Timing it just right, I deployed debris chutes, then decoupled the wings so they would fall back to Kerbin instead of hanging around and crashing my next flight. I hit space again to deploy my primary chutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThunk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA moment passed. Brief panic, though mild. Maybe it didn\u0027t register.

My transfer stage had a big supply of monopropellant and a giant set of lovely solar wings. It also had a set of four large drop tanks mounted on radial separators so I could carry more propellant yet dump excess mass along the way. Towards the end of my burn, I realized the drop tanks were empty and hit the key I\u0027d set to jettison them with - while I was still under acceleration. So of course they didn\u0027t just shoot away radially as expected - they went away and back relative to the stack, taking out both of my solar panels on the transfer stage.
