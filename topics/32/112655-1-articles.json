I would call it: Squad sitting back and playing their game and making 3d animated movie clips and twitch videos of themselves playing KSP while the community of modders is hard at work making features for their game which they will implement in a future release if people like it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell of course re-entry heat and working aerodynamics are very weird and unique features to implement in a game about space flight... Until there\u0027s code that shows they copied stuff this line of thought is completely ridiculous. AFAIK the implementation of aero in 1.0 differs a lot from the way FAR used to handle it with pre 1.0 stock...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Random Hooded Stranger","CreatedById":139766,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T14:52:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d be willing to bet that even if Squad did or want to steal a mod, they\u0027re perfectly in their right to do so.
