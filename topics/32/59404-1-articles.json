KSP doesn\u0027t run with ATI\u0027s OSS drivers of my laptop graphics (Mobility Radeon HD 4250). So, here we go to install the proprietary driver. Not compatible, but a legacy driver is avaliable. Okay, let\u0027s try that! Oh...You have to have an earlier kernel version, because the legacy drivers are not compatible with the current kernel. Then you come here and suggest that KSP should be compatible with OSS drivers.
