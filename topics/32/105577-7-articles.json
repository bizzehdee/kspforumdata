In true color, as aforementioned, the visual emission spectrum for most metals is black (cool - relatively), red, orange, yellow, yellow-white, then white (some show blue before or after white), by which point most metals are soft enough to melt or break apart like warm cookies. The color order some have mentioned (the \u0027shower-head\u0027 model) is an artificial false-color model based on the most common instinctive associations between colors and temperatures. If there were simply an option to pick between the two schemes (\u0027false-color\u0027 and \u0027true-color\u0027), I think that that would solve the issue.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Is it me, or does this seem off. \n\u003E pulled from config file. \n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E  // heatConductivity = 0.06 // half default\n\u003E \n\u003E  emissiveConstant = 0.8 // engine nozzles are good at radiating.\n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E is the heatConductivity suppose to be commented out. Has anyone removed the first set of // and tested the engine?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Only the whole thing is, NERVA\u0027s **never** used radiator when the engine was running!\n\u003E The fuel, liquid H2, was the engines coolant and the reactor ran at a steady GW output, where the fuel initially cools the reactor before it\u0027s becoming hot enough to become the propellant.\n\u003E \n\u003E So a higher GW reactor needed a greater fuel flow.\n\u003E \n\u003E Needing radiators in order to run a NERVA, like we now presumably need to, is rather ridiculous. **In my opinion.**\n\u003E \n\u003E But if we are going to talk about Bimodal systems, where the reactor runs in power generation mode (10% of GW outpout), then I\u0027m good with needing radiators. As a Brayton\\* generator can not convert all heat to ec anyway.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E As far as NTRs are concerned, I think the heating is a fair balancing point (although, again, a dedicated radiator part would be welcome). The reasons being that LiquidFuel is essentially cryogenic kerosene (by density and other engine stats, IIRC) with the thermal properties of Aerozine 50 (the thermal info according to NathanKell). It\u0027s a super-fuel, nothing near cryogenic hydrogen in terms of storage and handling. Realistically, an NTR running kerosene would probably have a terrible isp. Also, while NTRs may actually be quite cool engines (they appear to be about mid-range in terms of chamber temperature) KSP glosses over the storage of cryo fuels, which require some sort of cooling mechanism in order to avoid boil-off.\n\u003E I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m saying this, but I feel the NTR heating is a balanced and interesting gameplay mechanic because KSP is not realistic. If this were Realism Overhaul the way the engine works now would be inexcusable.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E A Nerva\u0027s shadow shield is built into the engine, right on top of the reactor core where the smallest size shield can be the most effective. I assume the KSP nuclear engine has a particularly massive shadow shield because the engine has a rather high mass.\n\u003E If Squad wants to screw over the nuclear engine, they have plenty of realistic ways to do it. ...\n\u003E \n\u003E They certainly didn\u0027t have to implement a faulty heat model that indicates and propagates misunderstanding of this particular rocket technology.\n\nAlso, while I totally agree with Brotoro and Regex about the whole balance/realism issue, that sounds like a separate thread topic. No one (Squad!) has to explain fission thermodynamics to model it accurately (or even approximately); yet knowing what design type the Nerv is would help clear up some things in the area of expected behaviors.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAaaanndd... one more thing.
