Geostationary orbit is a special case of geosynchronous orbit; one in which the inclination allows the satellite to orbit while maintaining position over a certain geographical area. Geosynchronous orbit is simply any orbit with a period equal to the rotation period of the planet (accounting for orbit around the sun of course). Thus, geosynchronous orbits can happen at any inclination... they are just considered less often because they aren\u0027t usually as useful for line-of-site properties."},{"CreatedByName":"bitbucket","CreatedById":6676,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T10:02:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I got offered this contract today:\n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/plH3j1b.png](http://i.imgur.com/plH3j1b.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E How can one have a keosynchronous orbit with an inclination of 159.4\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0?
