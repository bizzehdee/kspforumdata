I don\u0027t currently have enough science to send off manned missions that have a hope of returning from anything but the moons, and even then it might get iffy, however.... current tech levels are enough for me to send a bunch of satellites out to get some science from these worlds transmitted back, and their moons. So I spent an hour or so getting multiple missions up into orbit, and getting the final one launched. Now my current first stage lifter has a MINOR problem, the central engine likes to overheat to the point of exploding. Not a problem, so long as I keep track of it. However I\u0027m in a bit of a rush in RL, so I send this thing up into the first window I have for kerbin orbit (currently have 5 probe missions all in equalatoral orbit, 99.9% perfect of better on their orbits, 2 missions actually have a 1-1.5km variance in their orbital distance, but were on the opposite ends of the planet initially. Like I said, I launched into the first available launch window, everything is going fine and I go to full power so I can finish circulizing my orbit. Check the map real quick and see that one or two of the probes are about to get in the way of this new one, however if I keep the engines running, no problem. Unfortunately in this excitement, I forgot something...specifically the engine running at 100%.......BOOOM!!!! and there goes the main engine on the booster for probe #6. Crap switch out of map view quick eject the fuel tank and start the next engine burning....and probe 6 is out of the path of probe 3......unfortunately the fuel tank I just ejected wasn\u0027t. Probe 3 has just lost three of it\u0027s solar panels, and half of it\u0027s engines/tanks all of which are now flying free into a slightly ascending orbit. Now remember the two probes that I had orbiting within 1-1.5km orbital distance....well the lower one was Probe 3....and look one piece of Probe 3 has just ascended into the orbit of Probe 2.......CRAP. So yeah, instead of having 6 probe missions in stable equalatoral orbits, I now have 3, and about 4 dozen pieces in unstable orbits.....so, I see that I can actually still revert this flight and avoid all this crap. So I decide to do a quicksave so that I can go ahead and reload this later on this week when I really have time to play with this orbital mess, and revert my flight. Now the quicksave is renamed and I will try to relaunch probe #6 another day...Yeah, I did get into space today, but did not get my intended missions out of orbit today. And actually looking forward to this weekend where I can play around with my mini-kessler syndrome currently covering 90-140km orbits roughly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Though that is an idea for a challenge. Send a bunch of LARGE vessels that aside from the boosters are just large masses of parts and varied strength decouplers. Send up say 5-10 of these things into equalatoral orbits and then set off the decouplers, some with the ship oriented towards the poles, some with the ship oriented along the equator, and some vertically. Anyone else think that would be a nice multipart challenge. Challenge 1, Get ships safely into orbit. Challenge 2 Get a mission to the Mun and Minimus (can be separate missions). Challenge 3 Set up a space station in a survivable orbit. Challenge 4 use tugs from the station to clean up/dispose of the debris (you must either bring it back to the station or deorbit it to \u0027vaporize\u0027 the debris from mission control, and the tugs, unless crippled beyond repair/capabality to return to station, can not be deorbited to clear the debris) to a point where you have safe windows in equalatoral orbit again (or manage to clean up at least a third of the debris) Final challenge would be to remove ALL of the debris from your orbits (both from the \u0027accident\u0027 and from your launches) Anyone else think that might be a fun challenge?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Soda Popinski","CreatedById":92416,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-10T13:23:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI set out to land on the Joolian muns for the first time a while ago.
