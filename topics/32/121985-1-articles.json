It makes me quite wealthy quite fast, but it doesn\u0027t get me anywhere new and interesting or do much to beef up my science income (which is down on 20%).

If I remember correctly, my last couple career saves (both pre and post-1.0) have been hard mode (except with loads/reverts in case of bugs.) However, the funds/science restrictions make the game a tad grindy for my tastes. I\u0027m pretty confident by now that I can save orbiting kerbals and take tourists around the Mun, and repeating those missions over and over just to get the funds/science for more interesting missions kind of kills my attention span. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EBootstrap missions more aggressively/stop worrying about gleaning science.\u003C/strong\u003E KSP isn\u0027t too hard if you play conservatively. If you do a bunch of LKO missions, then do a healthy number of Mun-Minmus missions, (especially science missions), send up a science lab, run some Scansat maps, and you can have the whole tech tree unlocked by the time the fist Duna and Eve windows open up. However, I\u0027ve run....not a small number of those types of missions since I started playing KSP a few years ago. It might not kill me to just let the KSC take it easy for a few months, then launch a tech-constricted chemical-rockets only Dres mission or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003ERe-think my space stations\u003C/strong\u003E. Ever since last year, I have kind of default class of space stations that I build in a 150km orbit for refueling and the like. They\u0027ve a got a pretty healthy fuel storage capacity, (including fuels for whatever mods I have installed at the time,) lots of LS storage, living space, a big docking facility - They\u0027re a good family of stations. The problem, of course, is that I generally have to launch them in about 9 or so pieces, plus refueling missions. It takes essentially an entire IRL weekend to build/fill, and by the time I finish, I\u0027m usually a bit bored and I tend to lose interest in career mode soon afterwards. I need to figure out a way to either get the same functionality into orbit in a lot fewer launches, or possibly even bypass the permanent facility all together for interplanetary missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: I\u0027ve been playing KSP for a long time and my attention span has decreased, so I\u0027d like to avoid spending weeks running repetitive LKO launches.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xendelaar","CreatedById":139535,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-02T06:16:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just love the science grind!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my next career run, I will perhaps use a mod that enlarges the tech tree.i will put all the sliders on 10% and will start with 0 cash. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking of only visiting moons and planets beyond minmus so i m forced to visit more exotic planets for science points.
