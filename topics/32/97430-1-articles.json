This can be achieved by focusing another window while running. I personally have window focus follow my mouse cursor, so it is simply enough to move the cursor out of the KSP window. I\u0027m not sure, but it sounds reasonable to me, that also switching the active window using the task bar might work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-22T09:59:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELol.
