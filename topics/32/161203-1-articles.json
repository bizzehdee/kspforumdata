I use extra-planetary launchpads and a plethora of other mods. At what point do you think I should allow myself to spawn in a kerbal konstructs\u00A0launch site? I was origionally thinking after I surpass 200 on-world residents. But I figure I need more requirements as that seems a little too easy. I need more input. Like, maybe how many drilling facilities should be required? Or how many trucks/transport vehicles should I have?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-28T10:01:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt really is up to you. It really does not matter, but i would recommend enough drilling rigs to produce at least 1 big tank of ore in a reasonable amount of time, with like about 3 transport trucks. With one for parts building resources, one for crew, and another for ore and mining resources.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"suicidejunkie","CreatedById":155878,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-30T16:24:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you considered building a working replica space center, taking a bunch of screenshots and/or drive-through videos, and then reconsider upgrading it to a boring but better frame-rate launch site?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
