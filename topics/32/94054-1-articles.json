But there are some things to consider--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* What engines did you put on it? Usually the toroidal aerospikes are a great choice here, since they don\u0027t lose much efficiency in thick atmosphere, and have pretty good thrust. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Sometimes building wider is better than taller here (particularly if you\u0027re not using NEAR/FAR, but rather the stock aerodynamics). It looks like your stacks are pretty tall, so the TWR probably isn\u0027t fantastic, but that\u0027s OK in the earlier part of the flight since the atmosphere is so thick. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* If you use an ejectable engine/tank for the de-orbit burn, and parachutes for the landing, you can land with all of your tanks full. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* It looks like you have an asparagus setup (as far as I can see). That\u0027s very good here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* If you build both the parachutes and landing legs onto girders and other parts that are on radial decouplers, you can use all of that for landing, and discard it at lift-off. So the added weight of all of those parts are essentially \u0022free\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* When launching, the flight profile here should be a little different than on Kerbin (with stock aero, anyway). You\u0027ll want to go straight up for much longer, and not start the gravity turn until 30-35k altitude. Even then, pitch over gradually. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Landing at 3400\u002B altitude is pretty decent. It gets a lot harder below 2km.
