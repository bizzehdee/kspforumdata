I\u0027ve always liked to look at the various body rises and sets, and seeing the Mun rise and set was no different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, as I watched the Mun go across the sky, I noticed something rather strange, even when I wasn\u0027t zoomed in. You see, I can quite easily make out the Mun moving in the sky, bit by bit (which relatively speaking is probably closer to km by km). This of course didn\u0027t phase me at first as I just figured I was at some low time warp. But alas, I was playing in real time, and the Mun was still moving across the sky at such a speed that the movement was quite visible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would imagine this is simply a matter of how the simulation works in tandem with the lower scale of the Kerbalverse. However, it still seems strange. Is the orbital velocity of the Mun properly scaled down from a realistic one? IIRC, the Kerbin/Mun system is supposed to be more or less a scaled down version of the Earth and the Moon. If so, then shouldn\u0027t the Mun be moving much, much slower across the sky?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T22:00:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you ever looked at the moon (real one, not KSP \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E ) through a telescope?
