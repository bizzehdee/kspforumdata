Yes, the NASA pack can be classified as DLC but only if you take it in the most literal interpretation you give to it. Squad got the opportunity to work with NASA to develop new content for the game and educate people about spaceflight, I honestly don\u0027t see what\u0027s bad about that. Sure, you could argue that the NASA pack takes away development time from the rest of the game but honestly can you really say that that hurts the game? With the pack you\u0027ll get asteroids, new parts, new game mechanics.. it\u0027s just like a regular update to the game apart from the fact that it has to be downloaded and installed separately, I suspect because NASA is a government organization and can\u0027t give this level of support to a paid commercial product (hence release it as a mod, which is -technically- free). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also doesn\u0027t mean that the devs aren\u0027t finishing the game - they\u0027re still working on it, the NASA pack is a bonus in my opinion.
