So if your identity is having...an identity crisis...it can get pretty confusing for the viewer to know who the logo is for and what they do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think your flag is having a small identity crisis. I understand that you\u0027re using the lower Zeta as the main symbolism, but you need to generalize it a bit. The NASA logo is appealing to most everyone and not just the science nerds because it\u0027s been simplified and generalized. This is not only good for business (increased audience is always good for business), but it also means that the consumer doesn\u0027t have to decipher the logo and can just look at it and say, \u0022Hey, AlligatorINC sells aligators, because their logo is an alligator dressed like a used car salesman.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe include the word, \u0022Zeta,\u0022 or use the uppercase \u0022Z\u0022 instead (or even use the lowercase \u0022Z\u0022 and put \u0022eta\u0022 behind it). Because (even though you and I know it\u0027s a \u0022Z\u0022) it looks like an \u0022S,\u0022 and remember that logos are 90% looks, 10% functionality. If it looks like an \u0022S\u0022 and it feels like an \u0022S,\u0022 then it\u0027s an \u0022S.\u0022 Regardless of whether or not its actually a \u0022Z.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to that change, you need to incorporate something \u0022Zeta-y\u0022 to tie in the importance of your name to what you do. You\u0027ve got a fairly large empty blue area to work with, so maybe include a mathematical instrument like a compass (not the kind that tells you where north is), or maybe something \u0022space-y\u0022 since this is, after all, a space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027ve got to get back to work since my lunch is just about over.
