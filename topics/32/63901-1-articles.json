The density thing is another explanation, not the one he\u0027s asking about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think a higher G would make sense, to answer the OP. Certainly more sense than the planets being made of some fundamentally different kind of matter than the kerbals and their ships. If Kerbin has Earth\u0027s density, then G is 10.6 times higher (from solving 1g = G * 4/3 * pi * Kerbin Radius) than it is in real life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to this slideshow: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.thphys.may.ie/staff/mshadmehri/AstroNotes/MINIMUM.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.thphys.may.ie/staff/mshadmehri/AstroNotes/MINIMUM.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe minimum mass for a star to ignite fusion should go as G^(-1.5). The real world minimum star mass is about 0.08 solar masses. If we scale with our new G and compare with the mass of Kerbol (for which we must divide the wiki value by 10.6 to account for the different G), then Kerbol has about 3% the minimum solar mass in the kerbal universe. It should therefore be a brown dwarf still, maybe just a plain old gas giant. I think that means that (if we are going to persist in trying to figure out the physics of a game designed by devs that don\u0027t care about physical consistency) for Kerbol to be a star, G cannot be the only physical constant that we adjust. We could also adjust the Boltzmann constant, or perhaps the charge of a proton.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-21T19:45:12Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2014 07:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Horn Brain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ecorrected numerical error that did not affect the conclusions\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-21T23:22:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve always figured Kerbol is a brown dwarf.

OK, let\u0027s get right to tonight\u0027s topic. Is there any truth to the rumor that Magratheans did the design and construction work for Squad on the Kerbol planetary system?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: I\u0027ve already told you, we don\u0027t discuss our clients.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Well then, hypothetically speaking, could you tell us if it\u0027s possible to design a solar system with these specifications?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(BROTORO hands Slartibartfast a sheet of paper. Slartibartfast glances over it briefly.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: Ah, yes... Miniature planets are adorable, aren\u0027t they? They were all the rage with a certain portion of our clientele.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: So it\u0027s possible to construct a solar system matching those specifications?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: Certainly. We Magratheans pride ourselves on being able to build any kind of planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: But look at the densities of those planets. Most of them have densities greater than any known element.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: That\u0027s not a problem. We use black holes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Black holes? But wouldn\u0027t a black hole inside a planet just swallow it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: No, no. We use spherical force field bubbles centered around small black holes. We can adjust the mass of the black hole and radius of the force shell to get any planet density desired, then cover it with the mantle and crust material of the client\u0027s choice. It\u0027s a very flexible system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: So you\u0027re saying that Kerbin is mostly hollow inside, with some old rocky material thrown on top?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: No. More like the inner one third is hollow. And I assure you we use only the finest ingredients when building our planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Wouldn\u0027t these force field bubbles require energy to maintain their structure?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: Certainly they require energy. We just allow a small amount of matter from the lower mantle to trickle through openings in the sphere. As the matter falls into the gravity well of the black hole, the energy equivalent to a sizable fraction of its rest mass is released as radiation before it crosses the event horizon. That radiated energy is captured and used by the force field bubble, which also acts as a Dyson sphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Dyson sphere? So do Magratheans know about Freeman Dyson?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: Who? You misunderstood me. I used the Magrathean term for \u0022spherical mega-structure that captures all radiated energy from a central power source,\u0022 and that little fish I put in your ear translated the concept into a term you are familiar with. I\u0027ve never heard of a freemandyson.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Ah, so that\u0027s what the fish was for. I thought it was a quaint Magrathean greeting or something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: You\u0027re sitting there wearing a digital watch, and you think my people are quaint?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: But wait... If Kerbin has no liquid iron core inside, how could it have a magnetic field?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: Does Kerbin have a magnetic field?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Um... well, I\u0027m not sure. The developers haven\u0027t given us any magnetometers yet, but I just assumed it did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: And it well might. Magnetic fields are easy. We would just need to orbit a ring of charged matter around the black hole inside the force sphere. Adjusting the charge on the matter can give the client any magnetic field desired, and the inclination of the ring can offset the magnetic pole from the rotational axis if desired. Any field strength can be tailored for the client, although it\u0027s easier for us if they want a simple dipole. Haven\u0027t you wondered why Jool has such a weak magnetic field for a jovian planet?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: It does?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: Of course. If it didn\u0027t, the planet would have powerful radiation belts, and any kerbal you sent in there for aerobraking would be late.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Late?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: Yes. As in, \u0022The late Jebediah Kerman.\u0022 Ah hum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: . . .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: I don\u0027t understand why Earthmen always stare at me blankly when I use that line.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: I\u0027m just wondering how you know about Jebediah Kerman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: It\u0027s the Babelfish again. I just used the Magrathean word for \u0022bad-ass space pilot,\u0022 and the fish did the rest in conjunction with your primitive brain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Well. What about Kerbol, the sun of the system? How could something with that low of a mass possibly support thermonuclear fusion?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: I\u0027m not part of our stellar division... I work on the planets, and I specialize in doing coastlines... but there are two different ways we handle miniature stars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: One way involves black holes?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: Both ways do. In one method, we simply make the force sphere around the black hole small enough that the density and pressure in the overlying hydrogen-rich material is sufficient to maintain thermonuclear reactions at the rate needed for the desired luminosity. The second way involves simply letting sufficient matter flow through the force sphere and into the black hole to provide the desired luminosity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Which method did you use for Kerbol?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: I didn\u0027t say we made Kerbol. I was speaking hypothetically. Why don\u0027t you just measure the neutrino flux coming out of Kerbol... then you could tell if there are fusion reactions going on inside of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Well... again... we don\u0027t have any neutrino detectors as yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: You really do need to take more interest in your greater environment. If you\u0027re not paying attention to things outside your planet, terrible things could happen to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Yes, thank you. But what about Minmus?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: What about it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: The developers tell us that it\u0027s made of ice, but that can\u0027t possibly be the case given its distance from the sun, can it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: Kerbin, like your own planet Earth, is located at a distance from the sun where the equilibrium temperature is below the freezing point of water. If not for their natural greenhouse effects, the oceans on both bodies would be frozen over. The temperature is even lower when you are dealing with a surface that has a very high albedo, like ice, since that reflects away most of the incoming energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Yes, yes, I know all that. But Minmus has no atmosphere. Its surface is in vacuum. And water ice would sublime directly into a gas and escape into space at the equilibrium temperature of Minmus. Minmus should be a gigantic comet!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: Ah, I see. Young Hargledertfirst of our small moon department solved that problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Did he?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: She. She engineered a microorganism that was active in the small moon\u0027s water during its early warm phases. The organism excretes a clear polymer as a waste product...kind of like a resin. All of the ice on the small moon contains a small percentage of this polymer. When the ice is exposed to vacuum, the water will indeed sublime away, but the polymer is left behind and forms a barrier to further sublimation. And any future impacts or landing rocket flame scars on the surface are self-healing once the vapor clears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Really? And that\u0027s what you did for Minmus?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: I was speaking hypothetically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: And I suppose you\u0027ll tell me that Eve is purple because of a little food coloring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: Indeed. It takes a very small percentage of certain chemical compounds to give a planetary surface or atmosphere a desired color. You\u0027d be surprised how many clients are upset if they don\u0027t get just the right shade of purple or some other color in their skies. We are very good at this, and all the chemical stains and particulates are USDA approved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: You know about the USDA? Oh, wait...it\u0027s the Babelfish again, isn\u0027t it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: Indeed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: So... if you had to do it all over again, are their any changes you\u0027d make to the Kerbol system?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: Well, yes, now that you\u0027ve asked. I think Kerbin would look much better with more fjords on the coastlines. I always try to put a lot of fjords on a planet, but the managers always say it\u0027s too much. A lot of my work got erased. I was quite incensed about that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Hypothetically speaking, you mean.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: Um. Yes. Of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Well, our time is up. We really appreciate you coming here today. So long, and thanks for the fish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: No, I\u0027m afraid I must take the Babelfish back with me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Oh, please? I think it would be very useful *arrgh* Hey!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: Flerti slark tilligert sibilas fer torrn. Ser fasto gerhs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Yeah.
