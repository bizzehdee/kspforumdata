Minimalism isn\u0027t an excuse to be lazy;\u00A0it\u0027s a reason to be efficient, sure. But in a game like KSP, can you really feature creep with scientific modules so small and portable? Are you really that bad off trying to cover all the bases? Especially when one of the important parts of progressing in this game is scientific research. Honestly, so far, I haven\u0027t experienced much trouble with this beyond price tags.

But I\u0027ve also scrapped some ideas after it dawned on me that while I might be able to make certain things work, I could accomplish the same set of functions better with two different vessels. As you\u0027re perfectly aware of, a specialist vessel doesn\u0027t have to haul the extra mass of some extra parts. This is also a function of one\u0027s abilities. I know some players can build one ship that will accomplish things I\u0027d need three for. So my take on this is that you need need to evaluate your own goals and your own abilities and decide with your every build whether you\u0027re multiroling or feature creeping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-08-08T11:14:48Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2020 11:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by noname_hero\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-08T11:15:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA universal platform (orbital tug/rover base, several of them by size) providing propulsion, energy, navigation, communication \u002B specialized unified pack of tools per topic (geology, cartography, relay networking, etc), of more or less same mass and size corresponding to the universal platform.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA military craft as a base model for such tug (a tank, a rocket pack, etc), because its limits are less arbitrary.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen remove the turret/launcher and use the chassis as that universal platform.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-08T18:22:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it runs at more than .5 frames per second, I\u0027m happy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
