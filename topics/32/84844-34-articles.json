Complaining that the ksc was stupid cause it was invulnerable etc. Admittedly most of these comments were in jest but, rough implementation or no, still seems cool to me. Remember the original stated goal of this game was that it was supposed to be similar to buzz aldrins race to space. that game had a lot more administration stuff to it. Repairing and or adding to the space center would be very much like race to space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T18:59:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Franklin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Franklin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor sure.

If one worries about unknowns, then it will be a short and stressful life. and while its nice that the devs listen to a point. i also think that we take that as a license to throw fits when there is/isn\u0027t something we want. like i said its all irrelevant. the game is one of a kind. and with the amount of hours i put into it already, any feature is icing on the cake \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etry looking at it from another point of view... if you don\u0027t like it, don\u0027t use it. if your Danny level it... and if your indifferent that\u0027s cool too. lets not judge others based off their opinions, and allow people to have theirs as well. without feeling the need to defend our positions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T19:15:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E...waiting for 0.25 videos to start dropping...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...it\u0027s not happening...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
