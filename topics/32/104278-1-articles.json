And by rigorous calculation, I mean I employed the W.A.G. method.\n\nThe point being that in a perfect patched-conics simulation, you don\u0027t need a hundred billion KR-2Ls or something, just a lot of patience. In actual KSP, it would pretty much be impossible, as the k-drive/force imbalance effects are of greater magnitude than realistic ion thrust ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nBy the way, it should be possible to edit an asteroid to BE Gilly, the PotatoRoid entries actually have a \u0022mass =\u0022 floating-point parameter.. (obviously it wouldn\u0027t have any gravity, but it would be a movable object the mass of Gilly. Also you could joke about how Gilly doesn\u0027t have gravity either~)\n\nSince people are talking about fuel required, moving Gilly with xenon power @4200 specific impulse, you\u0027d need 6,171,363,808,102,380 kg of xenon for the maneuver I described (around 5% of Gilly\u0027s mass). Possibly even less, as you don\u0027t have to have all the xenon present at once if you\u0027re willing to resupply.

Millions and trillions of years is a long time. Note that it\u0027s actually thirty trillion years not three - there were so many threes in the number I got three-itized or something.\n\nAnyhow the overall point is that any non-zero thrust can eventually move something from one orbit to another, assuming you have enough time.. landing of course would be a different story~\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Can we get an E-class for scale into orbit around Gilly? ya\u0027know... for science?\n\nI was offered a contract to do that at one point.
