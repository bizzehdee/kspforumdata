If u wanna send satellites out, great... Muck about on kerbin with jets and wheeled vehicles. Also great, do what you find enjoyable. But currently, stock has no benefit for doing anything other then u having achieved it... Afterall. A lot of people that play games would do a lot less just because the game said \u0022this is your objectove\u0022... This game gives you the freedom to play how u like. U can make your own objectives. Or go on the challenge forum and complete some of them.... Or you could try starting your own pen and paper career mode until the official one is implemented.... Not to mention all the additional stuff mods give u, like already stated. Kethane is a good place to start... Some awesome looking space station and base parts out there too, and I saw someone working on a mod that will let you construct your own VABS on other planets and moons....
