Now, that\u0027s what happens in real life; astronauts aren\u0027t showered with extra fame and glory just from doing heroic deeds (their entire job is one massive heroic deed), and no one astronaut is prioritized for mission selection based on mission history.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, that\u0027s no fun! I propose a sort of experience system, where kerbals are ranked in a sort of military type manner (i.e. rank in front of their name such as Captain Jebediah, Major Thomples, Corporal Billy-Bobery, etc.). However, Squad has expressed reluctance in the past towards making the game militaristic, so the ranks could instead be something like Commander, Copilot, Rookie, and so on (in fact, almost like the ranking system on the forums \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) And like the ranking system on the forums, perhaps you could gain the ability to rename pilots\u0027 ranks to something more befitting their personality. For example: Crazy Badass Wonder Pilot Bob Kerman. Okay, maybe that isn\u0027t so accurate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere would be two ways to give kerbals those ranks. One would be that they accumulate experience points naturally over time, but weighted for the amount of time they spend doing different things. For example, a kerbal which manages to lift off of Dres, but is forced to ditch the ascent vehicle and head home, spending 100 days in his EVA suit and aerobrakes at Kerbin and rendezvous with a space station there, would level up a lot faster than a kerbal you left sitting around the R\u0026amp;D centre. The second way of levelling up a kerbal would be to assign a medal or something. If a kerbal did something especially heroic to save a mission (okay, I know its not actually the kerbal saving the mission but work with me here!) you could assign him a \u0022Medal of Honour\u0022 which might upgrade him a rank or two, differentiating this kerbal from the rest. (Like flags, you could attach messages detailing what exactly it was that this kerbal did; it might be that he remembered to pack extra snacks)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps even the Stupidity and Courage stats could be modified along with a kerbals rank; more experienced kerbals scream less. It couldn\u0027t be too much however, there still is entertainment value watching the little guys freak out. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Anyways, what I\u0027ve described here is more for the benefit of roleplay than anything else; it wouldn\u0027t impact gameplay much at all. As such, I have my doubts that it would be included in 0.24 (or even any 0.2x), but it is still something I\u0027d love to see in future versions. At the very least, add a dialogue in the Astronaut Centre which lets you know which missions a kerbal has been on, because right now, the kerbals are all so similar, and I find myself forgetting which kerbal was the pilot of my mission to Jool, and which one was flying planes around KSC for the last two weeks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there any improvements/changes that should be made to this idea?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bigbadben","CreatedById":89458,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T20:50:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProcedural generation does not necessarily mean random.
