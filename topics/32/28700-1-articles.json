Simply put, it\u0027s time to be practical and realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP as of now, is a sandbox game, as stressed by the \u0022greyed-out\u0022 option for career after you press \u0022Start New Game\u0022--sandbox IS the only option. As such, people have to try and temper their zest and eagerness to create \u0022balls-to-the-wall\u0022 complex missions that attempt to \u0022skirt around\u0022 the fact that the game doesn\u0027t have a career path, because I believe, the more complex your spacecraft or station or base is, the more chances (I say chances, it\u0027s not a sure thing) your current \u0022grand mission\u0022 game will go kaput, each time a new update gets released.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027m definitely NOT saying that people should stop being creative, because that ironically is what a sandbox is supposed to encourage--creativity. What I\u0027m saying is, how KSP sometimes draws us and compels us, makes us forget the very fact that \u003Cem\u003Eit is not robust enough yet\u003C/em\u003E for a grandesque career-type campaign mode. I\u0027m simply trying to let those who are fond of doing those grand tours and complex structures to temper their enthusiasm with the knowledge of the game\u0027s state.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI even have a feeling that perhaps the main reason why Squad hasn\u0027t given any word of a release for the \u0022career\u0022 mode of the game, is PRECISELY because perhaps, they found out that once you get to very complex scenarios (i.e. tons of objects/debris/ships/bases/stations), the very fact that the game is processor-dependent, will produce MIXED outcomes for every other user. This is purely speculation of course, but I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if this is currently the major showstopper for them, and they can see \u0022shadows\u0022 of that issue, each time they update KSP and see that most of the problems cropping up for other players are related to mods and/or persistent/saved files that contain a LOT of stuff \u0022spawned\u0022 into a game-state.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo again, I am not discouraging people to keep doing their complex missions--I simply wish they temper that attempt with the knowledge that at some point in the future, all of that might go poof once an update is made, esp. if they created something really superfluous and gargantuan. How does that saying go? Like if it has a million parts, expect a million problems, or something like that. That has always been my mindset, and that\u0027s perhaps why my \u0022progress\u0022 in \u0022playing\u0022 this game sandbox style has been slow (I haven\u0027t even gone beyond Minmus yet).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t really know if this post is useful or has any point, I merely just wanted express what I think is a good mindset to adapt for KSP, if only to ease the pain and discomfort of \u0022losing\u0022 your current Mun base or space station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-RODION\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sir Nahme","CreatedById":57378,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T04:20:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI need a bigger bucket to make a sand castle out near the beach at the space center\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OtherDalfite","CreatedById":8317,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T04:21:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI completely agree with this post.

My other thread entitled \u003Cem\u003E\u0022Am I the only one experiencing...\u0022\u003C/em\u003E is meant as an informal count/tally of those not experiencing any issues, and perhaps (and that was my error, I should have emphasized it) list down their machine\u0027s specs, so that perhaps, it can help other see that a certain \u0022profile\u0022 of machine setup (in terms of hardware/software) can perhaps be a good guide as to what sort of setup can be built in order to run KSP (esp. the latest version) well. Let that attempt at \u0022gathering data\u0022 make it clear that I am indeed aware that the program will work differently on different setups--my post was focused on those who are really \u003Cem\u003E\u0022using a pocket knife to cut down a tree\u0022\u003C/em\u003E sort of thing, and not those who are working/playing within the known limitations of the game. I don\u0027t think that those who have legitimate concerns should be worried, because, so far as in what I\u0027ve read in the forum, we can tell from the first few lines of their post about the \u0022legitimate\u0022 nature of their concern, and how it can potentially affect their gameplay.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFair enough, and I agree with your assessment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"loiske","CreatedById":63673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T07:53:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood text.
