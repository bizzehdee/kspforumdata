Otherwise ions for a slow boat or aerospikes for a faster one are the most straightforward option. The key thing is to keep the drag down. I believe the water drag works much like the air drag, so most parts are awful. Air intakes are well known as good floats and wing sections can work quite well too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInfiniglide might also work well, provided you keep control and don\u0027t take off.
