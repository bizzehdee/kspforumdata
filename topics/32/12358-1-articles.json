In December of 2011, I was planning to hook solid rocket boosters up (very calculated of course) and launch two unmanned wagons into the sky. I was designing all sorts of guidance systems, motor designs etc. I planned that if both flights were successful, either myself or my friend would launch aboard one of the \u0027Radio Flyer\u0027 wagon boosters.
