From 0 to 15 G. 0-2 G is green, 9-15 is red. But what\u0027s below zero? There\u0027s -5 G. Negative acceleration is used when vectors are important. If you\u0027re on a rollercoaster, anything that drives you into the bottom and crushes you to the seat is positive G, and hilltops are areas where you experience 0 or acceleration in the opposite direction of gravity, so it\u0027s named negative G.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never seen this part of G force navball actually working.

They could have just decided that 1 kerbin gravity is the 0 point and they are just mesuring any acceleration over that amount. I know with mesureing pressure theres a difference between gague pressure and absolute pressure. Atmospheric pressure is 1 Bar, if you mesure the presure in your tires it may read 4 bars of pressure but its actualy 5 bars absolute because the gague is reading the difference between in the tire and the atmosphere. Admitedly this explination does break down a bit as other planets should show a negitive. Either that or if it shifts to the local gravity as the 0 point the apparent TWR should show alot higher when at a low gravity area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn effect that gauge seems to ignores gravity altogeather and is just an indication of the ships acceleration in relation to its vector of travle, either from thrust or drag.
