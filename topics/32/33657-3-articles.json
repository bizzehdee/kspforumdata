It\u0027s a very nice design, albeit much bigger than you actually need to go to Mun. Since you\u0027re still having some issues, though, I\u0027ll make a few suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, you should always calculate the thrust-to-weight ratios of each stage. There are mods that can do this for you (like Flight Engineer), but it\u0027s also something you can do for yourself, like so:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I can see, your payload in the top two stages (everything other than rocket fuel, engines, or struts) masses about 2.0 tons, with nearly all of that being in the top stage. This isn\u0027t counting the 21 winglets (0.02T per) or 11 tricouplers (0.3T per) in the bottom stages, and I\u0027ll ignore strut/fuel line weights for now. So, the stages appear to go like so (masses are including all stages above each one):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: mass 2.8T, thrust 50kN. TWR: 1.8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: mass 6T, thrust 50kN. TWR: 0.8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: mass 26T, thrust 800kN. TWR: 3.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: mass 80T, thrust 1720kN. TWR: 2.3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: mass 144T, thrust 2580kN. TWR: 1.8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6: mass 285T, thrust 4515kN. TWR: 1.6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor TWR, a stage lifting off Kerbin should be in the 2.2 range, and anything below 1.5 is really bad. A transfer stage (something firing only in orbit after you\u0027ve circularized) can be as low as you want, although you shouldn\u0027t go below 0.1-0.2 for practical reasons and a moderate TWR keeps it from getting too boring, while a stage landing on or lifting off from Mun should have at least 0.3ish and should ideally be in the 0.5 range. So what I can see is that your bottom two stages just aren\u0027t powerful enough, whereas your middle stages have far more thrust than they actually need. Your top stage is also overpowered, but considering that the LV-909 is the smallest engine you can get in the demo, it\u0027s understandable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, here are some suggestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1\u0026gt; In the #3 and #4 stages, you can use LV-909s to save on weight, since you don\u0027t really need that much power at those points and efficiency is more important in orbit. The big engines you\u0027re using are 1.25T or 1.5T, whereas a 909 is only 0.5T. On the #3 stage, downgrading the engines from the LV-T45s you\u0027re using chops 4 tons off the weight; 22 tons for 200kN is only a TWR of 0.9, but that stage just doesn\u0027t NEED anything higher and the fuel will last much longer. Between the 20% lower weight and a 10% boost in engine efficiency, this\u0027ll get you 30% further on that stage, and will help a bit with the lower stages as well. Once you get the full game, you can replace the engines in the #4 stage with LV-Ns, which are MUCH more efficient despite their higher weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; Your #3 and #5 stages have too little fuel for their thrusts. Your 3 stage has 13.5 tons of fuel for 4 engines (3.375T per engine), and the 5 stage has 10 4.5-ton tanks feeding 12 engines (3.75T per engine); these numbers are just a little too low, given the high fuel consumption of the engines in question. The 4 stage is 40.5T for 8 engines (5.1T per), which is just fine in theory. The 6 stage has 25 4.5T (and one 2.25T) tanks for 21 engines (about 5.4T per engine), but it\u0027s not evenly distributed, which we\u0027ll discuss later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3\u0026gt; I know we love saying MOAR STRUTS, but you might just have too many of them. Each weighs 0.05 tons, so it adds up quickly when you start making strut networks that complex on fuel tanks that small. When you transition from the demo to the full game, you won\u0027t have that problem as you\u0027ll be able to use 2.5m parts instead of the demo\u0027s 1.25m ones. (Or even 3.75m parts if you use mods.) You can shave off a little weight by removing the struts that you don\u0027t really need, but it\u0027s usually better to just simplify the design a bit so that they\u0027re not necessary in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4\u0026gt; The big problem I can see is your fuel transfer setup on the bottom (6) stage. All 21 engines in the first stage fire initially, but the outer 18 appear to have a different amount of fuel than the inner 3. It\u0027s hard to see whether your fuel is transferring inward (the 18 will burn out first, which means there\u0027ll be a period where only three engines are pushing but you\u0027re carrying the weight of 18 dead engines), outward (the inner 3 will burn out first), or a bit of both where some tanks go in and some go out. Regardless, that\u0027s bad. With more fuel lines you could make all 21 engines share a supply, so they\u0027d all keep burning until the entire stage was exhausted, but it\u0027s still not the most efficient way to do things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat we usually suggest is the \u0022asparagus\u0022 design; the outer pods should be attached to the center with a radial decoupler (there\u0027s one in the demo, although the stock game has better ones), which you fire the moment the outer engines run out of fuel. This ditches the dead weight, saving a lot of fuel. In fact, if your outermost engine in the second stage are far enough from the center, they\u0027ll be able to fire once the bottom outer pods separate, so that it\u0027s not just 3 small engines pushing you to orbit. But that brings us to the final point:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5\u0026gt; Frankly, you could chop out your entire 5 stage and it\u0027d probably still work just fine. That\u0027d chop about 65 tons off your total weight, bringing the TWR of the bottom stage up to about 2.0-2.1. One issue you have is that your 5 stage has almost the exact same amount of fuel as your 4 stage (45T vs 40.5T), despite having more engines, which means that you\u0027re lifting an extremely large amount of weight on a #5 stage lacking in fuel. If you\u0027re going to do this sort of sequential staging, you want to have the weights and engine strengths taper down as you go up, but these two are too close. Ideally, you\u0027d make the #5 stage bigger and the #4 smaller, but I\u0027d look at just chopping out the #5 and making #4 a little bigger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6\u0026gt; Likewise, you could probably just merge the #1 and #2 stages. If you merge the two stages, using a single 4.5T fuel tank instead of the two 2.25Ts, you save 0.5 tons from the removal of the second engine during the period where the #2 stage is still attached. The downside is that once the #1 stage separates, you\u0027d be carrying along the weight of four landing legs (negligible) and the dry weight of a 2.25T tank (0.25T), so it\u0027s a tradeoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7\u0026gt; Put a stack separator just below the RCS tank, so that your final descent stage is only your command capsule, RCS fuel, and four RCS jets. Besides being a good emergency bailout mechanism, this minimizes the amount of weight you\u0027d have to push if you ran out of rocket fuel along the way. On something that small, the RCS could get you all the way home from anywhere in Kerbin\u0027s SOI just using the \u0022H\u0022 key to push.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8\u0026gt; I think you\u0027ve got too much RCS fuel in general, especially in the lower stages. You won\u0027t be using RCS during launch, and even in orbit it won\u0027t take much before the lower stages are separated. A rocket, even one that big, can make do on only one or two of those 100-point tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless of what path you choose, your bottom two stages need either more thrust or less total weight, while your 3 and 4 stages can be toned down a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-19T22:27:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2013 10:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Spatzimaus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rryy","CreatedById":57357,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T22:31:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Whackjob\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Whackjob\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy latest attempt...

In KSP, the surface gravity of Kerbin is the same as that of Earth (9.8m/s^2), so TWR is just \u003Cstrong\u003E(thrust of engines, in kN) / (mass of rocket, in tons * 9.8)\u003C/strong\u003E. And feel free to round that 9.8 off to a 10 to keep things easy. A TWR of 1.6 on that bottom stage meant that over 60% of your thrust was being used just to offset gravity, with less than 40% of your total actually accelerating you upwards. If you\u0027d increased your thrust by 33%, keeping everything else the same, a TWR of 2.1 would give you almost twice the acceleration while only burning through fuel 33% faster, for a 50% improvement in how far you can go on that stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, watch out for the reverse problem; if your TWR is too high in an atmosphere, then you\u0027ll be spending way too much fuel offsetting atmospheric drag; this can be even worse than fighting gravity for longer, so you want to aim for the sweet spot in between the two, which falls pretty close to that TWR=2.2 I suggested. Ideally, you want to ascend along the terminal velocity curve (110m/s at 1000m, 140m/s at 3000m, 170m/s at 6000m; see the wiki for the full table), so just keep an eye on your speed during the ascent. If you\u0027re going well below 100m/s when you cross 1000m altitude, then you need more thrust, and if you\u0027re going 130 or more at that point you\u0027ve got way too much engine power. It\u0027s usually better to have a bit too much engine, and just throttle down as necessary, than to have too little thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T23:55:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This end should point towards the ground if you want to go to space.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i301.photobucket.com/albums/nn77/Whackjob_photos/badproblem_zps1854bd6b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022badproblem_zps1854bd6b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022If it starts pointing towards space you are having a bad problem and you will not go to space today.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonus points if you can guess the name of this rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sir Nahme","CreatedById":57378,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T23:57:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eso many xkcd fans here XD lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spatzimaus","CreatedById":57215,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T00:05:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s hope the Up Goer 6 is more successful...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T00:10:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETake a look again at that picture.
