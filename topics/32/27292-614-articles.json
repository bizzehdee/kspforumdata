Didn\u0027t realize until the craft was coming in for splashdown that I\u0027d forgotten to load Bob into the capsule. Or that I\u0027d forgotten to take a crew report at the apoapsis...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was able to unlock Fuel Ducts, though, which gave me back the ability to make asparagus (checked for a new version of StageRecovery first, which was good since there was an update - one that gave me a shot at actually recovering stages). Launched a three-passenger tour bus to orbit with a booster I could rely on to make it. Ran a parts test while I was at it on an XL chute; I got the chute test completed but tore it off in the process, so it was a good thing I\u0027d packed spares specifically for that eventuality. Safely got the tourists back to Kerbin, though the craft landed in the mountains, so that was a \u0022just barely\u0022 sort of event. Also put out a pair of Stayputnik and jet-powered ground markers for KSC 09 and KSC 27. Used them to get Jeb back to the Runway safely from a parts test, which was the last thing I did yesterday. Raised enough capital to unlock the Level 2 Tracking Station, so at this point I\u0027m Munbound.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA current set of contracts has me flying tourists to both Mun and Minmus. I\u0027m reasonably sure I can design a ship at this point that will fulfill said contracts; my main concern is that I haven\u0027t unlocked solar panels yet. I\u0027m also finding myself a little short on funds, so I\u0027m hoping the final rocket won\u0027t be too expensive...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T13:36:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESurprise, no tourist contracts this time!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EValentina took one of the rookies on a field trip - unintentionally close to sunset *cough* - and collected some more science from the shores and grasslands, stumbling over a weird cold spot north of KSC, changing the climate in the area to that of a tundra ... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScientific data was added to the Mobile Lab Rover still munching the few data points it collected around KSC, copies of all of the results will go up to the KSS as soon as it is finished for evaluation in low-g.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs usual I picked and plucked small things at my KSS station design before spending quite some time crunching numbers in KER, pushing sliders, tweaking engines, changing an moving fuel tanks to build a launcher for that unexpectedly heavy station core.
