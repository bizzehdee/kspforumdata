Quite a few bodies have extremely low gravity, which makes the fuel cost of landing small; that list includes Gilly, Ike, Mun, Minmus, Pol, Vall, and Bop. You\u0027ll spend most of the fuel just matching orbits, of course, but the point is that one station can service quite a few destinations. In fact, some of these fuel costs are so low that you might not need refueling at all; I did Mun and Minmus in a single trip, and I didn\u0027t bother refilling after Ike before going down to Duna. I also didn\u0027t just rely on the onboard Kethane refinery; I had fuel depots around Eve, Duna, and two at Laythe. They\u0027re two-part depots, a main tanker and a kethane-refining lander, as seen here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gff9p7G.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gff9p7G.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou specified stock parts, so the refining part is out, but I can still get one of these to Duna or Eve with more than half its fuel intact, and a trip to Jool leaves about a third of the tank. Given the sheer size of these depots, a third of the capacity is still about three orange tanks\u0027 worth of fuel, more than enough to repeatedly refuel small vessels as needed even if you had no way of refilling the tanker. The key is the two-part nature; the 400-ton tanker will park itself in a nice convenient orbit, high enough to make docking easy and low enough to be Oberth-efficient. The smaller, more mobile part can come meet your vessels at each moon, then travel back to the big part to refill. This is especially important for high-gravity moons like Tylo or Laythe; you\u0027ll burn most of your fuel just getting out of that gravity well, and might not have enough to rendezvous with a tanker that isn\u0027t in local orbit, so having the smaller part come meet you to give the fuel needed to get to the next moon saves a LOT of time and effort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, one word of advice: even if you hate mods, I\u0027ll recommend a few specific ones for practical reasons. KW Rocketry includes a variety of engines, with the same efficiencies as stock engines (i.e., not overpowered), but most importantly it includes 3.75m fuel tanks and engines. This allows you to build your fuel depots with much lower part counts, which makes docking much more user-friendly without making anything \u0022easy mode\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other mod with a similar appeal is the Ion Engine mod; it includes larger versions of all the stock solar panel, xenon tank, and battery components, which\u0027ll make things a lot nicer if you decide to put any ions on your design. The ridiculously high ISP of ions makes interplanetary transfers MUCH more practical, although they\u0027ll take a long, long burn unless you stick a lot of them on board. (Just turn on ASAS and go watch TV for half an hour.) This\u0027ll help you to get to and from Moho, Eeloo, etc. without needing a fuel station on-site; even with LV-Ns, a trip to Moho will use up a lot of fuel, and getting a tanker there to refill you might not be feasible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jaedinator","CreatedById":27680,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T19:37:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Spatzimaus, you had some very good tips that I\u0027m implementing in my planning right now.

A very small, efficient design that\u0027s intended to just go to each place and land can do this sort of trip easily, if only because of how many times you can refill from a single tanker. As you start throwing on nonessential bits, the added weight makes things a lot harder; your delta-V will go down, which makes Moho/Eeloo trips more difficult, and you\u0027ll have a harder time staying stable on planets with atmospheres. For instance, my Nimbus design above had a bunch of things that weren\u0027t really necessary for this trip, like the robot arm, the various small docking ports, and so on. Dropping the Kethane tank, drill, sensor, etc. would chop a good three tons off the design. The base of the ship is a CBM 2.5m port, which I used a few times for fueling vessels but whose main use was the Eve descent (it\u0027s where I attached the temporary lower half of my design), and the \u0022neck\u0022 are two of the concealed 1.25m docking ports (so that I can hang this design from my big mothership). The parachutes were only useful for Duna, Laythe, and Kerbin (and Eve, but that required a second stage anyway which added more chutes), and I could have designed this to use a disposable descent assist module for those places. The design had more batteries than it really needed thanks to the hybrid engines, and it had large solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoving all of these nonessential bits to build it as a conventional LFO rocket would chop a good 10% of my total weight, with a corresponding increase in TWR and delta-V, but this design was intended to be my one-size-fits-all \u0022space truck\u0022 ship so I left these all on when I did my grand tour. A purpose-built mothership with landers customized to each world could do this much better. But then again, half the fun of this game is doing things the \u0022fun\u0022 way, like building SSTO spaceplanes instead of simple rocket stacks. It\u0027s even tougher if you want your design to be able to do more stuff on each surface, like detach a rover. My next-generation all-purpose craft is going to use Damned Robotics to have vectorable descent engines (VTOL landings on any world), and powered rover wheels, so I might have real problems with efficiency. But I\u0027ll have an awesome vehicle that can drive all over the surfaces to see the sights...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stealth2668","CreatedById":57377,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T22:27:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think any computer can handle the size of rocket necessary without refueling \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rodion_herrera","CreatedById":66284,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T02:02:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spatzimaus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spatzimaus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E A purpose-built mothership with landers customized to each world could do this much better. ...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s exactly how the \u0022Pegasus\u0022 was set up in that movie I posted (Voyage to the Planets)!
