The implications are obvious: all lifeforms on Kerbin are offshoots of the main Kerman race, clones adapted for various ecological niches. Obviously, a nuclear war wiped out all life on the planet, and it was recolonized from the few Kerbs who\u0027d been in orbit at the time, which explains the focus on repeated space flights no matter the cost. Therefore, those \u0022birds\u0022 are miniature, devolved copies of Jeb living in the trees. Like Jeb, they\u0027re just as active at night as they would be in the day, because as we all know, Jeb doesn\u0027t require sleep, food, or even air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Why yes, I DID just read The Mote in God\u0027s Eye.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T14:48:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like birds, but I hate this sound.
