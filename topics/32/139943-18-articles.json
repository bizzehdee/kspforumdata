I ended up trying to finish it in as little in-game time as possible, avoiding skipping past too many transfer windows, since that seemed wasteful.

You can\u0027t do anything until you get there, and there\u0027s not much to look at, so it can get tedious. Especially if you miss the direct transfer and go around the sun several times trying to find an encounter, which is probably what most new players do for their first few interplanetary missions; kicking yourself straight from one planet to another takes a lot of precision/fiddling and, often, knowledge of transfer windows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlus, since the physical warp goes to scary-red at max speed, people may think the regular warp is dangerous at max speed, too (which it kinda was before the game automatically dewarped at encounters, and that sometimes doesn\u0027t work) and keep it below that, which makes transfers \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E slow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-23T20:00:09Z\u0022 title=\u002209/23/2016 08:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by kotomikun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Will_F","CreatedById":169177,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-27T16:53:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSteam says I have just over 250 hrs in game.\u00A0 I have been mucking about in the Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E primary because I am working towards goals in that area.\u00A0 I\u0027ve thoroughly enjoyed tinkering with orbital stations, and missions to the Mun and Minmus.\u00A0 Frankly, I\u0027d thought about going further, but there always seemed to be something else to do first (and I was having fun doing it)\u00A0 That said, I started reading this thread about a week ago, and decided to fire up a 1.1.2 career save, and amazingly, the window for Duna opened 12 game days later, and Eeloo 12 days after that.\u00A0 I\u0027ve fired off my first interplanetary probes and fully expect the missions to be less than a stellar success, but I enjoyed planning and building (planning :/\u00A0\u00A0 Admittedly, rather slap-dash missions).\u00A0 So, thanks to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Original Post(er).
