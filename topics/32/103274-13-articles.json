At 113 days now, this has been the longest period so far. Heres a reference of the time between recent versions: version .18 - 73 days since previous update, .19 - 105, .20 - 66, .21 - 64, .22 - 84, .23 - 62, .23.5 - 105, .24 - 107, .25 - 82, .90 - 69 days. They said this experimental, which they announced less than a week ago, would be longer than most others, so I\u0027m guessing about four weeks total. \n\nSeeing as how the only major addition SQUAD is handling is the new aero system, (the other stuff are either small additions or being handled by outside mod makers) I don\u0027t think they\u0027re rushing at all."},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T02:12:44Z","Content":"the rush he is refering to is going to 1.0 after only 1 beta cycle. the game was alpha for 3 or 4 years, and after 4 months of 1 beta update its jumping to 1.0?\n\nQuite a few think its way too quick to jump that far: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108318-Do-you-feel-KSP-is-ready-for-1-0](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108318-Do-you-feel-KSP-is-ready-for-1-0)\n\nat the least I think this should be .99, and 1.0 can be the final bug fix/tweak update.
