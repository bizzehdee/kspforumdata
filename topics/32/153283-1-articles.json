Normally I use Juno engines to blow a turbine to power the propellor, but lately I\u0027ve been experimenting with landing struts for the same purpose. The basical principle runs thus: the struts are always extended, and as the blades of the turbine move into the collision ray for the strut\u0027s \u0022foot\u0022, the strut instantly compresses and then extends again, so applying torque to the turbine. I got the idea when I ran over a discarded stack separator and saw it fly off, and realised this was a potential source of reciprocating power. Anyway... when the craft is attached to the ground with stability enhancers, the engine works well, and I can get a steady rate of rotation without any issues (obviously the bearing part isn\u0027t attached to the ground, but the part with the struts on it is). However, when I release the stability enhancers, or launch without them (standing on wheels), it\u0027s very common for the struts to quickly overstress and disappear in a cloud of smoke.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo far I\u0027ve not been able to work out what\u0027s going on. I would probably be better equipped to avoid the problem if I understood \u0027the rules\u0027 for landing struts a little better. So, here we are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"W.
