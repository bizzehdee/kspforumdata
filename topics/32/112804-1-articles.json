The whole thing is working just fine, its just the tooltip that is a bit misleading.\n\nEDIT 2: Some people seem to think the bug is how much science is generated.

Off the top of my head I believe a gravity scan in low orbit around kerbin gave 22 data with 90% gains (did that last night). I could be off on the number, but not by 3x.
