Ram Air Intake\n\u003E \n\u003E Looking at the stats of both of these they appear to be exactly the same. Is that the case, or are there hidden things that I\\\u0027m not seeing?\n\u003E \n\u003E Nacelle Engine Body Vs. Radial Engine Body\n\u003E \n\u003E The stats of these two seem to indicate that the Radial Engine Body is better or the same in every variable. The Nacelle has less heatConductivity and heatDissipation, but otherwise the two seem to be exactly the same.\n\nTurboJet Engine Vs. Basic Jet Engine\n\nI\\\u0027ve definitely seen the Basic Jet Engine lose the ability to run at higher altitudes (around 8000 meters seems to be the point), but the TurboJet Engine seems to run fine for me from lower alt to higher. What exactly is efficiency measuring? At lower efficiency do engines use fuel faster?\n\nI tested the same design at the same alt (around 400 meters) and got around the same distance with both before running out of fuel. The test designs were 1) 3 Basic Jet Engines, 2) 3 TurboJet Engines.\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who can provide information or guidance! I\\\u0027m loving the additions so far. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T22:08:04Z","Content":"Hi Kymlaar\n\nFrom what I have read and experienced so far, the two intakes and nacelles are just for show at the moment, they were supposed to route air to the engines but that feature didn\\\u0027t make it into this update.\n\nAlso the statistics of the new engines are largely just placeholders to get them working in the game, the high altitude engine will be changed so it is only useful at high altitudes.\n\nEverything is going to change again at some point.\n\nHope this helps ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kymlaar","CreatedById":24642,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T22:09:51Z","Content":"It definitely does.

The turbojet keeps working up to, I think, 10 km. It\\\u0027s supposed to have poor efficiency near the surface, but I flew around with it.\n\nSo I made them into a launcher! The launch stage is three basic jet engines. The next stage is three turbo jet engines. Both of these consume a single jet fuel tank, which is just enough. The final stage is a normal rocket. Staging was weird because the jet takes a few seconds to build up thrust. So I modified the staging sequence so that the basic and turbo stages overlap before the basic jets jettison."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T08:08:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Both of these consume a single jet fuel tank, which is just enough.\n\nC7\\\u0027s parts are still massively overpowered I see."},{"CreatedByName":"Frostiken","CreatedById":1837,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T13:03:24Z","Content":"I\\\u0027m not sure I agree with the engine differences. While yes, a turbofan will operate better at higher altitudes, you can still easily get off the ground with them. And while you people may think they\\\u0027re overpowered, I think quite the opposite - they\\\u0027re incredibly underpowered. I cannot seem to pull more than a 1.5-2G turn, not only because the game doesn\\\u0027t really let me, but these engines aren\\\u0027t producing a whole lot of thrust, contrary to what you might think... they\\\u0027re actually just piling speed on gradually. If you make a sharp turn, not only will the aircraft fall out of the sky and completely lose control, but assuming that doesn\\\u0027t happen, you have to sit there and slowly wait for the velocity vector to catch up - because the engines, even dual turbofans on a very lightweight design - just aren\\\u0027t making a whole lot of Delta-V.\n\nIf turbofan operated as poorly as you all seem to want, you\\\u0027d see aircraft with multiple styles of jet engines on them in real life, which just doesn\\\u0027t happen. \n\nI\\\u0027m experimenting with small fighter aircraft designs and while they \\*work\\*, they don\\\u0027t work very well, and if we make it so that I now have to tack on 4 different kinds of engines just to get high-altitude flight, well, that\\\u0027s just getting kind of silly.\n\nPS: My wing loading is utterly massive and yet it takes the whole runway to get in the air - that should tell you how these engines aren\\\u0027t really that great."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T13:08:57Z","Content":"It\\\u0027s not just the engines though, the wings don\\\u0027t simulate lift properly and they actually resist your attempts to turn, the engines themselves are ok I think but the new fueltank isn\\\u0027t very balanced, and the new RCS thruster is massively overpowered.\n\nWe really need a way to see where the center of gravity and thrust is in the SPH, as it\\\u0027s too easy to make a plane with all the weight and lift at the back, and it\\\u0027ll then struggle to get airborne without bags of trim."},{"CreatedByName":"Frostiken","CreatedById":1837,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T13:13:26Z","Content":"Center of gravity would be awesome.\n\nAnd I want engines and control surfaces that let me pull 7-9G turns and still maintain control and a modicum of speed ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nRight now I\\\u0027m making two little addons:\n\n1) Turn the Small Hardpoint into a second version with decoupler functionality so I can use it to drop tanks - the current decoupler is just way too big.\n\n2) Add internal fuel to wings."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T13:16:33Z","Content":"Have you tried the aerospike? its got an output of 225 and is the most powerful stock engine, it\\\u0027s not vectoring though, I haven\\\u0027t used it yet so don\\\u0027t know if it\\\u0027s what you\\\u0027re after.\n\nAdd extra control surfaces for more manoeuvrability ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Frostiken","CreatedById":1837,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T13:58:39Z","Content":"Hmm.... can\\\u0027t seem to make wings carry fuel ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nThey have fuel in them and they appear to still generate lift, but the fuel won\\\u0027t transfer out, even with piping (which shouldn\\\u0027t even be required)."}]}
