And also so that if people do have a lot of RAM on average, maybe squad can see this and raise the recommended specs a bit, for things like clouds and maybe even procedural cites, more planets and parts, the sky\u0027s the limit. Well the RAM\u0027s the limit but you get my point.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs long as some of these features can be disabled for those of us that do not have excessive ram availeable i am all for it. Clouds (well eve is there but its kinda buggy, cant stand the Z-fighting at long distances, especially with jool, no idea why jool is so bad?) would be a nice addition, and cities, well im all for it, itd be like more persistent objects such as teh easter eggs but larger and more city like (if they are done right it wont even be too many polys, square or near square buildings would suffice, with some having a roof, and with some of them illuminated at night. Actually now that i think about easter eggs, we need to have the ones in game fixed as half of them are under ground, and a few more couldnt hurt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally i have 8 gigs, which seems to be the norm for a generic non gaming rig these days. I also run ksp on a older lappy that has 4, but thats still plenty to at least run it (although its cpu sucks so i cant have \u0026lt;1000 parts loaded without just crashing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough raising the limit to at least 4 or 8 would be reasonable, i still feel that it is best to optimize as much as possible, and at a bare minimum allow users to disable these features if they ever get added in the 1st place to save ram (or just personal preference). Id ofc be running them on my gaming laptop that has 8 gigs, but my older one (i play on there when traveling) might have issues, and id like to have the ability to still play on it even if without these new cool features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, upgrading ram isnt that hard one way or another, i have 4 slots, each with 2 gigs in them, nothing too hard with replacing some of those with 4 or 8 gig chips.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-21T18:04:38Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2015 06:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T18:13:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E12 giga in my laptop, but only 4 in old-ish desktop.
