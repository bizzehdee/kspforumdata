Let me get Val out of the inline cockpit to do an EVA and grab some science.

I also stared at my screen a few seconds wondering what just happened. EVA from a standard Mk 1 pod, but it had radial chutes, so she might have been launched because of those. Right into the ground so fast she disappeared in a puff of smoke.\n\nSadly, she was my last available pilot, the next few missions had to be done by scientists and engineers, and without SAS it was...problematic to get them to return. Eventually I unlocked the Stayputnik, and then the OKTO probe core after planeRoving around KSC collecting science. I was about \u003E \u003C close to losing the game though due to funds loss. Had to take a few contracts I knew I couldn\u0027t do just to get the upfront K$ to get my program back on its feet."},{"CreatedByName":"FishInferno","CreatedById":106219,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T15:35:38Z","Content":"welcome to the club:P\n\nI lost her when I attempted to suicide burn land on the Mun"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T15:39:27Z","Content":"How tall was this thing?! ![:0.0:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif)\n\nI\u0027ve had Jeb and Val jump from heights greater than what I\u0027m envisioning for your contraption and easily live..."},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T16:04:01Z","Content":"The game feels sad once Jeb or Val is KIA...\n\nI dont like it.

She and Jeb were flying to the other side of Kerbin in a Mk. 2 jet to get a pressure reading; since we would not have enough fuel to make the return trip (and I sucked at landing), I made a mechanism that ejected the cockpit from the main body of the plane and deployed radially-mounted parachutes (standard-issue to all aircraft). After I deployed the cockpit chutes, I decided to have Jeb go on an EVA and show off his new suit Level 2 parachute. Though I managed to land Jeb safely in the water, I later learned that Valentina was killed in action.\n\nThe weird part was that I deployed that system many times and it was perfectly safe. I don\u0027t know what happened to her; even if the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E was turned off, I\u0027m sure the cockpit-mounted parachutes would have still slowed her down to a safe velocity (even if we\u0027re over water).\n\nAny ideas as to how she died, everyone? Just like NASA with the Challenger, the KSP will take all necessary steps to ensure the death of a crewmember does not happen again."},{"CreatedByName":"SiriusRocketry","CreatedById":178125,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-26T20:46:48Z","Content":"I lost Val on a routine Skylark shuttle mission, along with rookie engineer Pondsey.
