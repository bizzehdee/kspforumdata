This rules life support out right away, and is a big strike against giving terrain scatter a collision mesh. On the flip side of this, he says he spent a few days implementing it. Past tense. So if it\u0027s minor enough, that\u0027s almost a week to playtest it.\n\nI think it\u0027s going to be something UI, or strictly visual. And yes, as much as I\u0027m a function over visuals kind of person, I played with a mod that added clouds once and was quite surprised by how much that one change made the game feel more real. I would not be disappointed if it is clouds, but I won\u0027t be disappointed if it\u0027s not clouds.
