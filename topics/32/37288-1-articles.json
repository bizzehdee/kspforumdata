All I\u0027m saying is that a wheel further out from the CoM would provide much more torque than closer in. Not a set of X, Y and Z wheels, just one wheel on one axis. Would it be useful IRL? Not at all, the chances the wheel happens to be in the right plane of rotation for it to work properly are ridiculously slim, having them all at the center provides much more precision. But It could give a much greater amount of angular moment to the craft. Just not useful angular moment.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t matter where a wheel is mounted. Torque is Torque.
