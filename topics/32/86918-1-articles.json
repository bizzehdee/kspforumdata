Did I capture the essence?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EImagine the most intricate, accurate to life space vehicle simulator you can. Dozens of toggle switches, displays ranging from the strange and esoteric to the vague and incomprehensible, buttons flashing angrily at you and daring you to press them. The screen shakes and aside from the roar of liftoff, the only thing you can hear is your own labored breathing and the pulse in your ears. Do you have this picture in your head? Good.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EBecause KSP is nothing like that. Take parts, attach parts, launch parts, land parts, detonate parts, survive falling parts. KSP is learning through failure. Unless you go on Youtube and look up the Scott Manley videos, you are going to fail. You gonna fail bad. But it\u0027s okay. Failure is only data by another name. Bit by bit, you\u0027ll learn how to do things right. You\u0027ll realize that putting the engines under the tanks is probably a good idea. Putting the crew capsule in a place not likely to be burned or detonated is also probably a good idea. Parachutes seem like a logical choice, but what the heck, right? Maybe you just need a five hundred meter long crumple zone. Nobody\u0027s gonna stop you. That\u0027s the great thing, isn\u0027t it? You can put anything at all you want on the launchpad, and nobody knows well enough to try to stop you. The Kerbish OSHA rep is permanently locked into the bathroom. He\u0027s not gettin\u0027 out of there. We welded the window shut, locked the door, and put model airplane glue in the keyhole. Cell phone reception in there is sketchy. You\u0027re safe. So go nuts.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThere\u0027s places you can go. Land at the poles, the sea, the mountains, or all three at once with a creatively timed spray of shrapnel. There\u0027s other worlds. A big burning thing with no surface that\u0027ll tan you for free if you check it out. It\u0027ll tan you to the bone. So that\u0027s a bonus. There\u0027s other worlds. Red world. Purple world. Green world with little worlds around it. Hidden stuff everywhere. All of these places are fit to seed with refuse. Landers, rovers, living quarters, stations, battleships, pasteboard furniture, lawnmowers, spaceplanes, robots, scooters, springboards, et cetera. KSP is a litterer\u0027s dream. There\u0027s so many places you can leave stuff you have no hope of bringing home. And it\u0027s worth doing it just to see that stuff sitting there.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EBut I\u0027ve got to warn you. You\u0027ve reached TL;DR level four, so here\u0027s a bonus. This game has very unexpected side effects. You will learn things. Hoffman transfer. Periapsis. Apoapsis. How orbit actually works. Why orbit is halfway to anywhere. Launch windows. Free transfer windows. Free returns. If you make the horrifying inadvertent mistake of buying this game for yourself or your child, somebody\u0027s gonna learn things. It\u0027s unavoidable. Real things, even. Newton\u0027s spectre haunts this game. You will find no escape, and he fears no earthly garlic.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELemmie wrap this up for the TL;DR folks who check the bottom summary. Just get KSP already. You aren\u0027t really learning anything from my review you probably didn\u0027t know already. Let\u0027s be honest with each other, here. Ok? You don\u0027t want to learn whether or not this game is worth buying. You\u0027re looking for someone to make the excuse for you. You\u0027re already gonna get it, you just want someone to possibly take the fall for you if you catch heat for doing it. And to you, good sirs and madams, I say; Yes. Yes, I\u0027ll take the blame. \u0022That fat idiot Whackjob from KSP told me to get the game, or he said he\u0027d cut me.\u0022 They\u0027ll believe you. You\u0027re good. So do it.
