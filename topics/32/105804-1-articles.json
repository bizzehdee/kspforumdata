It challenging, the new parts are wonderful, and the resource and mining is an amazing addition, which is a testament to the KSP modding community. Without the likes of Kethane or Karbonite we would not have this new \u0022ore\u0022, I mean squad went as far as recruiting Roverdude the creator of Karbonite to program the new resources. That all being said am I the only one who thinks mods such as KAS or KIS are required now. Without them bases will be ungainly and huge. To create a base now there is an enormous challenge to build proper bases. Obviously with KAS this is easily fixed by attaching modules with pipes. So what I am saying is KAS/KIS should be stock, right? Its gonna be interesting to figure out ways to create efficient ships that convert ore into fuel. Anyway thats just my opinion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS:\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514-0-24-2-Kerbal-Attachment-System-%28KAS%29-0-4-8-Fixed-for-0-24-2-x86-x64-%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514-0-24-2-Kerbal-Attachment-System-%28KAS%29-0-4-8-Fixed-for-0-24-2-x86-x64-%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKIS:\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113111-0-90-Kerbal-Inventory-System-%28KIS%29-1-0-2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113111-0-90-Kerbal-Inventory-System-%28KIS%29-1-0-2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T22:09:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeconded.
