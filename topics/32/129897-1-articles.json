Evidence is that there is very little Kerbal architecture on Kerbin, there is only one space program (maybe two), and prices for important resources like fuel and rocket parts are comparatively low next to ours.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Perhaps in the past they DID experiment with uncontrolled nuclear blasts, and in so doing (being Kerbals) they caused widespread devastation. Since then the environment has at least mostly recovered, but note the relative sparseness of trees, low biodiversity, and aforementioned dearth of Kerbal architecture. There\u0027s also one or two huge blast craters on Kerbin, which we all presume are the results of asteroid impacts, but mayyybe...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr.K Kerbal","CreatedById":156864,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-15T20:46:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI th when think when they nervs they think there going out there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-15T20:46:53Z\u0022 title=\u002201/15/2016 08:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Dr.K Kerbal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Epoop\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"n.b.z.","CreatedById":130888,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-15T22:55:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPlease.
