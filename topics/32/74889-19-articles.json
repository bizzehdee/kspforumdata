On Reddit, on the other hand, only one team made a football trophy, and the other three made something else entirely.\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately some of that lateral thinking went a bit too lateral. Reddit 3 and 4 definitiely are not what I\u0027d consider a \u0022trophy\u0022 at all. Reddit 2 can qualify if you consider something 2D like an artsy engraved plate to be a trophy.

I don\u0027t really like team 3, but not because the build is bad - I don\u0027t like it because I think the photo is bad. It\u0027s too dark. It doesn\u0027t look glorious at all, it looks more brooding and ominous. Nice idea with the eclipse but I don\u0027t think it works for this subject matter.
