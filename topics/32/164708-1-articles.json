Whether you are touching down on the Mun, and suddenly realise that you forgot the fuel to get back to Kerbin, or you are landing on Duna, but crash (or in Jeb\u0027s terms, a successful flight), we all are faced with two options: Revert flight (coward), or attempt a rescue (hero). Normally rescues don\u0027t go to plan. Normally they either make it back just in time, or they screw up (and you have to launch a rescue mission to save the rescue ship that was trying to save a crew). So what\u0027s your most daring rescue?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMine was when I had the infamous \u0027Dead Kerbal\u0027 bug, where the Kerbal is seemingly \u0027dead\u0027 by hitting something at high speed while in\u00A0a EAS-1 seat. You can\u0027t move them, but you can switch to them, and do everything else. It was on Minmus, but I had a station in orbit that was equipped for emergencies. I sent down a small craft that had the Klaw, positioned it over the Kerbal, and picked them up. I then docked with a fuel drone (a big tank with a big engine), and went back to Kerbin. During re-entry, I had to flip it upside down, otherwise the Kerbal would get fried! Opened the parachutes, and had a bumpy (but ok) landing, rescuing the Kerbal from doom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"luizopiloto","CreatedById":97503,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-23T06:09:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\none of my high orbit stations had some problems... various modules got astray... a shuttle that was docked to it survived the explosion and was able to rendezvous to all 6 crew modules and rescue everyone... \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"invision","CreatedById":178900,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-23T07:07:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\na few months ago i ran out of fuel coming back from duna, i made it to kerblins orbit. i was really bad at docking and used mechjeb to fly me out there and do all the work while reaping all the glory.....or so i thought thats what \u00A0was going to happen.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso i flew out a new craft to save the other, did the mechjebs things, and like \u00A0a good hero i went to make coffee. while making coffee i hear mechjeb doing its usual maneuvers and then silence for a about a min, i figured this must be where the crafts will meet up, and meet they indeed did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhile jamming large amounts of sugar into my cup i hear BOOM..................\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni come back to see the engines to both crafts are torn off....nice.......\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnow im annoyed with mechjeb, this is the 2nd time its blown me up, so i make a new rocket \u00A0and fly back out this time no mechjeb, it took me forever but managed to save the first craft and landed back on the ground. that was the last time i used mechjeb.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-23T07:08:41Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2017 07:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by invision\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnny Wishbone","CreatedById":118096,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-23T12:35:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve told this story several times here before, but since its a cool story, I\u0027ll happily tell it again:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEarly in my KSP playing days, I was doing an Apollo style Mun landing.

Great idea. I had absolutely no clue how anything worked, and spent basically all the lander\u0027s fuel getting to the Mun.

See, I was specifically not doing rescue contracts, since I had no clear idea how to do it -yet. Things changed when one of my own missions got stranded around the Mun.\u00A0I decided to bite the proverbial bullet and go for it and guess what: I did it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother, not really daring, but certainly more complicated than usual,\u00A0was\u00A0when an\u00A0ion-propelled rescue ship of mine, carrying a solar orbit stranded kerbal and it\u0027s pod, entered Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E and circularized in high orbit (500km IIRC). I figured the whole assembly would fit on the mk3 carbo bay, which meant\u00A0I could bring the whole thing back on a spaceplane.\u00A0Having a claw-fitted craft already docked with one of my stations, I decided to send it over and bring the ion rescue craft in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblem: the claw craft was never rated to carry something of that mass. I would ran out of fuel if I attempted to circularize, let alone rendezvous with a spaceplane. But hey, I\u0027ve got fuel drones in orbit. So:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nBrought the claw craft to an, as circular orbit as possible (with the ion rescue craft in tow).

In the meantime, I launched another spaceplane, with a claw and enough space to get the ion rescue craft (along with the pod and the kerbonaut\u00A0itself) safely back to kerbin.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe most tricky part in the whole process, was to line up the ion rescue craft properly inside the spaceplane\u0027s cargo bay -I basically had to eyeball it.
