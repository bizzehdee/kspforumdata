I have built subs, I have alt-f12\u0027d them over to laythe, I have built/encapulated them to be able to survive entry and splashdown, but I\u0027ve never actually gone through all the steps of launching a sub to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, putting it on an interplanetary transfer, and then splashing it down somewhere near an island that I\u0027m going to make a surface base on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFWIW, I haven\u0027t actually built a surface base on laythe in a legitimate way, but rather I used alt-f12 to test components of a laythe mission that I never got around to doing - most of my legit missions to laythe get launched, but I move on to a new save before they arrive. Duna/Eve/Moho on the other hand I\u0027ve done a lot of stuff at (I\u0027ll get burned out there while my laythe mission is still in interplanetary space), and take a break from KSP, and then come back and try out new ideas using alt-f12.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if its too complicated, then cut out some of the more routine parts (launch to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E/wait for transfer window/transfer burn, capture), and just immediately start trying to land a rover that jumps the dres canyon or something\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CrashyMcCrashFace","CreatedById":187039,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-29T16:40:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook at other people\u0027s designs and what their doing.
