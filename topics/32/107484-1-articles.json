I\u0027ve had to give up my tried-and-true strategy of never using the LV-T30 now that the T45 has lousy thrust at sea level.\n\nThe T45 is actually less suck now than it was before - the cost differential was larger in the past, and the thrust ratios are still rather similar (although the T45 is slightly worse now due to it\u0027s wider isp spread). I used to use T30s exclusively prior to 1.0 (*much* better TWR), and now I get more usage out of T45s. Pair \u0027em with some parallel SRBs to help \u0027em past the thick part of the atmosphere (which is very..very..very..very small), and they can easily handle the rest of the trip.

Almost like we have a 50\u0027s era jet engine from an F-86 or F-100 and one from the SR-71. Which is cool, I use them both, but I sort of wish we had a more powerful, non-turboramjet engine like what an F-15 or Su-27 KSP-analogue would mount. That ramjet curve sometimes feels like a runaway freight train when it kicks in, you really have to back off the throttle when at lower altitudes before you tear your jet apart. A third jet engine with performance between those two would be nice.
