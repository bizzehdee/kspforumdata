Once the tanks are spent, the orbiter throttles down, the interstage fairing and the extra tank are chucked off, and the orbiter continues to orbit. This particular configuration is capable of deploying a Big Orange Tank plus a large amount of monoprop into a 100km orbit. (Unfortunately the test shown below failed on reentry, because I still had the wings mounted too far forward. That mistake has been corrected.

Others worked, but putting the payload on the front means a balanced ascent profile becomes unbalanced when the CoM moves towards the engines after releasing the payload. I often had to save about 200 LF to store in the tip of the plane to keep it stable during entry. The newest version is stable even when completely empty on re-entry. Other low tech non-MK3 designs for large payloads have a scheme to put the payload in the center so that CoM doesn\u0027t move as much after releasing the payload, which is a respectable design, but I wanted to try and refine my own approach. It\u0027s fairly easy to use bicouplers to upgrade to 6 or 8 ramjets as-needed for heavier payloads.
