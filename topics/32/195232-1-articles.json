After the Mun orbit mission next up was an mun landing, here I manged to throw more weight than usual and managed to sample 4 biomes on the Mun who was perfect as I unlocked the graviton detector and the 2.5 m fairing.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/sygV8pq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022sygV8pqh.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sygV8pqh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nR7 Minmus1, R7 Mun2 and R7B Mun3 had an 1.5x and 2x lager transfer stage, transfer stage can dock with docking port on bottom of one of the drop tanks. Its important to move science from the outside science storage module to cockpit before staging.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith refueling in orbit I could have two landing areas on the Mun, or multiple on Minus, docked twice on Minmus but did not run with an fully loaded lander as it wasted fuel.
