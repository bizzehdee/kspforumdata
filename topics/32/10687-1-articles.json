Once may be not enough control surfaces. Another could be a lack of normal SAS modules (only one ASAS is necessary, if you have others, replace them with normal SAS ones), since ASAS is only attitude control, and doesn\\\u0027t have an actual force rating on it, so its effect will not increase with more of them, unlike normal SAS.\n\nA third thing that may help is a few thrust vectoring engines (don\\\u0027t replace all your engines with thrust vectoring ones, or your ship may become mighty unstable, especially with ASAS enabled)."}]}
