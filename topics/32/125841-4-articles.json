But usually, with just a minmum of care taken in tweaking your Pe on an encounter, and paying attention to what your path looks like on the other side, you can make for all kinds of fuel savings this way. Not just a Moho but anywhere else. At the expense of the elapsed mission time required to make multiple solar orbits. But at Moho, you get the best of both worlds with the multi-encounter braking technique. You get very significant dV savings and going around the sun at Moho\u0026#39;s distance doesn\u0026#39;t take very long so no real harm done on the mission time.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T22:54:42Z","Content":"\n[IMG]http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/531745346204331810/40DBB83848CD49D6C5A7E0F5E68064FCF22F42C6/[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI try not to over build ships.

Fortunately there are also a better one.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDv needed from Kerbin\u0026#39;s orbit to Moho\u0026#39;s orbit is very sensitive to even minimal errors. Typically very small error (even 1 m/s) after MOI burn can not be seen in map view, but it may increase needed dv to Moho orbit insertion with 1000 m/s. Therefore there are often nasty surprises in Moho\u0026#39;s SOI. If player does not want to use Mechjeb or other precision node adjusting mods, then only solution is to put 1500-2500 m/s extra dv for breaking. I think it is impossible or at least impractically laborious to adjust orbit with stock maneuver nodes. If player accepts mods, he can achieve near minimal energy transfers predicted by porkchop plotters. Orbit must be very carefully correct. I have noticed that AP and PE values of transfer orbit around sun are relatively good indicators. Map windows give often encounters even if they are not accurate, but then typically dv needed to orbit insertion is much higher than on exact trajectory.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSome Porkchop plotters does may not take patched conics model into account (I do not know current situation, it was several versions ago when I was on Moho). It causes errors in components of predicted burn. Leaving of Kerbin\u0026#39;s SOI gives free energy, which corresponds to tens of m/s on prograde burn (depending on burn\u0026#39;s magnitude). If map view does not show transfer orbit with correct apses it is good idea to decrease few m/s and try to get correct values by adjusting the departure time with 1-5 s steps.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt is difficult to get correct burn with very low TWR or from very low orbit. I use 300 km orbit and at least 3 m/s^3 acceleration. Even then I need correction after ejection burn and couple of corrections during course. I suspect also that there are some errors in orbit calculations. Possibly false SOI detections. My orbit have changed several times erroneously during coast when I have maneuvered other crafts. It happens when I go from outer planet to inner planet. Maybe about 2 flights per 100. These errors are typically not fatal except with Moho. I do not know if they are fixed or not, but I have not heard about it and trajectory mechanics seems to be unaltered since very long time ago.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T12:44:44Z","Content":"\nI know, I know, that was a joke.

There are 2 points where Eve crosses Moho\u0026#39;s orbital plane, 180 degrees apart. In my best missions I encountered Eve at the Moho-plane-crossing that is roughly 180 degrees from Moho\u0026#39;s perihelion. I figured that it was better to encounter Moho as close to the sun as possible so that the Oberth effect would reduce the encounter speed. However, that meant that a single flyby of Eve was not enough to drop the orbit all the way down to the Moho perihelion. You are encountering Eve at the Moho-plane-crossing that is roughly opposite Moho\u0026#39;s aphelion, so a lower-energy start from Kerbin can make it there after just one Eve flyby. I never ran all the numbers to prove which way is better, but my tests seemed to suggest that the meet-Moho-at-periapsis gives you a lower speed at your first Moho encounter. I could be wrong. My criteria for judging the first Moho flyby is the speed you are going at the moment you first enter Moho\u0026#39;s SOI, in Metaphor\u0026#39;s winning run that was 1584m/s (orbital). The higher this number the more times you will have to flyby Moho, correct your solar orbit, flyby Moho... Since every correction costs dV, the fewer you have to do, the better. Even at 1584m/s Metaphor didn\u0026#39;t brake into orbit until his 9th Moho encounter.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd yah, timing is a bear when dealing with Moho. After my 2nd Eve flyby I had to circle the sun 5.5 times before getting the first Moho flyby because I just couldn\u0026#39;t time the flyby accurately enough to get the Moho encounter right away. \u003Cbr\u003E\nHere\u0026#39;s a link to a picture showing the shape of my Eve-Moho orbit, so you can see where the Moho encounter is relative to its perihelion:\u003Cbr\u003E\n[url]http://i.imgur.com/SYZjn7g.png[/url]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor your comparison, I figure that Eve first crosses Moho\u0026#39;s plane on Y1 D14.22 (roughly opposite Moho peri) and Y1 D46.55 (Roughly opposite Moho ap) and every 65.486 days after those (Earth time!).

That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a lot of useful information, particularly the exact times of the Moho/Eve plane crossings. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s pretty hard to nail those down just squinting at the orbital map. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m basically doing all of this with manually placed maneuver nodes, using nothing more than eyeballing and node-twiddling. To calculate my corrections, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m referring to a big Excel spreadsheet I made with all the return times up to 12 orbits out for 22 different Moho-resonant orbits between 5:2 and 12:11. As to the speed at first encounter, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m definitely going quite a bit faster than 1500-odd m/s, so you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re right about that. It will be interesting to see if I can walk down through the many required encounters for less than Metaphor did. Based on my experience so far, a lot of the transitions from one resonant level to another could in theory be made for just a couple of m/s by dialing in each encounter perfectly. For the levels before 5:3, I was actually flying by Moho at around 30km, but to get to 5:3 I had to fly by at only 6km. Still, all my corrections to that level were about tuning the encounters and not about losing energy to get to the next level. That may change as I get closer in, but the resonant levels actually get denser as you get closer, while at the same time the amount of assist you get at each encounter increases. One other issue I will have to contend with though is the accumulated radial acceleration that puts my Pe further and further inside of Moho\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s orbit with each successive encounter. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m assuming that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s why Metaphor alternated sides going past Moho, but that also increases the number of encounters required to slow down. Starting at a place that is not exactly at Moho\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Pe can actually help you in this regard, as you can set it up so that your orbit processes as you lower your Pe, keeping it closer to Moho\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s orbit. Anyway, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll see how it all works out for me. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s really fun trying to do this, but it sure is time consuming\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6.[/COLOR][/FONT]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[FONT=Times New Roman][SIZE=3][COLOR=#000000] [/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PLAD","CreatedById":104158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T18:39:59Z","Content":"\nThe problem of your solar periapsis getting lower than Moho\u0026#39;s after each flyby is a big part of this approach, since it limits how low your Moho encounter speed can get.
