The regular jet engines are too weak to even complete the survey Kerbin missions.. they don\u0027t seem to be able to reach altitudes above around 14k under the best of circumstances. The turbojet engines just tear your ship apart at anything under 15k and above that you\u0027re left with next to no control because the atmosphere becomes too thin. The speed at which you burn up parts seems entirely too low, as I cannot get a spaceplane moving quickly enough in the 10-15k range to be able to make orbit without tearing the plane apart. I can\u0027t enter a steep climb above the 15k range with my jet engines because they lose control too quickly above that altitude and the atmosphere becomes too thin for a high angle maneuver like that - the engines just flame out in atmosphere thin enough to not tear the ship apart. I\u0027m going to keep experimenting, but as it stands I\u0027m not sure how I\u0027m going to get my spaceplanes into orbit.. /miss FAR.\n\n14km is pretty dang high for a plane to fly in the Earth\u0027s atmosphere.

From what I\u0027ve read most military aircraft can exceed at least 50,000 ft and that\u0027s 15km. Kerbin is smaller, and should have a thinner atmosphere.. but still, the gameplay issues are glaring. Most of those missions are best done with an airbreathing jet craft.. indeed, that\u0027s basically the only use of early game jets. With their current issues, the only way to complete these missions is to try de-orbiting rockets directly through survey sites (HA!.. Good luck with that) or trying to make dual stage craft that swap to rocket engines to gain those last 5 km or so. That second one is what I ended up doing, but it\u0027s not exactly the best solution.. especially early game."},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T01:45:26Z","Content":"One word: Parachutes.\n\nTry deploying a parachute in the upper atmosphere.
