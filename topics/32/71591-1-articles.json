We are a group of 14 students from Loughborough University, studying Aeronautical Engineering. As part of our final year, we were given a design project which required us to design a new, cost effective way to transport scientific cargo and astronauts to the Moon and back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Our blog (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://ltvgrouplborouni.wordpress.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ltvgrouplborouni.wordpress.com/\u003C/a\u003E) has lots of information and cool pictures of our solution to the design task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy are we here?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs part of this project, we\u0027ve been tasked with spreading awareness of the sort of work we do on this type of degree and the skills it teaches. As playing KSP was a reason many of us chose this particular design challenge, we thought it would be great to make a KSP mission of our solution! You can download the mission here( \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.sendspace.com/file/v5nnv1)(it\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.sendspace.com/file/v5nnv1)\u003C/a\u003E (it comes in the form of a game save), it does require the B9 aerospace mod pack though, We have a blog which we\u0027ve been keeping updated with our progress on the designs, as well as a twitter feed (@VIPER_LTV).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat was our design challenge?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe were given a project brief which tasked us with designing a low cost system to transport people and cargo to the Moon and back, to come into service 2035. In our scenario, there was already a small Moon base, which was able to turn water on the surface into fuel which we could use. We developed a two part solution. We proposed a spaceplane to take cargo from Earth to LEO, where it would rendezvous with a lunar transport vehicle (LTV). The LTV would only ever go between LEO and the surface of the Moon, where it would refuel at the Moon base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the mission?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the runway at the KSC is a spaceplane, codename Horizon, carrying vital supplies (in this case, fuel) for the moon in the cargo bay. At the same time, on the Moon, is our lunar transport vehicle, codename Envoy. It is your mission to safely pilot Horizon into orbit and orchestrate a safe rendezvous with Envoy. The cargo must be transferred over to Envoy, which needs to deliver it safely to the Moon base! The cargo module is fully pilotable with RCS thrusters, so Horizon and Envoy can be kept a safe distance apart during the orbital transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are we hoping to achieve?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe would really like to inspire the next generation of budding Rocket Scientists! We\u0027re hoping to give some ideas to anyone who enjoys playing KSP and would like to make it a career about what they need to look into. Also, anyone at school trying to decide what to do next, we hope to give some direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThanks for looking!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe appreciate you taking the time to read this post, we\u0027d be really happy if a few people would try the mission, read the blog or even follow us on Twitter! We\u0027re happy to answer as many questions as we can.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mipe","CreatedById":109421,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T21:36:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENeat challenge. I take it the Horizon is a fully reusable spaceplane?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat parts are you going to use for this? Exclusively stock or will you be using specific mods? I\u0027ll wager the answer is a yes to the latter, seeing how you have a water-producing Moon base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, what about a space station? It would make sense to include at least one in Earth orbit to provide storage and habitation. Neither vessels would have to wait for the other, plus the space station could solve a few safety concerns (in case one of vessels experiences technical issues, the passengers and crew could retreat to the station and wait there for rescue).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T21:37:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds very interesting!
