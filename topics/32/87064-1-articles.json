Inclination changes are also interesting especially when you understand how making the change at apoapsis is more efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll these concepts can be demonstrated very nicely in map mode. Map mode is ideal for seeing how orbits change when you burn different ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if I was doing this paper, here\u0027s what I\u0027d do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. learn about the concepts above. there are several good guides to basic orbital mechanics on this site and many here can answer the specific questions you\u0027ll probably have after reading the basics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Use KSP in map mode to demonstrate basic orbital mechanics, including:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E a. circular orbits vs elliptical\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E b. effect of burning prograde, retrograde, normal/antinormal, radial in/out\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E c. Hohman transfer orbits\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E d. circularization burns\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E e. inclination change especially as it relates to current velocity. A good spot to discuss vectors and difference between speed (scalar) and velocity (vector.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E f. You could also throw in surface speed vs. orbital speed and why rockets take off to the east. This can then lead to a discussion on relative motion in general and the whole theory of special relativity. You could use map mode to show how for example an orbit when viewed from the perspective of say the Mun is very different from the same orbit from the perspective of Kerbin. Map mode shows this very nicely. Hint: if you focus on Mun map mode will draw your orbit relative to the Mun, return focus to your ship and you\u0027ll see the orbit relative to Kerbin (if you\u0027re still in Kerbin\u0027s SOI.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think all this would work best if you do a lot of video editing so you can just show the parts you want and perhaps cut back and forth to some diagrams on orbital mechanics.

I am lucky enough to have been taught how to make presentations, lectures, professionally; something most people are just dumped into. Walter Cronkite is a fairly famous presenter and (I can\u0027t find any references so it may be apocryphal) was said to have been interviewed himself, to wit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQ: If you have to give a 5-minute presentation how long does it take you to prepare?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA: For a 5-minute presentation I\u0027d probably take two or three weeks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQ: Two or three weeks, that seems like a very long time!

If you have a long time - waffle!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a very loose rule-of-thumb expect to only make one point per 5 minutes. So what is your most important point?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E?? A communications-satellite is usually placed in a planet-stationary orbit so that it can always send and receive signals with the same patch of ground ??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- sub-point: A \u0027stationary\u0027 orbit means it orbits (orbital period) in the same period as the planet turns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- sub-point: \u0027orbit\u0027 means going sideways so fast you keep missing the ground as you \u0027free fall\u0027 towards it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- sub-point: The lower you are the less time you have before you hit the ground - so the faster sideways (around) you have to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- sub-point: Which means the higher you are the slower you go (orbital velocity)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- sub-point: So there is an \u0027ideal\u0027 altitude where the orbital velocity =\u0026gt; orbital period = planetary rotation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe LAST thing I\u0027d recommend is that you go bigger, unless you have a lot of time. To be honest I don\u0027t know what \u0022look more like a real launch\u0022 would mean - but then neither does your audience so don\u0027t worry about it (/handwavium \u0026lt;-ignore this if you don\u0027t already know it).

Have they \u003Cstrong\u003Eseen\u003C/strong\u003E (not just watched on TV) a \u0027real\u0027 launch?) isn\u0027t your point - the maths and physics of it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust because Kerbin isn\u0027t Earth doesn\u0027t change the problem - find an orbital altitude where the orbital period matches the planetary rotation.
