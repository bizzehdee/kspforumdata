I used the \u0022hammer\u0022 (better start using those neat nicknames) quite a few times and noticed its burn time is crazy low ! Is it just me ?

Everything was retweaked, but the SRBs in particular were nerfed far beyond that of anything else in the game. It wasn\u0027t just a tweak for SRBs. Think about this. A third less ISP, 50% heavier dry mass, and a third less fuel mass. That\u0027s a crazy nerf even with the atmospheric changes. You would literally have 50% more delta-V for the same fuel mass before these changes, but you still have a third less fuel to work with anyways\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T00:24:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 12:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Duban**"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T00:19:32Z","Content":"Ah, but let\u0027s look at it from the other direction.

I\u0027ve easily launched more SRBs than LFE engines in career under 1.0, and every time I try to get away from them, I wind up with something that underperforms compared to what I already had unless it\u0027s a lot more expensive.

KSP was rather frisky with doling out Isp to these engines, considering how TINY the system is. 0.90 was massively crazy easy mode. Actually, it still is massively crazy easy mode, but at least my rescue craft are costing more than 4600 funds now.\n\nYou now have gameplay diversity in that you have cheap, low-efficiency solids vs expensive, high-efficiency (but no longer quite as crazily so) liquids (T30s and T45s are like 1100 and 1200, more than even a BACC, and that includes bingo fuel). Before you had cheap, medium-high efficiency solids vs somewhat-expensive high efficiency liquids. Now the difference is more pronounced.\n\nActually I think they should have rolled in a lot HARDER on the nerfs, and then done an across-the-board EXTRA nerf on top of that. Then, any post-1.0 changes will be more likely to be buffs instead, which will be a lot more popular with the new community than additional nerfs."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T03:57:11Z","Content":"You\u0027re absolutely right!
