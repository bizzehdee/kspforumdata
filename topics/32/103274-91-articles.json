The more impressive fact is that for a little under a thousand dollars you can build one of these in your own house. It\u0027s a micro-controller, a magnetron, and a resonance chamber. The rest is copious quantities of solder and hot glue along with a generous heaping of duct tape.\n\nInteresting, though I\u0027\u0027m not 100% sure where I\u0027d source LN2 or LHe from."},{"CreatedByName":"Warshawski","CreatedById":9171,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T07:19:03Z","Content":"I\u0027m so excited that I can\u0027t sleep.
