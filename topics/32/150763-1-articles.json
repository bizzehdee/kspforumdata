Compared to No Man\u0027s Sky and Elite: Dangerous, Kerbal Space Program\u0027s planets are barren, waxy balls of nothing. Yet the moment I landed my first kerbal on the \u0027Mun\u0027 (moon), I really felt like a little green Neil Armstrong making one giant leap for kerbalkind.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile Kerbal Space Program is more obsessed with the technical mastery of engineering rather than exploring the far reaches of a galaxy, it\u0027s also been the one game that has given me that sense of adventure I so desperately want from No Man\u0027s Sky and Elite: Dangerous. Kerbal Space program cares little about what awaits me on its boring planets but invests everything in making sure that getting there is a struggle for the ages. Whether I\u0027m correcting orbital trajectories, plotting slingshot maneuvers between planets, or panicking as I design a rescue mission to save a stranded kerbal, each one has me painfully aware of the stakes. When I completed my first successful Mun landing, I felt like I had conquered more than the millions of miles in between but my own expectations of what I thought I could achieve. I felt like an explorer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith 1.8 quintillion planets to Kerbal\u0027s seven, No Man\u0027s Sky is desperately lacking that same tension. Unlike Kerbal, there\u0027s no anchor to ground the whole experience, no moment where I look back and see my homeworld behind me and feel awe for how hard won each and every mile I\u0027ve come has been. Without that sense of scale, that understanding of the enormity of things and the challenge it\u0027ll take to overcome them, I don\u0027t feel like I\u0027m stepping out into a vast universe. I feel like I\u0027m flipping through an endless coffee table book\u2014it\u0027s aesthetically pleasing but ultimately unaffecting.

At the risk of dating myself, seeing Star Wars in the movie theater when it opened altered the trajectory of my childhood. Soon I added other things to the repertoire - Battlestar Galactica, Buck Rogers, Lego space sets, Star Trek, Cosmos, various PBS documentaries, Apollo 13, From the Earth to the Moon, The Martian, you name it.
