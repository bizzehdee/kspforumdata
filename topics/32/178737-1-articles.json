I\u0027ve never caused an explosion through overheating.\u00A0 Aerodynamic instability... and even wobblieness in vacuum eventually becomes a problem, but autostrut goes a long way toward fixing it.\u00A0 The exhaust flames are definitely bigger than the hole through which they go, but it seems 100% efficient, not like what normally happens when some part of the craft is below an engine.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aeroboi","CreatedById":186653,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-05T11:15:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/190194-farmerben/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022190194\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/190194-farmerben/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@farmerben\u003C/a\u003E Never tried using a aerospike like that. The funny thing is, it makes sense (apart from the exhaust not melting the toroidal tanks)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA aerospike exhaust is expelled in a line like a funnel, call it a spike while bell shaped engines expel the exhaust conically out the back. So the aerospike exhaust fits through the opening of the toroidal tanks.
