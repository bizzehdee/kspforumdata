As I went larger it just kept burning more and more fuel, taking longer and longer. I am told its a flaw in the stock game. So I suspect that anyone making real use of spaceplanes is using mods. I never bothered to count but I expect I was putting those 20 tons in orbit for next to nothing, just fuel and jet fuel at that.

(whew!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah. The initial ascent has to be rather steep, approaching the \u0022launch straight up then circularize\u0022 strategy. It is not very fuel efficient on the face of it, but shedding all the mass of the first stage makes it more worthwhile than even the most fuel-efficient ascent with any SSTO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case of the vessel I posted, when the first stage burns out you should have a 60km\u002B apoapsis.

If it isn\u0027t, pitch up (slightly!) until AP reaches 69km. Then back to zero and keep it there. AP will still increase slowly; by the time you get there, you will be out of the atmosphere. When time to apoapsis is no longer decreasing, toggle the center engine (Action Group 1). Wait until time to apoapsis is at about 3 seconds, then switch it on again. Place a finger on the \u0027X\u0027 button. If you hit it at just the right moment, you\u0027ll be in a circular orbit of about 72km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe beauty of this vessel is that it has just the right amount of thrust that you can keep it at zero pitch and it will reach a near-circular orbit almost on it\u0027s own. Others need more convoluted maneuvers, like actually pointing them 20 degrees down at some point and similar shenanigans.

But boy, is it one helluva ride!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, when doing a tanker (that is, something that has to be properly deorbited anyway), I\u0027d probably stick with an SSTO (actually I use jets, but those are out of bounds for the purpose of this thread). For me, the first-stage thing is interesting when launching interplanetary vessels. Most of those can well circularize under their own power and only need a first stage to take them to altitude. For my most recent Jool-5, the difference in size between 1st stage and SSTO was tremenduous; and I didn\u0027t need to schedule a de-orbit burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that the first stage can be dumb: No probe core, batteries, reaction wheels, nothing but a handful of parachutes that you activate as you stage it away. And if you chose the right parts to land on, it can be very few chutes indeed. That\u0027s why I\u0027ve become so fond of the LFBs: high TWR, and resilient. They can splash down at 16m/s -- and by the time they\u0027re fully immersed, they\u0027ve slowed down enough that anything on top of them will be safe as well.
