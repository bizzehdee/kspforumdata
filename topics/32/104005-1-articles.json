Im guessing space dV of most engines will be similar to what it is now (except perhaps a few OP engines like the KR-2L, and 48-7s that are just too good in terms of TWR and ISP given their TWR), with possibly a few balance tweaks to improve a few bad engines, nerf some OP stuff, and make it more across the board balanced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, im mostly excited for that xenon tank, gone are the days of 100\u002B zenon tank ships (heck even my super small 10t SSTO has 20 of them). I hope they dont nerf bat the ions (i like them as is, especially ion propelled motorcycles/rovers, who doesnt like efficient high speed machines that dont need to drag overweight LFO anywhere). Still, nomatter what they do, i hope the game will be just as enjoyable as it was before (worst case scenario i can always load up 0.90 if 1.0 ends up not to my liking, but i dont think thisll be an issue since squad doesnt care about 100% realism, just playability and fun moreso).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wahgineer","CreatedById":59292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T15:49:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBurt the turtle?!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here I thought the only time I\u0027d see him was in American Studies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kylekov","CreatedById":74204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T15:57:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPardon the pun, but that\u0027s still up in the air. If the new aero reduces dV to LKO like NEAR/FAR then that will obviously affect just about everything.
