In stock, if it\u0027s anything like FAR/NEAR, you\u0027ll probably start turning at 75~80m/s, maybe less or maybe more depending on TWR. There will be no need to wait until 8~10km altitude to start turning because drag will be more realistic. Some stock craft will no doubt have to be redesigned for use under the new aerodynamic model, and you\u0027ll have to pay attention to your TWR as much as your delta-V when it comes to launchers. Interestingly, SRMs get more useful under a realistic aero/thrust model by providing initial TWR kick.

Back when 0.24 came out, I had quite a successful run at using Air Breathing Engines as lift-off / booster stages to my rockets. Lift off was decidedly slower, but these \u0022boosters\u0022 had fuel to spare for a long time.\n\nAnd to clarify the ISP / Thrust calculation - yes rockets will have less thrust per KG of fuel (an important distinction) in thicker atmosphere. The difference will be directly proportional, so if a rocket motor has 20kn of thrust with a vacuum ISP of 400, and an atmospheric ISP of 300, it\u0027s thrust on the ground will be 15kn.\n\nThis is the main reason rockets in real life have boosters - to provide a lot of extra umph on the ground when the rocket liquid fuel motors have lower thrust. As you climb out of the atmosphere the rocket motors really pick up some steam.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-21T15:55:00Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2015 03:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by EtherDragon**"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T15:48:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Pardon the pun, but that\u0027s still up in the air.

Overall im not expecting any massive changes to how much fuel/engines we need to get to x location from KSC. Im guessing space dV of most engines will be similar to what it is now (except perhaps a few OP engines like the KR-2L, and 48-7s that are just too good in terms of TWR and ISP given their TWR), with possibly a few balance tweaks to improve a few bad engines, nerf some OP stuff, and make it more across the board balanced.\n\nAnyways, im mostly excited for that xenon tank, gone are the days of 100\u002B zenon tank ships (heck even my super small 10t SSTO has 20 of them). I hope they dont nerf bat the ions (i like them as is, especially ion propelled motorcycles/rovers, who doesnt like efficient high speed machines that dont need to drag overweight LFO anywhere). Still, nomatter what they do, i hope the game will be just as enjoyable as it was before (worst case scenario i can always load up 0.90 if 1.0 ends up not to my liking, but i dont think thisll be an issue since squad doesnt care about 100% realism, just playability and fun moreso)."},{"CreatedByName":"Wahgineer","CreatedById":59292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T15:49:27Z","Content":"Burt the turtle?!\n\nAnd here I thought the only time I\u0027d see him was in American Studies."},{"CreatedByName":"Kylekov","CreatedById":74204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T15:57:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Pardon the pun, but that\u0027s still up in the air.
