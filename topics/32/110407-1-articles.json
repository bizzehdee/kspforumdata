For instance, radially attached parts produce the same drag whether they are fully exposed to the airstream or whether they are partially tucked in behind an oversized fairing or nose cone. Placing a 2.5m nose cone on a 1.25m attachment point is bad because the larger nose cone only increases the drag surface area while providing no other benefit. The large nose cone also adds mass, so it\u0027s doubly bad."},{"CreatedByName":"DarkGravity","CreatedById":143383,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T20:58:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Try it with the smaller nose cone that actually fits.
