I copy the entire \u0022Kerbal Space Program\u0022 folder from the steam folder into C:\\KSP with a name that indicates the version number and purpose of the install, e.g. just after an update I create C:\\KSP\\Clean_1.0.4 (or whatever) which is a complete copy of the install.

However, most people play KSP with mods. Having the game autoupdate with mods is apparently a recipe for pain and frustration, breaking mods at unexpected times and possibly even trashing saves in the process. My recommendation, having been exposed to both, is to lean toward purchasing directly from Squad. If you purchase from Steam, it\u0027s not generally clear that you can launch KSP without Steam, but you can. This can help you mitigate the issues associated with autoupdates.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"soulsource","CreatedById":110576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T15:30:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not the question \u003Cstrong\u003Eif\u003C/strong\u003E an automatic update will break your savegame, it\u0027s more a question of \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhen\u003C/strong\u003E this will happen. Once you\u0027ve opened a savegame in a newer version of KSP, it\u0027ll be a pain to make it loadable in an older version of the game again. Also, as we\u0027ve seen with the game-breaking self-heating bug of 1.0.4, there are sometimes updates that are so broken, one cannot play them at all.

Also, it\u0027s probably a good idea to keep a copy of different game versions around, just in case you want to downgrade (for instance if you installed 1.0.4 and realized just a few hours later that it\u0027s not normal for your batteries to overheat during the Munar night...).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"godefroi","CreatedById":101728,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T15:41:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne big difference is that when updates are released and forum users are complaining about overloaded download servers, Steam users don\u0027t notice because they\u0027re too busy playing the new version.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T15:52:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...\u003Cp\u003EMy standard advice for Steam vs. Store is: If you are already invested in Steam and like it, use Steam.
