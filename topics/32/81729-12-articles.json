I don\u0027t know where it started or why people keep repeating it. It\u0027s the worst attempt to defend non-realistic gameplay, because your argument falls apart completely the very second someone proves that it can be done, especially because it implicitly assumes that the only reason for not doing it is because you \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E do it. You know, I\u0027d bet money that if FAR didn\u0027t exist, everyone would say the same thing to excuse the stock aerodynamics system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are reasons to argue against realism on the basis that it is unfun, but don\u0027t sit there and say that such things can\u0027t be done as the reasoning. Most of what you\u0027re talking about can already be done in sims like Orbiter and X-plane, and they already had to tackle the same challenges that KSP would in implementing those levels of features. Code is code; it doesn\u0027t decide to melt if you combine it with a certain engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-27T15:41:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom \u003Ca href=\u0022https://twitter.com/Maxmaps/status/504652989072543744\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMaxmaps\u0027 twitter feed\u003C/a\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELooking at some of the modified work Porkjet sent us.
