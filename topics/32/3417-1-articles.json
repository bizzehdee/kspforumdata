(it was a very narrow margin)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUndetered Commander Jeb Kerman decided that as they were in a good eccentric orbit might as well as wait in it for the Mun to come round again. With the large habitation module beneath the command pod supplies would not be an issue. Several orbits later it was decided that if the next possible interception failed the mission would be aborted and \u003Cem\u003EAquarius\u003C/em\u003E would return to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapture occured in near perfect style, and a short burn from the Trans Munar Injection second stage engine put the mission in to an eccentric orbit over the Mun. Several circlising burns and Hohmann transfers saw the \u003Cem\u003EAquarius\u003C/em\u003E at a 10km orbit. Several landing sites were scouted from this altitude till it was decided to aim for what appeared to be a flat plateau. The Trans Munar Injection second stage was ejected as preparations were made for landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is were disaster nearly struck the mission again. For unknown reasons the second stage retro rockets fired irregularly and the exhaust from the spinning stage damaged the vital RCS fuel tank of the lander. Though the tank seemed to have survived there was no way of knowing if it had been weakened; if it ruptured during landing there was a high chance the mission would end in a fatal crash. A less determined commander would have aborted and burnt for Kerbin but Jeb Kerman was made of sterner stuff. Declaring that they could inspect the damage from the Munar surface, the crew activated the \u003Cem\u003EAquarius\u003C/em\u003E lander\\\u0027s engines and began their orbital breaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDays after they lifted off from KSC the three Kerbal crew of \u003Cem\u003EAquarius\u003C/em\u003E became the first to step foot on the Mun. Back on Kerbin people listened to that now famous broadcast. Having descended to the habitation module and donned their EVA suits the crew one by one descended the lander.

An overly long burn escaping from the Mun\\\u0027s sphere of influence saw insufficent fuel for the planned re-entry to Kerbin so a day of aerobraking orbits slowed the \u003Cem\u003EAquarius\u003C/em\u003E until it finally splashed down only a few miles off the coast of KSC, a fortunate coincedence after the trials of the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goran","CreatedById":500,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-04T22:16:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELanded!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan\\\u0027t get home...
