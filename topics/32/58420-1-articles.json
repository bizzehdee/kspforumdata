I should have mentioned that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SSTO uses a high altitude jet engine until it can\u0027t get enough air, by that time though, my apoapsis is higher than 80km so I coast and then circularize with a couple small rockets on the sides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SSTO is actually my SSTMARTK (Single stage to Minmus and return to Kerbin).
