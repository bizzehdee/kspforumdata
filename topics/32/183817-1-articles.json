I didn\u0027t save any pictures \u003Ca href=\u0022https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=810931898\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eminus the one here\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0and sadly never actually saved the modlist or the copy of the glitched game, so I\u0027m going off of my memory here, but here\u0027s what I remember.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLate at night, in late 2016, I was playing KSP for a while on my old laptop, which a few months ago experienced a hard drive failure so I can\u0027t get the mod list from it anymore. I was playing KSP normally, until I noticed that the ship I was trying to rendezvous with had suddenly disappeared from my sight, and the targetting indicator was going extremely wild. \u0022Well that\u0027s weird.\u0022 I looked at my speed and it had suddenly gone from its orbital speeds of 2000\u002B m/s to around... 100 m/s and it was telling me that I was over the surface of something. Definitely not right, because last time I checked, I was in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022High Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003EHKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, trying to get to my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022High Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003EHKO\u003C/abbr\u003E resupply station for the trek to Duna. That\u0027s when I opened my map. All the planets orbits had gone into a more square formation and kept flickering in and out(\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/Nhk1BPQxoHE?t=257\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ea similar result was achieved by Hazard-ish\u00A0in 1.0 when editing the aerodynamics, although I swear mine was more hectic than this\u003C/a\u003E.) It was a mess. All orbiting vehicles were screwed too, because they had all been slowed down by the atmospheres of flickering planets. A couple of satellites I switched to(when I finally could switch to them, it was a hard time trying to convince the game that no, I wasn\u0027t applying thrust at all) experienced \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Rapid unplanned disassembly\u0022\u003ERUD\u003C/abbr\u003E. upon loading in, and the one that didn\u0027t was already doomed because it was basically slingshotted out of existence for all the orbits cared. I noped the heck out and loaded the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E only to discover, to my horror, that the terrain was terribly warped and unrecognizable. I backed out of the game, and snapped the only screenshot I ever did. Before I closed the game though, there was something else. There was a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/80225-145-hangar/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehangar\u003C/a\u003E, I think the inline one, just... Randomly on the title screen. No rhyme or reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI rebooted the game a few days later, to see if it fixed anything, and the only difference was that the Mun was back. That was it. Kerbin was just... Obliterated off of the face of the title screen, and the graphics were garbled. That one also had a hangar, although it was on the game select part of the menu and it was a MK3(I think) hangar instead of the inline one. Only two kerbals showed up on the title screen. Trying to launch ANYTHING was basically impossible, and this affected ALL saves. Starting a new save just crashed it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo this day, I only have this screenshot to prove it, and I\u0027m frustrated I didn\u0027t get any other screenshots, because then I\u0027d have more proof. I dunno, what do you guys think? It\u0027s definitely a kraken, it destroyed my ships(and my save files), but it also affected the rest of the game. And what should I call this thing? I think it should get a name, if only for just how bizarre and mind breaking it was to me.
