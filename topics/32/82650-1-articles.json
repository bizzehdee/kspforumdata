It depends on whether you\u0027re simply talking \u0022vacuum\u0022 or \u0022in space within relative proximity to a star\u0022. The vacuum is the biggest problem of course, but in space you also have to deal with the radiation and high-energy particles as well, which would give you all sorts of nasty long-term effects even if you\u0027re miraculously saved within those 1-2 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022if supplid oxygen\u0022 is also a bit of a problem because if you\u0027re breathing in air at anything even remotely close to atmospheric pressure, your lungs would rupture because of the pressure differences between the air in your lungs and the vacuum. If the oxygen were to be supplied in another way or perhaps if you\u0027re breathing a high-oxygen mis at very low pressures it might work? Though breathing different mixes of gasses at different pressures tends to bring along a whole slew of its own problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, effects of being exposed to vacuum include: you body swelling up as your bodily fluids are below their boiling pressure (you wouldn\u0027t burst though, apparently your skin is too tough for that. You\u0027d just be in extreme pain as parameciumkid mentioned). Provided you didn\u0027t try to hold your breath (in which case your lungs would rupture and you\u0027d be looking at certain death) you\u0027d lose conciousness after about 10-15 seconds, water in your body would rapidly start evaporating out of your mouth and eyes and possibly other orifices. If you\u0027re in space you can add the solar radiation to that, giving you a massive sunburn and DNA damage, though honestly that\u0027s the least of your problems at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurprisingly, the cold isn\u0027t much of a problem.

This means that if you climbed to an altitude corresponding to 21% sea level pressure, about 38,000 feet, breathing pure oxygen would give you the same mass (not volume) of oxygen as if you were breathing normal air at sea level. Above that the reduced oxygen pressure would require you to have a restraining garment to stop your chest expanding and the oxygen would need to be blown into you under some pressure from a tightly sealed face mask. Pressure breathing requires quite a bit of practice in a high altitude chamber as it is an abnormal way to breath. At about 60,000 feet you get into the blood-boiling area and need a full pressure suit.
