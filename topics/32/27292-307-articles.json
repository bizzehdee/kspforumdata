Since I didn\u0027t bring my savegame with me, I started a new career mode game, this time with FAR and Isp Difficulty Scaler (what\u0027s the official acronym for that?), the latter set to the realistic preset. Well, I suck at rocket design, obviously, since all my attempts failed to go to orbit. Some rockets were promising, having an apoapsis at 80000m or so, yet they always ran out of fuel before the orbit could be stabilized. Nevertheless, I really liked the realism, and whenever I decide to start a new career on my PC, it will be with FAR, Isp Difficulty Scaler and DRE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing: Although my girlfriends computer has a (far) weaker GPU (R7 250x) than mine (R9 270x) the aerodynamic effects did not cause framerate drops on it, while my PC gets nearly unresponsive as soon as those are shoen. Both GPUs are using Radeon Southern Island chips and both were run with the radeonsi driver. Software difference: She is using Ubuntu (Mesa 10.1.0), I\u0027m running Gentoo (Mesa 10.1.1 till today, now updating to Mesa 10.1.4) I\u0027ll try a fresh install of KSP on my PC today and see if the issue is caused by something in my settings files. Of course there might be an easier explanation: My CPU has a worse single core performance than hers, and that could be a bottleneck in case the aerodynamic effects depend on CPU power...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jdsutton","CreatedById":74265,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T02:11:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are Korg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OA2NdLX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OA2NdLX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResistance is futile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TWKw9p2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TWKw9p2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"joekidd1992","CreatedById":110769,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T03:00:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWoohoo! 1st time to land on Minimus and land and return successfully!!!
