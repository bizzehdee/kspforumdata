Topped with a Science jr. with two Goo Containers, one thermometer and a radial chute for ease of planned Kerbin touchdown. On top of that the Stayputnik core with Commutron and four small solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe transfer stage got two FLT-400s on a LV-T45 and is junked by 8 Sepratrons after decoupling. The orbital insertion stage got a four-set with two FTL-400 on LV-T30 (for more power). The initial booster is a set of eight large SRBs and for the necessary control winglets and an inline reaction wheel are installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe transfer was without trouble, until I burned the last fuel of the transfer and fired the probes 909er. It started wobbling. Not bad at first but definitely worrysome. SAS was on, gimbal unlocked so what caused that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone guess?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStubborn as I am I tried a slow descent to maybe eek out a touchdown but with every firing of the 909 the wobble got worse. In the end the Mk.VIIa did the same as many before: it ploughed into the Mun. No surviving parts but a nice stretch of explosions over some hundred metres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen even some quickloads all did the same I decided to start a new probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame setup for Mk.VIIb, thanks to a slightly botched start with less fuel in the transfer stage and thus higher orbital velocity for the probe core to kill.
