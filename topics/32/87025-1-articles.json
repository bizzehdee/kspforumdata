Family life doesn\u0027t leave me a lot of time to muck around, at least not as much as I\u0027d like. So I\u0027m trying to decide if I should take a more serious attempt at 0.25 hard mode, or try to complete a major unfinished Fine Print contract in my 0.24 career, which is placing an E-class asteroid (I chose a 3600ton behemoth to lock onto) on a Kerbol escape trajectory. I already have a maneuver node for the first Kerbin slingshot lined up with enough dV in place, I\u0027ll try to catch it with a fleet of tugs for the next maneuver after that. Decisions, decisions....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T02:34:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to play 0.25 on Normal and just disable any features that you think make it too easy for you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
