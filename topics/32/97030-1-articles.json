It\u0027s also well-known that you can move said spacecraft from place to place to complete multiple contracts, as long as all the contracts were accepted before launch. I\u0027ve read some posts where an old craft could have a new part docked to it to complete a new contract, although that seemed to be a hit-and-miss, case-by-case basis as to whether or not it would work. But I haven\u0027t seen any mention of this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI launched a 5-seat lander attached to a lab/transfer stage craft, with a small satellite attached, to Duna, completing various contracts along the way, including landing a small outpost on Duna. After all those contracts were complete, I accepted another slew of contracts for Duna and Ike bases and satellites, which would go up at the next launch window. In the meantime, I went back to my old 5-man outpost on Duna and launched it over to Ike to plant a flag and do EVA surveys there, docking at the lab to refuel on the way. I\u0027m sure most players have noticed that the mission clock resets after docking and undocking a vessel, as it did this time. Imagine my surprise when after landing on Ike (ending up on its side; stupid EVA surveys were on a slope; see \u0027Like a Badass\u0027 in my sig) I noticed that I had completed a contract: for the 5-man outpost on Ike that I had just accepted!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI checked this by taking the small sat that I had hauled along and left in the contracted orbit, and docking it to the lab. After undocking I saw that the \u0022Launch a new...\u0022 line in the new contracts was checked. Too bad my sat and outpost only met the other requirements for one contract each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else noticed this, or had this happen? I\u0027ll have to make sure future satellites have a full slate of science gear and a docking port!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-18T03:53:32Z\u0022 title=\u002201/18/2015 03:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by StrandedonEarth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EI tried to find one of the other contract threads to post this in but couldn\u0026#039;t find one\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-18T12:41:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve not had this happen but I had been wondering if this existed. It sort of bugs me that I can\u0027t have a bank of satellites, launched as a single craft and parked in LKO, waiting for satellite contracts. So what I was thinking was launching a craft that carries a load of satellite bodies with docking ports and then when I need to do a contract I just bring up a probe-core with the relevant sci attachments and dock it to one of the satellite bodies. From what you\u0027ve said it sounds like that might be possible, but could be unpredictable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
