I noticed it when I was driving a rover I had on the Mun.. Almost predictable hitching every 10-20 seconds.. Then when starting the game it was slow to bring up the resume screen, then slow to bring up the saved game list, slow to load the VAB.. Everything was slow. I then also noticed a lander I had just landed on the Mun was mysteriously gone. It clicked with me then my save was most likely corrupt. So I went one by one in my tracking station deleting each flight (I had a backup save) until I notice the glitchy slow game play go away. The buggy game play was narrowed down to the rover which was one of the first vehicles of this save.. Copied over my backup, deleted that one flight and everything was kosher again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure others have experienced this.. How do you prevent your save getting corrupt like that?

It\u0027s called Jebretary (secretarial staff for your space program) and it maintains automatic version control of craft, subassemblies and save files. If either you or KSP muck up a craft or save file you can just click on a previous version and go back to how it was. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith save files (persistent and quicksave) and subasemblies a new version is marked each time they change. With craft it waits to mark a new version until you launch the craft, this way you get a version for each variation you deemed worthy enough to do a test launch. You can also force it to mark a new version at any point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also load a persistent files as a quicksave, so if you forgot to quicksave and then some horrible bug happens, don\u0027t panic, you can just load up the last autosave as a quicksave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebretary doesn\u0027t just take copies of files (which is kinda inefficient, especially for saves with lots of in-flight craft), it uses the GIT version control system to track the changes. This means it tracks just the lines of the files that have changed which is much more efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also has other features like enabling you to archive craft by deleted them (you can restore them later if you need), it tells you what parts (and therefore which mods) a craft uses and if any of its parts are missing, it can move/copy craft between different campaigns or installs of KSP and you can also write notes about each version of a craft or save file (useful when looking back to find the right version to reload).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72212-Jebretary-Automatic-Version-Control-%28backups%29-for-craft-and-saves-v0-3-3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Eget Jebretary here\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-24T18:48:58Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2014 06:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by katateochi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espeelong mistaks\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Russoft","CreatedById":111646,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T20:09:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elearn how to fix your save files, or make back ups.
