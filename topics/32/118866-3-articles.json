This is called thread safety. Threads have to be isolated, they can\u0027t talk across to another thread. This is where your 1 ship 1 thread/core comes in. The physics calculations for one joint may be affected by another joint, if that joint wobbled than the next joint would move too. So having those be multi-threaded would be hard to do, if not impossible. However, threads can be anything, anything at all as long as they can be isolated. So while one thread/core may be handling the physics, another could be handling the lighting on that craft, and another could be handling the deployment animation of the antenna (which I don\u0027t think is affected by physics?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo what does this all boil down to?\u003C/strong\u003E Well it depends on how isolated things can be as to whether there will be a performance improvement. Since physics are the bulk of lag (at least I think so) we might not see a huge improvement on a single craft. Though simply freeing up the core of mundane tasks to perform those physics calculations could speed it up. As you said, multiple craft could be able to be isolated into multiple threads since their physics in space shouldn\u0027t affect each other (unless they collide). The truth is I have no idea how KSP or Unity is programmed, so only time will tell, but I suspect there will be at least some noticeable improvement, even on a single craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-20T07:06:43Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2015 07:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T07:05:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeethoven\u0027s 5th Symphony was playing when I read the tweet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETalk about perfect timing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
