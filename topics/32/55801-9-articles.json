I am actually really disappointed with this development but then again, Squad really has the right to change its mind. I see a lot contradictions on this forum, some people want Squad to listen to the community while others don\u0027t want Squad to do that. I think this move is clear sign that Squad is still in control of its game and making what THEY want it to be. I presume that resources will return after the implementation of career mode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I have a strong suspicion that Squad is suffering from lack of innovation. There seems to be no more driving force behind the development of the game, I believe that this is because of the change in crew. Many of the originals have gone and disappeared and the new guys are not pulling their weight. Whether it would be communicating with the community or developing the game any further. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I personally think Maximaps and Rowsdower are useless in the forwarding of this game.The reason for this is that I think that their job descriptions are bit too much overlapping. PR agent and Community manager should have been consolidated into one job. A good game should be able to do its own PR. I personally prefer Rowsdower as I don\u0027t know what Maximaps does all day. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

He then goes on to say that if you want him to play KSP, write in the comments. As of right now there are a lot of comments asking to play KSP.

Squad released some teaser materials to do with resources a while ago, and then went silent on the subject. Some people seem to have been expecting that the silence meant Squad were busy implementing exactly what they\u0027d earlier leaked, when it seems like in reality they had a change of mind about what they\u0027d worked up, and have subsequently binned it entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I\u0027m not surprised at all. The lack of any real progress on the \u0022old\u0022 resource system shows they weren\u0027t really pursuing it with any enthusiasm. I do seem to recall that they\u0027d also publicly said some time ago that they weren\u0027t that keen on the old \u0022tons o\u0027resources\u0022 system, as it was too fiddly and not compelling enough. I personally assumed that iteration of the system was binned, and that we\u0027d be getting a simpler system (as I said back on about page 3 or 4 of this thread).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClearly others were expecting otherwise, and if so I can understand why they\u0027re upset. This is kind of the risk you take when you follow the development of a pre-release game really closely though. You might get really excited about features that get cut before release.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
