Problem here is that players may use the square wings as part of a bigger delta wing, so it will technically work in supersonic flight. Like how the Concorde had a massively large wing, made of many different shaped parts individually, but made into a delta shape overall, allowing supersonic flight anyway. I don\u0027t think we can apply a flat value of high/low speed efficiency to individual wings when it\u0027s the \u003Cem\u003Etotal\u003C/em\u003E wing shape that should dictate the overall lift and drag. The wings in stock KSP already respond to 2 factors which is their individual lift rating and the atmospheric thickness they are flying through. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d hate to repeat myself but I don\u0027t see how this is a\u0027 lack of gameplay choice\u0027 when the game doesn\u0027t physically hinder you from making streamlined craft with delta shaped wings if you wanted. Gameplay choice isn\u0027t the issue here, it\u0027s the soupy aero and infiniglide problems that are hindering our crafts from performing properly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut back to my original point, in the end of the day it\u0027s the triangular wings that have low lift and the broad square ones that have high lift in the crude fashion we have in stock KSP now, and I don\u0027t think that is fixed by assigning them individual stats for high efficiency and low efficiency numbers. For all we know someone could have made a highly efficient shape made out of square wing parts, but \u003Cem\u003Ebecause the numbers said so\u003C/em\u003E, it won\u0027t fly. This is something for the aerodynamics to decide how air will flow around the final shape of the craft and how I think it\u0027s probably best left to SQUAD to see how it all fits together because dramatic changes like this can make some craft un-flyable even though they represent their real life counterparts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-20T05:06:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, I agree entirely that the aero needs to look at the entire shape of the wing, not individual game parts.

That\u0027s a fallacy, since other more realistic space sims (such as Orbiter) aren\u0027t as popular as KSP.\u003Cp\u003EWhat the devs aim for is rather a sweetspot between realism and fun (closer to realism than to \u0022arcade\u0022), a stylized simulation. But people cringe at the idea of a stylized simulation, as if we could only have sims that are perfectly faithful to reality, and don\u0027t really understand the difference between a simulator and a simulation game, which is a gaming genre and not a learning/research tool. For these people, anything shorter than what NASA uses to train astronauts is \u0022arcadey\u0022, which makes me wonder if they ever played an arcade game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo solve the issue of reality one has to divide reality into two or more groups and try to solve the reality issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets take example of reality that should not be solved in game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
