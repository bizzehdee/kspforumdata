Long story short, it was too long and unstable, the engine was the in the back and it oscillated once I tried to actually move this seven launch docking creation. It was my first planned manned mission to another planet\u0027s SOI so obviously it didn\u0027t go as planned. I got cocky. So, I\u0027ve been conducting experiments to figure some things out. First I wanted to know if I could dock multiple ports along the same lateral point AND if by doing so it would increase stability. Second, can I make a larger lifter in order to send up larger segments (to allow for more strut points to increase stability) and I am only on orange tank and Mainsail rockets in the techtree.
