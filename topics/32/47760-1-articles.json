I got Jeb into orbit around Duna, the decoupled his rover\u002Blander from the return craft, and descended to the surface, enabling the SAS on the return craft before I left. The mission on the surface went almost to spec, except that Jeb rolled the rover, and had to walk back to the rocket. The liftoff went well, got into a stable orbit, and was a couple km from rendezvousing with the return craft. I switched to the return craft to point it\u0027s docking port towards Jeb... and couldn\u0027t. I hadn\u0027t given it any RTG or solar panels, and the SAS had drained the battery. Despite this, Jeb managed to dock, with fuel remaining, and got home in one piece.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027d think that after that, I\u0027d learn my lesson, but no, that\u0027s not the Kerbal way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast night, I started assembling a space station (using FusTek and Infernal Robotics parts) in keosynchronous orbit. I got my core module up there, *with* plenty of solar power, and some RTG for backup. Once it was in a nice stable orbit, I detached the rocket, turned back towards Kerbin to put a bit of distance between me and the station before my retrograde burn... and promptly ran out of power. So now it\u0027s in a very slightly eccentric orbit, that intersects with KSO, so it\u0027s only a matter of time before it blows back into the station, blowing Jeb and Bob to kingdom come. This means I\u0027ll have to accelerate my plans to get a tug up there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe it\u0027s time I printed out the checklist I\u0027ve already made, and kept it beside my computer.

The bit to get the tug back is going to be less significant, since it only needs to move the mass of the tug, not the mass of the other vessel as well. I don\u0027t have KSP in front of me here to see what kind of vehicle that would take, or even check the mass of the vessel that needs to be deorbited. It\u0027s got 14 FL-T800s, 4 of which are empty, and 7 LV-N engines. Those would be the bulk of the weight, so some quick math works it out to about 63 tons. But, I can use the fuel in it\u0027s tanks for the deorbit maneuver, so it wouldn\u0027t actually take any fuel from my tug, in this scenario.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T22:03:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI remember having a probe around Vall which got stuck in one position after its batteries depleted in the shadow.
