I had never seen the \u0022reach 11, 22, 33 or 56km\u0022 contracts before because I tend to just head straight into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m interested in how you guys approach the initial phase of career, do you try and complete each contract in turn, or do you go rushing off for the stars?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided to try both approaches and compare how much funds each way returned. So I did a couple quick runs of the start of career, both on moderate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the first one I went for getting into space quickly, just doing a small set of contracts; launch \u0026amp; 5km then escape atmo \u0026amp; orbit (just two launches)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the second one I did each of the altitude contracts (at least I think it was all of them); launch \u0026amp; 5km, 11km, 22km, 33km, 56km then escape atmo \u0026amp; orbit. (the 11 to 56k missions where each done as a separate launch, 6 launches in total)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn both versions I unlocked the same two nodes in the tech tree (basic rocketry and Survivability) and used exactly the same craft for the first two contracts (a pod with a booster that had 129l of fuel and a parachute) . In the 2nd career I then used the same craft with increasing levels of fuel for the 11km \u0026amp; 22km and for the 33k and 56k I added a 2nd booster. The escape and orbit required a different craft but the same was used in each. 2 stage ascent with a small orbiter that also had 2 goo containers (ran one goo in the atmo and one in space in each career).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn each career I didn\u0027t pick up any other contracts and I made sure to grab all the science that I could. I didn\u0027t upgrade anything or turn any strategies on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIn the 1st career \u0022yay space\u0022 ; I ended up with 113737 funds \u0026amp; 81.2 sci\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ein the 2nd career \u0022slowNJeby\u0022; I ended up with 184880 funds \u0026amp; 85.7 sci \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYay space took about 20-25 mins, slowNJeby took around an hour (I wasn\u0027t timing, rough guess). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the slowNJeby way can set you up with ~71k more funds and \u002B4 .5 sci (I did also have a higher reputation in that. forgot the check the exact figures). But slowNJeby was BORING!! Each launch until the last one was basically the same (I ran all launches bar the last at 4x physics cos it was that dull, and it still took almost an hour). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYay Space was fun and quick to get though, but 71k is not insignificant. Although at this stage I need more sci than funds. 4.5 sci is neither here-nor-there really, it pretty much comes down to funds and time taken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn balance, considering that time is money and I\u0027m here to have fun, I think I favor the yay space approach. \u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is your approach? \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t look at the effect of strategies because at this stage I couldn\u0027t really afford any.
