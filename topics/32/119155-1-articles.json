The trick is to hit laythe at the point where it is moving away from you (so to the right of jool and your trajectory). This makes you hit it below 4km/s, which is surviveable if you have enough drag and dont go too low. Also, just performed aerobrake at laythe with a SSTL (single stage to laythe) starfighter that didnt have any issues at all with teh maneuver. The trick is to point radial or antiradial and let your wings do the work, wings that arent in line with your velocity vector (and even fuselages) have enormnous drag, so much that you can actually end up getting a reentry without burning up if you dont level out at the right time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially the only 100% suicidal maneuver seems to be coming in to a direct laythe aerobrake if its heading towards you (speeds in excess of 6km/s are pretty much instant suicide). Jool seems surviveable too, although i havent tested this in 1.04 as its less dV to go to laythe directly, or if you prefer Tylo grav assist to slow u down, but jool has teh advantage you dotn need to go deep into it as its very wide and you get a much longer time to brake, allwoiung you to just graze the upepr atmo which according to my knowledge isnt instant vaporization. The one thing i really love about Jool is the fact that once there, you have theoretically infinite potential to alter your orbit with just small maneuvers due to teh sheer amount of gravity assists you can get. All id want in stock is faster timewarp, so getting to Jool doesnt require 10 minutes of wait at max time warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, this comes from someone that has never used airbrakes once since ive not found any use for them, extra mass and drag that doesnt benefit your dV at all. Stick to radial or antiradial (assuming it has a hull or wings and isnt a sphere, spheres are suicide to try to brake with as you cat really increase drag), and just come in not too low. Always going too low is suicide as you wont slow enough before u burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for Duna and Eve, its also possible and ive aerobrakes on these 2 a few times as well. Duna seems very forgiving, even super large warships have been braked for me without issues of them frying, and even takes some more trouble, but again, isnt excessively hard to brake on. Eve only becomes a major pain in the arse when you are trying to get to it from outer planets like jool or eeloo (not that ive ever done this), but from kerbin, the velocity isnt enough to vaporize anything at least from my experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-23T18:00:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022johnnyhandsome\u0022 data-cite=\u0022johnnyhandsome\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Tahoma;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#3e3e3e;\u0022\u003E Aerobraking at Jool, still possible in 1.04?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003EIt is still possible with the right spacecraft design, but it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s really tricky.

I found that it is possible under just the right conditions, but barely. The entry corridor is so narrow that if you miss the correct periapsis altitude by just a couple hundred meters you will either blow up or fail to capture. The design of the spacecraft is also very important. The spacecraft requires a large ablator and a low \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_coefficient\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0000ff;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003Eballistic coefficient\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E, i.e. low mass per cross-sectional area. A low ballistic coefficient means that the spacecraft will decelerate more quickly for every unit of dynamic pressure produced. This allows aerocapture to occur higher in the atmosphere and with less aerodynamic heating.\u003Cp\u003EThe vehicle I used in my tests had a mass at atmospheric entry of only 2915 kg and was equipped with a 2.5 m heat shield. This means its mass was less than 600 kg per square meter of ablator surface. I don\u0027t think that anything much higher than this would have a very good chance of survival. My velocity at atmospheric entry (200 km altitude) was 9783 m/s, which is about typical for a Kerbin-to-Jool transfer. For this vehicle and conditions, I found that the ideal periapsis was about 196,200 m \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B1200 m. On one attempt I came in with a periapsus a little below 196,000 m and just barely made it, having burned off all but 3 kg of my ablator (a few meters lower and I probably would have been destroyed). On another attempt I came in with a periapsis just a little below 196,500 m and failed to aerocapture (I actually got my eccentricity below 1 but was still on an escape trajcetory due to the patched conics).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough, in this example, a periapsis altitude \u0026gt;196.5 km would not result in an aerocapture, the vehicle would be significantly slowed down to the point that just a small burn would be necessary to finish off the capture. This might be a good strategy to use - a combination of aerobraking and propulsive braking. Obviously the higher the periapsis altitude, the less the heating and the greater your chance of survival.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve proven that small probes can survive a Jool aerocapture with proper design and targeting. Unfortunately, I think that large massive vehicles are a greater challenge. The need for a low ballistic coefficient means that a large craft would have to be equipped with an unwieldy number of heat shields.

To escape a planet you must increase your velocity to at least escape velocity. Therefore, when a spacecraft approaches a planet from deep beyond its sphere of influence, the spacecraft must be traveling at no less than the planet\u0027s escape velocity. As the spacecraft is pulled in by the planet\u0027s gravity, its velocity increases. At all points along its trajectory, the spacecraft\u0027s velocity will be greater than the escape velocity at that altitude. At the top of Jool\u0027s atmosphere, escape velocity is 9,547 m/s.

Then Jool\u0027s gravity accelerates you. Orbital velocity for jool is already about 8km/sec - obviously if you *slow down* to caputre into orbit, then at perapsis, you\u0027ll be doing over 8km/sec. If you put your apoapsis out to the edge of Jool\u0027s SOI, you\u0027ll be doing over 9km/sec at perapsis. As you *slow down* to capture, momentarily you\u0027ll be in the same orbit... with apoapsis right there at the SOI boundary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnything crossing into Jool\u0027s SOI going along a ballistic path, with a perapsis at or below Jool\u0027s atmosphere, will be going over 9km/sec when it reaches perapsis... even if the relative velocity before crossing the SOI boundary was 1m/s (or 0.00001 m/s).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I never did an aerocapture at Jool, I always used Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried doing an aerocapture at laythe with a probe behind a heat shield, it worked fine, didn\u0027t use much ablator either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I also had a survey scanner probe with no heat shield, and I find the tylo or laythe gravity assists for capture to be pretty easy to get as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYeah, the problem is that in order to make Kerbin reentry have a non-zero chance of reentry problems, denser atmospheres become lethal.

Eve would be much more forgiving if it had kerbin\u0027s gravity. Its not its thick atmosphere as much as it is its large gravity well that will ensure any object encountering it is travelling much faster than something encountering kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe underlying problem is that except at Kerbin, atmospheres are actually more like oceans because their densities don\u0027t fade away ...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget Duna. As others said, it does fade away at the top of Eve and Jool too, but that transition is quite fast and not at all like the rest.
