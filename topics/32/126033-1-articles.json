Otherwise, you need to do a resonance drift (set it up so that after 4 or 5 orbits you meet your target) or expend a lot of radial delta-v to shift your orbit in flight. If you have over-engineered rockets, you might just be doing hyperbolic transfers, where your orbit goes out way past your target but you meet in the middle. This is what probes like New Horizons did (with a gravity assist) to reach the outer planets in a reasonable time.

First of all, Kerbal Alarm Clock \u002B Transfer Window Planner. But after that I do missions to the Mun and Minmus to build up the KSC and Tech Tree, by the time the first Moho Window comes along, I\u0026#39;m done with most of that. I play with RemoteTech and ScanSat which adds more missions to do. There are other mods to add missions as well and before you know it you are going interplanetary. In my current game I\u0026#39;ve just launched all my communication and scanner sattelites to Moho as well as an unmanned orbital Science vessel and my tech tree isn\u0026#39;t quite done yet (but close).

If you are using Transfer Window Planner, it points out the most ideal window, but you don\u0026#39;t have to take it. Moho at the start of the game for example has a fairly cheap window in about 30 days and 60 days, it\u0026#39;s not the ideal, but it\u0026#39;s close enough.
