This has been hashed and rehashed for years by people contemplating first Kethane and then Karbonite. The questions/tutorials forum is full of such threads, and they all say the same thing. Do not bother with a refueling system within Kerbin\u0027s SOI. Ore is no different.\n\u003E It boils down to several things. First, there\u0027s the sheer time and hassle of it all compared to just launching what you need to start with. But on the fuel side, it\u0027s also cheaper to do that, too. This is because the heavier a ship, the more fuel it needs to generate a given amount of dV. Thus, moving large quantities of fuel (and thus a heavy ship) consumes more fuel than you save save by putting the remainder into another ship.\n\u003E \n\u003E Consider a fuel depot in LKO supplied from Minmus. For this run, your tanker doesn\u0027t even need landing gear so is just tankage and engines. From LKO out to Minmus surface is 1300-1400m/s. This is done with no cargo so doens\u0027t need all that much fuel. Coming back from Minmus surface and rendezvousing in LKO with the fuel depot can takes anything from 500-1000m/s depending on how well you aerobrake (and more if you don\u0027t aerobrake), but this time the ferry is heavy with fuel so the amount of fuel consumed is actually rather greater than what it needed for the outward trip even with dV on the low end of that scale. Plus whatever mono the tanker uses during docking. On top of this, unless you\u0027re adept at launching straight to a rendezvous, whatever comes up from Kerbin will have to spend about 300m/s on top of its launch cost to rendezvous with the station (plus mono for docking) to use any of the fuel from Minmus. There is also the sunk cost of setting up the whole operation, which will require many uses to pay off. So the end result is, you consume more fuel and spend more money, plus take a lot more time, doing all this than just flying out from Kerbin.\n\u003E \n\u003E There\u0027s also the question of what you\u0027d use an LKO refueling station for anyway. Anything going interplanetary is cheaper to launch with enough fuel for the outward trip than it is to bother with refueling in LKO. Use the refining stuff at the destination so you don\u0027t need to pack fuel to come home with. And even with SSTOs that can barely make orbit to start with and need to refuel to do anything else, it\u0027s still cheaper to send the fuel up from Kerbin than bother with the whole Minmus-LKO tanker system.\n\u003E \n\u003E The only way a refueling system in Kerbin is actually worth doing is if you luck into abundant ore next to KSC. That means you can build rockets with empty fuel tanks and fill them up for free on the launchpad prior to launch. Sure, you have to buy the rovers to do this but that will pay off finacially in a few launches, although it does cost time and effort on your part.\n\nStrongly disagree here, 1400 m/s with 4 LV-N, then 3-500 m/s to get into orbit. I now have 3 of the larges MK3 tanks with fuel in LKO, this is enough to fill multiple ships. \n\nStandard practice for interplanetary ships is to adjust them so they do the last 5-700 m/s of the 3300 m/s burn themselves and arive in LKO with just 2-300 m/s left. \n\nAs fuel is most of the weight I get away with an far smaller launcher who only has to do 2500-2700 m/s anyway. \n\nIts far cheaper and also easier to launch 80 ton to LKO rather than 200, worse as the interplanetary ships are rarely very aerodynamic \n\nMore I often use an reusable LV-N tug for the first 1000 m/s. Now this tug would need to either be launched as part of the ship as an LV-N transfer stage or refueled from ground. \n\nI have another miner on mun, its the old minmus miner this is only used for Mun opperations but let me jump anywhere on Mun. \n\nOnly benefit of not using LKO fuel depots is the extra steps. You have to do an mission to Minmus for every 2-3 large interplanetary ships and you have to dock in orbit. \n\nbenefit is smaller and easier to build launchers.\n\nYou are likely to want an small mining operation anyway like I have on Mun.\n\nits often smart to take the base on Mun or Minmus contracts and do an test run with an new base for other planets, easy 200k funds and you test the base over time in space before landing on Eeloo ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I really like this setup!!! Question though: Can you switch to a completely different mission and this base will continue to mine? Or do you have to be switched to this mission (and use time warp) in order for it to mine?\n\nBase continues to mine, as an bonus it does not use power then not loaded.\n\nOnly difference is that it will first fill up the ore tanks then convert to fuel and oxidizer. This is not very important except that you might run low on power then you convert ore at maximum capacity and drill at the same time."},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T18:24:09Z","Content":"1.0.5 Mining up and running :)  \n\nIts as simple as I could make it.
