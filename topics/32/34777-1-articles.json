I think the game loads a 2.5 KM bubble with the active vessel as the center, so your entire vessel is inside the bubble. However, unless you have NASA supercomputers, I doubt your computer will be able to handle a 2000 meter ship with all the struts to hold it together. I think Scott Manely did a video on this (space elevator), you should watch that if you haven\u0027t. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Why would you want to build a 2 KM ship, that completely overkill!!!!\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"7499275","CreatedById":70640,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-25T23:29:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright thanks and yeah I have a load end computer but I wanted to push it to the max and do it just for the reason of over kill \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yeah I watch Scott Manley, like him but I have not seen that video.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"elkar","CreatedById":57130,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-26T05:31:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou would need 5km\u002B long station since camera is focusing on center of mass, or getting it offcenter. but then it should be just that you dont see parts in the background.

It\u0027s limit to load vessels just for perfomance reasons, not fundamental limitation. If part is detached it\u0027s become a vesssel. Vessel is just loaded as whole if it in the distance(center or any part, I m not sure, but more likely it\u0027s center). If vessel is unpacked - all parts of it will be rendered and functioning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So nothing will happen exept bad perfomance because of big amount of parts will be processed and growing physics glitches, not because it so long but because amount of parts in interact and thing will collapse long before you will build is this big.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-26T06:25:01Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2013 06:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by zzz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"elkar","CreatedById":57130,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-26T07:07:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat makes sense actually, that game is loading whole vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
