The \u003Cem\u003EKittyhawk\u003C/em\u003E is a handful in space, and even more of a handful in the air - I had to put it into a nosedive to stop it spinning. And then I had less than a tank\u0027s worth of fuel to use to get it to land. I had thought about not bothering to put it down on the runway - but the \u003Cem\u003EKittyhawk\u003C/em\u003E is designed for Eve landings, and so has an awful lot of wing parts to take advantage of that. If it can be held on course, its glide characteristics are pretty good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FFSxS.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FFSxS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
