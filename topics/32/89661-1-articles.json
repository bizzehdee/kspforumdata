On the way back to the station, I ran out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESigh.... So I sent out my little rescue claw to bring fuel to the lander. That got my orbit a little closer, but again, no more fuel. No problem, I sent out the MEM (Munar Excursion Module). Docked with the ship, but yet again, I run out of fuel, just one kilometer from the station. Well, I still have two rovers left, and they have fuel..... I send those out. I now have a string of 2 rovers, gripped by a claw, docked to the top of the rover lander, another rover docked to bottom, with a Mem docked to the bottom of that. It was a ridiculous sight, but all Kerbals survived and returned Home.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Physics Engineer","CreatedById":128512,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-07T23:49:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Hm8E4SU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Hm8E4SU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EForgot the most important image\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Voculus","CreatedById":85437,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-07T23:50:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a win, right there!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xacktar","CreatedById":88876,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-08T01:34:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Katamari?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingPete","CreatedById":127384,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-08T18:00:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had a similar experience where the lander ran out of fuel approaching the Mun station. The intercept was less than 1km, so I just got the kerbal to gather the science data, abandon ship and complete the rendezvous by EVA. The errant lander was eventually intercepted by a resupply ship and brought back to the station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
