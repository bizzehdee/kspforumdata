Before contracts, you could easily complete the tree from the muns in Kerbin\u0027s SOI, although it involved a fair number of landings, but after career was released, you\u0027re pretty much buying three tier-8 nodes from a single mission at the end...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E In my last career mode game, I completed three unmanned (Eve, Dres, and Tylo) and five or six manned (Duna\u002BIke, Gilly, Pol\u002BBop, Tylo\u002BLaythe\u002BVall, Jool-5, and possibly Moho) interplanetary missions before finishing the tech tree.

I\u0027d almost call that a challenge to NOT complete the science tree while doing that many extra-Kerbin-SOI landings...\n\nI was playing on moderate. The basic idea was that there are no science experiments (except when required by a contract), no biomes, and no distinction between low/high orbit and low/high atmosphere. Then I relaxed the rules a bit, in order to get two crew reports (orbit/surface), one EVA report, and one surface sample every time I visited a planet."},{"CreatedByName":"keeper","CreatedById":124530,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T20:13:11Z","Content":"Thats exactly what I did, I did many contracts rewarding money and science, i went for minmus and my first recovered land from teh mun topped me up with my last batch of science.

In fact, it was far better to send a few missions outside of Kerbin SOI for cash rather than launch Yet Another Polar Satellite because cripes are those terribly rote. Same for parts testing contracts... I even gave myself 500K starting funds and another 500K fund injection a few play hours ago because ~grind~. Now that I\u0027m getting base contracts and setting up an EPL/Karbonite station on Minmus, things are picking up, but damn, were there a ton of really boring launches on the way there. Can\u0027t imagine staying totally in Kerbin SOI for the entire tech tree, I\u0027d go stir crazy and delete the save..."},{"CreatedByName":"Aragosnat","CreatedById":60487,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T20:53:56Z","Content":"In carrer with science in contracts. Just need to stay within Kerbins atmosphere. Sure one can go out and hit other planets and get a lot of science that way. But, all the science you need is right within Kerbin SOI. Pretty much doing all of M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and some of Minmus will net you all the science points you will ever need right now. \n\nSuggestion: If you want to start over. Do so with the mod that removes science from contracts and reduce severlly the science gained... Otherwise the only reason to go out to other places is to read the funny text they have associated with the science tests."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T20:58:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I just finished a career game and due to the amount of cash needed to upgrade the research center I finished all the tech in the tree instantly (had 4.5K science waiting) when I upgraded it to the final tier and managed it without leaving kerbin SOI.
