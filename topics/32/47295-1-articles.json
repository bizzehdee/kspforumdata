OK, great, but nearly as big a gripe is the pathetically small number of buttons on gamepads and the lack of a mode switch that precludes assigning more than 1 command to a button. Thus, when the number of commands in the game exceeds the number of buttons, you have to go through this horrific scrollable menu, an unspeakable abomination that, sadly, often finds its way into the PC versions of multi-platform games despite there being no need for it.

Once things like joysticks work, odds are the steam thing will also work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the current steam controller\u0027s image is suggesting of massive fail. It has rather few buttons, and they also are pushed inwards towards the center. Two of them require taking your \u0022primary stick finger\u0022 off its stick to hit them (most controllers concentrate these buttons on one side so you can keep one thumb on a stick for the majority of time). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks like it might work well for simple platformers.

Which honestly is quite important for a simulator type game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: You want evidence of the limitations the current steam design has? Look at the proposed bindings for Portal they have shown. The push-to-talk button requires you to STOP MOVING.

Apart from that the simple closeness of those buttons to the touch pads is likely to cause unfortunate accidents in which those buttons are pressed, Not good for KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Imagine if you will a launch scenario where you have your pitch and yaw bound to one pad and your roll/throttle to another, because why not, and your stage key bound not to the obvious middle space button but instead to the Y or B keys. You reach the point of the launch where you need to start your gravity turn but the craft is being a little skewed compared to your normal assent and you now find yourself needing to raise your pitch and yaw drastically to try and recover when suddenly your fingernail catches on the Y key and stages the rocket, or alternately you\u0027ve just gotten to a point where you can open the throttle and have perhaps decided to roll for a more cinematic shot and yet again your finger goes just over enough to catch the b key and now you\u0027re out of control with whatever throttle you had set.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eback to my main point though the second reason i think the controller will be a flop is that currently most games on steam where a controller can be used already supports a number of other gamepads which gamers have come to have their own preferences, Either with the Xbox or Dual shock style layouts. Personally I have a ps3 controller that i\u0027ve gotten a program for that lets me use it as a PC controller as well as a Logitech controller with the same layout and then a saitech Joystiq.

So, instead of being able to use all the wonderful features of our PCs, we\u0027ll be stuck using a gamepad interface suitable to the cheapest console.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIOW, I\u0027m diverging off topic here.
