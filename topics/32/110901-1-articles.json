I had several other events that didn\u0027t mention because I didn\u0027t trust them. \u003Cp\u003E- Ike was ejected from Duna orbit, but I\u0027m not sure what caused it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Eve and Kerbin interacted with each other, and eventually swapped orbits. I later realized that Eve\u0027s mass was too high due to clerical error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Mun was tossed out to sea. This was also due to Eve\u0027s erroneous mass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI plan to check my settings sometime, and run it again. Not tonight though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest reason I focused on the Joolian moons is because the results are near instantaneous, and because the speed of the model was limited by the interaction of those moons. I have to delete Jool\u0027s moons in order to speed up the model.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T00:21:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 12:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Asharad\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
