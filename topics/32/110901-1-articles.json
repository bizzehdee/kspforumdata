A white dwarf is plenty dense enough for Kerbol - in fact I think of it as a D\\_9 (There are various letters that could go in the middle, but the 9 is the important part as it determines the color, in this case yellow). As for the planets, perhaps Kerbol was once part of a multiple system that experienced some cataclysm, so degenerate matter from one or more white dwarfs ended up scattering and reconstituting into the current planets and moons. It would also explain how every single one of them seems to have rocket fuel buried in it.\n\nI haven\u0027t hashed this hypothesis out all the way though.\n\nMore importantly, the densities of the planets really don\u0027t matter that much as far as orbital physics are concerned. It\u0027s often said that if the Sun suddenly became a black hole, all the planets would continue orbiting unchanged. This isn\u0027t exactly true (they would be perturbed slightly), but the Solar system would remain stable and as far as orbits are concerned mostly unchanged.\n\nWith the exception of the Joolian moons, the orbiting bodies in KSP are separated plenty enough for them to affect one another basically as point masses as is the case IRL. My prediction is that if you built the system in real life, it would probably end up rather like the simulation cited above, with Jool\u0027s moons repositioning themselves but the rest staying basically where it is.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T22:21:06Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 10:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by parameciumkid**"},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T23:01:03Z","Content":"Alternatively, what if just the universal constant of gravitation G was much higher in the Kerbal universe?
