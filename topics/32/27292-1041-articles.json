Sinking something like 2500 science points (custom config, defaults are cheaper) into incremental improvements resulted in rapiers with 20% more thrust, nervas with 20% better efficiency and weighing only 2.1t, and cockpits and crew cabins with additional heat tolerance and 10% mass reductions. All combined, this resulted in a light (32 tons wet) spaceplane with a runway \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 0.72, rising very quickly to 1.

Back in the day, I\u0027d have sent them to land on Minmus - but Minmus is now a sub-moon of Rald, and it was to Rald that I wanted to go.

The manoeuvre did uncover a design flaw in Skyball Station however, since the solar panels were within inches of the Firebird\u0027s cabin when the docking ports finally clamped together. In future, small pods like the Dunaworrybehappy will use these radial ports, while the ends will be reserved for spaceplaines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven after the return burn and AP reduction, the Firebird still had a full km/s in the tank - which turned out to be a very good thing indeed, since that was the only way it could turn around and get out of its dive. Canards are clearly needed for the next revision.

Trusting the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E system, I manage to get the lander back on course, and shortly after dock with the CSM for a full transfer of science and all the resources the CSM can hold. Then I dive into a 21 km PE of Kerbin in one go, praying that the ablator will hold out, as I cannot do a gradual transfer due to supplies being rather low. A nailbiting ride later I can recover Bill and Bob.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe extra bonus is that the lander is now a probe and it happens that I have a Minmus satellite contract, requiring a materials bay! So after some more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E nudging, the contract is fulfilled with a net balance of 38326 funds, claiming it the yet most unlikely success of my current space program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t need a single picture for that.

Minmus is easy they say. Go to Minmus they say. Jeb, Bill, and Bob climbed into the Apolloesque craft. The flight was flawless. The landing not so much.
