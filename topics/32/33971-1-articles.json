The challenge will involve a part limit set so that most players will be able to compete in it. I\u0027m trying to find an average here. So, the question is: how many parts can you have on the pad before your computer starts to lag below 30fps. Don\u0027t worry about exact part count or fps. 32fps is approximately the same threshold as human eyes can see at (or so I\u0027ve been told,) so if you can see lag, you are below 30fps. I\u0027ll look at this thread 48 hours from now and use the average as the part limit in the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T16:44:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs I understand it, purely structural parts cause quite a bit less lag than engines and the like, so a simple part-count is difficult to judge from. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Also, as a side note, the human eye can see a fair bit higher than 32fps.
