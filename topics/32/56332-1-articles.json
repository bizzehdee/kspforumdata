Lifting it to Mun isn\u0027t the problem; I can do that easily enough, since I\u0027ve got an SSTO booster that regularly lifts 900-ton payloads into circular Kerbin orbits. The problem I\u0027m having now is that any time I make a turn on Kerbin, it shreds at least one tire. This might or might not happen on Mun, given its much lower gravity, but I\u0027m seeing what I can do to minimize the issue first. So for now I\u0027m sticking with smaller designs that don\u0027t need those giant wheels, ones that work fine even on Kerbin, but that limits the size of my rovers to maybe 30 tons. (The smaller rovers are fun to drive, though.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides the shredding issue, the large wheels have a real problem attaching to a curved surface; the tangent line is just too small, so you have to use a bunch of struts to keep the wheels rigid enough to handle the strain. If you look closely as the picture of my old version, you see I put flat plates on the sides for the wheels to attach to, with four struts linking each plate to the body, but even that doesn\u0027t work too well at the masses I\u0027m dealing with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI would\u0027ve loved to have seen that landed.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt wasn\u0027t that tough, really. On the old version, there were detachable booster pods placed at the ends of the two \u0022arms\u0022, drawing fuel from the main body. Once down, I dumped those pods. The real pain was that the design predated the flywheel change, so I had to steer solely with RCS, and that almost made the whole thing fail at one point. The new version uses flywheels and integral engines (enough to get TWR=2.0 on Mun), so it should be much easier to land.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-16T10:01:21Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2013 10:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Spatzimaus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vrana","CreatedById":79915,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T10:13:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy old Mun base:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/0Iz9x\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

No, I did the flight entirely manually, I just needed MJ to help with rover autopiloting. To be entirely honest, this was probably my favorite (and best) rover I\u0027ve ever launched. It crewed 16 Kerbals and I was constantly leaping and bounding over hills and craters with no real damage... Though, there was one point where I blew out all the wheels from going too fast. I slid over a kilometer until it finally stopped so a Kerb could get out and repair the wheels. That was fun... Though, through the whole mission, I don\u0027t believe there was a single hitch. Not one quicksave or quickload, no structural failures, it actually held together quite well, surprisingly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bizmar","CreatedById":95525,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T20:08:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI started using these wheels when learning to land on the Mun. They have some of the highest impact tolerance in the stock game which makes up for some of my less than perfect landings. You can come down really hard on these with out them breaking, usually breaking the connection before the wheel itself. They also stick out so far that they give you a lot of stability on uneven surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
