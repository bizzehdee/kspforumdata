I don\u0027t seem to recall this being the case with previous versions, or have I forgotten that much?; Out in space, viewing my ship, press the map key... then immediately return to the ship view again and find myself out of view range (typically 8 mouse wheel scrolls back in to the previous viewpoint). Doesn\u0027t matter what view mode (chase, free, orbit, etc), the result is the same.
