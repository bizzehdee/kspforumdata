Before you would open the chute, and it wouldn\u0027t be fully deployed, and only very minorly (is that a word?) have an effect on deceleration. Now, when the chute opens at 20km at 1.5km/s, it is still not fully deployed, but you go from 1500m/s to 50m/s in a second flat - STILL not fully deployed. The chute fully deploys at 500m and slows you to about 6m/s as it used to, but in NO way is the predeployment the same, that\u0027s absurd.\n\nThe difference, from what I can tell, is that the drag model didn\u0027t work \u0022properly\u0022 on the partially deployed \u0027chutes before. Now it does.\n\nThe problem, I think, is that the stats for the parachutes didn\u0027t get a balancing pass to make sure they worked realistically."},{"CreatedByName":"Frybert","CreatedById":97766,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T04:28:06Z","Content":"Well this also happens:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ol0H60NCLLk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T04:32:46Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been having an issue with warping while closer than 2500m of another vessel: The other vessel explodes for no apparent reason."},{"CreatedByName":"lost_in_space","CreatedById":142158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T04:44:00Z","Content":"This is something that may need to be fixed.\n\nI just purchased the game and have never played it before.

As I predicted, there is in fact a \u0027death wall\u0027 speed limit of around 900 to 1200m/s below about 35km or so on Kerbin. It\u0027s really poorly realized, too: I just had the fairing on a rocket blow off as I crossed that magic number, even though there was no shock heating prior to that on the rocket at all. A quick check of the variables for the heating engine shows that, regardless of altitude, heat builds up in a purely linear fashion relative to speed: you\u0027ll hit the same temperature at the same speed regardless of how long you\u0027ve been flying or how thick the atmosphere is. The heat radiation parts do dissipate this heat, but it\u0027s heat that should not actually be generated under many of the conditions it is generated.\n\nEDIT: And a new bug discovered along with that! When the fairing blew up, all control of the ship was completely lost. Even though there were two command pods and a probe core present, no controls responded at all. Everything inside the fairing appears to have been marked as \u0022dead\u0022 when the fairing blew up, despite the fact that it was all still intact and functional.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T05:11:18Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 05:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SkyRender**"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T06:24:11Z","Content":"You can add to the list (these are all minor):\n\nThe LY-01 and LY05 are not considered landing gear by the engineer report\n\nThe control surfaces do not maintain their deployed state on launch.\n\nThe Round-8 tank is in the Ion Propulsion tech node.
