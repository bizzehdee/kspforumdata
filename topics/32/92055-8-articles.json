The operative word is \u0022fun\u0022. If it is fun and difficult, you want to try harder, but if it\u0027s boring and hard, the you might as well be studying instead of playing. Most of the time, fun can only be judged by trying - stuff may seem fun on paper but nor when implemented in the game, and vice-versa. Personally, most of the changes proposed here seem fun to me, but I\u0027ll wait until I actually get to play the game to give a veredict.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-09T17:45:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vrana\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vrana\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThey remove features because they are \u003Cstrong\u003Enot fun and overly complex\u003C/strong\u003E (resources, the constant delay of proper aerodynamics, life support, communication channels) and then they implement stuff which imposes artificial difficulty (no SAS, no orbit lines...so they have a reason to implement RPG like elements to game.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*bold to emphasize ridiculousness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake a look at what the community is doing.

Squad is in a lockdown mindset, unwilling to backtrack on released features. Once a feature is done it is done. They might do some tweaking hear and there for balance, but they will not remove anything post-public release. Other than the old parts and KSC, which were just models, have they ever admitted a mistake and removed a feature? This is a common issue with startups. Any removal seems like a backstep, rather than a correction.
