This gave me the idea to try flying as low (~100m radar) and as slow as possible when deploying air drop payloads, and it seems to work. However, it can get pretty tricky (especially in hilly terrain), and certainly won\u0027t work for some of the heavier payloads I have in mind. Does anyone know of any plugin that can get around this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, for the devs: I can understand why debris should get auto-deleted if it touches down far away from the player craft, but why command pod/probe equipped payloads? If it works close to the player craft it seems like something the engine should be able to handle farther away.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceSphereOfDeath","CreatedById":69754,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T20:24:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn atmo all ships 2.5km from the controlled ship are deleted unless landed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s quite annoying I know, there are mods than increase this to 100km\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T20:26:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpaceSphereOfDeath\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SpaceSphereOfDeath\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn atmo all ships 2.5km from the controlled ship are deleted unless landed.\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s quite annoying I know, there are mods than increase this to 100km\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also applies to skydiving kerbals as I recently learned...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kilmeister","CreatedById":65062,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T20:47:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpaceSphereOfDeath\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SpaceSphereOfDeath\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn atmo all ships 2.5km from the controlled ship are deleted unless landed.\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s quite annoying I know, there are mods than increase this to 100km\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich mod, or what should I search for?
