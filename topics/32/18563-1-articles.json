You get it for free. But in reality you would need a heatshield or a other speacial design or you can do it very gently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts very challenging in reality. Because if you are to shallow it could spit you out on a total wrong course.

There are a couple of very strong advantages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst is the fuel usage. For example, departing from Minmus, if your departure vector is counter to minmus orbit, you will only be going about 270m/s Kerbin orbit velocity when you reach Minmus escape velocity. As result, it only takes very small amounts of fuel in a short burn to reduce speed to an atmospheric grazing velocity. It is so slow out there that if you wanted, you could completely stall all velocity and set up any orbital capture path you want around kerbin without too much problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond: Your kerbals always get home\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main disadvantage is you need to be lined up correctly and get the correct altitude for your braking to prevent complete re-entry. Too low and you don\u0027t get to choose landing location. Too high and it can take a few passes. If you want specific landing locations, you need to plan in some maneuvering to get a permanent orbit capture. This can be done by simply burning directly planetside to round out your orbit. My favorite altitude is usually the 35km altitude. I never dip lower than that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-12T13:15:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have been playing around with aerobraking sense you posted those numbers and it\u0027s been interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just did a direct entry from Mun where I adjusted my Pe to 7,800 meters and with an Ap of 9,700 Km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy speed top out at over 3200 m/s as I hit the atmosphere and then dropped quickly, at the same time my Pe lowered into negative numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that new Dragon Rider capsule I was able to land within 0.4 km of the launch tower, but that was just blind luck that I was passing directly over head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did use the landing autopilot when I saw that the KSP center was just below though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo fuel was needed for de-orbit, just for the last part of the landing as the Dragon has no parachute.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-12T14:19:11Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2012 02:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Tommygun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpsterMan","CreatedById":32671,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-12T17:48:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have never tried aerobraking before re-entry before, might try it on my next munar mission.
