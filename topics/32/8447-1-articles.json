I did have a long craft, actually a space station in Munar orbit. When a rogue LFE took out a solar panel, I had to return. There was a small escape stage, but it was designed for use on the launchpad. I fired it, and that did f-all, because I forgot to decouple the capsule from the station. The station was REALLY long, and I still had a little RCS fuel, as I used it to rotate VERY fast instead of holding down H forever. Once I had obtained a satisfactory velocity, I decoupled toward Kerbin, and then turned warp to 10000x and went to bed. The next day, I found myself with a periapsis of 60k on kerbin, and pulled the chute.
