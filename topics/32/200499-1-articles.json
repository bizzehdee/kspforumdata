That said, I\u0027ve seen a lot of people talking about having a \u0022wide\u0022 transfer window, or having a transfer window \u0022close\u0022, and I\u0027m not sure what that would mean.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now, when I want to go to another planet, I check the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E map, send a ship into orbit, check the transfer window planner, then - depending on my mood - leave Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E either at the lowest \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, or as early as I can get with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E on my ship.
