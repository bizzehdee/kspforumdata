But ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the issue. Many of the other parts need to be balanced with the aero. dV to orbit, thrust, landing, fairings, heat, etc. etc. So if we all just pick our own personal favorite atmosphere, it\u0027s going to be hard to do that. And then we have the mod community. Just like the stock parts, many of the mods need to be balanced and designed to fit the game physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example, I put the 1.0 aero into 1.02 and flew some test missions with a Mk1-2 capsule. It was more steady and controllable on launch. It was rock steady on re-entry, too. I started out by coming in from low orbit at a shallow angle, then progressively stress tested it until I was coming in with Kerbin-escape trajectories and a 15km periapsis. That last one burned off more than half the heat shield, but I was still able to wait until I was sub-sonic before popping drogues, followed by mains. HOWEVER, the 1.02 main chutes are too small now for 1.0 aero. I needed one of the big blue ones on top and four blue radial chutes (plus four radial drogues) to get the capsule landing speed under 9 m/s (survivable for the heat shield). That\u0027s a lot of chutes for just a capsule! Which means that if I want to keep playing with 1.0 aero, I probably need to rebalance the chutes again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I think Squad needs to just make a decision and call it good. Personally, having tried it both ways, I wish they would settle on the 1.0 aero. They made some good fixes for 1.01, but I think they over-reacted to the complaints when they changed the aero. (But my guess is that the 1.02 aero is going to go forward, because they are probably sick of people arguing about it and just don\u0027t want to touch it again.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T01:40:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELet me get this straight, you put the 1.0 aero system into 1.0.2 and are complaining about the balance of the parts in 1.0.2 with regards to the 1.0 aero system which you modded into 1.0.2.

Part inefficiency and part betrayal by mechjeb left my with to little fuel, and I could only return to kerbin, but not actually slow down. So, as an experienced KSP player, what was the sensible option?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerobraking of course. From an Eeloo trajectory, with the whole mothership, around 3800m/s. What could go wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurned out 30km periapsis wasn\u0027t as reasonable, tho. Slowly, one part after another, the frontal docking section started melting, while the central mk3 parts survived just a bit longer. However, as the first radial engine section broke off, it sent the whole ship into a brutal spinning motion, flinging that little crew section around like a toy, while one stressed part after another finally conceded to their fiery death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mothership did one good thing: It succesfully slowed the flight down, shielding my pilots just enough, so their capsules could survive the harshest part of the heat and aerodynamic forces. When the docking port finally broke off and their safeboat was tossed away from the dying ship, it stabilized itself after a few seconds of tumbling, shooting like a bullet through the atmosphere and somehow just remaining below melting temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it left atmosphere, the apoapsis was 400 km and the periapsis around 25km, which would put less strees on the capsule during the next, and final, reentry.

Just play the game, KSP was always a bit unrealistic and weird, so some small misstep during balancing won\u0027t ever break it. Everything in the game has its margins and possibilities to overcome problems with a little bit of creativity, and that\u0027s actually a great thing about the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your aerodynamics hack, of course it throws off the balance harder than every small issue. I\u0027m not sure why you\u0027d prefer that to continual balancing. If you want fullblown realism, then go for FAR, which to my knowledge aready has a beta. Just remember that mod also took a while to balance, even with it\u0027s straight adherence to realism. Did it kill the mod?
