Levelord: Unless you are going out of your way to replicate a launcher designed fro GTO shots (like Atlas V or Delta IV) an ascent simply does not take that long unless you *literally* burn straight up and then circularize at apogee. You can, in fact, make orbit *easily* in six minutes, you just need to be somewhat inefficient (i.e. have a high-thrust upper stage).

I encourage you to try taking off in a \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearjet at the same speed you do in KSP, and pitching up as fast. Actually I don\u0027t, since \u003Cstrong\u003Eyou\u0027ll die\u003C/strong\u003E. That said, since the consensus even among the die-hard realismers is that stock KSP shouldn\u0027t have that level of aero stress, it\u0027s kinda a moot point.

It\u0027s very true! An Orbiter\u0027s (aka \u0022Space Shuttle\u0022\u0027s) reentry takes 70 minutes. Good thing no one has to make that exact craft, or fly it that exact way. Ballistic reentries can be very fast, and even lifting reentries don\u0027t take very long. Note, again, that \u003Cem\u003Ethese are different things\u003C/em\u003E, and there are an \u003Cem\u003Einfinite\u003C/em\u003E variety of lifting entries. The Shuttle flew a particular track due to all sorts of reasons (that I\u0027m happy to get into, but is OT for this thread), and there\u0027s no reason you couldn\u0027t fly a lifting reentry that\u0027s not much (if any) slower than a six minute ascent. Once again, this problem would be solved if, y\u0027know, you actually tried it (as you assume all of us have tried the version of KSP *you\u0027re* promoting...). And if KSP had a reasonably real reentry model and aerodynamics model (hint: not uber-real, not perfect, just *reasonable*) \u003Cstrong\u003Eyou would know this distinction\u003C/strong\u003E, and not think that all real life reentries take 70 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. m4v: well, it\u0027s very convenient that a game can\u0027t teach you something unless it sets out to! Oh wait, the follow points (above) should...pretty much put paid to that idea. KSP teaches you lots of things.

This goes against my previous flight sim experience where you are supposed to take off on full throttle.

Besides that, if you didn\u0027t have the excess thrust to pass 100 m/s, how would your vehicle be able to produce the work necessary for it to gain altitude? After all, something needs to be able to produce the energy to fight losses to drag / gravity, and if drag is already eating all of that energy on the runway, there\u0027s no way for it to get into the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat sounds more like a mod conflict than actual \u0027realism\u0027 where both aerodynamic forces apply.
