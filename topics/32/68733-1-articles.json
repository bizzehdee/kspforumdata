I\u0027m playing stock atm but I will be running with life support mods soon so I\u0027ve changed my approach to be more like the proposed NASA missions. I have an unmanned craft that can capture and bring the asteroid into orbit and then I have an Orion type craft that brings crew up to the orbiting potato. That way I don\u0027t have to worry about packing enough oxygen and sandwiches as some capture missions have lasted a couple months. And also the risk to our little green friends is much less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what is your approach?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArmchairGravy","CreatedById":78526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-09T04:06:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EToo high of risk to send a manned mission for me.
