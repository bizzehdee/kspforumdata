KSP is a difficult game, especially for those not yet benefitting from physics classes at school (or who slept through them, like my foolish younger self). With other games, a player might ask how to improve their XP farming speed by 10%. With KSP, a player might ask how to keep their rocket from flipping on ascent without realizing that there are literally five different answers to consider, each with its own particular physics background. It\u0027s a different level of challenge. As such, nothing is more important than having a place for people to go to that accepts even the most complex questions and returns in-depth explanations, in a language that even younger players and non-native-English speakers can understand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we didn\u0027t have Gameplay Questions and its denizens, KSP\u0027s community would only be half as good.
