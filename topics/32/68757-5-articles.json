I\u0027ve read many of the earlier posts... (Sorry, too lazy to read the later ones!) and I think my limitations are that as long as it\u0027s not a tank within a tank or engine within an engine, clipping is fine. Granted, this is single player, so the standard is up to the player as to what they will allow. I\u0027m a big person on looks, and I can see half burying an RCS tank in the flank of a ship, because the part of the tank that cannot be seen, can be spread around in empty spaces.... I cannot suspend my belief when two same sized tanks occupy the same space. I don\u0027t clip engines at all, because it requires a suspension of belief (ruining immersion for me) to do. This is my stance on the subject; I won\u0027t enforce it on anyone else, or say they are wrong to do it...

The base of engines can overlap, but the \u0022bells\u0022 cannot occupy the same space or overlap.

Honestly, this is an immersion factor for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Clipping cannot be done through a debug menu.
