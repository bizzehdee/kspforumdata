It is important to note that none of these channels will reach everyone in the community, and therefore we take great care to ensure that important information is posted everywhere, or at the very least in places where one could expect to find it. That does not mean however that all information gets posted in full in every channel, since they don\u0027t compare very well:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EA quick development update may be placed on Twitter, because it\u0027s great for sending out quick and small updates to a wide audience; these updates are often first tweeted by the person in charge of them such as Ted and Maxmaps, before being retweeted by the main @KerbalSpaceP account. Imagine if you will that all these small bits of information would be posted in their own threads on the forums, then the logical complaint would be that there\u0027s an information overload because of numerous posts. Information would still be fragmented even if you posted them into one thread because people would respond to them and the posts with the actual information would require a lot of searching to find. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EA larger article on development updates in general or a particular feature will usually be posted exclusively to the forums, and then referenced elsewhere, since these forums are excellent for sharing large amounts of content. Think of the recent Win64 article by Ted, or the cargo bays outline written by HarvesteR. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThen there is content we post everywhere: the devnotes in particular. These notes contain the vast majority of development news, and reading them will keep you updated with what\u0027s happening. They are posted in full on the forums, on Tumblr and on Reddit, and are referenced elsewhere. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I honestly think that the current response to the Reddit being mentioned in the dev notes is somewhat over-the-top. As mentioned previously in this thread Reddit lends itself perfectly to get the information Maxmaps was after: not only does Reddit\u0027s format of up- and downvoting mean that the most popular answers float to the top where they can be quickly looked over, Reddit also attracts more \u0027new\u0027 players who haven\u0027t gotten much experience in KSP yet and can therefore share what problems they\u0027re running into. We\u0027re very much aware of the spread of the KSP community and therefore made a choice to ask this particular question on Reddit. What I will admit is that we could\u0027ve communicated this a lot better here, so that you guys would also be able to join in that discussion. It\u0027s something we failed to do and should improve on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy experience is that between the dev notes and the articles the forums still receive by far the most attention when it comes to development, and I intend to keep it that way: it makes sense. Keeping up with the dev notes and articles will keep you informed on 90% of the development news, the other 10% comes from other official channels. The picture that\u0027s being painted that we go to Reddit for all of our official announcements is objectively false. The mere fact that Squad is active on other channels than the forums, or that small bits of information aren\u0027t necessarily posted here is (in my opinion) not a reason to be insulted. We love our community, the whole of it. As mentioned earlier in this thread the things that are posted elsewhere usually find their way onto the forums very quickly, whereas the reverse is not always true. Examples of that are the weekly summaries of the KSP-TV Squadcast, or people posting Max\u0027s tweets here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-11T17:02:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KasperVld\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KasperVld\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...Reddit also attracts more \u0027new\u0027 players who haven\u0027t gotten much experience in KSP yet and can therefore share what problems they\u0027re running into...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EThis.
