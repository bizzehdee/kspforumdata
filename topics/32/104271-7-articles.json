The most important announcements etc.. are always cross-posted to everywhere (where applicable), such as the devnotes, the experimental announcements etcetera. Noone will miss out on vital information about the game if they follow any one of these channels. \n\nThat doesn\u0027t mean all content gets posted everywhere, because different channels have different audiences, for example the forums are generally the place where one finds the people who already own the game, are very passionate about it and have a lot of experience, whereas on say Reddit you\u0027ll also find a lot of casual players, and Twitter where you\u0027re also reaching out to an entirely new audience (generally speaking). We like to differentiate certain content based on the medium: Squadcast is on KSPTV because it\u0027s a livestream, in depth dev blogs about features are on the forums, a lot of community highlighting happens on Facebook and Twitter, and so on. Even regardless of where we post things, they\u0027ll end up here sooner rather than later: Squadcast summaries, people posting our Tweets... that\u0027s great to see too! Of course, we\u0027re not perfect and I\u0027ll evaluate when things do go wrong and see how we can prevent that in the future, but my goal is that all official channels get access to all official announcements. Aside from that, we can post different things in different places.\n\nI hope that satisfies your concerns, but if it doesn\u0027t then this thread really isn\u0027t the place to discuss that: we\u0027re here to discuss the #KerbalCountdown contest. I suggest we stick to the topic at hand.\n\n* * *\n\nWe\u0027ve shown two pictures now, and I was impressed with how fast all of you managed to put the pieces together, though I\u0027m sure the exact answer to the countdown is still unclear.
