Lots of options right off the bat with little parts that can still do a lot (broke atmosphere and survived on my 2nd flight. Could probably manage that 1st flight with some tinkering. In 2 flight I also had 230k in the bank and lots of science (100\u002B again easy).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the best part was my 3rd flight. I opened up the first plane mode as I had a couple of science observations to get under 20km altitude. Usually this meant launching planes off gantrys and landing with parachutes (we used to not have landing gear early on).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I built a great little plane in about 5 minutes. I assumed the little Jets would be low thrust so stacked on 4 (2 by the tail and 2 under wing). Boy was I wrong. 300m/s\u002B easy at the surface and huge range (only burned 5% of my fuel on a 50km flight including landing on the island runway for laughs. Short landing, quick turning etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s nice to see they don\u0027t cripple you early game.
