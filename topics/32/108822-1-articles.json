Even then I have a hard time imagining *finishing* the tech tree without going interplanetary\n\nI\u0027m using stock, abused polar orbits to get EVA reports above all the Mun/Minmus biomes, and got surface data from a bunch of them too. I just did a Duna\u002BIke return mission for a boatload of science, but I STILL need 8500 more to finish the tree"}]}
