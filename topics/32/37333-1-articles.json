And normally, with all the mods and whatnot, MechJeb is my best friend. I remember looking at a mod with a triple docking port and saw just how stable it was with the stuff docked to it. So I made my own using the parts I had. Then the trouble started. No matter what I did, I couldn\u0027t get all three to latch together at once even with MJ2. My solution? I learned to dock manually...completely manually. I\u0027ll post pics later tonite...or tomorrow morning.

You can even let MechJeb run a few to get started; watch how it sets things up, watch the navball, get educated. Once you get that down, docking huge things is more just a matter of patience. Learning how to do it manually will ensure you are always prepared, and MechJeb can take care of the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-16T19:39:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongrats, skyrunner!

I can get a straight dock most of the time with a single port, but using a quad-coupler eliminates any guess work as well as any minor errors increasing the more parts you dock. It just bugs me when one of the parts on my station isn\u0027t perfectly square with the rest.
