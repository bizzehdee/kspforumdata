Basically looking at the current feature list we need to look at our work in general and consider working on polish, bugfixing and balance in certain areas of the game instead of some of the new features we\u0027re working in. Going specific instead of going wide. We don\u0027t plan on stopping work at 1.0 at all, so we\u0027re maybe better off leaving some stuff for 1.1 and getting to work on the specifics of what can make the existing stuff in the game truly shine.\n\u003E We\u0027ve decided that the next release will be 1.0 because it accomplishes the goals we\u0027ve set up with the development of KSP from the very beginning, my question to you is whether you\u0027d prefer we try and add more features, or focus more on things like the aero overhaul, bugfixing and balance?\n\nHi Maxmaps,\n\nI would prefer that you focus on delivering a polished iteration of the current scope.\n\nI prefer to see a well executed aero-overhaul with in-game tools to help build better space-planes.\n\nA well thought out resource gathering system to round out KSP\u0027s career mode \u0022end-game\u0022 is much higher priority than new features.\n\nThese priorities are strongly tied into balancing career mode, so this is a must before other new features are added:\n\nCareer mode needs to have a leaner start - right now there are too many buildings at firs, and it\u0027s overwhelming to new players. The clear and singular focus should be taking on contracts, and building and launching rockets to complete them. All other aspects of the KSC are in support of this central goal and should be introduced later, as appropriate. Here are some specific suggestions:\n\nThere should only be one completed building to start with: Mission Control - the VAB and Launch Pad would be shown as \u0022under construction\u0022 with a tooltip or something that states, \u0022Visit Mission Control, these buildings will be ready by the time you get your first contract.\u0022 Walk the user down the strait path of get contract, build rocket, launch rocket, blow up - try again - eventually win by learning Rocket Science!\n\nR\u0026D - Under construction at beginning of the game, and cannot be used. Unlocks after the first contract is completed that returns Science or after the first successful recovery of a ship (since recovery of a rocket that survived launch gives 5 science). Automatically adds ability to do Crew Reports and EVAs while landed on Kerbin. \u0022We didn\u0027t expect you to be so scientific! Good thing they just completed construction of Research and Development. Head over there and see if you can put your Science to use!\u0022\n\nAstronaut Complex - Under construction (cannot be used) It should only become available after the first crew member dies, or after reaching a sub-orbital trajectory. On death, \u0022Oh my! We\u0027re going to need to hire more Astronauts, good thing the Astronaut Complex just finished construction!\u0022 or \u0022You\u0027ve reached space, and we\u0027ve just opened a new facility. Go check out the Astronaut Complex.\u0022\n\nTracking Station - Under construction (cannot be used) and becomes available after the player achieves a stable orbit. \u0022Now that we\u0027ve reached orbit, we have a new facility to track our rockets and solar system. Check out the recently finished Tracking Station.\u0022\n\nSpace Plane Hangar and Runway - Under construction (cannot be used) becoming available after the player unlocks their first Tech Tree Node that contains Space Plane parts such as an atmospheric engine and wheels.\n\nAdministration Facility - Under construction (cannot be used) until the player unlocks with with their first building upgrade. After all the other buildings are unlocked they get a message, \u0022The Administration Facility is almost complete, but they need an additional so-and-so Funds to finish construction. When you\u0027re ready, Upgrade the Admin Building by rick-clicking on it...\u0022\n\nIf you follow something like what I\u0027ve laid out above - all the core concepts of managing and using the KSC are introduced over several flights - reinforcing and supporting the central core of the game (contracts, building and launching rockets).\n\n**Point is: Balancing career mode progression so that the player is introduced to each concept one at a time, is the highest over-all priority for me. In order to do so, you need the new Aero model and resources present.**\n\nLastly - specifically for career mode balance, Strategies in the Admin Building need to be easier to initiate - costs of many of them are so high, even at a low commitment, I never use them.\n\nTHEN, in 1.1 I would like to see something like a \u0022win condition\u0022 in Career Mode, with some side stories fleshed out:\n\nWhat is the story behind the Mistery Goo? (Maybe each new Career Mode play through has it coming from a different place in the solar system...)\n\nResources - locating, collecting, and returning a certain quantity of a rare resource.\n\nThat kind of thing...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-18T18:22:08Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2015 06:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by EtherDragon**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T18:22:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E From MaxMaps and Harv replies on reddit (at least we had a post here too this time) they seems to be dead set on 1.0 as the next release. \n\u003E One problem with that feedback request is that we don\u0027t really know the current state of the features and what was fixed. The dev update give us a glimpse but far from the full picture. From what I understand the new aero is done and only need QA and bug fixing, but what is the state of the other features and what was fixed ? I don\u0027t see the point in expressing my view that X should wait for 1.1 if X is already 100% done and tested.\n\nAnd it really doesn\u0027t matter what they have or haven\u0027t done, or how much it has been tested. QA and Experimental testing will only get you so far, and with the major fundamental ways that the game is being changed for this final release, the chances of catastrophic-level issues getting released is very high. I have history back all the way to 0.11 or so and it tells me that the big changes always need a followup patch to fix things or make changes that aren\u0027t quite right. Before, it was just another beta release so it wasn\u0027t a big deal. But if you 1.0 patch lands with a giant thud and needs an immediate patch then you have a problem.\n\nEven if the patch was just:\n\nNew Aero model and attending features (Heat, Fairings, etc)\n\nTotal part re-balance because of Aero\n\nCareer/Science Tweaks as described by Harv\n\nThen that is a massive amount of things to test or go wrong. I can\u0027t think of any possible reason why they would want to risk that in a \u0022launch\u0022 situation instead of dealing with it in our newly minted beta period, which won\u0027t actually see any releases within it as it stands (Beta Than Ever being the Alpha/Beta Milestone)"},{"CreatedByName":"damerell","CreatedById":123074,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T18:34:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well, it\u0027s not an *entirely* unjustified fear.

For someone just starting out, this game is pretty damn good with tons of depth. Yes, it has bugs, but honestly not even close to a bad as other games I\u0027ve played upon release. Games have been getting buggier and buggier as time has passed. And honestly, games can be buggy on release and still be fantastic. Look at Payday 2 for example. Super buggy on release, and still is even somewhat buggy today and even despite some of the initial reviews being so-so, it\u0027s become a hit game. Game development is far more fluid these days.

Why in Krakens sake would you ask for our feedback when clearly you had your mind made up all along? Why do you so desperately want to appear to listen to the community just to say \u0022whatevs guys, we dont care and are keeping our deadline. We\u0027re just informing you we\u0027re not keeping our promises/announced features, so deal with it\u0022. It seems this is merely a desperate and amateurish damage control ploy...\n\n**HarvesteR**, judging by the drastic change in pace of development and releases since 0.25, I can only assume you are no longer directly in control of KSP development and that there are hierarchical/external forces driving this illogical rush for gold. Please let your community know what is the true reason for leaving Early Access, as being \u0022uncomfortable\u0022 is no excuse for defaulting on promises and delivering an incomplete product. You\u0027ve done an absolutely amazing job all these years and KSP is nearly good to go 1.0. However, to rush a game just before the finish line with many placeholders and grindy gameplay would be an incredible disgrace to you, KSP and your fans.\n\nTrust your community as we have trusted you so many times over the last years. Let us know what causes this idiotic push for 1.0, and we\u0027ll get a petition to Goya and Ayarza to delay the deadline so you can launch a complete and fun KSP true to your vision.\n\nIf not, please consider \u0022**KSP 1.0: shoulda done beta**\u0022 for the official release title\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-18T21:16:54Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2015 09:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yakuzi**"},{"CreatedByName":"Spartwo","CreatedById":58131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T21:04:04Z","Content":"Fleshing out what is there is would be the most important thing IMO after that Multiplayer is something which would massively change the game for the better."},{"CreatedByName":"DocMoriarty","CreatedById":57433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T21:07:48Z","Content":"Fix bugs and balance, thats what beta is all about.
