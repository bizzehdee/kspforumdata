Most moons are tidally locked to their planets, and have no appreciable rotation; landing on a specific spot is therefore pretty easy, as long as you can dodge the terrain. It\u0027s much more difficult to land on a specific spot on a planet, since they\u0027re rotating under you as you descend, but with a little practice (and/or a quicksave) you can get the hang of it. If the planet\u0027s got an atmosphere and your design is winged, it becomes much easier as well. The most difficult places to get Kethane were planets with no atmospheres, high rotation rates, and decent gravities, like Moho.\u003Cp\u003ENot very. The deposits are pretty huge, and there\u0027s no benefit to landing in the center of it. On airless low-gravity moons, it\u0027s not hard to kill most of your horizontal speed and all of your vertical, and then just drift over the surface until you hit the deposit you wanted before killing the last of your horizontal.

There\u0027s no atmosphere, so a winged design is out. Does anyone have any experience on how accurate the MechJeb auto-landing system is, and whether or not it accounts for rotation etc. and could land someone on a deposit? My experience has been pretty mixed -- one time, it got me down to just eight meters away from my specified landing point. Another time, it was almost ten kilometers off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, I remember reading somewhere that, in future versions, KSP would have interstellar, not just interplanetary, space travel. In that case, it would seem that a base around Eeloo (or whatever planet is the furthest out from Kerbol on future KSP versions) would be pretty useful, since it could act as a final pit stop to refuel spacecraft on their way to targets much further out.

But Eeloo\u0027s gravity isn\u0027t terrible (only 0.17g, almost identical to Mun), so the drifting method works fine; once you get close to the surface, kill your velocities a thousand or so meters up, then figure out which direction to go to get to the deposit you were aiming for, and just drift over to it. It\u0027s not a very fuel-efficient method, but the beauty of a Kethane design is that you\u0027ll just refuel as soon as you land anyway, so who cares how much fuel you spend on the descent?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn that case, it would seem that a base around Eeloo (or whatever planet is the furthest out from Kerbol on future KSP versions) would be pretty useful, since it could act as a final pit stop to refuel spacecraft on their way to targets much further out.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe not, depending on the exact mechanism for FTL travel they use. If all you need to do is get beyond a certain distance, then a fueling station at Eeloo would be a bad place for outbound vessels; they\u0027d have to spend a lot of horizontal velocity circularizing to match the planet\u0027s orbit before fueling up, and Eeloo\u0027s SOI is small enough to make that difficult. Plus, accelerating away from Eeloo to escape would take a lot of energy, whereas if they fueled up at an inner planet like Moho and then headed straight outbound, the Oberth Effect could be used to maximum advantage. But honestly, I\u0027ve found that it\u0027s better to plan your fueling stations around where it\u0027s easiest to get the fuel TO the station, and not worry so much about the ships that\u0027ll be refueling there. A fuel station around Pol is really easy to manage, as the moon\u0027s rotation is negligible and its gravity is low (but not Gilly-level low), and it\u0027s much easier to get to/from as Jool has a large SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is also why my fuel station is a two-part vessel. The big tanker gets placed somewhere nice and convenient, and the lander has two purposes: refining new fuel, and traveling to meet vessels that can\u0027t easily get to the tanker. When I did my Grand Tour, I\u0027d place the landers wherever I knew my main vessel would have problems with the ascent (like Tylo or Laythe), so that it could refuel quickly without having to travel to the Jool-orbiting tankers. Sometimes, it\u0027s just easier to plan things in that direction; sure, Eeloo looks like a good place to refuel on an outbound trip, but your outbound vessel should have more than enough fuel to get from somewhere more convenient out to the FTL point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T00:06:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Burke112\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Burke112\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat, and I\u0027d probably have to drain half the Kethane on Eeloo to fill it up. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethree words: Kethane Debugger\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M5000","CreatedById":57096,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T00:46:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t really have tankers, as I don\u0027t really have much orbital operations underway right now (most of my time is spent in the VAB, specifically, messing with staging, not even building) but I did just put up a 114-Ton fuel node, it only holds 6424 units of fuel, 810 of which can be directly accessed by a KSPX LV-NB which it uses to adjust itself.
