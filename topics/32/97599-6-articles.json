What if I want to build something like the old Otrag concept (see below)? Their idea was to use a simple standardized propulsion module (long and thin), with the lower stages essentially wrapped as layers of modules around the upper stages. The fairing, which is connected to the small-diameter upper stages, is wide enough to cover the width of the whole booster at launch.
