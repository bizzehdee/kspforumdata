I think I know what the problem is, an SSTO is not complicated enough in some peoples eyes anymore. Here is a tip if you do not like it you do not HAVE to use it, since this is a single player game being overpowered is kind of irrelevant honestly. If you want a challenge make what you want with parts to make it difficult as you want. My SSTO I built before .23 came out to see if I could build one, I got it into orbit using turbo jets and an aero spike. On the same token I felt there should be an engine that could cover both bases, though be somewhat lacking, to reduce the weight of the craft.

Replacing the center turbojet with a RAPIER allowed me to drop the two HOME engines, as its rocket mode was nearly identical to their effect.

Before you claim RAPIERs are overpowered, try making a non-RAPIER SSTO using a mix of turbojets and inefficient (not LV-N) rockets.

That\u0027s why I said on the previous page that you\u0027re often better off mixing RAPIERs with regular turbojets on larger designs, because you simply don\u0027t need as much rocket thrust as it provides and the extra weight starts to add up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spectrhz","CreatedById":69106,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T14:22:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s amazing!

I have been building working SSTOs for a while now, of my nearly 1000hours in KSP 90% of that has been building SSTO space planes, with SABREs or without SABREs.
