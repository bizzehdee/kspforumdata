KSP2 hadn\u0027t yet been announced and Making History and Breaking Ground were but glimmers in the devs\u0027 eyes. I was good enough at the game to feel comfortable with landing on Mun and Minmus, rendezvous and docking, I had several mods installed and had played around with planes and VTOLs a bit.
