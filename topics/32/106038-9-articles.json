Which brings me to the question: \u0022What does one expect from a 1.0 release\u0022?\n\nApparently the community expects something which is perfect in every sense, no flaws or bugs are allowed. So something completely impossible. Even a multi billion dollar company like Microsoft isn\u0027t able to create that (ever checked out the number of updates released for every windows version?). \n\n\u003E \n\u003E As much as I hate to admit this (and I consider Sal\\_Vager a friend), this is what I\u0027m seeing the community become more and more of. Maybe it\u0027s the influx of new players, but I\u0027m seeing an increase in the mentality that all of the game\u0027s bugs needs to be compensated by the player or that it\u0027s the player\u0027s fault that the game is not up to par, or that we should learn to accept mediocrity in a game that initially began as something great.\n\u003E I\u0027m also questioning why SQUAD would want to rush a game, and skip the usual beta testing based on a *deadline they set themselves*. We the playerbase were here as a resource for them to use to beta test during that period, they took the gamble of not having us put the new version through some vigorous testing ourselves and decided to push game through 1.0 without us. That gamble didn\u0027t pay off and I can see why the heat is on them, and I can\u0027t blame those that criticize them.\n\nTake for example the above post. It looks to me that merely the versionnumbering is the cause for the discontent. I don\u0027t agree with that and i completely disagree with all the harsh words which have been uttered in the forum concerning SQUAD, the testers and the game on this release and i still consider KSP a great game and not something \u0022mediocre\u0022. \n\nOn a final note, all members of this forum should remember that gaming is fun. A forum is a place where you can share the fun. It isn\u0027t the place to vent your frustration when you\u0027re pissed off about something. That only works counterproductive and removes a lot of the fun this forum provides. Give criticism like you personally would accept it.\n\n(Sorry for my ramblings)"},{"CreatedByName":"Silanda","CreatedById":64664,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T14:52:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Apparently the community expects something which is perfect in every sense, no flaws or bugs are allowed.\n\nNo, I\u0027m sorry but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s true. What\u0027s expected of a 1.0 release is a game that is functionally finished with only minor bug fixing and tweaking remaining, not something that is absolutely perfect in every way. That doesn\u0027t preclude development continuing past that point, and it doesn\u0027t mean that there won\u0027t be any bugs present, but there shouldn\u0027t be glaring issues like the ones present in 1.0 that then require extensive rebalance patches only days after launch. Patches that are themselves rushed and introduce other issues including a critical technical bug (memory leak). It\u0027s also fair to expect that end users shouldn\u0027t have to jump through hoops in order to workaround issues.\n\nThe end of early access and the version being increased to 1.0 signifies a lot more than many old time users seem to appreciate. It\u0027s not just another number, it is a statement that the game is now complete, something that new buyers are going to expect rather than the work in progress that we\u0027ve had until this point. The many merits of what is a fantastic game do not absolve Squad of all criticism for what looks like a disappointingly corporate launch, i.e. release at fixed date for business/marketing reasons no matter if the game\u0027s ready or not. It seems that virtually no-one in the community, or even the testers, thought that it was a good idea to release with so many changes without a beta release first. Squad went ahead anyway, and I don\u0027t think it\u0027s unfair to take them to task for it.\n\nAs for your last comment: \u0022Give criticism like you personally would accept it\u0022. I agree, and if I handed in a draft with blatant errors as a final piece of work because I rushed it, I\u0027d expect to get my ass chewed over it."},{"CreatedByName":"Engineer of Stuff","CreatedById":106757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T14:59:41Z","Content":"I completely agree with Kasper and Ted.

I would love to see more people discussing this instead of the already trite \u0022let\u0027s defend SQUAD from online bullies\u0022, I do believe SQUAD needs to learn a very important lesson with the v1.0 release about time management, Q\u0026A, scope, hype building and community management.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T16:31:04Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 04:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wooks**"}]}
