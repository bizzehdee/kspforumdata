As for getting them to the surface, you have several options. You could make an individual expendable skycrane/parachute module for each base module that is undocked and jettisoned once the module is landed. This is good for small bases without many modules. You could make a reusable skycrane that works for all of the modules, though it may be somewhat challenging to make it capable of returning to Duna orbit. You\u0027d also need to refuel it each time. Another method is to assemble the entire base in orbit (which removes the need for surface docking) and then land it all at once with a single descent module. This isn\u0027t always the best method though, because it can be difficult to balance the descent module, and it can also lead to inaccurate docking that may cause modules (and therefore landing gear) to be misaligned. You could also make a cargo \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E that works essentially like a skycrane but is more aerodynamic and therefore somewhat easier to fly back to Duna orbit. This last one is my personal favourite for Duna, because a well-designed rocket \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E can slow down mostly by gliding (though usually some thrusting is required to brake fully) and they also look nice and are a good use of the Mk3 cargo ramp.

Test them out before sending them too, either on Kerbin or by teleporting them to Duna if you\u0027re willing to use the cheat menu or hyperedit for testing purposes.
