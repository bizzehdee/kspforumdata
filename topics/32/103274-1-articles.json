This time, Kerbal Space Program is finally growing up. Our favorite little game about trying to make structurally weak rockets go higher than the last one has evolved into this huge game of Kerbal\u0027s grand voyage into Space.\n\nFirst let\u0027s take a look at the past major updates that brought us to where we are today.\n\n*0.7.3*\n\nThe game was just released. There was no HypeTrain yet, as almost no one knew about it.\n\n*0.13.3*\n\nThe game\u0027s features were rounded out enough that any more would be too awesome to keep free. The first Demo was born.\n\n*0.16 and 0.17*\n\nFor the first time Kerbals could leave their ships and step out onto the surfaces of alien planets and moons. The rockets became huge to facilitate the discovery of amazing new planetary bodies outside of kerbin.\n\n*0.18 and 0.19*\n\nThe Kerbal Death Count was too high, so the Kerbal Space Program settled down with more sedate options for missions. Docking stations together in deep space, sending unmanned probes out to the depths of space, and soon Kerbals could enjoy a calm sunday drive in their space rovers.\n\n*0.22*\n\nAlong with a new Space Center, Kerbals decided that just flying around in space aimlessly was not a good cause for exploration. They then realized that they could extend their quest for knowledge into space. Science was to be done! It was also the first time we started making a big deal out of the HypeTrain.\n\n*0.23.5 and 0.24*\n\nRockets soon grew too large and unwieldy, so newer parts had to be fashioned to remove the unwieldy side of that. This came at, quite literally, a price.\n\n*0.90*\n\nKerbal Space Program was almost done. All of the major features were in the game in some way. This is the departure station for our current voyage.\n\n**The Hype Train**\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/DYRDuOCKr2A?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nImage Credit: 5thHorseman and h4didact\n\nShe\u0027s undergone a minor re-fit, nothing too special. She\u0027ll probably get at least 1.12275 as ludicrously fast as before. She\u0027ll need that extra speed, too. The Experimentals for 1.0 will be quite a long distance away.\n\n**Confirmed features for 1.0**\n\nRedone Aerodynamics including shock heating and cross-sectional drag.\n\nLarge wings and Landing Gears for Mk2 and Mk3 planes.\n\n![3aj2F7U.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/3aj2F7U.jpg)\n\n![OdKmZ9i.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OdKmZ9i.jpg)\n\nKerbal Clamber (they can climb on things a bit better, not just ladders).\n\nResources!
