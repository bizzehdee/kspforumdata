Lol, that is a terrible idea. Lead, and in fact no metals at all, should not be used to shield the particle radiation inside any magnetosphere, that would simply induce Bremsstrahlung causing an increase in x-rays inside the vehicle. This radiation only needs to be shielded by wood, plastic, water (or urine built up over time is a suggestion i\u0027ve heard), acrylic, basic insulation (as was used in the Apollo missions). And when metal must be used on a ship, the best option is the least dense metal possible that could satisfy the need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the matter of shielding yourself on Laythe, I would recommend either a submarine/subterranian base which would cut down on mass required to take there significantly along with the mild/occasional use of medicines currently being tested by NASA that slow cell division and allow cells to heal from damage\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"toomuchbrew","CreatedById":57346,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T21:55:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022phunk\u0022 data-cite=\u0022phunk\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThey don\u0027t emit it (other than some infrared), their giant magnetic fields channel solar and cosmic radiation into belts.
