I\u0027m happy for whatever other ways to monetize their time the dev can figure out, this isn\u0027t a hobby for them, it\u0027s their livelihood.\n\nThat really depends on what they deliver in the future. As I have made clear on this thread I am personally very skeptical due to their previous track record of only making simple mobile games.\n\nBut that does not have to mean that they are incapable or bad developers. For all we know these guys might actually do a good job.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E As far as I know the porting of KSP to PS4 will barely affect the development of the PC version of KSP so even if the console version is a disaster it wont matter because most of us already play on PC and will continue to play on PC. The point of porting to PS4 is to give more players access to the great game of KSP and the extra money squad makes from PS4 Will likely go into hiring more devs that will work on PC KSP.\n\nThat really depends on how much money they had to invest and how much of an impact a failure would do.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Sorry if it has already been discussed but, what about PS4 version Mods support ?\n\u003E I heard about Microsoft allowing Fallout 4 PC mods to run on XBone version as well, so I am just wondering what is possible to do with these consoles regarding Mods.\n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks.\n\nI highly doubt it would be easy to convince Sony to allow mods. When large companies like Bethseda had issues, then it is for sure not going to be any easier for a small company like squad.\n\nAnd if they do allow mods it will be mainly mods that does not require a dll or any other code to work, so mainly will be limited to parts and other simpler mods."},{"CreatedByName":"megatiger78","CreatedById":114940,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T04:58:18Z","Content":"science. mining. scanning. moding. anything that requires left or right clicking a part in flight."},{"CreatedByName":"Francois424","CreatedById":98138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T05:04:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Maxmaps has just confirmed that KSP will be coming to the PS4.\n\u003E \n\u003E How do you feel about this? \n\u003E \n\u003E What do you think it will do for KSP?\n\u003E \n\u003E Discuss anything and everything related to it here, but please keep it civil! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Zild","CreatedById":111018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T05:05:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You kid, but if I could get a KSP app that allowed me to work in the editor anywhere I would pay real money for it.\n\u003E Or a KSP app that ties into the game itself as an auxiliary display, maybe showing map mode or something, kinda like Fallout 4 is doing with their mobile Pip-Boy app.\n\nI hate iPads, but I love both of these ideas.

And arguably KSP VAB/SPH would be easier than LBP for many builds, as everything attaches to a common node. It would no doubt be less straightforward than a mouse, but doable.\n\nand flying ships should be fine on a controller. Hopefully that will also feed back into the PC version giving us better default controller support - there are times when I\u0027d like to play KSP via steam home streaming on the TV in the living room, but can\u0027t because controller support isn\u0027t comprehensive.\n\nmy biggest concern is the physics and mods. The PS4 has a relatively weak CPU so would that mean restrictive part count limits or bad performance? And I don\u0027t olay with lots of mods, but at least some are important and I assume they won\u0027t be supported on console.

Maybe some of those people come to the PC version eventually, maybe they don\u0027t. But it increases awareness of the product, and brings more money in so the developer can continue to develop the game.
