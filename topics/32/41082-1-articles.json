Then you get a map of a kerbin, for the spaceplane. Showing you areas you\u0027ve been, and the three runaways on the planet. You can either select an already made spacecraft, or aircraft, if you want to go into orbit, there is a button in the corner titles orbit, if you want to go to a runaway, saw the second space center, you click on it, and the map will show what you have to do to make it there, or as close as you can get if you don\u0027t have enough fuel. For rockets, you can select orbit, and select how high, or click on any of the bodies. It will show you how much delta-v you need to get there. Then you go into the VAB, and build a craft to meet the delta-v requirements. Then after achieving orbit, several nodes are made, to show you how to get there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T03:19:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI hope mission planning is more nebulous, kind of like \u0022land a kerbal, and activate a negative gravioli detector, on Pol\u0022 or something.
