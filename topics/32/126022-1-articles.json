Something in \u0022quotes\u0022 means it was directly said, though I frequently don\u0026#39;t bother with that. [brackets] are those rare times where the accent barrier keeps me from understanding something, or I want to say an aside about something Dr.Turkey said about KSP development. [COLOR=\u0022#008000\u0022]Green text is descriptions of what the good Doctor is doing in the game, with asides and commentary by me where I feel the desire[/COLOR]. If you want to watch the episode yourself, you can find it at [url]http://www.twitch.tv/ksptv/profile/past_broadcasts[/url]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSquadcast was just over an hour.\u003Cbr\u003E\n0:00\u003Cbr\u003E\nKasper co-hosted with Dr Turkey.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDr. Turkey will not put his mug on the cam.\u003Cbr\u003E\nD.T. seems to be a self-censoring swearer. Which I can FREAKING appreciate.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe actual video started at 7:00\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey\u0026#39;re in the office, and there are noises in the background.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe\u0026#39;s a Sips fan. As am I. He was infuriated by Sips\u0026#39; KSP play. As was I.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=\u0022#008000\u0022]He starts a fresh Career Mode on Moderate difficulty.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe was going to do Science but the chat got him to switch.\u003Cbr\u003E\nGood choice, IMO. You are showcasing the game after all.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe takes some contracts and heads to the VAB.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTypical first ship.[/COLOR]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n15:00\u003Cbr\u003E\nNot much to disclose today.\u003Cbr\u003E\nQ: How much have you played?\u003Cbr\u003E\nA: A lot, \u0022I\u0026#39;m just supremely bad at games.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=\u0022#008000\u0022]He launches, without having done his launchpad science.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe does no science in the air either.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe also ALMOST fails to pull the chute. He does so about 1700m off the ground, accelerating downward to 235m/s.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe slows down to 10m/s at about 160m :D\u003Cbr\u003E\nTHEN he does the science. And recovers.[/COLOR]\u003Cbr\u003E\nQ: How did QA miss the fairing collision?\u003Cbr\u003E\nA: (Kasper) QA teams and Experimental test teams focus on a lot of things. And they\u0026#39;re small groups. And they are volunteers. If 50 people are testing things like OS specific functions they literally can\u0026#39;t test everything.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=\u0022#008000\u0022]He got his 2 contracts, so he takes \u0022Escape the atmosphere\u0022 and \u0022Haul a parachute into flight,\u0022 which is one of the new ones.[/COLOR]\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey discuss KasperVld\u0026#39;s username. Which FTR I thought was \u0022KasperVID\u0022 for a surprisingly long time.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=\u0022#008000\u0022]New lanch, crazy ship with way too many solids. 3 RT-10s and an RT-5.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe stages the 3 RT-10s, an dwhen they burn out he\u0026#39;s at 10km going 840m/s.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe RT-5 gets him to an Ap of about 62km, so no \u0022space\u0022 contract.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe was going too fast for the parachute contract, so he didn\u0026#39;t get it either.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd he\u0026#39;s plummeting to the ground.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLuckily the boosters had so much drag he slowed down just fine.[/COLOR]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n30:00\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=\u0022#008000\u0022]The chute flips him around but he\u0026#39;s otherwise fine.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd he even got the parachute contract.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe opts to get more solid rockets.\u003Cbr\u003E\nRocket #3 uses a LF upprer stage and a decoupler to make the stage an actual stage.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe also has a LF lower stage.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe \u0022launches.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe throttles all the way up, and actually launches.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe reaches SPAAAAAAAAAACE.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe\u0026#39;s going 1.8km/s straight up.[/COLOR]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n45:00\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=\u0022#008000\u0022]He uses time warp, goes too fast, tops out at about 400km, falls back, and hits atmo at the same 1.8km/s. Then he ditches the upper stage, leaving just the pod, 2 goos, and a very scared-looking parachute.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis could be a problem.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt is a problem. At 19km the pod explodes, killing Jeb.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNathan in chat suggests he launch more sideways. Good idea :D\u003Cbr\u003E\nPhoicca Kerman is hired.[/COLOR]\u003Cbr\u003E\nDr. Turkey takes a phone call, about 2:30. Sadly he needs to get back to the call. Though there are still over 10 minutes left in the video.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=\u0022#008000\u0022]He launches Phoicca, tilts a bit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe sees fire, panics, flips the ship over, and THEN throttles down.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe still manages to reach space, though the contract was already gotten when Jeb died.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe does get some science though.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe ship comes back down at a sedate speed, and with plenty of fuel to slow down...[/COLOR]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1:00:00\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=\u0022#008000\u0022]He kicks away the fuel he had brought down, and panics because he didn\u0026#39;t burn. Should be fine though.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe has a habit of closing the navball so I can\u0026#39;t tell the speed very well, but he\u0026#39;s fine.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPhoicca splashes down with no issues.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe buys heat shields and radial decouplers.[/COLOR]\u003Cbr\u003E\nSquadcast will always be Thursdays at 6pm Eastern.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNote: I\u0026#39;ll not be able to recap them until Friday, hopefully afternoon but possibly evening, or Saturday even if I\u0026#39;m busy.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T00:05:39Z","Content":"\nThursday at 6pm?
