It\u0027s not really designed for laptops, although Squad do what they can to make it playable. Laptops almost always have terrible cooling systems due to their compact size which severely restricts airflow, making the processor and graphics card overheat far more easily. As a result, laptop hardware has to be limited such that it doesn\u0027t use too much power or simply overheat from the strain of trying to process all the data. One thing you can try is changing the power options to High Performance whilst you play KSP. It might help a little.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fastfishy2","CreatedById":58118,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-10T00:54:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks guys, thanks for the help. i am now scared about the highway blockage inside my laptop \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HGGundamReviews","CreatedById":57099,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-10T01:05:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing to look. If you have the ISA Mapsat Mod installed, Turn off its mapping functions when you\u0027re not actually flying a mapping probe. It can cause lag because the plugin is active. Also turn it off before you launch something with a ISA mapping dish installed as it will cause the game to lag and stutter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
