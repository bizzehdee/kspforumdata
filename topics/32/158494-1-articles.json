He\u0027s set forth on an adventure to explore Europe and Asia, and hasn\u0027t decided yet where he will settle down when his roaming ends.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSome of you know Sal_vager as one of the forum\u0027s more active moderators. Some of you know him as a helpful person who is good at diagnosing problems players are having with the game\u0027s software, and giving advice for fixes and workarounds. Some of you know him as one of the QA testers who helps find, diagnose, and fix game bugs for Squad. Many of you will recognize him as the guy who collects and posts \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/158474-threads-of-the-month-april/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EThreads of the Month\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut those are only his most visible roles. Some of you who look more closely will have noticed that he\u0027s also one of our forum admins who finds and fixes problems with the forum software. He collected \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/129403-links-to-common-suggestions/%C2%A0\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethe Common Suggestions thread\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0He wrote the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/22919-challenge-submission-guide/%C2%A0\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChallenge Submission Guide\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0He wrote the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/13107-the-good-conduct-guide/%C2%A0\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EGood Conduct Guide\u003C/a\u003E. And several other helpful stickies and announcements.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut what the public cannot see is that Sal_vager has also been one of our most senior and most dedicated moderators since the early days of the forum. He\u0027s the guy who recruited many members of the moderation team, and taught us how to moderate, and he frequently started discussions within the team about how we can better serve the community. He has maintained, updated, and just plain personally written a significant proportion of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/guidelines/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethe forum rules\u003C/a\u003E. He\u0027s been our institutional memory of what has already been tried and worked or didn\u0027t work. When we moderators disagreed among ourselves, Sal was the tie-breaker. He was the experienced old hand to whom we handed off our thorniest moderation issues, knowing he\u0027d come back to us with advice and/or a ruling which made sense and was in the interests of the community. We always knew that when things got bad on the forum, he had our backs.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s no exaggeration to say that when Sal_vager leaves, it will take three or four of us to keep up with all that he has been doing by himself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd as for myself personally, Sal_vager was the person who good-naturedly bugged and cajoled me into joining the moderation team. I am not a very assertive person and I\u0027m troubled by clashes and confrontations, so I was resistant to the idea of being a moderator. But after Sal dragged me, kicking and screaming, onto the team, it has turned out to be one of the best experiences I\u0027ve ever had. Helping on the forum has been one of my primary pastimes for the last three years, and the other moderators have become a circle of friends with whom I chat and joke every day. And one of those friends is Sal_vager, who I have bugged with questions, argued with, teased, and played games with. I personally will miss you terribly, Sal, and the KSP forum will never be the same without you, but you\u0027ve made this a better place, and we wish you well as you head off to new adventures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn recognition of your efforts here, though, your name will not be removed from the list of moderators. You will remain an honorary moderator as long as this forum exists.\u00A0I can\u0027t bring myself to say goodbye, so instead I will say have fun and be safe on your travels. We look forward to updates on your adventures, when you can send them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe world can be a better place, if we make it be one.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n-- Sal_vager\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-01T02:07:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have one simple rule that guided me throughout moderation, \u0022how much harm does this do to the community\u0022, that\u0027s it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople make mistakes, they forget, they don\u0027t mean any harm, so a tap on the shoulder is enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOthers come here to make trouble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGo with your gut, it\u0027s not hard, treat our friends as they would treat us, a reminder is enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-01T03:00:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\no7\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSafe travels!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-01T03:04:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223005186\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022158494\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221491015642\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002270807\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 minutes ago, regex said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\no7\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSafe travels!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts been a pleasure working with you sal, I now formally accept the title of \u0022Person silly enough to sticking around longest on the moderation team\u0022..\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou have been a very welcome asset to the community for a long time, and your shoes both very large and very smelly to fill \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck man, hoep to catch you around.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-01T03:07:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*salutes*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFare thee well, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/16426-sal_vager/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002216426\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/16426-sal_vager/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@sal_vager\u003C/a\u003E, and enjoy your travels.
