You also forgot their relatively poor fuel efficiency in the list of flaws with them. As for vectoring, that\u0027s not a major feature from my point of view, not actually needed with a reasonably balanced plane design. I\u0027d gladly trade vectoring for thrust and fuel efficiency to make them a useful alternative to turbojets\u002Baerospike.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ComradeGoat","CreatedById":59041,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T23:53:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Peppe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Peppe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAn easy way to have them switch all at the same time is to action group your intakes -- just like you would on normal SSTO.

Even 0.03 air allow the engine maintain power with air breathing mode. This is excellent! An old jet engine will be shut down when air drop below 0.10 if thrust is on max but the rapier will not. However, it seems if you have dual rapier and let them running in a low dense atmosphere, they sometimes have different thrust and may change your direction. They are still running but with different output. I really like the light effect when they are running at full thrust but the sound effect sound quite odd to me. I don\u0027t like it.
