For example:\n\nDres Lander 2b (Dres Lander was the purpose of the original design, 2 being the second revision, and the b is normally some variation, for example an additional docking port for this particular mission).\n\nThis is normally combined with a fairly generic transfer stage:\n\nInterplanetary Mothership 2b (Again, purpose, revision, and some variation)\n\nAll of this is strapped onto a launcher platform:\n\nKalinin MK3 (Normally named after its looks, with a revision number... and yes, a stack of orange tanks somehow makes me think of old soviet-era nuclear reactors)\n\nHowever, when this is all bundled together and ready to launch, i rename it all, normally something that resembles the mission, purpose, or looks. Examples include:\n\nIcarus - Close pass to Kerbol\n\nLeviathan - Sinking into the oceans of Eve\n\nKim Jung - Some suborbital probe thing that was only going to trasmit some science and then explode\n\nDodo - A winged contraption that i knew would fly horribly.\n\nEwok Partyvan - My laythe expedition. I\u0027ve always liked to imagine that Laythe has Ewoks.\n\nAlbatross - A bunch of large TAC-LS modules with probe core and wings.
