(Anyone want to conform/deny this?) Just remember that your current position is the axis of rotation of your orbital plane. I would imagine that as long as you keep your orientation perpendicular to the velocity vector you could flip it around. You would burn a lot of fuel in the process though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-09T19:34:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s doable -- you want to burn on the \u002B/- normal vector.
