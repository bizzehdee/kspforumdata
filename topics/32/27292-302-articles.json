Then, I carefully constructed a cargo to go within, so that it just about fit, put some rockets and control onto it and saved the filled box as a subassembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext was the destination. I hadn\u0027t landed on Minmus\u0027 Great Flats yet, and they were a nice, flat area that was rather nearby. I decided to send Jeb, Bill and Bob there with the box. So, I built a ship for it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/tp4qha.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tp4qha.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/M7yOnL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022M7yOnL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGot orbit, matched inclinations, performed a twist-docking maneuver and then set off. You may note a small issue here, if you are careful.

Then, the box and the lander cans were decoupled. Bob descended first and I immediately noticed another problem: the lander can was upside down. I used the IVA a little to keep an eye on the radar altimeter (forgetting that the Great Flats surface is at \u0022sea level\u0022) and the vertical speed, but it was still a little disorienting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/KvmcqT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KvmcqT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen Bill followed, about an orbit later. This time, I used IVA a little more, to look at the anti-maneuver marker for the descent, and later in the same way as before. Landed very close, within 40m of Bill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/RCxqWk.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RCxqWk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the point at which I realised my big mistake: the rockets on the box had no way of getting at the box\u0027s fuel supply. Yeah. Whoops. So the box was stuck in orbit until I terminated it and sent a replacement. The first version of the replacement had fuel lines and was strapped atop an extremely obsolete rocket which ran out of charge on the way out. The second gave each of the box\u0027s rockets its own, independent fuel supply, bringing more fuel than the original had brought, and was sent out by the old Aleph Tank Lifter, because any of my other subassembly lifters was even more extremely overkill. The rocket had a probe core, a Z-4k and two RTGs put on it, so it would absolutely not run out of charge on the way out, and could deorbit itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/B5zpEV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B5zpEV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the above image, you can see the lander cans with Bill and Bob in, if you look closely.

Bill and Bob took down three reports between them, took a surface sample and planted a flag. (Now that I think about it, one of them is going to have to retrieve the crew report from whichever lander can it was before those batteries die. Should be fine though.

It\u0027s very basic, but I just got RAPIERs and wanted a proof of concept. I could see a design like this being used for space station missions in the future... Hopefully less ugly. At around 15km it flipped the bird to the atmosphere and really started to pick up speed. It\u0027s currently in a mostly circular ~90km orbit and by my guestimation has barely enough fuel to deorbit and land, but I feel like once I get more comfortable with designs like this it could be very useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2014-05-1723-50-50-30.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2014-05-1723-50-50-30.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2014-05-1723-54-50-30.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2014-05-1723-54-50-30.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: That design clearly needs some work. When I brought it back down it got really unstable as the atmosphere thickened back up -- The nose would drift up almost uncontrollably, unless I tipped it below about 15 degrees then it would drift down. That landing was a rough ride... I chose to put it down near a coastline because I miscalculated (read: derped and lost my bearings) and KSC ended up being halfway around the globe on the dark side when I deorbited. Not that I probably could have landed it there anyway... Although I did do a pretty good job of putting it down where I wanted to (when I originally looked for KSC I just went by a rover marker that I knew was within a km or two, but I was seeing the marker through the other side of the planet).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust over there\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2014-05-1800-59-06-52.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2014-05-1800-59-06-52.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmoooooossssttttt. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2014-05-1801-04-23-02.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2014-05-1801-04-23-02.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrap.

The LV-N powered transfer stage just has 60 kN thrust, so it will have pretty long burn times. Nevertheless, if I didn\u0027t totally miscalculate, it should easily get to Duna, even if I miss the optimal launch window (there\u0027s enough fuel to change angular momentum around Kerbol form Kerbins orbit to Dunas Orbit with about 1/3 of the fuel as emergency reserve). The lander has a lot of parachutes (terminal velocity should be about 1.3 times higher than on Kerbin, where I tested the design) and aerospikes both for the final burn during landing and as first stage for the ascent afterwards. After the experiments are performed, the material bays, nose cones and goo containers are jettisoned (with separatrons) to lower the weight. To finally reach Duna orbit again, an LV-909 is used. The return vehicle itself is using an ion engine and will just bring back the Mk1 Pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side note: I know that those ladders are ugly, but my graphics driver (radeonsi) has issues with the lights of the mobility enhancer. If I use those, my FPS drops below 30. So, although the original design had extend-able ladders everywhere, I decided to go back to the static ones, that don\u0027t reduce my framerate. Let\u0027s pretend they aren\u0027t there, OK?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I learned the hard way, that it\u0027s not a good idea to edit the text for Kerbal Alarm Clock alarms while controlling a vessel. After doing so, I was quite surprised to see parts of my unmanned Moho probe slowly drifting away from the probe itself... Well, I (unintentionally) went to the next stage by typing a space character, and jettisoned my (half full) fuel tanks of the transfer stage... I reverted that flight, although it\u0027s a pity, since I already had performed a successful gravity assist at the Mun and also already performed a 10 minute burn to get the periapsis on the orbit of Moho... I\u0027ll try again, this time with locked stages ;-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
