I will mention that, having flown your plane, yours will kick over to closed cycle mode around 26,000 meters (a bit low for the comfort of most spaceplane enthusiasts - if you want it to be higher up when it kicks over, add some more intakes - the general rule of thumb is three Ram Air Intakes per engine). When I flew it, it was going about 1750 m/s when that happened. When a RAPIER equipped spaceplane does that, it\u0027s a rocket at that point; you\u0027ll want to close the intakes and pull up to about 45 degrees so you can get out of the atmosphere as quickly as you can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGuideline for landing at KSC - put a flag out on either end of the runway, just off the little raised area so the game doesn\u0027t think it\u0027s debris. Put a maneuver node such that the periapsis is about 44,000 meters above either flag (assuming you\u0027re in a 100x100 orbit; go for a slightly higher periapsis if you\u0027re in a lower orbit, or vice versa), and then if you\u0027re more than a minute or two from that node move it ahead about 1 degree per additional minute. Burn to retro as indicated, go ahead and switch your plane\u0027s engine back to air-breathing mode and open the intakes. You should wind up in the vicinity of KSC at a minimum - and if you\u0027re spot on, you should be able to glide right in.

Last night I attached the payload for the first time. Plane is still having control issues in horizontal flight due to how the wings are set up (structural issues mainly - they\u0027re twisting a bit due to insufficient strutting; I\u0027m going to have to fix those soon).

I\u0027ve made a small plan for my next two missions: a second Mun landing, and then a Minmus landing that\u0027ll leave a probe behind in orbit. To do this, I put together a small lander, a probe, and a transfer stage, sized so that transfer stage and the probe-lander combination each fit inside a single large MK2 cargo bay. I\u0027m not 100% certain the lander will manage to land on Mun and return to dock, but it can take the probe with it - it doubles as a small auxiliary fuel tank.

It still had a little fuel leftover when it landed, so the fuel cost of putting up that transfer stage was 1362 funds.

It can dock with Bastion (150km), leave 3.61t (the mass of the transfer stage - more is likely), and return to the runway with fuel to spare. The maximum possible fuel cost of such a flight is 1541 funds.
