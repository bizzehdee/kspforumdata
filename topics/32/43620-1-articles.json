If you\u0027re talking about an update like 0.22 or 0.23, then it depends upon what the developers say. The only reason 0.21 destroyed ships and forced a new game was because Squad introduced a new feature that could only be implemented if it broke saves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor mods, you will always keep them, no matter what update you go through. The only problem is, they may not work after a new update, because of some new coding that they won\u0027t comply with. In that situation, you just have to wait for the mod developer to release an updated version and replace the old mod with that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-23T16:32:19Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2013 04:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by TheHockeyPlayer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"johnnyhandsome","CreatedById":59580,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-23T17:37:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen an update comes out, keep an eye on this forum: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forumdisplay.php/19-General-Add-on-Affairs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forumdisplay.php/19-General-Add-on-Affairs\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone will usually start a list of addons that have been udpated, still worked or break the new update.
