I\u0027ve done it myself many times but it\u0027s very hit or miss. One thing that stood out to me was that MechJeb is able to predict your apoapsis after braking. I think I saw something about that here many months ago but since the forum upgrade old links don\u0027t work \u0026amp; the search doesn\u0027t find anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy questions are: Is there a reason the patched conic solver can\u0027t draw a aerobraking estimate? The fact that MechJeb can give me data on it makes me think that the devs just haven\u0027t gotten around to it (understandable considering the pressure they were under at the time). My concern is that with all the lovely new planets and atmospheres in the next patch it would be a shame to spend a bunch of time traveling to another planet only to miss the envelope and slam into to planet or skip off. A rough predicted course post-atmosphere would help a lot and it would seem to be a simple addition (of course in programming nothing is what it seems).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it\u0027s not in the dev checklist for the next update but neither was the new sky (stunning btw). I\u0027d just like to know if the devs have considered adding it to this update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-27T02:05:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHarvesteR discussed this a while ago, and (as I remember) he said it would be doable, he wanted to do it, but it was the sort of \u0022gloss\u0022 on the game he wants to leave until more underlying game mechanics were finished.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
