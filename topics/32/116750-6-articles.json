Consider a few aspects of how real space flight and communications issues are dealt with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGround based communications is really very good and very extensive. I can buy a satellite dish that can receive signals from a satellite in geosynchronous orbit for a price that is affordable to your average consumer. The ability to get signals to and from Earth\u0027s surface to low orbit satellites is, frankly, trivial.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGround based communications are also able to get signals to and from probes a very long way away is possible without space-based communications relays.

That would simulate remote control from the ground pretty well without requiring any special flight computers.

That makes sense to me!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could still allow probes to be launched by hand if you made a sphere around Kerbin (say 100 km) where probes were allowed to be flown by hand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would make soft-landing probes on distant bodies very difficult, however.
