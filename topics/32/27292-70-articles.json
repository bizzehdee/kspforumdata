I sent them there in the prototype lander (a minimal change to the stock 2-stage lander design that comes with the game, coupled with a launcher built using KW Rocketry and Kommit Nucleonics engines).

By the time I switched to map view, I was already on a Kerbin escape trajectory entirely! Fortunately, I still had a Kerbin flyby en route. I added a midcourse correction to lower the periapsis and then time warped. Unfortunately, I was bitten by either a time warping bug or one related to Kerbal Alarm Clock (or maybe both - maybe it\u0027s how they interact). When I came out of warp near my predicted periapsis of 150 km, I found myself inside 120 km and dropping rapidly. I was under 100 km before I realized the full extent of the situation. By the time I double-checked the map and switched back, I was under 70 km. Ah, what the heck ... full retro thrust until depletion and by then I was under 40 km and in full-on entry mode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurns out my lander can in fact survive entry! Good to know. And good thing I had installed those launch abort chutes. Totally out of fuel, there was no way to make a powered landing. Chutes deployed nominally and the lander upper stage splashed down off the western coast of the continent where KSC is located.
