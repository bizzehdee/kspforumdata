Considering how you can land them on their head, or have them survive explosions via EVA. Who knows what kinds of secrets could lurk on this little blue ball in the Kerbol system. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dasemay","CreatedById":57491,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-10T00:04:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esimple answer kerbals are a type of grass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASI Director","CreatedById":64746,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-10T02:18:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbals are an advanced species of adamantium, hard-to-obtain-nium, and super-dense-ium.
