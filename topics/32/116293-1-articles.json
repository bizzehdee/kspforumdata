The craft was also more wobbly, indicating that the air-flow was not even because of the uneven payload. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also have to remember that fairings (undeployed) have quite high drag themselves and launching a craft with the fairing pre-deployed removes that drag. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConclusions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFairings have high drag and high mass.
