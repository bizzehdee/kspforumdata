Then you can just leave the fairing separation in a stage where it will never occur.\n\nI guess now that I think about it, this shouldn\u0027t be so bad for simply structural uses, like recreating the pointed shape of the N1. I think I can still make it work on some parts of my Saturn V as well, while still using wing pieces for other parts. I guess as an incremental change it\u0027s not so bad, just a little disappointing because it\u0027s not good enough to do 100% of what I want yet."},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T18:09:16Z","Content":"They just did a big SteamDB update, updating all three at once."},{"CreatedByName":"Frybert","CreatedById":97766,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T18:11:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E They just did a big SteamDB update, updating all three at once.\n\nPage is down for me.\n\nETA: Back up now.
