For example, Minecraft doesn\\\u0027t mind piracy, Notch the creator of it welcomes it. He knows that a good product sells itself. Word of mouth and so on. And look how minecraft is thriving. A person that is going to play the game for a longer time will probably buy it. What the people on youtube are doing is the major selling point if you ask me, all the lets plays. Thats how i learned about KSP before i bought it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso i see no reason why this needs to be reported nor why anyone thinks they should play internet police about it. Nothing can be done about it.
