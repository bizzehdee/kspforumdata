I was thinking of possibly roleplaying KSP in hard mode.\n\nI thought I would impose a few rules on myself such as:\n\n- Hard mode\n- No Kerbals Can Die\n- Use little or no data from outside the game\n\nSo this is what I\u0027m thinking of doing:\n\n- Creating a story\n- Creating Mission Plans\n- Creating Missions Reports\n\nI have added a few mods so far which I believe enhance realism. These mods are:\n\n- TAC - Life support\n- KOS\n- Remote Tech\n\nI do not want to add any mods that add parts.\n\nSo, what is everyone\u0027s thoughts? What should I include in a roleplay of KSP?"},{"CreatedByName":"Plume \u0026amp; Akakak","CreatedById":142955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T03:10:56Z","Content":"Forget your rules.\n\nThis is kerbal roleplaying.\n\nWhat you need is talking to your screen with your nose pinched, just like we certainly all do already.\n\nHave fun ! \u003C-- leprechaun voice\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-06T03:19:04Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2015 03:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Plume \u0026 Akakak**"},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T08:58:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E - No Kerbals Can Die\n\nThat doesn\u0027t sounds too \u0027arrpee\u0027 to me. Accepting the loss of life and mourning the fallen is more immersive than reverting or loading a save when something goes wrong. That mentality can also set you the most interesting rescue missions too.\n\nI\u0027d also consider playing only from EVA. Or at least doing much of it.
