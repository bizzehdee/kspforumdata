There is always a reason behind it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, some people ask why they do not explain themselves and the answer is because people simply do not accept the answer, even though it is a legitimate problem. Games cost more and more money to develop since people want more and more. You can\u0027t please a customer with the same thing over and over gain. So you try to push the boundaries which sadly requires more money. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why Free to Play looks so amazing to some developers, they are willing to take that risk because it isn\u0027t cheap to make games. Indie games are able to be successful because they appeal to an entirely different audience. So you really can\u0027t compare the two. Unless you think everyone who plays Call of Duty also plays indie games? Sure, they might but that doesn\u0027t change the fact people who like these FPS games, high end graphics, and so on and so fourth costa lot more money then an indie game does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe industry is hitting a bit of a wall when it comes to making money. You now have to sell a ton of copies to even break even. The DRM always online, isn\u0027t about piracy entirely it\u0027s also about used games which these companies make nothing off of at all. Some people have used the excuse, someone already payed them for that copy, but that isn\u0027t the issue. The issue is now you have 1 copy of the game which was previously owned by 2 or more people, which if used games didn\u0027t exist that person probably would have purchased a new copy. So instead of a company selling 800,000 copies, they may only sell 500,000. It\u0027s a huge difference. Course those numbers can vary greatly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing people do not realize, is this is why steam works as well as it does. This is also why steam is able to do the sales they do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, EA has done some stupid crap, but really ... does anyone honestly think they are doing just to do it?
