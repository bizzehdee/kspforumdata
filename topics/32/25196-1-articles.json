First you need a tug that can get you into space. Second a stage that can transfer you to the muns sphere of influence and also land (witch is not very hard), then be able to get you back into orbit back home (witch takes a lot less delta-V then you mite expect) don\u0027t forget to put a parachute on that sucker so you don\u0027t hit the ground at mach 2. That\u0027s about all there is to a mun rocket\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Westo454","CreatedById":12702,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T01:11:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMun Rockets are really easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first thing you need to do is to get into orbit, a basic launcher can do this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second thing you need is a transfer stage, again quite easy, just put a fuel tank and a rocket on top of the previous stage. The final thing you\u0027ll need is a descent/landing stage, this is simply a tiny rocket with legs. Usually, if you play right, leave no fuel behind, this kind of set-up will get you to mun and back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WarMachin32","CreatedById":62465,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T03:32:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell after some trial and much error i have made it to the MUN!!! used that rocket in the link i really like the design very user friendly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T03:41:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations, and I\u0027m glad you liked my rocket. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sovek","CreatedById":57251,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T04:20:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you are up for a small challenge, take my Pegasus Rocket for a spin (requires KW Rocketry), Burns to orbit and TMI with a Free Return Trajectory in two long stages, Once the TMI is finished, the crew readies for pyro arm and docking of the CSM with the MEM (Munar Excursion Module).
