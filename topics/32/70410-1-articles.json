I had \u003Cem\u003Eplanned\u003C/em\u003E to land on the surface, but as I entered the SOI and warped to the periapse to do my insertion burn, a staging error removed the entire lander assembly from the craft. Violently. The worst part was that I didn\u0027t manage to do the insertion burn, so my little brave Kosmonaut was speeding out of Minmus\u0027s SOI and would imminently be placed in a hugely eccentric Kerbin orbit. Luckily, it was one of my newer models of space capsules, so it had a docking port on it (which was a new feature to my designs in this particular save). I quickly sent a rescue mission after it, and it was as I was trying to match orbits with the stranded capsule that I realized that this was almost identical to the orbital path I had seen an asteroid take earlier. The thing that spurred me to go after the capsule was the possibility that the stranded Kerbal would be thrown out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI by Minmus returning. After about 10 minutes of trial-and-error burns and frustration, I managed to dock with the capsule and scored some practice for when I\u0027m ready to go for the asteroids!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second story actually took place earlier on a different save: I was testing lander technology for a long series of missions involving the Mun, so I built my rocket and capsule/lander and decided to test it by sending it to Duna. (I saw via Kerbal Engineer that I had enough Delta-V to do it, so why not?) I launched the whole kerjigger to Duna, planning to orbit and come back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I saw that I had nearly \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E of my fuel remaining in the lander. Hey... Why not try a landing? I burned and got myself a nice angle to do some parachute-assisted aerobraking, slowed down, and completely \u003Cem\u003Enailed\u003C/em\u003E the landing. As a matter of fact, it was my first EVER Duna landing. I was so pleased... but THEN I found out that I still had half of my remaining fuel left. Hey... Why not come back home?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI lifted off, did some creative burning, and \u003Cem\u003Elanded my guy back home.\u003C/em\u003E It is probably one of my greatest triumphs so far.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DirtyHarry","CreatedById":83383,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-25T05:19:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI, too, bailed out over the Mun after running out of fuel... my Kerbal bounced around a bit, but amazingly survived.

I built a \u0022command module\u0022 and \u0022lander\u0022 and put it up into orbit... then realized it was really a Mun/Minmus sort of lander, and not at all suited for Duna. So, I built a Duna lander, and figured the other could go to Ike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI flew this cobbled-together mistake out there, and wound up using all my fuel in all three ships just to get into orbit around the Duna system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow what?

When i was nearly reaching the AP with Min_2 i had to recognize that the flightpath of Min_1 was diverted by mun - on an trajectory directly strait into kerbin. Luckily SQAD haven\u0027t implemented an \u0022damage-model\u0022 for a kerbalnout experiencing high accelerations during reentry yet. So i could lean back watching both crafts to land safely on kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-25T16:14:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELittle fun cooked up as an excuse to decommission an old space station\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart 1: Unauthorized Takeoff at KSC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/HmaJeBYDX5A?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart 2: Space Station Resupply Mission\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/481uITDSny8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart 3: SABOTAGE!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/mCpEL6KvsAw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart 4: Orbital Rescue\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/L0HZAkAASRU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart 5: Three Space Kowboys\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/wV2mrMF0vM4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadpangod3","CreatedById":58339,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-25T17:00:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy best ksp story?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh...

They really liked that and asked if we could land. Not in the spacestation, of course, but it has landers. Might as well do some proper sightseeing at [an anomaly/easter egg- name removed to protect the innocent].
