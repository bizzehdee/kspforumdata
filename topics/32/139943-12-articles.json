The main reason for this is time. Like others mentioned, I don\u0027t like the idea of leaving my space program unattended for 100 days to several years, just so I can get to my landing immediately. So, I end up skipping several days, then decide to go do something else, and ever so slowly the moment crawls closer. But it takes a long time.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNext to that, outside of Kerbin\u0027s SoI, it\u0027ll be difficult as all hell to save your kerbals from a stranded lander or even a\u00A0KRV (Kerbin Return Vehicle).

That seems to take away from the motivation. In the end, what can I do on a planet once I have all science unlocked? Drive around, goof a bit with the gravity, I haven\u0027t even bothered with searching for artifacts... Seeing as there is no way to discover them, it just turns into an hours-long rover/aircraft/rocket hop hunt.

I hope they are not kidding themselves that they can learn all this on the fly instead of bringing in some new talent. What they have now has some serious conceptual problems, like the fact that even for an experienced player, it starts off really hard and then just keeps on getting easier.\u00A0For example, if\u00A0you want to rendezvous,, dock, etc. early in the game, you have to do it without the benefit of SAS or RCS or even a target indicator. That exercise is pretty challenging even for an experienced player and for a beginner it\u0027s next to impossible. It should therefore only be introduced later in the game, perhaps as some sort of \u0022Jebediah has to rescue a stranded astronaut but his RCS and SAS are malfunctioning\u0022 contract. The bottom line IMO is that unlocking the tech tree is just the wrong thing to have as the central motivating factor of your campaign, for this very reason. There needs to be some other narrative motivating you beyond that, and this will require the generation of a whole bunch of de-novo content. It also represents a major conceptual crossroads, which means there are bound to be disagreements within the team about how to move forward. I hope that navigating this passage is at least close to being the next thing on their agenda.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-28T17:17:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n^^^Preach it, brotha\u0027!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gilflo","CreatedById":62881,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-28T20:00:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have been playing for hundred of hours.
