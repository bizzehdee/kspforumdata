This gives it a density of 58000 kg/m^3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is hugely, weirdly, scarily high. Earth\u0027s is about 5500 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E. The densest known material (under STP) is osmium, which comes in at about 23000 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E; I see a few references that the synthetic element hassium (atomic number 108) will have a density of about 41000 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E if anyone ever makes enough of it to measure. But that\u0027s still not enough. Plus it has a half life of 12 minutes so even if you did have enough of it, you wouldn\u0027t have it for very long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore the only plausible explanation for Kerbin\u0027s ludicrous density is that it has a core of some kind of degenerate matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElectron degenerate matter is the stuff you normally get in the cores of stars. It\u0027s ludicrously dense... for a gas: it goes up to about 10000 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next step is neutron degenerate matter, a.k.a. neutronium; with a density starting at about 10\u003Csup\u003E9\u003C/sup\u003E kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E you\u0027d only need a sphere of the stuff 47 km across. (Minus some to account for the rock padding needed to form the planet we all know and love and crash into.) The only problem is that AFAIK you can\u0027t have neutronium bodies smaller than 1.4 solar masses, or they explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(There is also proton degenerate matter which is somewhere in between, but it seems to be rare and I can\u0027t find any references as to how dense it is. And there\u0027s quark degenerate matter, but that\u0027s even denser that neutronium and is scary.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, unless some ancient god-like being put a blob of neutronium at the center of Kirbin inside a very strong box so it wouldn\u0027t explode, there is only one candidate left:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKirbin\u0027s core is a black hole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a small one, and the rest of the planet is otherwise ordinary rock; a black hole with a mass that of Kirbin\u0027s would have a radius of about 10 microns, so while it would be sucking in mass, it\u0027s not doing it very fast. And while small block holes do evaporate over time, converting their mass to energy increasingly more quickly as they shrink until they finally explode in a planet-destroying blaze of energy, this one will take about 1e52 seconds to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it\u0027s still something to look forward to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-16T17:32:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbin is hollow (except for the black hole in the center).
