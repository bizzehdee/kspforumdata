Two, rework the tech tree so that different kinds of science are required to unlock next levels. For example, command pods and other crewed parts require Medical AND Spaceflight to unlock. Lander parts might add in a small add mixture of Planetary science (how to keep munar dust out of the snacks, etc). Contracts would then be related to specific kinds of science to do. Pure, planetary work, or long-term manned labs to see how kerbals deal with spaceflight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, tech would be unlocked as it is for parts contracts provisionally, so that you can get stuff in advance of unlocking it.

Add a camera part (can have upgrades automatically, so the more advanced you are the better they work, without chaining the part to keep the count down). Alternately all command pod, science lab or probe parts have a camera with no extra part required. Flying over a world maps it, which can simply change the zoom level allowed the player on that world. It might also allow showing the biomes with enough advancement (based on research facility rating at KSC?). Other useful science can be thought up. A real reason to do stuff like send probes. In a perfect world, the Kerbol system would be slightly randomized each new game to make such probes/data really useful.

I\u0027m not new to the game, but when I started playing career in 0.90 (first time I tried career \u0022for real\u0022) I was completely lost as to what to do or what should be my objective as a player.

I think they should tweak it further to make satellites and stations more useful. It does not make much sense that they are more or less obsolete after placing them there.
