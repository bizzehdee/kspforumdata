Only way I figured out right now is to put it one by one in single \u0022symetric\u0022 mode.

The game automatically adjusts the symmetry mode to the object you are placing it on, with the exception being one. Try making it so that instead of a 4-way symmetry mode, make it 2-way and then put the other 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA from it, and then place the solar panels on one of the two pairs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SalmonellaDingDong","CreatedById":57168,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-27T10:28:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENope.

If you have, for example, a central tank and then have placed 4 side tanks on it using the 4X symmetry then anything you place on those 4 side tanks will also be with 4X symmetry and as far as I know, no amount of pressing X can override this. You can have 1X symmetry or the same as the parent object\u0027s symmetry. As far as I know you have to do what rryy said.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"loppnessmonsta","CreatedById":58525,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-27T16:50:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re both right. When you\u0027re placing an object, the symmetry will match whatever you drag it over (as long as you have the symmetry above 1). So, if you try to place it on a 4x symmetry, you either have to do 1 or 4. However... if you\u0027re trying to place it on something that has no symmetry, but you dragged it across a 4x symmetry before you got to it, your symmetry selector will switch to 4x and stay there. Pressing X solves this by cycling through symmetry modes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
