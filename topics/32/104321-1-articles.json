Given what i knew about the game and its physics i designed a modular base that i could construct in stages. The rough sketches helped me immensely, and i encourage you to do some planning if you want to build a large station.\n\n[http://imgur.com/gallery/9y4sm](http://imgur.com/gallery/9y4sm)"},{"CreatedByName":"jarmund","CreatedById":126888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T17:31:20Z","Content":"I concluded a while back that I need to do what you\u0027re doing, as my stations normally consisted of 2 docking ports on either side \u002B useful stuff between them, then a lot of these docked together. Most of the segments still had their orbital insertion vehicle still on, as I don\u0027t like deorbiting fuel that could come in handy. The result: part count through the roof, cluttered with orange tanks and mainsails pointing in all direction, and a general mess.\n\nI just haven\u0027t gotten around to building a station after that epiphany.\n\nIt would seem that you build your stations as far away from my approach as possible: You make a rough draft, you plan ahead, and you actually make it look good.\n\nI won\u0027t claim that one of the methods is better, but.... well.... actually, I\u0027m just gonna go ahead and say that your station looks great, while mine look like (and are) total crapfest. Nice work!\n\nAre you going to extend it further?"},{"CreatedByName":"Norcalplanner","CreatedById":112223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T21:08:48Z","Content":"Station looks great, but watch out for the lag monster.

Strange thing is that everything goes perfectly until you add some more parts and the FPS and GUI response goes rapidly down.\n\nI experienced that when assembling my space station around Laythe. Around 600 parts, It turned like hell. I had to install KAS mod to remove nearly 250 parts. Now with one of the staged lander not returned from Tylo (by design) and with few fuel tank disconnected, it\u0027s largely manageable. I also tweak the graphic options and resolution. \n\nHere is a screen when the crew arrived at the station (13 assembled elements around Laythe)\n\n[![f5faacc7-588f-4fed-9d20-424f28a030b2.jpg](http://tof.canardpc.com/preview2/f5faacc7-588f-4fed-9d20-424f28a030b2.jpg)](http://tof.canardpc.com/view/f5faacc7-588f-4fed-9d20-424f28a030b2.jpg)\n\n(click to enlarge)"},{"CreatedByName":"Norcalplanner","CreatedById":112223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T19:37:00Z","Content":"This one is the largest station I\u0027ve ever built, or ever will build. 1200 tons in orbit around Laythe, and room for over 1,000 kerbals.

Mine weights 400T for 900 parts, which I managed to reduce to 650, then 600 parts. \n\nThe big trouble wasn\u0027t the slow FPS but the non response from the context menus. It was very hard to simply get the menus to show. Transferting fuel was nearly impossible (and ultra slow when I succeed)."},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T07:44:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This.

However, it does not help with **G**PU load, because the renderer still has to draw all those parts either way. Help is helpful, depending on where the bottleneck is for your system."}]}
