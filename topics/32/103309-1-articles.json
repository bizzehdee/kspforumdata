Mind-blowing.\n\nSo which of the features that was mentioned and officially said to be part are you most anticipating and excited for?\n\nFor me, I think it would be the Fairings, and new landing gear, as they\u0027ve been long wanted in stock for a long time, and could change KSP engineering, not only in the replica side of things, but in general craft-making as well.\n\nWhat about you guys?"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T10:20:53Z","Content":"Memory leaks fixed and hopefully some DX11 fixes.
