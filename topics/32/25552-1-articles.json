Upon flying out to the general area about 40 kms to the East of Kerbal Space Center, the anomaly appeared no where to be found. It was only after much searching that I discovered the reason to be because I was searching for something on the ground, when the monolith was actually about 100 meters above the ground, hovering in mid air. I am guessing that this is a bug? Is this hovering actually intended?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bulletrhli","CreatedById":55960,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T14:12:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomeone had told me about this yesterday and I did not believe him, but I tried this as well.
