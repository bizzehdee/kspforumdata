But a lot of the community can be very helpful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing you should learn about this game, is its just that, its a game, not a simulator. The physics of the game are only partially realistic and the tech tree progression has no basis in reality at all. The devs decided to go a different route, in a way I like that they didn\u0027t follow the well trodden path, it gives the Kerbals some personality they lack, going the rout of Realism is boring, everybody would be doing the Mercury to Apollo missions or the Soviet equivalent and all the rockets would look roughly the same. But with the way they did it, it takes creativity and the ability to think outside the box with limited resources to accomplish whatever task someone has set for themselves. Also, please note this game is still in development and some stuff could change pretty drastically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf its lack of help that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s frustrating, you have definitely come to the right place, this community is better than most, but most people resent others who yell and scream that the game sucks because of this or that. Im not saying your doing that, just warning you, you will not be well received if you don\u0027t look for your issue before yelling about it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf its help you need for docking or getting a rocket in orbit or whatever, Scott Manley is a well known KSP player and YouTube personality, look up his videos if your stuck. He likes to get into the science of the game as well and the real concepts the game is based off of. Youtube is really helpful for this game if your a visual or aural learner. If you learn better with written materials im sure there are plenty of tutorials in these forums somewhere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I really disliked about this game when I was new though, was the lack of easily accessible information that you need to know quickly, like your apopsis and periopsis (even my spell checker cant spell it), or how much Delta V you have total or in a certain stage. You have to figure your Delta V by hand after looking at at least four or five part entries in the VAB before you have enough info to figure it, why don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t we have that info at hand in stock? I decided to mod the game almost immediately, I got MechJeb first for its info screens, didn\u0027t want the autopilot but at the time it was the only one with all the info I liked. Now you can find at least three mods that give you the info you want at a glance, four if you count SteamGuages: MechJeb 2, Engineer Redux, and VOID. If you get MechJeb, I suggest you either only use it for the info screens or use the autopilot as a flight demonstration for concepts you may be having a hard time with. Don\u0027t use the autopilot for regular launches, IMO it takes all the fun out of the game and ruins any sense of accomplishment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking seems to be the hardest thing for a lot of people to wrap they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re heads around, for me is was rendezvous I just couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t get the hang of it for the longest time, docking was a piece of cake compared to the many hours of frustration it took me to rendezvous effectively Two things I learned that helped me greatly with docking though, there is a keyboard command that allows you to make the controls less sensitive and jumpy, I think it Capslock by default, I use it often. And in general you have to be patient, take it slow only do tiny bursts of RCS when you are close to your docking target, and RCS is basically required to dock effectively with a minimum of frustration, it can be done without RCS but its not fun, unless you find exploding and reloading several times \u0022fun\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck with your Kerbal endevours.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pingonaut","CreatedById":15723,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T13:13:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d say start in sandbox, then move to career mode.

Skills aside, it doesn\u0027t take a player all that long to go from a craptastic rocket, to Mun and Minmus missions. In a month (Kerbal Time) I have put a space station in orbit over Kerbin, landed Kerbals nearly a dozen times on Mun, and completed a manned and unmanned Minmus mission. Some players have reported that they can pretty much open the entire tech tree in only a handful of missions. Think about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, career mode and the tech tree needs work. However, what\u0027s the point of giving a player the tools for a prolonged space flight when they should be mastering getting something into orbit first? So much of the rest of the game is understanding those mechanics, because docking, going the Mun or anywhere for that matter hinges on what you learn with the first tier. Seriously, in those 15 minute missions, you can get really high levels of science doing very little. Between an orbit around the equator, and an orbit around the poles, I generated a ton of science. Add in just screwing around KSC, and there\u0027s even more science to gain. By then, plenty of missions just trying to aim re-entries for specific biomes for science, I had more than enough science to get solar panels before I even was in space long enough to need them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m no Scott Manley, but by the time I was designing craft that realistically needed solar panels, I already had them unlocked.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T04:39:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEasy solution: \u003Cstrong\u003EDon\u0027t transmit in low tiers.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem the OP is having is probably more due to the lack of information on \u003Cem\u003Ehow\u003C/em\u003E to science rather than anything to do with the difficulty involved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for the OP and anyone else interested, here is the key to the mechanics of science to get you through the lower tiers:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe command pod can store one copy of any \u003Cstrong\u003Eunique\u003C/strong\u003E experimental result.

Had about 7 days until my window, so I figured I\u0027d launch my probe, get it into orbit, take care of some other flights and time warp to my window. So my window rolls around, and my probe is reacting sluggishly because I forgot a SAS, and still had one stage to go before it was better, but playing in map mode so didn\u0027t think much of it. As a result I miss my window by a lot because of the SAS thing, so Duna has a window in 14 days so I figure I\u0027ll just change up my mission and I\u0027ll shoot another probe to Moho later.
