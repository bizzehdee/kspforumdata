And, you know, the other thing to realise, and this is\u2026 you know, if you were around in the early days of KSP you might have remembered there was the whole \u201CDLC gate\u201D, where it was suggested that there might be some DLC at some point. People instantly took that to say: \u201CYou\u2019re gonna start charging us for updates\u201D, and the whole like: \u201CNo, we\u0027re not\u201D\u2026 a whole lot of people saying: \u201CNo, we weren\u2019t gonna do that\u201D, and they committed to never, you know, making any of the existing owners buy DLC. But, you know, with the changing of essentially all the public faces of the game, it\u2019s entirely possible that policy may fall by the wayside. Especially considering that there is a console audience, albeit a console audience that are currently really mad at the low quality of, or the dubious quality of the port.

I\u2019m not sure, I can\u2019t tell you what kind of quality we\u2019ll see from forthcoming updates, but you have to remember at this point there\u2019s really no requirement that the developers supported any more unless they think they\u2019re gonna get more sales as a result of updating the game. You know, it would be entirely consistent with, you know, major publishers they would, you know, just ditch the game and move on to something else, say Kerbal Submarine Program or something.

But I\u2019m prepared to be pleasantly surprised. The last time I talked with any of the guys about multiplayer, the big problem is that the Unity physics engine really doesn\u2019t support multiplayer, right, in the same physics system. So, to make it work you pretty much have to give up [\u2026].\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/6PqClNxM58M?t=3394\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E56:34\u003C/a\u003E On NathanKell and mod development\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that\u2019s the other big concern I have. NathanKell specifically is one of the\u2026 you know, is very much involved in modding and maintains some very important mods and we don\u2019t know whether he is so burned by his experience that he will just abandon what he\u2019s been up to, or whether we will continue to get \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E updates, I\u2019m not clear. I honestly think that if I were, you know, if I were the developers, what\u2026 well ok\u2026 If I was developers wanting to be nice to the community I would just basically stop future feature development and focus on making things that are easier for mod developers to work around. Because basically the new features and stuff just break mods all the time.
