(The heat shield/decoupler thing could be a red-herring for all I know, it\u0027s just the only common factor between all these craft that I saw, that was not shared by other craft that continued to work fine.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, the ones with heat shields attached to were \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E my crewed craft.

So it\u0027s a good thing I know how to edit the save files. (I\u0027ve had to edit save files to work around bugs before, but this was by far the most extreme. I built an empty craft on the pad with lots of hitchhiker seats, \u0022moved\u0022 the kerbals and science into it from wherever they had been, then recovered the craft.) Otherwise I probably would have had to stop playing KSP for a good few months, because that would have been so heartbreaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it is, it was mostly immersion breaking to have to \u0022edit\u0022 people into a situation where I could possibly rescue them. Shocking at first -- when I thought I\u0027d lost everyone and 9000\u002B science, the product of probably man-days of effort, I felt actually like I\u0027d been punched in the stomach -- but I feel better now that I\u0027ve made a successful recovery through hax. And now I\u0027m filled with a bit of glee that I have 9500 total science to spend. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI run Windows 8.1, 32-bit KSP, and my mods are EngineerRedux, Kerbal Alarm Clock, and Contracts Window.
