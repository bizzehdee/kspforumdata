I have bound my PD account to my Epic games account so now the game appears in my PD account but i want a separate launcher. Is that possible?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nazalassa","CreatedById":217956,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-21T11:28:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou don\u0027t need the launcher to play the game, it actually has nouse except getting in the way (see \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/210409-how-to-bypass-the-new-launcher-added-in-update-1124-steam/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethis thread\u003C/a\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTl;dr: just find out where KSP files are installed (see here), and you will find an executable (KSP.exe, KSP.app, KSP.x86_64 or something like that, depending on your OS). Launching it will launch the game. You can then add a shortcut to it on your desktop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
