At this time I was still quite hazy on this whole Navball thing, beyond how to turn East from KSC. I hadn\u0027t even heard of maneuver nodes. Naturally, I decided it was time for Kerbalkind to shoot for the Mun - for science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this mission, I chose Bob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trip out was exciting, it was my first Mun attempt at all, and I was pleased that I had designed a ship that could make it, and Bob and I successfully piloted there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESort of. Bob and I didn\u0027t set up a very circular or low, or even equatorial orbit, and we\u0027d never landed at all without a parachute before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding was...a frustration. So many attempts where I ran out of fuel only to slam poor Bob into the ground anyway. At one point, I quicksaved, uh, a lot lower than I probably should have, and due to my aforementioned confusion over the Navball I wasn\u0027t exactly oriented quite right when I did this, either. So each quickload, I would (somewhat slowly and tbh sometimes not at all) manage to reorient myself and try to immediately burn to slow down and slam into the ground. But eventually I got faster at orienting myself and could do it very quickly. Because I was still failing, I did not dare to quicksave so I got a lot of practice at that little maneuver. I was convinced at one point that I had irretrievably murdered Bob, but kept on out of stubbornness. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, after a lot of practice and to my surprise, humiliation gave way to \u003Cstrong\u003Esuccess\u003C/strong\u003E!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMostly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ORYPtjl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ORYPtjl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh well, Bob seems happy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E He even has a little fuel!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe righted the ship, and Bob got out for his historic moonwalk.

He\u0027d die, but he\u0027d die on his home world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting as high an apoapsis as I could manage with the ship, I ejected Bob and had him burn straight up away from Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/49pegeo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002249pegeo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe didn\u0027t like it, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe had just barely enough fuel to escape Mun. I tried several times to get him out with any fuel left at all, and could not. Any variation ended with him failing to escape. And he couldn\u0027t return to Kerbin. Quickloading back to the surface and the safety of his lander seemed the best option for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn response to the fuel issues I modified the launch stage and came up with a design that I\u0027ve now used for many successful missions to both Mun and Minmus. I also widened the design of the Lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb was the first beneficiary of these redesigns, successfully landing on and returning from Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RrrrBzH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RrrrBzH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut he could not rescue Bob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo missions to Minmus later, I finally remembered probe cores are a thing and researched Stayputnik. Took my usual lander, replaced the parachute with a Radial one, added solar panels, slapped Stayputnik on top of the command pod and EVAed its Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was time for Bob to come home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn hindsight, I should have waited for Bob\u0027s landing site to move back to dayside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rescue probe landed on the opposite side of Mun from Bob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo problem, Bob\u0027s ship has fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously??

Instead, I set him a landing point a little beyond the rescue probe. The EVA camera doesn\u0027t always like to be where I want it to be but I quickly figure out where his retrograde is without the Navball and which key to fire to burn it since it refuses at some altitudes to let me turn him that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also learned about the limitations of EVA packs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was yet another instance of trying over and over to avoid the inevitable. Finally I gave up, quickloaded, and just put him into Orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I remembered the rescue probe. I knew if I used the fuel for an intercept I would not be able to get him home to Kerbin, but I could at least get him back into a command pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe was on a Polar orbit, so I waited until his orbit was aligned almost perfectly with the rescue probe, and launched. At pretty much exactly the wrong time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESet him as target and circularized my orbit. Matched it perfectly to his to have a place to make adjustments from. Then changed the orbit (by far, far too much) and waited a very long time for a decent intercept window. Never really quite got one. Tried a few futile and foolish intercept attempts with that awful, awful orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could have kept trying with a less excessively elliptical orbit. I could have launched a second rescue attempt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I didn\u0027t. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI finally knew. None of this was really happening. Bob died weeks ago, on that very first failed landing attempt. This, all that had happened, was some fragment of Bob; searching repeatedly, desperately, futilely for some way home which was never meant to come. This was torture, and it was time for it to end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith one final, retrograde burst of his rocket pack, I ended Bob\u0027s orbit and bid him sleep well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VdinN3A.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VdinN3A.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe didn\u0027t bring home any science to KSC, but I learned more from Bob\u0027s disaster of a mission than from anything else I\u0027ve done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randox","CreatedById":18034,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T19:12:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most common one for me are mishandling heavy lifter rockets.
