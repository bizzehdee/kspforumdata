The OX-STAT Photovoltaic Panels (the single small square solar panels) produces electricity from sunlight at a rate of 0.75 e/s, the Illuminator Mk2 only consumes electricity at a rate of .02 e/s. Just a silly idea I had, I know there are better, simpler, and more practical way to power your creation, but seeing the stats for those parts couldn\u0027t help but get me thinking... If you placed one of these lamps shining directly onto one of these solar panels could the light from lamp produce more electricity than the light was consuming?

It is the amount of energy that solar panel would get from sunlight, at Kerbin\u0027s distance, if the panel is facing directly towards the sun. Go closer to the Sun (Eve or Moho) and the panel produces more energy, go further away and it produces much less. (This is a real headache when you\u0027re doing a mission around Jool.) Fixed panels simply won\u0027t be facing directly towards the Sun; this is the big advantage of the deployed panels, since they\u0027ll do their best to face the Sun at all times.
