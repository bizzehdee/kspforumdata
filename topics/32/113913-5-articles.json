As it is for me. My install of Win64 crashed pretty reliably, so I no longer use it because the crash to game ratio was too high, and a Linux partition makes a lot more sense for me.\n\nAs folks have stated (and what seems to be repeatedly ignored), there will always be lucky folks who, through a combination of hardware/drivers/blind luck get this to work reliably enough. And then there will be the rest of the people who, experience has shown, will try to ask for support and intentionally hide the fact that they are using Win64 and having Win64 crashes - who are completely convinced that it\u0027s the mod\u0027s fault, despite it being Win64 instability.\n\nThe publishing of an \u0027UnFixer\u0027 is damaging to the community, disrespectful to the people providing you free content, and ultimately will result in less modders, less mods, and a push for more restrictive licensing (and we\u0027ve already seen this start to happen).

You have an anecdote. This does not in fact change the reality, no matter how many times you repeat an anecdote. You are confusing anecdotes with data\n\nI agree, I will continue doing testing on different Setups.\n\n\u003E I strongly suspect Ferram4 is not a big mean liar and in his install, this thing is still crashing. As it is for me. My install of Win64 crashed pretty reliably, so I no longer use it because the crash to game ratio was too high, and a Linux partition makes a lot more sense for me.\n\nWho is saying that anyone is lying? I trust you, Ferram4 and Squad. I have only provided an isolated scenario in which my KSP is stable.\n\n\u003E The publishing of an \u0027UnFixer\u0027 is damaging to the community, disrespectful to the people providing you free content, and ultimately will result in less modders, less mods, and a push for more restrictive licensing (and we\u0027ve already seen this start to happen). Now, if you feel that your personal crusade is worth that cost, nobody can stop you. But don\u0027t be surprised at what the end result is.\n\nFirst of all, the only reason why I decide to publish the tool was because I thought that it could be useful for someone else (and it was). I agree that it is a dirty hack and there are much better and neat ways to do this. And yes, if I were a modder and I found that someone is hacking my code, I will not be happy with that.\n\nHaving said that, I\u0027m here to contribute and I would like to reach an agreement about a solution which could make happy modders \u0026 users that want to try easily KSP Win x64, and I will be happy to implement this solution. ( I have some ideas that are much more complex to implement but that will have more neat and fair results)"},{"CreatedByName":"Megan","CreatedById":145770,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T09:11:39Z","Content":"Y\u0027all ain\u0027t \u0022contributing.\u0022 You\u0027re hacking off the people who *are*."}]}
