The composite tank they forced the engineers to use in the X-33 failed, but there was a backup. Also, let\u0027s recall that X-33 was a \u003Cstrong\u003Ereusable lifting body\u003C/strong\u003E. The requirements for that are way steeper than just SSTO. Heck, Titan II\u0027s first stage was capable of single-stage-to-orbit with a few dozen kilograms of payload, on \u003Cem\u003Egas generator hypergolics\u003C/em\u003E of 296s specific impulse! Old-Atlas (i.e. balloon-tank) could easily be SSTO with today\u0027s staged combustion kerolox engines. And you could convert SLS into a single-stage-to-orbit design without too much trouble (hah, you could even just not jettison the boosters), although again payload would be quite limited.\u003Cp\u003EThe argument for SSTO hinges on reusability though (you\u0027re not expending anything!), but reusable TSTO has it beat (as Falcon 9 will be proving) in pretty much all the ways that matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, the other tank wasn\u0027t tried. I\u0027m pretty sure the proponents of the failed tank would have said, at the drawing board stage, that it would work. The key in real life is to put a sensible payload. Putting a very small payload in orbit is cheaper with staged rockets than with SSTOs. As for larger payloads, including manned capsules, it\u0027s just not attempted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP, out of necessity, doesn\u0027t present the players with the same constraints as if real life. Funds are plentiful. Otherwise, a realistic space economy would mean funds get so reduced after the first Mun landing that you can no longer send kerbals outside LKO. So you could easily design a picosatellite, mount it into an SLS tank with the KS 25-4 engine cluster and send it straight to the Mun, and probably beyond. Which means you need gameplay constraints to entice players to build staged rockets. In a way, you have to cheat realism there because trying to achieve realism through realistic economic constraints would severely hinder gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Special Agent Sigvan","CreatedById":92033,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-13T01:12:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t think anyone is saying anything about realism being more important than satisfying gameplay.
