And I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s even possible to edit the height of a stock planet\u0027s atmosphere, but I see 3\u00A0problems there already: 1- This is a video game and the height of the atmosphere might not be irreversibly tied to the behaviour of any craft at any given altitude. 2 - Even if that\u0027s the case u would have to make the atmospheres of all planets reach out so far that it\u0027s always dense enough for wings and control surfaces to work if u have any plans of flying all the way to other planets, much more so if u wanna use air breathing engines. And travelling to other bodies brings me to point #3 - time warp. Even just skimming through the last few atoms of the outer atmosphere of any body that has one forces physics warp. Even just flying to the Mun would take HOURS that way, let alone leaving Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E and going interplanetary!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anything, there should be a mod that simulates atmospheric flight by firing thrusters according to the change of an aircraft\u0027s orientation and prograde vector, which, btw, has also been done in the stock game by Scott Manley, albeit all manually:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/XYPxJtra1ws?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FrostedShoe","CreatedById":183418,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-25T11:52:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not just atmosphere you need to make it like star wars, it\u0027s no gravity too.

You\u0027d also need something that calculates your craft\u0027s velocity in reference to the nearest celestial body. That is, so that you\u0027ll come to a relative, instead of an absolute stop -unless you\u0027d like to see how long it would take for the entire galaxy to leave you behind, if you opted for the latter \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s also the problem of how to get into orbit around a celestial body.
