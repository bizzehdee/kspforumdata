I hope I gave him enough spare life support supplies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also noticed heat seems to be a major problem now. Together this raises a few questions... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre nuke engines now more practical on spaceplanes? it seems that without the need for onboard oxidizer, this would be the natural choice for planning SSTO missions with limited wet weight.

It seems like ship designs centered around nuke engines could now benefit from dedicated heat radiators, to keep the engines and fuel tanks cool during long burns.

I generally use a few wings to help radiate heat (my tug lost a bunch of radiative wings with 1.0.2), and you can also use the Gigantors to help. In KSP you\u0027re probably never going to face a burn larger than, say, 4km/s (braking at Moho) if you\u0027re not doing anything strange so if you can recover from that you\u0027re doing just fine.
