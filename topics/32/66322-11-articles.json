Couple of questions here:\u003Cp\u003E1) We already know that some mods will work on 0.23.5, and some won\u0027t (Unity update and all that). So I presume complex things like MechJeb, FAR or KJR will require updating - but what about simple part packs like KW, NovaPunch or FASA? Is there some new strings in the part.cfg, like in 0.22, or we will be able to load use our modded rockets without any problems?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Speaking of mods - how much RAM will 0.23.5 use?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) According to the devs, the plugin-less mods should be fine unless they are somehow incompatible with how the new joints work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Once again, according to the devs, there may be a slight amount of extra memory used, but they\u0027ve done their best to minimize the amount.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cmdr.
