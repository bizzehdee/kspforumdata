Your Arwing looks awesome though even if it doesn\u0027t fly too well, much better than anything I\u0027ve come up with when trying to recreate a plane. I was working on a Firehawk attack jet from Command and Conquer earlier on, and got a design to fly, along with the ability the original has to enter the upper atmosphere using rocket engines. It\u0027s surprisingly stable for a craft without a tailfin, but I\u0027d still not fly it for fun and its range is terrible.
