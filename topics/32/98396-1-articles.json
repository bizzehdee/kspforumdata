I barely get anything out of the Kerbin-Mun orbit. Why? Because of fuel, fuel, fuel - I can never figure out how to get enough mass and fuel into orbit. On the other hand, if I can supply my stations (AKA orbital gas stations) with fuel from the Mun, I can focus on making better ships and not worry about them having little to no fuel by the time they get into stable orbit. Also more crews will be able to return from the Mun. It changes so many things - and also means making new, cool designs for tankers, fuel stations, everything. It will make things both easier AND more fun as I set up a supply network AND have real reasons for a Mun base.

Asteroids, OTOH, mean you don\u0027t have to pinpoint the landing spot of your tanker, fuel the tanker, take off, rv, rinse and repeat.

What fraction of an asteroid\u0027s mass is going to be convertable to fuel? It would take a lot of fuel just to move the asteroid to location where you could use it. Maybe you rendezvous a refinery ship with lots of empty tanks with a passing asteroid...then quickly refine all the fuel out of it that you can, and then separate the refinery with full tanks and take it where you need it. That way you only have to shift the fuel, and not the useless rock mass. Possibly this could be economical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I think refining fuel from the celestial bodies you are exploring (or nearby low-gravity moons) would be more economical because then the fuel is closer to where you need it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
