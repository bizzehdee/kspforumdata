Anyway the best advice I guess I could give is patience, and a good understanding of orbital maneuvering. You can\u0027t just thrust towards your target because you\u0027ll affect your orbit on the other side of the planet and you\u0027ll move away faster than you can correct. You need to sync the orbits so you catch up to your target. Like mentioned above, lower orbit to speed up and higher to slow down. It can be very counter intuitive at times. If you\u0027re ahead of your target but your orbit is going to be lower than your targets orbit, you have to thrust away from it to allow it to catch up. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, again as mentioned, RCS. You can\u0027t really do it without it. As for a step-by-step, this is as I understand it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Align orbit planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Position your apoapsis in exactly the same place as your targets apoapsis (this is your rendezvous point).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Position your periapsis below your targets so you catch up and meet at your apoapsis (next to impossible to judge accurately by eye, maybe mechjeb helps)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. When you catch up to your target at your apoapsis you make your periapsis identical to your targets (Assuming the rest went as planned this is the easy bit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, information required to do this is missing or a pain to get for now. Hopefully that will change soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my experiance (I\u0027m counting orbiter in this as I\u0027ve only done this once in KSP) you need to match up your orbits so you get within 1km of your target and then use RCS to finish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t help with mechjeb or docking side of things, I\u0027m waiting for it to be included as standard. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone more experienced please correct me if I\u0027m wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nhnifong","CreatedById":12196,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-05T21:12:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif you have plenty of fuel, just get close, set your mechjeb rendezvous target to the other craft, and just alternate beween burning RVEL- and TGT\u002B\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EvilotionCR2","CreatedById":27754,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-05T21:18:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got big problems with it too...Try Hyperjump(or how what is it).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KAO","CreatedById":30795,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-05T21:27:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eonce I did my first rendezvous, the others were a piece of cake\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehere\u0027s the skinny:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. if your ship is ahead of your target ship, get a higher altitude than your target ship and circularize.

Launch your rocket using mech jeb at the same altitude as the object you are trying to rendezvous with. This will store necessary data in mech jeb for a timed launch. Once the ascent autopilot disengages you can end the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Now get the same rocket on the pad for the actual rendezvous. At the bottom of the ascent autopilot window there is a \u0022time launch with rendezvous\u0022 button. Press this and select the object you wish to rendezvous with. Mech jeb will use the data collected in the previous launch to perfectly time your rendezvous! Note: you will warp on the pad, so be aware your rocket may get damaged (explode) when it comes out of warp. Let mech jeb do its thing and you should end up close to your target!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

If your still dealing with the solar map.. Yes orbital corrections are needed to catch your target. If your in visual range (the game is showing you target distance) then you can just direct thrust, because you\u0027ll accelerate then decelerate to catch your target long before your orbit has an extreme effect on your direction... providing your orbits are relatively well matched anyway.. The more matched your orbits, the longer the window you have to do this in.

Look not so much where your ship and the target are now, but look ahead along their trajectory lines and manuever to bring those lines together. Match orbital planes but slightly above to let the target catch with you or slight below to catch up with the target, and once you get within about 20km, you can start gently steering directly for the target. But don\u0027t let your approach speed get too high, or you\u0027ll lose the trajectory match and/or not be able to brake in time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
