One thing thats been featured in the 1.0 preview videos is the smoke ejecting from the sides of the launch pad and spread across the ground during landings/launches. First of all, it looks amazing. Great job SQUAD. It\u0027s those little things that really make the game feel more complete. But secondly, could the new smoke be adapted or be a precursor to a cloud system the same way destructible buildings were for upgradable buildings. I mean just look at it; it\u0027s voluminous and translucent and really looks like they could be clouds or dust storms on atmospheric bodies. I don\u0027t know a bit of coding so I don\u0027t know how easy it would be to adapt it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oVOrFzu.png?2\u0022 alt=\u0022oVOrFzu.png?2\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T00:28:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust make EVE stock...please.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brofessional","CreatedById":2080,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T00:29:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe, but I doubt it.
