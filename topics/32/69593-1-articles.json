When I need ion power I grab for an MPD thruster first and don\u0027t even think about the lower thrust alternatives. I personally think those parts should add their mass to the craft overall because spamming them (or use on a small enough ship) does make a difference but their mass should be added at the CoM of the part they are attached to (chaining back to the nearest non-massless part in the tree). This prevents imperfect balancing while still avoiding the exploit and ultimately everyone wins. Then again, \u0027cheaty\u0027 is a personal term.
