Currently I have a probe around the Mun, and a space station core in orbit around Kerbin. Should I launch some more Mun probes, or build my station? Or should I land on the Mun for the first time in this save? My rocket flies like a noodle but I can probably fix it with moar struts."},{"CreatedByName":"Phil deCube","CreatedById":120897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T02:31:54Z","Content":"In sandbox mode it doesn\u0027t matter what you do next. That\u0027s why I don\u0027t particularly like sandbox mode. There are no goals. There is nothing to discover. You have all the parts. If you are looking for direction, give career mode a try."},{"CreatedByName":"Teilnehmer","CreatedById":143330,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T02:41:34Z","Content":"In sandbox mode, it doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t matter what you do next.

Things like:\n\n1) Send an orbital probe to every planet and moon\n\n2) Start full scale ore mining operations on Minmus or even better somewhere like Pol \n\n3) Start designing and testing parts building towards what will become a Jool-5 challenge entry\n\n4) Send a Kerbal to explore the mohole via EVA and then return to Kerbin"},{"CreatedByName":"OddFunction","CreatedById":143805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T03:04:38Z","Content":"My favourite thing to do in sandbox is build enormous, impractical rockets, and to strap 4-5 Kerbals on top, aiming for whatever planet looks shiniest.

It\u0027s only 1,256,637m, so if each base is around 10km apart, that\u0027s a mere 126 of them to land.

Go for your Mun landing, then build a bigger lander with a rover and land that. Or build an all-in-one space station and launch it in one big launch.\n\nI\u0027ve also had a lot of fun building a practical modular rover with a docking port on the back that can take a bunch of different payload modules (science, fuel, ore, etc)."}]}
