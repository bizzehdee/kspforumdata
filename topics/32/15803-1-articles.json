He\\\u0027s a decent rookie like myself, but he\\\u0027d cut some corners thanks to my experience and prone to insanity. That resulted the Massive Attack II type of rocket. While it\\\u0027s fun for me to watch this, poor Kerbals suffer from the deputy director of KSC a great deal. But to cut the intro short(er) here\\\u0027s the deal:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- He launhced the MA II, and managed to litter his trail with debris\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- He got into a highly inclined (almost polar) Munar orbit and failed to land safely - pod stranded\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Sent one poor Kerbal to EVA - KIA\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Two Kerbals left in the pod for weeks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few days later outside of the Kerbal universe their original director decided to attempt the seemingly impossible: rescue the rest of the ill fated crew. So I had to design a craft for that from scratch. Specifics were:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Stock parts only (as I haven\\\u0027t got any mods, hehe)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Ensure manuverability for precision landing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Lightweight, 3 person craft\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Minimze orbital debris\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- NO SAVES USED\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took about three test launches \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eand crews\u003C/span\u003E to get it \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Efairly\u003C/span\u003E right. (Sadly that also meant Jeb waiting for his turn of coming out of the cloning facility.) But I eventually prepared the Munar 2, made mostly from 0.16 parts. Scott Kerman was a bit reluctant to go, as he had explosive experiences with the Massive Attack series, but he was chosen exactly for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAscent was a bit tricky as with gaining altitude the Munar 2 lost stability for some reason and it was really hard to stabilize things without wasting RCS. Similar to Scott Manley\\\u0027s experience. In the end I managed to get rid of the last lifting stage (with more than half of a large tank of fuel left) at the cost of all three tanks of RCS fuel and quite a bit of the TMI stage fuel reserves. Poor prospects for my rescue mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I had to exploit the fuel bug, if I wanted to carry on. I did, shame on me. But after bad luck, came a bit of good as well. My approach to the Mun was fairly inclined, so I needed less fuel to get into the proper orbit. Thanks to the bug exploit (again, shame on me), I still had the TMI stage to do this. I got a 44x53 km orbit seemingly along the correct plane. But before that the TMI stage ran out of fuel, so it broke my zero debris left behind rule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother fun fact, that the landing site was on the dark side of the Mun, but as I had a functioning command pod there I knew that the altimiter cheats approx. 500 meters and the area is quite flat. Scott then preformed my second succsessful Munar landing with a faulty craft, without any RCS. \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EOf course I botched it and the craft fell over, but I managed to get it straight up on the second try with the landing legs.\u003C/span\u003E It was huge succsess considering Scott landed in 11 kms from the stranded pod. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen came the EVAs from the MA II pod to the Munar 2. The guys preformed well \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eapart from ragdolling a bit on the surface\u003C/span\u003E and had plenty of RCS fuel left when they arrived. Then again they met some faulty engineering again, as some idiot forgot to put enough ladder on the side... But they used their mastery of RCS and got safely on board anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen Scott fired the engines, headed to 270 degrees and preformed a textbook Mun escape to Kerbin aerobraking orbit. The return was safe and sound, max G didn\\\u0027t even exceed 3 and the guys landed in a nice forest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYAY! 8)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.s. 1 screenshots underway\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.s. 2 Can you tell me what\\\u0027s with the parchute textures?
