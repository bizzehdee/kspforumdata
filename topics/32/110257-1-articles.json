At the midpoint between ascending node and descending node the prograde vector will always be 90 degrees or 270 degrees, no matter the inclination. Between those points and the nodes themselves the vector will fall between 90 and 90\u002B/-Inclination or between 270 and 270\u002B/-Inclination.

Adjustments can easily be made by watching prograde marker through at least a half orbit... make a note of its maximum deviation from the horizon, the next time you hit the point of maximum deviation will be at the next node (ascending or descending). Even getting in the ballpark (plus or minus a few degrees of phase) will allow you to create a fairly equatorial orbit with only a single adjustment. This method works even for elliptical orbits. (Though I make no promises about efficiency)\n\n@Redironcrown, I\u0027m pretty sure he\u0027s talking about the fact that normal vector shows inclination, since navball polar alignment is always correct.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T05:03:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 05:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by impyre**"}]}
