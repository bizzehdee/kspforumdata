Danny2462 had it happen to him as #8 of the 25 Things to Do With Your Kerbals, back in August 2012. Note how different the game was back then!\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/qzjg6KVqdFQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nSome people have wanted to fix it, but I\u0027m personally fine with this little bug.

My first mun landing had enough fuel to get there, land and only get part way back up. So when the rescue craft got there, I orbited at a low altitude to mun. I launched the anemic lander to about 13k altitude and had Valentina jump. She circularized with nothing but RCS and dead reckoning. I then swooped in with the rescue craft and took her home. I could hear the anemic rocket crash into the moon as I was doing my manual maneuver.
