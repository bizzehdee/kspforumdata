I have watched more youtube videos than i care to tell you. I have crashed into the mun about a dozen times. I absolutly hate this game and for some odd reason i cant put it down. Where does the mun surface actually sit? is it 400m or is it 1600???? I am soooo frustrated at this. When i do land before i even make it back to earth I am going to have me a nice little happy dance. Probably not so little to think about it. Im going to scream at the heavens my accomplishments.... dammit, just wanted to vent.

If not, it\u0027s a real bitch to set down on the surface. Fix that first. If you are, then be aware that the surface level changes depending on where you\u0027re putting down. I tend to slow my descent to \u0026lt;10m/s when I\u0027m ~3km up, and look for my shadow to get a more accurate read of my altitude.
