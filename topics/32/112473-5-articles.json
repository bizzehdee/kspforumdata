With an easy UI (no limits remember ?) I could make that happen.\n\nGoing strictly inside the actual game, but infinite resources, Really huge spaces stations (Like an ISS but for each planets/moon), with equally huge ships (as an example, a huge tanker with a lot of everything in it.\n\nAlso huge Moon bases on every moon.

Yes. Or even better, bridges connecting every planet and moon in the solar system.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E A space station that goes all the way around Kerbin.\n\nEven better, a hollow spherical space station that completely SURROUNDS Kerbin. Or even better, the entire solar system. Although I suppose that could just be called a dyson sphere.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I would build a massive base on Duna or Minmus that is many square kilometers in size.\n\nI would rather build bases that cover every square meter of land area on said planets. Or all of them.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Huge stations and huge interplanetary spaceships!\n\nNow, what is your definition of \u0027interplanetary\u0027? If the planets in KSP Unlimited weren\u0027t on rails, I\u0027d want a spaceship that, rather than moving between planets, *moves the planets themselves.*\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I would install the mod that adds other solar systems. Then build a mothership likely 15-20 kilometers long (picture a Titan from Eve Online) which would carry other motherships which carry smaller ships. Then I would go from system to system dropping off the smaller motherships which would explore and colonize each system. I would also have to be able to carry hundreds or thousands of Kerbals.\n\nGreat start. After doing that, I would create a mothership that carries *those* motherships, with a population of millions of kerbals. The mothership itself would act like a self-sufficient KSC, capable of hiring astronauts and scientists from the rotating colony modules, building, upgrading and repairing its own facilities, and doing everything a spacecraft or the KSC can do in the current game. The mothership would travel to every corner of the galaxy, droping off thousands of sub-motherships, each carrying hundreds of reconnaissance and exploration probes, terraformer vehicles, communications satellites, flag-planter craft, and huge colony ships\n\n\u003E \n\u003E A planet miner. Also cities. I\u0027d make Kerbin just like earth, with cities, farms, history, culture, FOOD, pizza, pizza, water, factories, pizza (I\u0027m getting hungry)\n\nI agree that Kerbin should have its own cities, history, plants and animals, culture, nations and everything else earth has. Right now it is completely uninhabited except for the KSC.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Seriously though, I would probably do a realistic long term colony mission to Laythe. Balancing for radiation shielding and full sized rockets to return from the surface. It would be like Avatar (blue people movie) in a nutshell. I would also make an entire video series based on it.\n\n\u0027Blue people movie\u0027 - Avera9eJoe, 2015. \n\nBut yeah, I would love to see something where you could colonise and terraform laythe, bringing visible greenery spreading over its landmasses and islands, while the Kerbals autonomously build their own cities and divide into their own nations.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I would build a space empire. Huge bases on every moon. With a large network of stations and outposts.\n\nWith AI Alien empires spread over the galaxy, creating an interstellar empire would be quite enjoyable. Since KSP Unlimited has a realistic (100s of billions) number of stars per galaxy, it would be good if a \u0027auto-expand\u0027 option came up, where the empire\u0027s colonies would autonomously build up their own populations and infrastructure before launching their own colonies. This, plus a lot of higher timewarp settings, would be perfect. You could just sit back and watch your empire expand through the galaxy, with separatist rebel colonies forming and reintegrating... until a notification comes up saying your first intergalactic mission has reached its target, or a new technology has been researched. And then the game would automatically drop back to real time.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Death Star. No wait! death System! NO WAIT! DEATH GALAXY!!!!!!!!!!!! MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA!!!\n\nOnce you build enough antimatter factories in your empire, perhaps you could create planet-sized lumps of antimatter and launch them at your enemies. Once you have enough antimatter, you could perhaps even crate anti-stars with self-sufficient nuclear fusion of anti-hydrogen and anti-helium. A quick back-of the-envelope calculation suggests that if an anti-star were to collide with a normal star, in addition to informing every alien race in the universe of your existence and location, it would look really awesome.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E If I had no limits, i would try to land the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn(softly) on Kerbin. Work my way to having all but Jool landed on Kerbin. Maybe put Kerbin(plus landed planets) in Jool orbit as a moon. All with rockets. If I had no limits, if the planets weren\u0027t on rails. If I had absolutely no limits and with other stars? Attempt to equal a black hole using the same method but with stars.\n\nNew idea: moving every planet/asteroid/moon/comet into their stars habitable zone, and merging all bodies that are too small into a kerbin-sized body while breaking larger planets into kerbin-sized chunks. Congrats, infinite habitable worlds!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d build this out of stock parts:\n\u003E \n\u003E [![4CxiYwl.png](http://i.imgur.com/4CxiYwl.png)](http://imgur.com/4CxiYwl)\n\u003E \n\u003E  And then I would fly it to ALL the modded-in star systems.\n\nPlease tell me where you got that from. I NEED IT!!!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Put the solar system inside of a spherical space station.\n\nEven better: build a solid sphere thousands of light years in diameter. The gravity alone would be immense, but if we turned the gravity down we could also use billions of orbiting stars to \u0027terraform\u0027 the surface, and *voila!* a single habitable planet, almost as big as a small galaxy and with a surface area that makes the entire world of minecraft look like a speck of dust. And if we were to seed the planet with plants, animals and microbes, just imagine all the trillions of unique ecosystems pop up, some of which become intelligent civilizations who could live, consume resources and expand almost forever since their nearest rival is several light-years away. Since they have a near-infinite space to expand, it is likely they would be too spread out too quickly to kill themselves, and nothing they do (fossil fuel burning, nuclear war etc) will change the planets climate. They could expand so much that they each evolve into multiple different species, just because of the separation caused by the long travel times between different points in their former species\u0027 empire. And because of murphy\u0027s law, we will have billion-kilometer-long mountains dozens of kilometers high, oceans the size of solar systems with not a single point of land above 5000 meters below sea level, light-year-long rivers, hurricanes the size of supergiant stars, volcanoes that create million-light-year-wide lakes of lava, canyons that could hold the volume of entire stars with room to spare, and things we can\u0027t even imagine until we see it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E A Dyson Sphere ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![dyson-sphere-artist-2.jpg](http://en.es-static.us/upl/2013/05/dyson-sphere-artist-2.jpg)\n\nInspirational image is inspirational.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Add 500 more modules to my space station.\n\nOr a near-infinite space station labyrinth with *trillions* of modules.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Planning interstellar highway missions would also be cool.\n\nAgreed. If we want to travel 15 billion kilometres in a grand-tour, doing it at a \u0027really fast\u0027 driving speed of 200km/h would take only 8556 years! At a half-walking-half-resting pace of 1km/h, the journey would take 1.711 million years, and this pace would get you to alpha centauri in around 4.7 billion years.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E A bridge to connect KSC to the Island air field... ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nNow this is something I want in the actual game.
