I\u0027ve had the game become unresponsive(to my clicks and button presses, but will still be running) multiple times because of leaving to eat dinner or mow the lawn and I just would like to know what the cause is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-21T22:01:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMemory leaks, probably. A process within KSP (maybe stock, maybe a mod) may need 1 MB of memory, and for reasons returns only 995k of that. And say this gets called 5 times per second. That\u0027s 25k per second which may not look like a lot but give it time and it will run your system out of memory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother suspect is your screen saver which really doesn\u0027t like KSP.
