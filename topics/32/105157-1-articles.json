Now I think even that has changed due to the new aerodynamics so now I\u0027m completely lost. I didn\u0027t even play 0.9! So I\u0027m wondering, what are all the new numbers; gravity turn altitude, maximum speed you should have during liftoff to avoid wasting fuel, dV to orbit Kerbin, the mun, the furthest planet, what engines are good for what etc etc. Perhaps people can post they\u0027re data and new things to know about 1.0 below for noobs and returning players in one spot.

Anyone know the technical reason why?\n\nIn the old aero model the atmosphere was reaaallly soupy and you\u0027d lose a lot of energy to drag. Now that it behaves more like air and less like treacle, there\u0027s far less drag slowing your ship down and so you can get into orbit far more efficiently"},{"CreatedByName":"godefroi","CreatedById":101728,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T15:24:26Z","Content":"Because the atmosphere isn\u0027t made of nearly-dry concrete anymore.\n\nAlso, if you\u0027ve been using NEAR or FAR, you know how to do proper gravity turns, and the techniques are the same in 1.0: Start your turn at ~70-100 m/s, nudge over a few degrees, follow prograde to orbit. If you have a large circularization burn at the end, you didn\u0027t turn over fast enough. It\u0027s more about watching your \u0022time to apoapsis\u0022 than anything, really, just ensure that it keeps climbing slowly, and once you hit about 90 seconds to apoapsis, keep it somewhere there in the neighborhood. Nosing up will increase time to apoapsis, nosing down will reduce time to apoapsis. If you do it right, you finish your boost phase with your periapsis just underground (I shoot for -10m) so your booster will hit the ground (or burn up now), and your circularization burn is small, under 100m/s.\n\nAlso, 1.2-1.4 TWR is plenty. Remember, Saturn V left the pad with a TWR of 1.18.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T15:29:43Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 03:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by godefroi**"},{"CreatedByName":"Quazar87","CreatedById":141804,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T15:25:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I wonder why it takes less dV to get into orbit? Anyone know the technical reason why?\n\nFrom what I can tell, the new atmosphere is much less soupy. And it\u0027s the deltaV that you expend earlier in the flight that costs the most, where you fight inertia and the atmosphere the most. In the previous stock versions it was thick but it dropped off fast, meaning you would do a much more abrupt turn to reach orbit. Now we can use a much more ballistically efficient gravity turn."},{"CreatedByName":"Hannu","CreatedById":60596,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T15:26:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I wonder why it takes less dV to get into orbit?
