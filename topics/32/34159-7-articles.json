Everyone in my class knows I\u0027m obsessed with aviation and astronomy, and for a book project I read the book \u003Cem\u003EApollo\u003C/em\u003E and I had to do some visual presentation, so I decided to recreate Apollo 11 in KSP, made my own version of the Saturn V, recorded me doing the entire mission, and brought that in on a flash drive. I showed it to my class, and they were all asking questions like, \u0022Can you land on the Sun?\u0022 \u0022Can you land on Saturn?\u0022 \u0022Can you make a boat?\u0022 and I ended up sparking a lot of interest in the game. The next week after, some of my classmates were saying they downloaded the demo or had their parents buy the game.
