To my consternation, I found myself orbiting Jool the opposite direction that Laythe was (which I believe is called Retrograde). This makes entering orbit around Laythe difficult, because it\u0027s orbital speed is added to yours. I tried a few times but I just couldn\u0027t burn enough to circularize the orbit around Laythe, or even come close. So I knew I had to use aerobraking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a few trial and error attempts, I set up a periapsis of 18,000 meters above Laythe. This altitude will brake you right into orbit, with an apoapsis of about 600,000 meters. So if you find yourself in that situation, that\u0027s the magic number for a retrograde entry into Laythe orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, remember to pull in your solar panels. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T04:30:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eugh thats the worst. especially when your mission is to any of the other non atmosphere moons. i can never enter joolian orbit the right way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"liweih","CreatedById":62796,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T04:36:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love and hate aerobraking so much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T05:10:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I did this, I overshot to around 12000m, then quicksaved just outside atmo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter many hercuean tries, I managed to pull off a complicated chain of micromanagement (including uneven fuel pumping while engines were running) to pull out of a crash, using some of the original kerbin circularization engines that were still attached but unfueled.
