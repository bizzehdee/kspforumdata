This is why there are no cities on Kerbin, only KSC. There is no need for any of that because the fungal mat only grows Kerbals when and as needed, and only in the specific place it needs them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fungal mat also can perceive through its Kerbals, so by sending Kerbals out in space, the fungal mat learns about the universe and other planets. Plus, when Kerbals die, they release a cloud of spores, which seeds the fungal mat on other planets, either directly or via eventual panspermia by spores drifting in space. The Kerbals themselves, however, have no more sense of self than does any organ of our own bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to names, the fungal mat is the one and only Kerman--that\u0027s what it calls itself. It gives Kerbals individual names depending on their function in relation to its body. Being a fungal mat, Kerman\u0027s anatomy is totally different from our own, so you have to use analogies. Such as, \u0022Oblorf Kerman\u0022 actually means something like \u0022The Left Big Toe of the Kerman\u0022. Most Kerbals of course have totally alien names but there are naturally going to be some that coincidentally sound like proper English names. However, this is along the same lines of how every race of beings in the universe has a drink whose name sounds very much like \u0022gin and tonic\u0022, even if the ingredients and purpose of the drink are totally different \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EExplanation 2:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals are synthetic lifeforms made by a race of pan-dimensional, hyper-intelligent beings for totally unknown purposes of their own. Are Kerbals part of some grand experiment? Is watching them struggle and die simply a sick form of entertainment? Who can say? All that is known for sure is that the hyper-intelligent, plan-dimensional beings are the folks who created and placed all the monoliths and these monoliths are what make Kerbals. The one at KSC is the output end of the Kerbal factory, from which all Kerbals are spawned. The others scattered about the system gather the raw materials from their surroundings. There being so many monoliths on Mun, the Kerbals are more Mun-dust than anything else, which is why the explode in a cloud of gray dust when they die.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbals are all self-aware and vary in personality, bravery, and stupidity. However, they are completely without reproductive systems. They are created when and as needed by the KSc monolith, which also assigns a random name to each one. \u0022Kerman\u0022 just means \u0022synthetic life-form, small, green\u0022 in the language of the hyper-intelligent, pan-dimensional beings, but their 1st names are chosen randomly from a databank of names used by all other races in all other universes and dimensions. Thus, occasionally a Kerbal has a name familiar to any given other lifeform. But there are no cities or anything else on Kerbin because the only Kerbals in existence are those spawned by the KSC monolith.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T15:29:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreen.
