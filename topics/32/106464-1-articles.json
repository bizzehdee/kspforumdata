None of them over heat or even glow. I deleted everything and re-installed KSP. Any ideas would be helpful.\n\nHmmm, strange bug. Any mods installed? I will say, for what it\u0027s worth I\u0027ve seen an abnormally large amount of bugs for a KSP release. I think just about everything that could fail has failed for me, including my engine FX being blown up to size with the galaxy map. I\u0027d ride it out until 1.0.1 and see if that fixes stuff up a bit personally. I didn\u0027t even want to post this answer because of recent threads etc but it\u0027s the truth of the matter.\n\nAlso have you tried the NERVA? I\u0027d be surprised if that doesn\u0027t overheat. But no other engines of mine have gained any heat yet either from the looks of it but I also haven\u0027t dabbled with the NERVA yet."},{"CreatedByName":"majortimekiller","CreatedById":142463,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T18:03:22Z","Content":"If anyone could help me out... My generation factor is set to .030. I have never touched anything in debug toolbar before. I set it to 1.0 and everything heated up like crazy. So my question is what is the Normal setting for Generation factor."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T18:57:25Z","Content":"0.030.\n\n10char."}]}
