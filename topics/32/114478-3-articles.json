Why has everything taken such a sudden change?\n\nBefore Kerbal Space Program was in a developmental stage. Nobody ever critiqued anything too harshly because we knew absolutely everything was open to change. We loved and admired all the positives and cared little for the negatives because we always expected them to be changed or fixed by the full release.\n\nOut of the blue though \u0022beta\u0022 was announced. Beta in quotation marks because there was absolutely no such thing as beta. What squad released as a beta was just a preview release to see what squad was working on. There was no testing involved in beta because there was nothing to test. Everything in Beta was just a polished version of everything in alpha.\n\nThis is because in a similar fashion to the beta announcement... Version 1.0 was announced! And with version 1.0 Squad dropped in several *untested* and unrefined game aspects. The larger landing gear released in 1.0 do not have spinning animations or steering... or suspension... Aerodynamics and heat came out of nowhere and are still being changed.\n\nEven the fairings and heat shields were released with flawed mass and drag values. Causing capsules reentering to flip over and explode.\n\nBugs that existed since the first public release still exist. Game performance and FPS are nearly at an all time low.\n\nTechnically this \u0022Full Release\u0022 is not a full release because it is still being tested. We should still be in *BETA* right now because it is evident little to no testing has gone into the full release.\n\n**We can\u0027t overlook these flaws anymore because Squad is selling it as an officially finished product.**\n\nThe currently negative outlook by a large part of the community is entirely misread. We only care so much because this is one of our favorite games ever made.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-29T00:47:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2015 12:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jon144**"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T00:52:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E **We can\u0027t overlook these flaws anymore because Squad is selling it as an officially finished product.**\n\nIf I asked you to count the number of stars in all the cosmos, would the task ever be complete?

I respect their direction and I love their game and have no complaints because they continue to provide support and updates. But the fact is that this isn\u0027t a \u0022finished game\u0022.

It\u0027s the nature of software development. But what many of us are complaining about is the fact that there are annoying bugs that have been present for several releases that still have not been fixed, and the fact that new bugs have been introduced because of rushing releases and an apparent lack of general quality assurance/testing. The temperature gauge memory leak, the trailing launch clamps post-launch, the save-breaking heat shields of 1.0.3, and the NullRef log spam with the parachutes in 1.0.4 are all examples issues that should have been easily detected if they had tested the game properly before their respective releases. When I was last working as a web applications developer, my boss would have fired me if I had consistent bug-ridden code like KSP does; now granted I was writing web services for multi-million dollar e-commerce sites in which my code handled pricing and payment transactions, so a screw up by me could have cost that company a lot of money, so I had that type of pressure to test my stuff thoroughly."},{"CreatedByName":"severedsolo","CreatedById":80345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T04:06:36Z","Content":"People like to get up on the soapbox.\n\nPre 1.0 announcements, a load of people made a big deal about aero.

It doesn\u0027t affect me at all because I backed up 1.0.2, and I play FAR and NF HC anyway. But some have argued in this thread that it might confuse new people, and I can see that point of view.

We\u0027re not all complaining because we\u0027re bitter, old, nasty, \u0022entitled,\u0022 elitists, or whatever the slur of the day might be. Some of us are sincerely trying to look at the broader picture, and how all this affects KSP in the long run.\n\nAnd of course there\u0027s always the issue of mods, which have to be recompiled (at least) or reconsidered practically from scratch (at worst). Career saves are also an issue for some, though I used career as a tutorial because sandbox overwhelmed me - regardless, that\u0027s a point of view that, though it\u0027s not necessarily mine, isn\u0027t invalid. Even non-career saves can be effectively broken, hundreds of hours of play thrown out the window, if someone has a ship or station in orbit that he\u0027s worked hard on, that\u0027s suddenly rendered useless because the laws of the universe have suddenly changed.
