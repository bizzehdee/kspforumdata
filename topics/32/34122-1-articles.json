When all engines are off, it reads .00 since I am in orbit, and when the unblocked engine is at full throttle, the accelerometer reads .03 as well.

Right now, things like the mainsail have thrust damage enabled - the same block of code which also handles disabling any thrust it produces if it happens to be blocked. Some of the smaller engines have it disabled since they\u0027re generally too small to cause any damage to parts (like the ion engine), so the actual thrust-being-blocked parts and causing-damage parts need to be separated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Colonel_Panic","CreatedById":61997,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T19:28:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy guess is it wasn\u0027t implemented the same as liquid engines because the nature of the engine is different. Clearly if you have an ion engine completely blocked, it shouldn\u0027t give you any thrust, however, since it operates via a combination of expulsion and magnetic repulsion, and at such a low rate of expulsion, the exhaust can probably still produce usable energy while dissipating, even when something is in the way directly behind.
