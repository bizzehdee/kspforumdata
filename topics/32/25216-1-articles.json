I\u0027ve got an older mid-class cpu Athlon X4 640 3Ghz and just docked a 360 and a 150 part ship without bigger problems. Navigating and time acceleration is a bit slow, but works fine otherwise, since the game slows the time down to some degree. Of course, you need more patience this way. Until now the game didn\u0027t use more than 4gb ram, but this seems highly relateted to the ammount of mods you use.

The next console generation will bring a big step forwards in graphics and physics. Especially the last one was very limited with this generation. The best, or at least less costly idea would be to wait for the next consoles. That will show you how good your hardware needs to be for the new games. And more importantly, competition will also pick up, since many gamers will again have reasons to upgrade their systems, so the prices will go down.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-03T04:00:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2013 04:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Temeter\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThatBum","CreatedById":57405,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T04:01:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGraphically, KSP isn\u0027t too intensive at its highest settings, as it\u0027s just DX9.
