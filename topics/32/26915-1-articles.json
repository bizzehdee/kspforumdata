Thank you calculator!\u003Cp\u003E((side note to any REAL mathematicians, correct me if I\u0027m wrong))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your idea, I personally think it\u0027s a bit far fetched. First off, there\u0027s no clear indication of how far Eeloo is from Kerbin, as it varies depending on it\u0027s orbital position. Though, in all honesty, I doubt it would ever reach anywhere near ~4 Terameters even on their most distance positions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFTL travel is not possible in reality(as far as I know), but this is probably the best place for Squad to get creative with the theories behind intersolar travel by creating a visual representation of what \u003Cem\u003Efeasible\u003C/em\u003E FTL travel would look like! Why should they pass up on that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThree ways of solving this, 1) do the 1/10 scaling, this would require some new class of engines like advanced fusion or antimatter to bring the travel times down to say 20 years, problem is that this engines will make traveling inside the solar system trivial as in single stage grand, would also require decent trust so you could land on all bodies at least without atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) scale down interstellar distances to something like 20 times the distance to Jool. It would still feel like an long distance but you can travel with existing systems like an nuclear asparagus or ion with an sun slingshot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn both of this settings you will have to solve the accuracy issues. Sending an probe far out in kraken land and follow it all the time tend to deorbit things back home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) FTL escapes most of this problems as you load the new system and unload the old. Would probably work like the ftl drive in Nivens know space, you has to be far out to activate it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eboth 2 and 3 is posible but 3 is easier to make in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThePyrateCaptain","CreatedById":57208,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T13:47:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Reavermyst\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Reavermyst\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere is word that they MAY develop an FTL engine in future updates.
