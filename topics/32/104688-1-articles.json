So, maybe just maybe I might come back to playing KSP and loving it with some videos and streams. We\u0027ll have to wait and see though. What\u0027s everyone\u0027s thoughts on 1.0 at the moment? The new fairings, female kerbals, resources system, heat and aerodynamics upgrades..this has to be thee single largest update to the game ever and I can\u0027t wait to get back to it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-22T17:21:36Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2015 05:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Damion Rayne**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T17:20:43Z","Content":"Oh really?!
