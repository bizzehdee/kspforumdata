It does a pretty alright job, and it always has, but I\u0027d sort of like something that does more than a pretty alright job. I also don\u0027t have the fund to rebuild the computer from the ground up like I should have done with this one, so I am looking at a mid life upgrade. I\u0027m pretty sure that even by winter the 79XX will not be in my price range, so right now I am thinking of an HD 7870, which currently depending on which one, I could get for as low as $230 after rebate. Since I am aiming for more like November/December (I am thinking christmas present actually) I could probably get one for a nice low price, or something a bit better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy understanding is that even though the 7xxx series use PCIe 3.0, they don\u0027t really care if they use something older, since I have no plans on upgrading my motherboard (not that a PCI 3.0 uATX card that supports an AMD processor is a thing that exists).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, while I expect I will ultimately get something that can measure this properly, I have to assume that my computer is already pretty close to blowing the 460w PSU, seeing as it was off the shelf and I stuck another hard drive in it. Unfortunately, my favourite power calculator will not work for me, and the ASUS one is suggesting I need 500 to 550 watts, which I obviously don\u0027t (I might if I tried to charge 6 cell phones with my computer while playing GTA IV). On that note, I know pretty much diddly squat about power supplies, but given the power jump from a 6770 to a 7870 I\u0027m gussing I want to go to at least 600w, perhaps higher if I am counting on reusing it in a future computer (in that case I might aim for 750). Now, right now there is this 700 watt on for just under a hundred, plus a rebate, but I know absoutely nothing about which ones are prone to conking out or frying things (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=4362115\u0026amp;Sku=O261-2018\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=4362115\u0026amp;Sku=O261-2018\u003C/a\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo any advice there would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, am I just being stupid with upgrading the computer now?
