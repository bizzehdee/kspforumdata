(It can do it, barely, as seen in the screenshot.) Without the probe it easily has enough delta-V to do all the rescue missions. The intakes are large enough that I can get up to ~1700m/s and ~30km before switching to rocket mode, which means it doesn\u0027t waste much fuel getting to orbital speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to what I did today: ROVERS. You see, I have two basic rover types that I use. Both are Kethane refineries, so that I can refuel any vessel that lands on whatever moon/planet the rovers are based on (as long as you land close enough, anyway). Granted, I\u0027ve got several other Kethane-based vessels to refuel things in orbit, but I figured I\u0027d want some excuse to make rovers as well. They\u0027re just fun to play with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first is the \u003Cstrong\u003EIguana\u003C/strong\u003E class of rovers; ~25 tons, can hold 2 men (or run unmanned), VTOL engines to let it jump ridges and such, small kethane refinery and drills. In my previous career save, I had a few of these scattered around the various planets to help out; I could fly one straight to Mun or Minmus from LKO using solely its onboard fuel and the VTOL engines, like so:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RM5aK3F.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RM5aK3F.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s an older picture, but the basic design hasn\u0027t changed much since then; I\u0027ve tweaked the fuel amounts a bit, and moved some parts around. It\u0027s just a really handy design; the only problem I\u0027ve had is ripping the tires up by turning at high speed, but as long as there\u0027s a kerbonaut onboard he can get out and fix it easily and with 8 wheels you can lose a couple and still drive just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETonight, though, I put the finishing touches on my main mobile base design, \u003Cstrong\u003EMun Unit Zappa\u003C/strong\u003E. It used to use dozens of the largest stock wheels, but I\u0027ve switched to treads from a mod:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EEME7uh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EEME7uh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E511 tons (sans Kethane), 22 treads, and it holds a metric buttload of fuel. Its acceleration is terrible, as is the braking, but if you\u0027re going in a straight line it can cruise at ~10m/s indefinitely. The main body are 5m tanks (KW Rocketry), for reference, so it\u0027s really just a big honking vehicle that drives more like a train than a car. The greenhouse modules from HOME are purely cosmetic, but I like the aesthetic for my bases/stations and they don\u0027t waste much mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI sent a 200-ton smaller version of this to Mun in the last career, but I haven\u0027t launched this one yet. The lifting isn\u0027t the problem, I\u0027ve got a 12k-ton SSTO booster than can lift my 900-ton stations easily, so this is actually a bit on the small side. Its center of mass is exactly inside the central junction, which means it can easily handle skyhooks and such; I just haven\u0027t finished designing the transfer stages yet. (The old version had onboard engines with a TWR of ~0.35, but I haven\u0027t done that on this one.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETonight\u0027s efforts, though, involved making it capable of docking with an Iguana:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ebRx6Aj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ebRx6Aj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, if you pull the Iguana under the front end and line them up, it\u0027ll dock automatically onto a couple downward-facing ports. Really handy for transferring fuel and such, although with the KAS winches and the asteroid claw it\u0027s pretty easy to dock other ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I just have to figure out where on Mun I want this behemoth.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"corvustech","CreatedById":111036,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-16T12:59:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter having my space program entirely reset by what I now call the Glue Kraken (nothing undocks again, EVER) I added more mods.

This is known as \u0022limbo\u0022 on a tidally locked mess like the Mun. It took all of my remaining fuel to reach Kerbin\u0027s orbit, and much of my RCS fuel used as emergency thrust to reach Kerbin.
