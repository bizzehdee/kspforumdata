Now that I\u0027ve made some simple stations, I wanted to make a \u0022floating city\u0022 type of a thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VzWHdQLl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VzWHdQLl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease excuse the *ahem* shape of it currently, I plan to have rings of modules radiating outward from all sides, but that\u0027s where this problem arises. I\u0027ve done searching around the forum and wiki about multiport docking, and actually, the two modules connected to the center tower are connected by 2 ports each that both are docked. However, I wanted to test putting a module between them as a sort of corner, but that requires 4 ports to come together. When I tried it, only the top two ports, near the cupola capsule, docked while the bottom two don\u0027t seem to do anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QubADhRl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QubADhRl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI undocked and came back in with the two lower port angled down so they\u0027s contact first, and they still didn\u0027t seem to recognize the others and when the top ports came down, they docked again. This caused me to rotate the module as seen in the screenshot above, so the capsule was facing the opposite direction, but the same thing appeared to happen, ruling out the ports on the station. Having just the two ports docked makes the other two appear docked because of the alignment, but they still don\u0027t grab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I was wondering if anyone has more insight on how docking ports work, maybe code-wise, that could maybe explain this. I know I could install quantum struts to stabilize it, but it would be way cooler to have everything dock properly. I\u0027ll try again when I have time, but it doesn\u0027t seem to be alignment as much as the ports not recognizing each other. I think it would be a nice feature to be able to right click 2 ports like fuel tanks and tell them to dock if they\u0027re close enough, but I don\u0027t know how hard it would be to make something like that possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny insight would be appreciated, thanks. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pursuedtank","CreatedById":50078,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T20:33:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo ports are able to be docked together, however they have to be exactly lined up and have to go together at the same time, it is very difficult to do properly and often requires numerous attempts.

The problem you\u0027ve caught up with is that docking with multiple ports \u003Cem\u003Eout of plane with each other\u003C/em\u003E is extremely difficult. It seems like no matter how well you nudge them into place one plane will get the magnetism effect first and prevent the docking of the other plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it can be done: I have a nearly identical setup (2 sets of 4 port symmetry around 4 objects docked up in a square) in orbit right now with all 8 connections showing as docked, which I did by bringing the last piece in extremely slowly and at an angle such that both sets of ports got the magnetism at pretty much exactly the same time. I won\u0027t recommend it though, as even though it shows as docked one of the ports is visibly misaligned and separated. I suspect this is the cause of the phantom forces that are slowly making the entire structure rotate faster and faster over time :-).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour best bet if you really want to go through with construction as planned is to remove the out-of-plane docking problem entirely. In your OP screenshot, I would suggest undocking one of the two existing pieces from the station, docking it with the new piece, then docking the whole assembly back with the station. That will put the four ports in question in the same plane and let you easily dock them with normal multiport precautions. It makes the whole thing pretty tedious, but I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any other way to avoid the problems you\u0027re having.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
