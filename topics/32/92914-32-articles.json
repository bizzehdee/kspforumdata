I soon discovered that the only real increase to difficulty is in fact the upgrade costs.

I started a new career as I always do when a new patch is out. The upgradeable buildings really contributes in making a game out of KSP. I really enjoyed making difficult decisions on mission parameters to stay within restrictions. Until reaching tier 2. Tier 1 is really about scraping by, once you reach T2 you got everything you need and more and the pressure and excitement is gone.\u003Cp\u003EKSP has always had a bit of a problem with the end game for me, but I see no reason for the building upgrading to become irrelevant so quickly. I basically think there should more building upgrades, like 15 instead of 3 tiers for launch pad and assembly buildings, so that you get more granularity than really tight/more than enough/literally more than any computer can handle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn example: I was building a rocket in the T1 assembly building, and my part count went up to 32. Over the limit, fair enough. I had to remove something. But to upgrade the building, I needed hundreds of thousands credits and when I did, I got 255 as the new max limit. Right then and there I needed the limit raised by like 5 parts, not 225.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is not a request for more grind either but for more rewarding grind, instead of the long term goal of grinding millions to get that thing you\u0027re never going to think about again once you get it, you get short term goal of just getting enough capacity to barely do what you\u0027re trying to do for the moment and the next ting is probably going to require further investment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree - alot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SalehRam","CreatedById":138066,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T17:28:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHave you tried instead customizing the \u0022difficulty\u0022 (what I call \u0022grind\u0022) settings to better match your preference?
