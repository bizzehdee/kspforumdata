Vice versa is also true.

For instance I went from 8 double blades to four single blades and my speed improved despite reduction in \u0022lift\u0022 generating surfaces. From this I assume that the engine spins so slowly that the increased lift of the larger propellers would benefit from a faster engine. The weight of the blades themselves could be causing the engine to spin slower to such an extent that the lift benefit of the propellers was outweighed by the faster engine speed of the smaller propellers (there is probably a formula for that somewhere, oh God help...)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe engine would be most efficient if the thrust hit the blades of the engine at a 90 degree angle so all the thrust goes into a \u0022forward\u0022 anti-clockwise / rotation motion, instead of an angle, so the blades have been angled as such (1 in image).

Having the edge of the blades more inline with the axle that you use will generate higher thrust up to a point because of the higher angle of attack. But also because of that, you get increased drag which I think you also have figured out. From what I\u0027ve learned (of not really my own original research), generally for the most thrust you want a high speed, lowish pitch blade. Finding the correct pitch is a lot of fine tuning and often times, you want the inner and outer pitch to be a bit different to make the most of the rotational speed you have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223478278\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022179414\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221540942035\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002279928\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stewcumber\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, Stewcumber said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the propeller (for example) is not the weakest link in the system, changing the propeller won\u0027t influence things much.

But it also could be that by reducing the mass, you were able to spin faster and thus get a better lift output. Sometimes more blades is not better as you mentioned (higher rotational inertia -\u0026gt; slower speeds). No idea if there\u0027s a formula for that but ummm..... yeah I guess mostly experimentation? 3 or 4 blades is usually pretty reasonable.

For the blade to not cause (drag against the direction of travel) when traveling forward at 100 m/s, (so 100 m/s in the direction of craft travel, and 62.8 m/s along an axis perpendicular to the direction of travel) its angle needs to be at least 57.9 degrees (Take tan^-1 (100/62.8)).
