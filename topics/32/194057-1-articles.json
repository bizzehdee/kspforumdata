The devs could probably fix it, but it might cost in programming time or system resources to make it look perfect from every angle. I\u0027m not sure of your age, but I remember back in the 90\u0027s before 3D acceleration was really catching on, many games had a fake 3D effect of placing a bunch of flat 2D panels so as to make the graphic display very similar to a cardboard cut-out. You could rotate the camera to have all vertical surfaces or horizontal surfaces be 1 pixel wide/tall making for some really interesting screenshots. I\u0027m 35 so I see a huge graphical improvement over time, but if you are say 20, this effect from KSP probably looks like absolute garbage to you in a modern game.
