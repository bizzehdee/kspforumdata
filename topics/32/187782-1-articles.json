Enabling cross feed and setting tank priority let the cores to be drawn first but the bosters\u00A0would start draw fuel from the core once they was drawn dry.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis happened even if the piping was broken as the first staging as I just hyperedit craft into Eve orbit.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nYes nowday you can use fuel flow priority but fuel can not flow over the grinder and the plates. Its an hole for the pipe to pass trough.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nHas to use manual transfer.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
