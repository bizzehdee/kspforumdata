A rocket trying to land on a planet/moon possessing an atmosphere will be lucky to end up in the same zip code as the destination point; in the current stock KSP there\u0027s not much need to land on a specific site, barring anomalies, but once the new resource system comes in (or if you use the Kethane mod now), being able to land on the right spot becomes very important. This is a major issue on Laythe, where good landing sites are few and far between; a rocket will have a difficult time ensuring a good landing site, but spaceplanes can easily find a safe place to land. On your return to Kerbin, a spaceplane can also land right back on the runway at KSC with ease.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second is a matter of forces. A winged design can easily and safely land on a thin-atmosphere body like Duna, whereas a \u0022brick\u0022 rocket using parachutes runs into a serious problem: the atmosphere\u0027s so thin that if you come in at a shallow angle (i.e., an aerobrake), parachutes simply won\u0027t have enough time to cancel out your lateral motion before you impact the ground, and the retarding force of parachutes on a decent-sized craft won\u0027t be enough to ensure a good gear-down orientation. Also, the moment of deployment for parachutes can rip your design apart if it\u0027s still got too much speed, even with drogues, whereas a winged design can take its time bleeding off the reentry speed without having to worry about tearing itself to pieces. And on a thick-atmosphere world like Eve, a spaceplane can literally glide the whole way down without using any fuel at all. (Of cource, you\u0027ll need to use mods if you want to take off again...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, spaceplanes have a significant fuel efficiency advantage if you only want to get to low kerbin orbit; even though you\u0027re spending far longer in the lower atmosphere, with all its drag, the ridiculously high ISP of jet engines means that once you\u0027re in the upper atmosphere you\u0027ll use very little fuel building up the horizontal speed you need to orbit. The limiting factor is generally intake air, but if you put enough intakes on your design (relative to the number of engines) you can actually GAIN air even at 20km, giving you all the time you need to add more speed. Once we get a career mode, with some sort of economics, this (and the lack of disposable stages) might give spaceplanes a major advantage over rocket stacks. But for this to work you need to have a well-designed spaceplane; the transition from aerodynamic flight to a sub-orbital trajectory requires a rocket engine with enough thrust to do the job, as well as rockets with enough efficiency to cheaply circularize once you\u0027re in orbit. If your plane has too little rocket power, it\u0027ll just end up wasting a ton of fuel getting out of the gravity well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M5000","CreatedById":57096,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T01:39:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease be advised: No.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tavert","CreatedById":57383,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T01:43:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERe: Spatzimaus,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can do pinpoint ballistic landings, it just requires some predictive math.

A vertical trajectory through the lower atmosphere is typically more efficient than horizontal launch, unless your TWR is very low. And jet engines are fairly heavy to carry around in space with you, better to stage them away once you get into Kerbin orbit, unless you\u0027re going to Laythe or coming right back from LKO. For reusability you could put parachutes and probes on the jet booster stages, though the physics draw distance makes that problematic at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T01:56:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the goal is to lift a whole range of big payloads to space then you\u0027re better off with rockets. SSTO spaceplanes typically don\u0027t carry much payload if any and even the larger cargo SSTOs designed to carry payload have some pretty strict requirements on both payload mass and dimensions. If you attach a load only slightly off from the original design payload in terms of mass or dimensions you will throw the COM of the whole craft off and make the combination unairworthy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is opposed to rockets which simply have a maximum designed lift capacity to orbit. As long as you stay under this lift capacity of your carrier rocket and the COM of your payload is reasonably centred the rocket will be able to place your payload into orbit regardless of how high or low the COM of the payload actually is. Once you have a range of rockets for different payload capacity you can just stay with them for the rest of your space program. Every time a new payload needs to go up just weight it and attach the appropriate sized rocket underneath and you\u0027re done.
