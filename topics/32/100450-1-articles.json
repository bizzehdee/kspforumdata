Kerbodynes are substantially cheaper and the Mk3\u0027s are substantially more expensive (perhaps to reflect the superior tank materials and the premium SSTO\u0027s place on mass ratio over upfront cost). Perhaps I withdraw my argument, or repitch it to a slight increase to 8.5-9 for Kerbodynes and the others left the same.
