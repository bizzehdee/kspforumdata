I end up using the half tank of my command stage to get into Munar orbit because I just about missed it completely. I still had 2 full tanks of fuel so I orbit Mun a couple times before making a return attempt, the first attempt I burned too soon and it would have sent the capsule way off from Kerbin so I retroburn to fix my orbit around Mun and wait for another opportunity. Next time around I burned later and it looked like I might make it to Kerbin so I speed time up and wait. Once I got far enough away from Mun, my orbit shifted to around Kerbin....with a Periapsis of 9.8 million meters and a Apoapsis of 22.9 million meters....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright, at this point I still got a little over 1 and a half tanks of fuel left, so I figure I\\\u0027ll do a spiraling orbit by retroburning at each Periapsis to shrink the Apoapsis. my Kerbonauts have already been in space for about 1 day MET and it takes about a day and a half MET to shrink my orbit around Kerbin. I get my Apoapsis to 150k and my periapsis to 100k when ::dun dun dunnnnnnnn:: my liquid fuel runs out, Ok no biggie, I still have a little over half a tank of RCS fuel, I can use that to shrink the orbit some more... so I retroburn on that until it runs out, and I get a periapsis of just under 57k, now the waiting game began.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I reached the Periapsis I was a little sad when my parachute didn\\\u0027t deploy and my capsule started gaining altitude again, however that was cancelled out when I noticed that my Apoapsis had shrunk from 150K to about 138K so I figured I might as well see what happens, sure enough as my capsule approached the Periapsis again, not only did it the Apoapsis shrink another 20K, but the Periapsis shrank by about 1k, each subsequent orbit continued to decay until finally after 4 days and 7 hours in space, the parachute finally deployed and my Kerbonauts splashed down safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else got any similar experiences of barely making it home after a mission?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"khyron42","CreatedById":8551,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-25T02:52:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\\\u0027re doing the exact opposite of what you want to do on a return trip - you want to slow down at Ap to bring your Pe down to about 30 km, then ta-da! single orbit return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have done a long return where the Ap was still up around 6000 km and the Pe was 50 km when I accidentally hit space bar instead of throttle, which took forever to gradually bleed off the excess speed over a dozen orbits.
