Well, okay then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, first I made the modification I mentioned earlier, switching the LV-909 and small decoupler on the crasher stage for a 48-7S and tiny decoupler, bringing the price down to 18012. The mass reduction counteracted the decrease in ISP, to the point that there was a net increase in dV.

I used the crasher stage to decelerate, burning off much of the horizontal velocity immediately. At about 500m from the ground, the crasher stage ran dry and was staged away, and 5.29 units of the lander\u0027s fuel supply was used to touch down softly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/SDDjdo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SDDjdo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/JByimu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JByimu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe return was rather simple: half an orbit, then an escape burn. Recently, I\u0027ve been setting the parachute release pressure to 0.33, activating it the moment my periapse is in the atmosphere, disabling SAS and just letting the return happen on its own.

The top of the thing had a definite lip to it, as if it were topped by a short cylinder slightly wider thn the main cylinder. Colour very dark greyish-black. Size - estimated at 30-50 metres tall and wide, but this was only a guess. Seen from 2.8km I used cockpit view to zoom in on the thing, but sadly didnt think to grab a screenpic whilst in close-up. I do have one pic from the exterior view (but no idea how to post pics here). I couldn\u0027t help thinking that the thing looked somewhat like the base of a huuuge artillery shell. Which made me wonder whether some Kerbals having been reading Jules Verne... - moments after I took teh screenpic I have, the thing vanished as suddenly as it had appeared, and seconds later, Jeb\u0027s rover (of a reliable standard type I use a lot on Minmus) started playing up, eventually rolling and destroying most of itself, although the cabin and Jeb survived.
