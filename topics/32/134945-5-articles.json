When i was young, i used to gaze at the starlit heaven and think about everything. By then i had decided i wanted to become a rocket scientist or an astronaut. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the beginning of elementary, i showed great potential. Getting full scores in math, i was quite the nerd. There\u0027s a reason why my elementary school had to borrow fact books from my middle-school just to please my reading. Eventually they crushed me down and forced me to read normal books like the other kids. Also not getting the help i needed when things got more advanced, pulled me down as it downright demotivated me from everything that was math. I never failed any tests, but my interest were crushed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of that i never reached my full potential during middle-school and i struggeled with simple math. I never failed any courses, but i weren\u0027t good either. My interest rose once more when in high-school I had a surprise math test. I was shocked when i got my results. I got a very high grade effortless, and i began studying, but it was to late. I had chosen a different path, not a bad one, but something quite different. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now im in my second year in electric studies to become an electrician, but since i found KSP, it has brought me back to when i was young, but only now i understand!
