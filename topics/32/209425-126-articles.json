The spindle speed is one of the major contributors to noise.

The 3 TB WD Red is known as one of the quietest drive around. I have a bit of trouble digging up a relevant noise comparison, but you might want to look into that before making up your mind.

That way any system in your house can access the same files easily over said network. The drives can be used perfectly fine for non-NAS use too, though, and turn out to be very frugal and quiet drives.

I find that with some computers they can dismount at random times (USB2 comes to mind) and since they tend to rely on the relatively low power that USB can supply, they also tend to have slower drives in them (5400 RPM or so). Probably not the best choice for game playing. Great for storing photo\u0027s, backups, music, etc. They fall short on the speeds needed for gaming.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for my external drive, it\u0027s a Vantec NexStar3 USB2/eSATA/Firewire 800 case. It uses a 4 amp wall-wart as a power supply, and it has been excellent for the 7 years I\u0027ve owned it. HDD is a Samsung 650G 7200 RPM. This case accommodates the standard 3.5\u0022 format drives, which is nice for cost.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSSD\u0027s are fantastic, great speed, and can retain data for quite a while. HOWEVER, some SSD\u0027s can lose data if they aren\u0027t powered up once every 3 months. As long as you power them up, say, once a week, you\u0027re golden. If you only use it\u00A0once in a while, stick with a standard HDD.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBasically it boils down to what you intend to use the external drive for. If it\u0027s for backups or data you want to keep for a long time, and look at it once in a while, a standard portable HDD is the cheap effective ticket. If the drive is for gaming and to keep files you use daily off your main rig, then look for a powered external SSD setup. Also evaluate your budget. 5400 RPM drives are cheaper, 7200 RPM are a bit more, 10000 RPM drives are a bit pricey.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSSD\u0027s are cheap now from 120 gig to 256 gig, but they climb exponentially in price as they approach the Terabyte range.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyways, just my 2\u00A2 here.

I\u0027ll also include benchmarks at the end, as well as answer any questions you might have (I think one of you\u00A0was curious just how loud a certain part I was planning on getting was, for example).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK then.Have fun!

All 6 cores will function nicely, and it costs as much as a 6700k skylake build. But, this build is also easily overclock-able. All 5820k CPUs can often hit 5930k speeds, which are 200 mHz faster. That motherboard also supports multiple GPUs very well, with many PCI-E lanes. Overall, this would perform well for many years beyond, because games have begun to need more cores. You can always drop in a 2nd 970, but I do recommend a 980 instead for SLI, because you will hit the 3.5 GB limit.

I\u0027m rambling, sorry....This is the new monitor I\u0027m looking at:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824236313\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EASUS VG248QE Black 24\u0022 Gaming Monitor, 144Hz 1ms (GTG), 3D Monitor, Height \u0026amp; pivot adjustable, 350 cd/m2, Built-in Speakers\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy, no less than 144Hz? 4K isn\u0027t really worth the price at this point.

Just curious, but why does it seem so many (or maybe it was just you, I can\u0027t remember)\u00A0are trying to push me into getting AMD over Nvidia? (Please don\u0027t misunderstand me, this is pure curiosity, I\u0027m not angry or trying to be rude by any means; I ask because I genuinely don\u0027t know). That R9 Nano has 4096-bit, HBM memory...that seems like an explosion better than GDDR5 256bit cards, does it not?\u00A0I do want to mention again that I would prefer Nvidia. I have no experience with AMD cards; I have always had Nvidia,\u00A0have never had any issues with them, and have always had a smooth experience. Of course that isn\u0027t to say AMD wouldn\u0027t be the same, but just that I\u0027d be more comfortable with Nvidia, and I feel like more people choose Nvidia over AMD (pure speculation). Also, I see a lot of people hold EVGA very highly, and they\u00A0only make Nvidia cards. This is what I really have my sights on:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814487079\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEVGA GTX 980\u003C/a\u003E. I generally filter Newegg results by Most Reviewed, and try to pick components from brands I have firsthand experience with, as well as very highly rated/reviewed\u00A0brands/specific components.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as 6 cores go, I was also thinking about this lately. While I don\u0027t see myself needing 6 cores right now or soon, I could\u00A0need them in the future. I typically don\u0027t do much multitasking; generally the biggest workout I give a CPU is running one game and maybe a web browser with streaming video at the same time. That\u0027s it; I don\u0027t edit or play with video software, or anything else that is generally considered very CPU intensive. Also, most games, and most games I play, are more GPU dependent than CPU (which is why I am now very much leaning towards a GTX 980, not a 970, as a minimum). Like I said earlier, I mostly play Minecraft and KSP right now, and once I get this new computer, I\u0027ll also start playing GTA5, maybe go back to some CS:S and The Long Dark as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo anyways...I would like a 6 core processor, but don\u0027t think I can afford one. Unfortunately, there are only two 6 core processors on Newegg, and you picked the cheapest one. It\u0027s still an extra $110 more than the 4 core CPU we picked earlier...I don\u0027t know if I can swing that AND get the 980 over the 970 like I want to do. Also, just so you know, our shopping carts differ a little. I want\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817438053\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0power supply, a G2 series, not GS.

Finally, I also want\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814487079\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0GPU, the EVGA 980, for all the reasons we\u0027ve already talked about. I\u0027ve also got a keyboard, headphones, and thermal paste (not important\u00A0to include, but does affect price).\u00A0That\u0027s what\u0027s in my shopping cart that isn\u0027t in yours, and it brings the total to $1918 after tax and shipping costs. So I\u0027m basically already over budget; which is okay because it\u0027s only by ~$100, but I can\u0027t really spend anymore. I still have to have money for a cheap desk, computer chair, and a little wiggle room. My absolute total budget was $2200, which is why I want this system to cost ~$1800.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry for such a long post, I probably could of put more effort into keeping things shorter. TL;DR: I really want to stick with the GTX 980, and I just can\u0027t afford a 6 core CPU right now, nor do I think I would truly need one for quite some time. I suppose if I wanted, I could get a 970, or other AMD card, and then I could afford getting a 6 core CPU, but I don\u0027t want to make that trade-off. Like I said, I\u0027m more concerned with my GPU than my CPU; most things I plan on doing/playing are much more GPU intensive than CPU intensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit: forgot to also mention I\u0027d much rather stick with Skylake than go down to Haswell. I have no experience with either but Skylake is newer and I hear better things about it...not that it matters anyway because of budget restraints\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-24T02:53:20Z\u0022 title=\u002203/24/2016 02:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by KocLobster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceception","CreatedById":152800,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T02:05:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould you call this accurate?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/SWWlEo0uIRg?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
