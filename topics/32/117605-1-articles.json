Main idea is to keep heatshield strictly in front (pointing at surface prograde marker) and it should be wide enough to cover all other parts (could be easily visually checked in VAB). The only downside was that after this aerobraking I was at altitude of about 10 km and speed of about 500-600 m/s (mostly vertical, i.e. going down fast), which isn\u0027t best cause for chute deployment. But anyway I had enough time to aerobrake below 300 m/s, deploy chutes and even decouple propulsion module of craft for separate landing (I tend to build fuel tank\u002Bheatshield (without engine) as separate module for missions that require landing on other bodies and use landing module\u0027s engine as main propulsion)."},{"CreatedByName":"Varsi","CreatedById":120571,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T14:29:32Z","Content":"Tested now, heat shields can definitely explode due to overheating before running out of ablator. At Kerbin you need to do something ridiculous to achieve this but at Eve and Jool it will be much easier due to interplanetary speeds."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T14:44:43Z","Content":"A part will explode when *either* its internal temperature *or* its skin temperature exceeds the part\u0027s rated max temperature.\n\nSlow, shallow reentries keep the skin from getting too hot, but will take very long, and therefore tend to overload internal temperature via conduction. This generally kills spaceplanes that don\u0027t bleed off speed quickly enough.\n\nSteep, fast reentries are too fast to heat up the part internally very much because conduction is sluggish, but they can overload the skin. This is generally what happens when you try to aerobrake out of an interplanetary transfer a Jool. Because the skin has next to no thermal mass, this overheating happens near-instantaneously, giving people the impression that they explode just by touching the atmosphere. And in a way, that\u0027s true.\n\nAblator on the heatshield is a consumable that carries skin heat away. Think of it as \u0022every point of ablator is worth X heat energy\u0022. That means the skin of the heatshield stays cooler than it usually would be as long as it has ablator to spend. It doesn\u0027t die immediately after running out of ablator either; it simply behaves like any other part at that point. However, ablator can only be consumed so fast. It is possible to overheat the skin of the heatshield even when you have ablator left, because it simply cannot spend ablator fast enough to carry the heat away."},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T14:51:42Z","Content":"Meanwhile on MatoroIgnika\u0027s stream ... a heat shield survived **two hours** of aerobraking passes at Jool with zero ablator before finally exploding (when it did the rest of the craft went up almost instantaneously).\n\nHeat shields may need a *tiny* bit of work."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T14:55:13Z","Content":"That\u0027s exactly what I wrote... when running out of ablator, heatshields simply work like any other part in KSP. I.e. they explode when either their internal temperature or their skin temperature exceed their maxTemp value.\n\nAs long as temperatures don\u0027t get that high, you can aerobrake with it just fine for all eternity. Just like you can with a service bay, or an engine, or any other particularly heat resistant part. Of course, pulling that off at Jool is quite a feat, and a testament to M.I.\u0027s piloting skill (or dumb luck ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)).\n\nThe rest of the ship then goes almost instantly because the maxTemp value for heatshields is very high. If the situation is such that the heatshield passes its threshold, then by definition it is also enough to easily overload all other parts that remain after the heatshield is gone.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-04T16:38:00Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2015 04:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T15:18:04Z","Content":"I must say I don\u0027t understand how the heat systems works.
