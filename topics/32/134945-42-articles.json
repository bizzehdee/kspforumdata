Where I live it\u0027s cold and crappy out for 8 months of the year to do anything. Half my friends are getting girlfriends/wives and my social life has been going down the toilet from that among other reasons. I dated for a while and after getting dumped for various reasons (including one being a closet lesbian) I\u0027ve pretty much retired from the dating game because it is too much disgust and anguish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is where I wish my reality was. Among the stars, exploring, seeing new worlds, I wish we had the technology to leave Earth and make space travel as common as taking a trip to the grocery store. This game is fun and educational, and it relaxes me where it seems that everything else today tends to drive me insane. A game about stupid green men building rockets and leaving the planet for no particular reason other than fun and exploration. I would rather play KSP at this point than socialize, date, eat, or even sleep for that matter. I still work, I still get out, I still take care of myself, I just like playing KSP more than doing other things in life. Although I will say that this game has inspired me now to possibly get a pilots license (my dad used to fly planes after all).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-10T05:29:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tygoo7\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tygoo7\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhen you are out in your deer stand thinking, \u0022I wonder how much deltaV this bullet has.\u0022\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, don\u0027t mind me... just casually riding my deer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Madrias","CreatedById":89995,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-10T07:20:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you can land an asymmetric nightmare on the runway after a tragic accident.
