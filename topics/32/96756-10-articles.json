We both rely on mods to create a game we want to play. In your case, you\u0027ve installed mods to make it easier. In mine, to make it something \u0022reasonably realistic.\u0022 At this point, I don\u0027t even want to use the \u0022R\u0022 word anymore. It holds so much baggage at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just hope KSP 0.90 doesn\u0027t become Counterstrike 1.6. The last KSP that was FAR capable.
