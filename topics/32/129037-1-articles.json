Only way I could think of (without using ingame ships, which would take forever) is to write down coordinates and then make some equasion in excel tab to calculate the distance between two points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there is any faster and/or easier solution you know about, please let me know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you in advance\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ninteractive map link:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalmaps.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.kerbalmaps.com/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-01T14:25:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeems like your GM should have thought of that before starting\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis won\u0027t be much help I expect, but the best I can think of quickly is print off the map of the area you want and use a ruler, it will be in scale with itself at least though won\u0027t give you accurate Kerbin distances or account for bending round the \u0027globe\u0027. \u00A0Though you can print off other areas and if you get it right you can use the same scale or make a note of how much you enlarge it and compensate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll have a think and if anything else comes to mind I\u0027ll post it here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-01T14:29:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can see the maths is a little complicated.
