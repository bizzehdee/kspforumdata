All the lift needed to fly in Duna\u0027s thin air plays havoc in Kerbin\u0027s thick air. Thus, the plane\u0027s name of D\u0027OH (Dun\u0027Overflight Hybrid) became all too fitting. At first I weaseled around this problem with Orbital Construction but my conscience kept needling me to do it from the ground up. So, I kept at it and finally, after killing at least 1/4 of my liver drinking liquid inspiration, I finally managed to get the damn thing from KSC to orbit in 1 piece, and as an SSTO for extra style points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I\u0027m so ashamed.

There\u0027s relative positioning (the white indicator lines), relative velocity (the red crosshair), but no relative orientation in Docking Cam. In other words, Docking Cam will get you centered on the dock, but gives no indication as to your actual orientation relative to that targeted dock, so if you\u0027re not moving the cam all around, you may be trying to dock while approaching it at an angle and not realize it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other plugin, however, gives you additional markers to work with, so that when you target a dock, you can use it to first get oriented so that your nose is perpendicular to the port, and your roll axis is oriented how you want it, relative to the ship when you dock. After getting yourself oriented, it then works much like Docking Cam, showing you where you need to translate in order to get lined-up with the targeted port.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T17:07:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022annallia\u0022 data-cite=\u0022annallia\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI suspect I will like the lazer one better (plus nice that its a standalone so I don\u0027t have to get the whole system). \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, it\u0027s \u0022standalone\u0022 in that it doesn\u0027t require you to install all the various Lazor parts, but it\u0027s pretty much just an appearance of being standlone since you\u0027re still loading and running the plugin code for all that stuff, and you\u0027re stuck with the baggage that comes with that code.
