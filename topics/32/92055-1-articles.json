A very nice idea, but unfortunately, there\u0027s a few things that I see as problems - the fact it\u0027s an hour long, it\u0027s only available at one place and one time and there\u0027s no summary of it.

After many new ides, they settled on the current one. \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#B22222;\u0022\u003EBasically, every kerbal starts at level 0 and there are 5 levels. They know what they want to be good at, but they aren\u0027t actually good at it yet.\u003C/span\u003E For example, Jeb knows he\u0027s a pilot so that\u0027s what you train him up for. They get XP based on achievements and what they do - a trip to Mun awards X amount of XP, a trip to Eeloo awards way way more. As they level up, they gain new abilities and perks. \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#B22222;\u0022\u003EScientists will increase science output by a certain % which grows with each level the kerbal gets\u003C/span\u003E (\u0022I don\u0027t believe they stack, but I could be wrong\u0022 says Max). This is the closest to the original idea for them.\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#B22222;\u0022\u003E As for engineers, they fix things and repair stuff. \u003C/span\u003ELevel 0 engineers can\u0027t do anything (as with all lvl 0 kerbals), but as they level up, they can learn to repack chutes, fix solar panels and wheels (also maaaaaybe in the future, they\u0027ll be able to build stuff but hush hush, I didn\u0027t say that..). Also, SAS doesn\u0027t really exist as a thing any more - it\u0027s only available if you have Pilots (or sufficient probe core) in the ship. RW and pods provide torque. \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#B22222;\u0022\u003EIf no pilots are present (just engineers or scientist), you have to hold everything manually and will be very hard.\u003C/span\u003E Probe wise - the higher tiers act similar to higher level pilots so you could use a very expensive probe core and not have a Pilot onboard. Max doesn\u0027t recommend using probes over pilots, however (I don\u0027t know why, he didn\u0027t say). Levelling up pilots, they learn to control SAS. Higher level pilots can point at a direction and hold that so you can say \u0027point prograde\u0027 and they will until you tell them to stop, the \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#B22222;\u0022\u003Ehighest level can hold direction at a manoeuvre node.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/Nm7yy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMk3 parts\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA whole beautiful set of parts from PorkJet.

Removing SAS is a bad example: it becomes a game of \u0022balance your twitches\u0022 instead of trying to focus on your ascent. Same with the orbit lines, maneuver nodes, and patched conics: it\u0027s removing basic flight information that literally no astronaut or mission control ever would be without. It makes the game frustrating, instead of making career difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Troubletcat","CreatedById":130757,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-06T02:54:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELots of interesting stuff in here I didn\u0027t know, cool to get some details about what exactly the building upgrades and kerbal skills (other than pilot, already knew about that) will be like.
