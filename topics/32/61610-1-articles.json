Once I made a quite spectacularly complex rocket that had the fatal flaw that when the launchpad finished loading, immediately the top of the rocket began wobbling and fall over BEFORE I had a chance to do anything. I knew once I got it into the air that I would be fine because my rocket required that I have the standard booster-from-below, but also what my friends have decided to call, a kite-booster-from-above. The kite doesn\u0027t quite PULL the rocket (though I have made ones that did that), but it mainly exists to keep the rocket stable in flight...sort of...lol... Anyway, I couldn\u0027t use the stabilizers because their trusses conflicted with the lower booster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I did was that I put a radial decoupler on the edge of the upper part, then I mounted a strut/truss on there, basically making a large rod sticking out the side of the craft, far enough away that I could attach a stabilizer onto the end of the bar! But you can\u0027t just decouple the stabilizer and the radial decoupler at the same time, you\u0027d have this big bar flop down onto your ship and cause you problems...so I put two separatrons on the rod so that it would go shooting away into the distance (spinning around its long axis). The result was that when I loaded, everything was fine and stable then when I hit launch the stabilizers detach, the radial decouplers detach, and the separatrons send the rods shooting out into the distance. It is somewhat terrifying once this massive thing launches into the air, to see one of those rods somehow turn around in a long arc and fly directly towards you like a seeking missile. Luckily the rod ran out of fuel and ended up flying under me. My special kite and booster system worked wonderfully!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft in question was of a sort that I love to make, something so ridiculous and stupid that in order to get it into orbit I MUST work as a team WITH mechjeb. It is not a matter of letting mechjeb do the work and sitting back, oh no, this rocket is too ridiculous for mechjeb to control properly, it just explodes. But, I cannot pilot the rocket on my own without mechjeb handing the proper throttle, staging, and constantly providing me with direction updates on where I need to have the rocket pointed...I just don\u0027t have enough fingers. You see, the kite system stabilizes the rocket so that I can direct it without it just going into a tumble. But in order to actually make gravity turns without falling over into a tumble, I need to mount rockets that JUST push me left, right, forward, back on the kite so I can force the end to point where I need it. I use several of the number keys, set up so say 0 activates the rockets that push me right, and deactivates the rockets pushing left. It is lovely seeing these things get into orbit knowing the effort it took.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sabreur","CreatedById":93165,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T20:21:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI dislike that I have to install a mod like mechjeb or engineer to get basic information about my rocket, like total mass and thrust-to-weight ratio.
