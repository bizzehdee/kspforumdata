But if you\u0027re like me, there are some things in your V0.90 save file that you simply must have intact in V1.\n\nMe, I\u0027m keeping my asteroids. I have a class-E in orbit around Minmus and have not gotten around to building a base on it yet. And I can\u0027t give up my class-A lawn ornament, shown here. Besides serving to inspire new recruits at Kerbfleet Academy, it is a convenient targetable marker for ships returning to KSC.\n\n![b7wdvuH.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/b7wdvuH.jpg)\n\nI\u0027ll also keep my Kerbals, unless the training system is so thoroughly revamped it makes sense not to. Once everyone comes home from the various kerbed space stations and interplanetary missions, I\u0027ll delete all the ships, debris, flags etc, every part in the game except the two asteroids. Then hopefully I can get the save file to work in V1 with the crew roster and asteroids intact. \n\nPossible snags in this approach include the cost of hiring new Kerbals if I already have a bunch of guys on the roster, and if Squad dropped a barn or a trailer on the same spot where I put my lawn ornament. \n\nSo how about the rest of you? Starting fresh, keeping everything, or attempting some sort of hybrid like me?"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T20:46:53Z","Content":"Ehh, maybe, *maybe* at most, taking a few crafts over.\n\nBut only maybe."},{"CreatedByName":"Freshmeat","CreatedById":111048,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T20:47:32Z","Content":"I\u0027ll start all over.
