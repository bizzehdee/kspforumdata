Another work around solution is to thrust balance. The 4 external rocket fuel tanks actually feed both their engine and the aerospike engine, I could do it with two but the top two are there to balance the torque caused byt the bottom two which cause it to enter unrecoverable spins when the first tank drains.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy final solution is to add more canards, winglets and wings to the rear of the aircraft to counter the fuel drain\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe re-entry problem is easier to solve.
