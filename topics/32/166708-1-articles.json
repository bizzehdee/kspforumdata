There were surprises pushing the boundary... then people basically expected to find it everywhere on Earth, and then surprises came when places have been found on Earth without life. An example is a hyper saline lake in Antarctica. There are some microbes that tolerate very high salt concentrations, but even they have a limit and there is a hypersaline lake in antarctica where the only signs of life there appear to be blown there by wind, but then they die/go metabolically inactive. No life *grows* there. That does not bode well for the hyper saline RSL on Mars. Then we\u0027ve found that in some samples from the Atacama desert... the soil is sterile, some samples had no detectable organics, nothing consuming nitrates that rain down from the atmosphere (normally their deposition is so low compared to the uptake by life that nitrates produced by lightning, etc never accumulate). Nothing could be made to grow from the samples, even under a variety of conditions. The atacama is a big places, and at the fringes you find plants and animals, more inward there are hardy extremophiles. Even more inward, there may be viable spores waiting for the brief moments of moisture, but in the driest places, there is no life.

We\u0027ve had billions of years for life to adapt, there are even gradients that allow for intermediates as natural selection should drive the evolution of forms that could survive there.... but it seems nothing is there, apparently, physics says \u0022no\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, popular science articles like to present new discoveries as if they are surprising, when they really aren\u0027t, but they do help pin down where the boundary might be for conditions too extreme for life. We still see it portrayed that anyplace we see water, we see life, but that is not true. People act like anywhere on Earth\u0027s surface, you find microbes - not true.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, it likely does on other worlds as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMercury - No\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVenus - No (*maybe* in the past, but its surely all dead now)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoon - No\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMars - probably not, maybe underground, maybe in the past, maybe around those geysers when the pressure builds up between the dry ice and water ice layers before geyser eruption.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCeres - probably no, maybe if there is a warmer core with water ice below the rocky surface\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJupiter\u0027s moons: maybe\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTitan/Enceledus: maybe\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore distant bodies... very unlikely\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if the ocean of Europa is habitable, that doesn\u0027t mean its not sterile due to a lack of conditions for abiogenesis. Microbes from earth would have to survive in an inert state for a very long time to get there, and the DNA would likely be too damaged during the journey when repair mechanisms would presumably be inactive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if microbes made it there without being killed, the environment would probably be so different from the one on Earth that they came from, that they\u0027d be unable to grow/be metabolically active, and would thus die in time. That\u0027s assuming they somehow made it under the ice intact. The surface of Europa is deadly thanks to Jupiter trapping all those charged particles. Such a transmission of microbes is a non-zero chance, so its worth considering for directed spaceflight, but its still pretty unlikely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
