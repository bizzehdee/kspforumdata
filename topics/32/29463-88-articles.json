During the final phase of my initial ascent, despite being relatively shielded by the cargo fairing, these solar panels succumbed to the violent forces of ascent and exploded...destroying the fairing in the process, exposing the payload to this:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i65.tinypic.com/23rph0k.jpg[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith the payload exposed (the payload was a high resolution resource scanner intended for Minmus), bits and pieces went the way of the solar panels, causing a series of explosions like this one as the attached landing probes disintegrated:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i64.tinypic.com/23ijlz9.jpg[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter several such explosions, the rocket eventually lost critical pieces, including the remote guidance system. The engine, in good health and maintaining a stable trajectory, carried what remained of the mission payload off into the great beyond, to a projected apoapsis of 278km before running out of fuel. It was then decided that in the future, all solar panels, protected or not, should be located [i]inside[/i] the payload fairing.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis next one was the result of a fatal error in the rocket staging. While preparing for the orbital insertion burn, a cargo rocket carrying a resource miner also bound for Minmus advanced a stage to eject the payload fairing so that the solar array could be extended, and the crew could enjoy the spectacular view. Unfortunately, the entire miner was set to jettison in the same stage, abandoning approximately half the remaining mission delta v, and the powerful engines of cargo rocket. After some face palming, it was decided that the miner had more than sufficient dv available to complete it\u0026#39;s mission, and the insertion burn was to proceed as planned. However, the cargo rocket had ascended on a relatively steep 30 degree ascent angle, and with some horror, the crew discovered that the miner craft did not have sufficient thrust to complete the orbital insertion before it started to re-enter the atmosphere.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nGiven that the miner was never intended to enter an atmosphere, or even perform under it\u0026#39;s own power around Kerbin, the re-entry looked like this:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i66.tinypic.com/3126zo8.jpg[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe craft was not equipped with a heat shield or parachutes. It would rely entirely on the engines and powerful RCS system (80 thrust forward and back from the RCS system) to slow down the descent and hopefully hit the ocean at a survivable speed. Pictured above is the seconds before catastrophic structural failure, as the crew desperately tried to jettison the overheating LV-N engines in an attempt to live at least a little longer.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i66.tinypic.com/2hwh0kg.jpg[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEvidence points to a failure in engine seperation, and the critical failure of the LV-N engines destroyed most of the miner craft. If you look closely, it seemed that in its final moments, the craft managed to invert (point prograde). The Command pod can be seen on the right, and the faint profile of the craft as it falls apart can be seen in the explosion itself. The only component confirmed to have survived the explosion was the large docking port mounted on the bottom. Other unidentified debris was also spotted descending toward Kerbin, but all was lost to the depths of the ocean after impact.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThree Kerbals lost their lives.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOh, and to aid in seeing the profile inside the explosion, here is her identical replacement, sitting happily on the surface of Minmus with a partially crippled landing system (note the permanently compressed landing leg. The craft is still landing capable, but touch down will be \u0022interesting\u0022).
