What they may use KSP for, as we\u0027ve seen with NASA is a quick way to make a mock-up video to present the idea to the press/public. KSP\u0027s parts, physics and solar-system are just too different to be useful for real applications. Graphics purists might sniff at the limitations of KSP\u0027s images but real applications don\u0027t need to know much about what a vehicle will look like - what they need are all the numbers; mass, deltaV, temperatures and everything else that tells you if/how it will perform.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-22T18:19:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHarverster said it... it\u0027s a game.

Real rockets have to worry about what\u0027s going on in the interior of the rocket, stresses that the materials are taking and exactly where those stresses occur, what exactly will happen during staging, forces exerted on the payload, weather conditions, etc. KSP features none of that. You also care about exactly how much what you\u0027re building will cost (keeping in mind what you\u0027ll compromise on to get off-the-shelf stuff and what you\u0027ll have custom-made, and what tolerances you need on parts). You need to work with actual aerodynamics (which is difficult to simulate properly). KSP is not designed to even approximate actual rocket design, testing, and flight; it cannot really be made to do so via modding below the level of \u0022call fork() and launch a real simulator\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegrim","CreatedById":2155,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T04:08:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing I can think of is for a concept video.
