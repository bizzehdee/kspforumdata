All of my boosters have unmanned controllers and a small fuel reserve, so that I can de-orbit after delivering each payload into LKO. I also use SSTO spaceplanes for a lot of things that would be more efficient with rockets, such as launching small mapping satellites; I modified my standard Sleazy Weasel spaceplane to carry two ion-powered mapping probes on the ends of its wings, which it can either launch in orbit OR deliver itself after refueling. (I\u0027m working on a heavier spaceplane with a cargo bay, but for now it\u0027s not necessary.) Most of my larger vehicles have onboard kethane refineries, so I have no need for extensive booster setups; they might not be SSTO in every case, but there\u0027s no need to stage once you\u0027re in orbit. In the few cases where I do use standard rockets without a reserve, I make sure to leave them on a suborbital trajectory. (Heck, my last Eve trip was with an SSTO, so I didn\u0027t even crash any boosters there.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the debris I still have in my game are the parts of rovers scattered near KSC, since the impacts that destroyed the vehicles often didn\u0027t destroy the pieces.
