Thanks for such an awesome content rich update! I have some feedback to consider as you take this Beta forward toward completion... I know that much of these can be adjusted by sliders, but I think some tuning is needed on the default setting. (From a well tuned default setting, more casual or hard-core players can customize their play experience further).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarly Career:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally this phase of the game seems a tad slow, even for a seasoned KSPer like myself. It costs a LOT of money to do the first few things an early career player would want to do - and this is exactly the time that you want people trying out all of your new features, so they get hooked on their potential!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Building Upgrades: Some of the building upgrades are prohibitively expensive to start off with. It\u0027s fine to have upgrades get more and more expensive as time goes on - but players in the earlier career should be able to afford one or two basic building upgrades within the first couple of missions. This gets users hooked on what building upgrades will offer in the future, offering more incentive to save Funds for upgrades.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1b. Alternately - many of the buildings are of no use, at all, during the first two missions. I think that the players should be required to buy these buildings in the first place. i.e. the only buildings that should be accessible at the start are the Basic VAB, Basic Launch Pad, and Basic Mission Control. Right now, the area looks a bit crowded to a new player, to be honest. Starting with just the bare minimum of buildings for the first two contracts really sets the player up for a more simplified starting experience. Also, when a player comes back after their first two missions - you could offer the pop-up showing some of their construction options. Players will be much more interested in what a building does for them, after they buy it! Example: after the first contracts are done, the user might decide to by the Administration Building, granting them access to strategic initiatives, I guarantee that once someone buys the admin building, they will be more interested in kicking off a strategy to help their career. Another example: The first time they unlock the Tracking Station and see all the places they can go (and all the junk they\u0027ve left behind, that might be recovered for some extra funds!) they player will be hooked on using the building - amplified by the fact that they paid for it in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Strategy Initiatives: Speaking of the Admin Building... Some of the strategies are entirely too prohibitive to start! A limit on the number of active strategies isn\u0027t a limit at all, if they can\u0027t be started in the first place. Entry fees for most strategies should be drastically lowered, so that players can kick them off. I like how the start-up cost is variable based on the commitment percentage, but the fixed values should be much more approachable. Some of these start-ups are so expensive that I would never use them, ever (250 Science points, I\u0027m looking at you)... Again, getting people started in initiatives earlier is a way to hook them on the advantages, and keep your audience coming back to readjust their initiatives. Right now you only ever want to start an initiative once since it\u0027s so expensive - offering only a one-shot currency sink. If people can fidget with initiatives more, over time, users will sink their currencies into these initiatives over and over - encouraging them to go out and earn more! Also, if initiatives are easier to start, users will bang against the initiative limit of 2 strait away, encouraging them to upgrade the building (further sinking Funds out of their budgets).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2b. Basically, players need to be able to make decisions about what to spend their currencies on. While a limit on the number of strategies seems good on the surface, it\u0027s not a limit at all if the player can really only choose from one of eight strategies due to the high start-up cost. Lowering the initial costs of strategies and building upgrades. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Part progression / mission progression.

Having the maneuver nodes and ability to EVA be unlocked via building upgrades adds more sense of progression as players proceed through career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think unlockable content needs to be fleshed out much more, especially with more building tiers coming. Some ideas for things that could be unlockable with building upgrades:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Gizmos\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Symmetry switching\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Display of interplanetary transfer windows\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Discovery/display of celestial bodies\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Crew transfer without EVA\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Visual representation of range/delta-v of a craft (maybe by showing a potential orbit in the tracking station.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo improve the richness and complexity of the game, a lot could be added here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVisually, to my eye, the quality of the tier 1 and tier 2 buildings is not up to the standard of the tier 3 buildings yet. It\u0027s a work in progress - \u0027nuff said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbal XP\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother system which adds significantly to gameplay. Once again, this is brand new and, from my viewpoint, also needs a lot of fleshing out. I would definitely like to see more reasons to want/need a particular Kerbal skill on a given mission. Some possibilities for skills that depend on a Kerbal\u0027s role or on the role/skill level combination:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Scientist required to move science data from instruments to pods or from one pod to another\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Science lab only functions when crewed by scientists\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Engineer required to move fuel/electricity from one part of craft to another\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Engineer required to deploy solar panels on a craft that has run out of power\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Engineer required to deploy any part from outside the craft\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Engineer required to extract resources (assuming resource extraction becomes part of the core game)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Pilots could have more autopilot-type skills, i.e. rendezvous, docking, even ascent and landing (I realize a lot of players will hate this idea. Just trying to think of ways the roles might be more valuable)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs others have pointed out, the changes to probe core tech really blunt the impact of the Pilot skill. Specifically, SAS is the only critical pilot skill, the rest are merely a matter of convenience. Since SAS is available with any probe core except the Stayputnik, once any of these are unlocked, pilot skill isn\u0027t that important. I\u0027d definitely like the pilot role to have more value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, only the scientist role has any improved value after level 3. Hopefully, the other skill levels will eventually be fleshed out so that they mean something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFine Print\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA vast improvement over the available content in First Contract and Economic Boom, the addition of all the new contracts is, it seems to me, an essential part of the core game. I believe we now have a good start on the contract system. While there is more to be done here, the improvement in gameplay up to this point is enormous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would definitely like to see a much greater diversity of contracts. An even broader selection of contracted missions to choose from would probably improve career play for most players. The contract system already gives us the ability to decline contracts causing them to be replaced instantly with new, randomly generated, contracts. Along with enough variety of contracts, this should satisfy players with many different interests and play styles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother possibility to improve the contract system would be mission contracts that build on work done for previous contracts. For instance, after putting an orbital station up to fulfill a contract, a contract could appear asking you to add a lab, or another habitation module, or a part with more solar panels, or rotate the crew. Perhaps some contracts to do survey missions could be generated near where you already have infrastructure, with appropriately balanced payouts. This would lead you to use infrastructure placed for earlier contracts and could add significantly to the sense of progression in gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESAS \u0026amp; Probe Cores\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChanges to SAS can definitely alter early career gameplay. I enjoyed the challenge of placing a satellite in a specific orbit without SAS, but I wonder if some players may find it daunting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiving the various probe cores all different characteristics is very interesting and definitely adds to the usefulness of many of the previously unerutilized cores. The SAS ability of most probe cores does, however, as noted above, vastly reduce the value of the SAS pilot skill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, I found the career mode gameplay richer and more interesting as well as much more challenging.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-30T13:23:04Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2014 01:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starhawk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gan_HOPE326","CreatedById":128974,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-29T23:47:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022basic.syntax\u0022 data-cite=\u0022basic.syntax\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAgree on satellite clutter!
