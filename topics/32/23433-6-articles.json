First paid version was 0.15 (which was on June 17th, 2012, coincidentally my birthday). I definitely remember flying straight up to see how high I went before learning how to properly circularize my orbits. I also remember trying to build excessively huge rockets (though consisting of the small parts in the earlier days). Before I attempted any proper Mun landing, I was aiming to build a rocket that could reach it (though I still didn\u0027t learn orbital mechanics yet). While I was able to reach the Mun eventually (though without learning orbital mechanics), I had no way of landing and crashed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat led me to learn how to build a rocket with landing capabilities by watching trydyingtolive\u0027s YouTube video that was found in the KSP Wiki (though one of the differences was I implemented four winglets instead of three). After various attempts at learning how to land, I was finally able to land on Kerbin and prepared for the Mun. Following what was discussed in that video, one of my first attempts made it to the Mun. However, the first attempted landing was very rocky (which left the Kerbals stranded). Here are the two screenshots I took of that failed landing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://smg.photobucket.com/user/Bandock/media/Screenshots/FirstFailedMunLanding1_zpsf8d3e220.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v458/Bandock/Screenshots/FirstFailedMunLanding1_zpsf8d3e220.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FirstFailedMunLanding1_zpsf8d3e220.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://smg.photobucket.com/user/Bandock/media/Screenshots/FirstFailedMunLanding2_zps6973dc9f.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v458/Bandock/Screenshots/FirstFailedMunLanding2_zps6973dc9f.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FirstFailedMunLanding2_zps6973dc9f.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy second attempt, however, ended in success. After various successful (as well as some failed ones) Mun landings, I eventually tackled on another task. Learning orbital mechanics! One of my early attempts at circularized orbits resulted in decay (due to the fact the periapsis was low enough to cause such decays. This eventually led to establishing proper orbits around the Mun so I can eventually pick my own landing site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I have not played anything earlier than 0.13.2, y\u0027all could say I actually learned quite a bit from playing even in the demo. It was because of this game that I also decided to tackle Orbiter again (which admittedly, still need practice with). However, I was able to learn more about apoapsis and periapsis through Orbiter (which I actually first used years ago, but had no clue at the time due to the steeper learning curve).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo end this post, I will list the things I have learned/acquired throughout each version I played:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E0.13.2-0.13.3\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Built my first rocket and was able to fly it upwards without fail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Built my first Mun-reaching capable rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Built my first Mun-landing capable rocket and used it to land.
