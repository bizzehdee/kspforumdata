They are so great we can get spoiled by them, and completely forget what we last had set after landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday I used the retrograde setting to land on the Mun, and boy, did that make that so much easier. Landing somewhere flat helped, as well. Got my science done, planted a flag, went to check out the cool crater nearby. You know, the usual things you do upon landing on the Mun. After getting some choice screenshots and getting back on board, I was set to take off. Decided to shed my landing stage as it performed above specifications, and then launched. The nose immediately took a turn for the ground, which immediately got my adrenaline up and fought to correct it to stop it from being a lawn dart. That was when I realized I still had pilot control set to head for retrograde. After fixing that to stability assist and getting the ship back on course, I was able to get my breathing and pulse under control. I do have to say, managing to correct that without crashing was a true rush.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the pilot controls to help land is a real boost, unless you are coming down on challenging terrain which can require overrides. But once you have landed, don\u0027t forget to switch back to stability assist. Unless you want to go for that adrenaline rush, yourself. It helped that my return stage was so small and light(I am not up to all Mk2 parts, yet), but anything heavier would have ramped the difficulty for certain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely a word of caution for you pilots out there.
