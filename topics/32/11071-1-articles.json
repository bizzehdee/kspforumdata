IX2 seemed to be in a better position to land at the time, though no ice lakes were below the daylight side of its orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVA would like to assure all interested parties that the \u003Cem\u003EIbis X\u003C/em\u003E is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E an inherently unsafe spacecraft. The \u003Cem\u003EIbis X1\u003C/em\u003E\\\u0027s destruction was caused by pilot error, as Pilot Bobvis Kerman failed to deactivate the SAS - something that could happen for any spacecraft, although admittedly not a problem for most rockets.The \u003Cem\u003EIbis\u003C/em\u003E, being a spaceplane, has a different set of takeoff protocols. The loss of X2 was caused by its landing on the rocky and steep slopes of Minmus\\\u0027 mountains. Its mission was crippled as soon as it touched down and lost a wing, though the loss of the nose cone and with it the RADAR did nothing to help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuture VA missions to Minmus will be strictly controlled to prevent landings over mountainous regions. Takeoffs may use mountains as launch ramps, but launches should not be attempted from mountain summits.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Twinky827","CreatedById":17455,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T23:42:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERed...
