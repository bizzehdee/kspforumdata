The orbital rendezvous and docking was not so hard, but actually landing took a fair bit of the paint off of my f5 and f9 keys. I never really drilled a hole, but I ended up on my side over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. Trying to toggle back and forth between the docking and flight modes with the keyboard to do the RCS translation to get the dern thing headed straight down was just impossible. When I finally stayed upright on the gazillionth try, I was dancing all around the room. Then I started using a Nintendo controller and suddenly it was easy! I\u0027m amazed so many people still fly with their keyboards. Now it takes landing on Tylo to get my pulse rate up.

My first landing was March of last year (still a veteran, 700 hours played). My lander was a pod, parachute, 2 small fuel tanks, and two small tanks with engines to give more fuel to the main engine. I knew everything about the Kerbin system up to Mun orbit. My lander had extensive testing, ten flights to make sure it decoupled properly, 5 for the launcher, and 2 for the ladder (back then I thought you needed ladders for everything). This was my 5th attempt of a landing. Attempt 1 and 2 ran out of fuel, and 3 and 4 crashed into the Mun. The launch was perfect. I had tight margins in orbit, but the transfer stage got me into orbit around the Mun. I decoupled it, and went for the landing. I killed most of my velocity, and was really close to the surface. I forgot to kill my horizontal velocity, and I was moving around 30 m/s. I hit the Mun hard. Left fuel tank gone, righty survived though. I survived with about 60% of the ship alive. I got out, extremely excited, and planted my flag. I took a picture of it on my phone (it\u0027s still on there). I terminated the mission afterwards, but not after 3 rescue attempts.

It was my first attempt to enter a Munar orbit where I discovered that it went the wrong way around. So I had to compensate for the additional rotation during landing. So I used some of the fuel of the transfer stage that still had plenty of dV left to deorbit the lander.\n\nThen it turned out that the landing site will be inside one of the big dark craters, just off the rim, because I misjudged the amount of rotation of the Mun. I didn\u0027t dare to try to extend the trajectory because the lander was getting low on fuel. But Bill was lucky, the landing site turned out to be a smaller crater inside the rim - just pitch black because of the rim\u0027s shadow. D.... why didn\u0027t I take lights with me?
