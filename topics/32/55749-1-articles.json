One thing I have done with my KSP videos is turn the music down so it is barely audible in the video, but on my headset it is fine. I do remember that awhile back Mojang had to redo their terms of service for Minecraft as it was getting people into trouble over how it was worded, I dunno how KSP\u0027s is officially written so I cannot say we even hold the write to honestly monetize videos without their direct consent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my case it wasn\u0027t an artist claiming suit against me, but rather a partnering agency saying they held a copyright to a certain sound in my video.

Also with the coming Youtube changes to how gameplay videos are going to be handled I would strongly recommend getting as many as you can loaded up now as it could take longer to clear copyright scrubber.
