I\u0027m really just taking a survey to see how many people would actually join a stream, but yes if/when I start a community twitch I\u0027ll need to be much more personal. What I really need to start is a list of maybe 6 streamers that could do half an hour to an hour of streaming in evenings of time zones. I\u0027d be handing the streaming code of my personal stream to a number of people and keep a log of streamers in a Google Doc probably that way everyone can edit. If someone misuses the code I can reset and re-pass in PMs. Be looking for another poll in about a week if you want to either host or join. My CP runs KSP fine but doesn\u0027t stream well so I\u0027d probably just be hosting and possibly doing an occasional laggy stream. You can check my channel for an example of what I currently stream.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater all.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-10T19:38:06Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2014 07:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Avera9eJoe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-10T10:27:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is quite a task to accomplish.

You need to get more of an idea of what you want to be streaming and then approach people to see if they\u0027re interested. They\u0027ll spread the word if they are and you\u0027ll almost certainly get more interest than you would by making a forum thread containing very little actual information for potential streamers to go on (like what they would be streaming, what kinds of things you want to see on the streams and so on).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Othuyeg","CreatedById":105454,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-10T12:39:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI stream kerbal on my channel from time to time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it is not the only game I stream and I only stream occacionally and in rather bad quality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emy channel:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.twitch.tv/othuyeg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.twitch.tv/othuyeg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not believe my contributions would be very interesting to anyone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-10T19:33:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E-moved to top!-\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-10T19:37:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2014 07:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Avera9eJoe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
