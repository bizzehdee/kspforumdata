TBH, I find it a bit troubling that you guys are coming back asking us what things you potentially want to drop from the 1.0 update and save for the 1.1 update instead...\n\n**My Reasonable 1.0 Request**\n\nHere is what I feel should be mandatory includes for the 1.0 update... you dev\u0027s don\u0027t know me personally, but I am also an indie developer and highly regarded/experience programmer, and I have spent at least 700 hours on your game by now. Here is what I feel you guys should be releasing with 1.0 in order from highest to least priority:\n\n1) **Aerodynamics overhaul** - this is the big thing we were promised with this update. The current aerodynamics is bad. Part of this game isn\u0027t that it\u0027s just a space game but an airplane game as well. I think the aerodynamics need to be more realistic. It would give us a lot more reason to use parts that make rockets more aerodynamic as well. This is something that should be included in the \u0022full post beta release\u0022 of the game.\n\n2) **Reentry heat** - When I very first played KSP, I found it really strange (and dumb) why my ship didn\u0027t disintegrate in the atmosphere or anything. Reentry is the most terrifying part of a real life space voyage, yet KSP plays it off casually like it\u0027s nothing. I think the game should match. I think we need an official deadly reentry built into the game, that also includes realistic/deadly g-force like the current \u0022deadly reentry mod\u0022. I\u0027m not sure why this is even a question at this point to not include.\n\n3) **Mining** - I heard this was another promised feature to us, maybe I\u0027m wrong. But I would like a mining capability added to the game as an official new feature.\n\n4) **Stability fixes** - is it too much to ask for stability with lot of mods? I know mods are out of your control officially, BUT... you guys made a VERY mod oriented game, and nothing urks me more than when my high end, water cooled deskop computer with the latest software and hardware crashes because of memory limits of this game. I\u0027m sorry, but the excuse of Unity limiting the games memory is not an excuse anymore. You guys should find workaround for their framework to allow more memory with this game. I\u0027m a programmer and software engineer, and I know when it comes to programming anything is possible if you put your mind to it.\n\n4) **Female Kerbals and enhanced EVA suits** - I\u0027m sure it\u0027s already coming, but I think many of us would be disappointed if these things didn\u0027t come with the 1.0 update. \n\n**My Personal Wish List**\n\nThese are things that I personally wish would be added or changed in KSP... probably won\u0027t happen but it doesn\u0027t hurt to put it out there.\n\n1) **More science parts and things to spend science on** - at one point when you unlock everything in the tech tree, science almost becomes useless. Can\u0027t we get an overhaul here? \n\n2) **Less emphasis on career mode, more emphasis on science, exploration, and more rocket parts**\n\n2) **FIXED DOCKING PORT WOBBLING**\n\n3) **Saturn** - there is one great mod that added a Saturn analog to the game (Sarnus), can we get an official Saturn added to the game, though? How could you skip the coolest planet in our solar system for an explorable KSP world with one of the most interesting moons (Titan)?!\n\n4) **5M parts** - KW Rocketry is a great parts pack, sometimes I feel it should be officially included in the game. It contains 5M parts, cone-shaped fuel tanks, and more RCS blocks."},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T07:44:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E EVA kerbals orientate according to your camera.
