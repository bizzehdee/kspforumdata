I\u0027m glad Squad was able to integrate the DDS loader. Having Valentina Kerman on the main menu is a nice touch. I haven\u0027t had any memory issues, but then again I never really did in stock. Looking at the memory usage in task manager shows that there still appears to be some memory leaks on scene changes so Squad still has some more work to do on that front. The rocket particle effects on the ground and on the launchpad are neat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at the parts in sandbox, I mostly like the new parts, but I don\u0027t care for the new mk1 inline cockpit (the old model was better) and the new Flea SRB is a big missed opportunity to add a proper 0.625m booster. All the other boosters are 1.25m already, we didn\u0027t really need another one. The new wings with fuel tanks are nice, but I wish Squad had made that change to all the other wings as well. All of the engines have been rebalanced and it looks like the worst of the balance issues have been addressed. The new fairings and service modules are pretty slick as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new aero model is a nice improvement from the old placeholder, but it still needs some balancing/tweaking. Jet engines have way too much acceleration (FAR had to reduce their thrust in previous KSP versions to prevent this, but Squad doesn\u0027t seem to have rebalanced this yet) and parachutes are just silly now. The deployed chutes are immune to heat effects and even partially deployed at 30km have magical craft-slowing properties that easily redline the G-meter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoving onto the new career mode, I\u0027m sad to see that Squad hasn\u0027t really fixed anything here, in some ways they\u0027ve actually made things worse. First off, the tech tree is still terrible. It has numerous issues with balance and progression that I won\u0027t go into here as it would take up way too much space. Suffice to say I don\u0027t think Squad\u0027s method of determining the tech tree layout was successful at doing anything besides randomly moving parts around. There\u0027s still a lot of parts in nonsensical locations in the tree and poorly thought out part dependencies that more or less make certain parts useless until you\u0027ve unlocked another node with the supporting parts (i.e. you get antennas before batteries, and the transmission cost is so high you can\u0027t even send one crew report without depleting the internal batteries in the command pod so antennas are useless until you get batteries). The only improvement I can see is that airplane parts are available sooner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContracts are marginally better than they were before, but still need a LOT of work and a way to filter out certain types of contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis leads to another major balance issue: funds are basically meaningless. You get so much from contracts that even on hard you don\u0027t have to think about them. It seems like Squad heard people complaining about the building upgrade costs, so rather than adding an extra tier to smooth out the progression they threw money at the player so they could just upgrade them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlaying the game, I didn\u0027t really run into any bugs, the EVApult is fixed and water seems to be a bit more forgiving. The only issue I noticed was some Z-fighting around the space center (and the lack of clouds). The textures for some of the older parts really look out of place (i.e. mk1-2 pod has a pretty low-res texture even on high settings and looks pretty bad compared to the newer parts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking into the game files, its nice to see that the tech tree is now editable without mods, but the promised ability to edit the upgradeable buildings appears to be missing. This was a major sore spot with modders and at a glance it looks like Squad hasn\u0027t done anything to address this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, this update is about what I expected. The new features are neat, but balance is still way off and quite a few bugs were revealed during the livestreams after the cutoff date so they won\u0027t be fixed until the next update (this is exactly why I and many others made such a big deal about Squad not doing another beta release before 1.0). It doesn\u0027t feel like a 1.0 release, to me it\u0027s just another (albeit larger than normal) update that should be called 0.27. There\u0027s still some fundamental issues with career that really need to be addressed, as is the game is an excellent sandbox to play around in but the career still lacks any meaning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are your impressions on the new update?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T15:07:25Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 03:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T02:32:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s hard for me to judge KSP 1.0 harshly. I have seen games less stable and far less fully-featured make it to 1.0 before, and also seen those very same games grow into something far greater than they were at 1.0 as development continued. We\u0027re somewhat spoiled when it comes to this sort of thing, as we tend to expect a level of completeness and thoroughness of testing that basically only the most profit-healthy game developers can afford. I find that, with indie games (even popular ones), you have to accept that things are never going to be quite \u0022just right\u0022, but that they\u0027ll also remain in active development long after the IPO (which is not true of most big-name titles, DLC and bugfix patching aside).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T02:48:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy impressions. Hmm. I think Squad has done a good job. I like most of the features, and the fact that it is *relatively* bug-free. When it was announced some time ago that the next update would be 1.0 and the exit from Early Access I was quite sceptical and seriously doubted whether Squad could add so many features, polish the game and squash most, if not all, the bugs. I will wait until critical reviews come out to decide whether Squad proved me wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the actual game side, it kind of feels like just another update, although a better update than usual.

Career really seems more enjoyable to me now. Yes, more balance is going to be needed, but the improvements are fantastic. Weirdly enough, I fin the new aero really adds to career: I had a lot of trouble sending Bob without SAS in a very overpowered rocket, and immediately lost Valentina on my first try (restarted since then). The new tech tree progression seems much more sensible. The amount of money you get from contracts is tweakable, so I have no problem with that... I prefer to get a bit more money (about 80%) and less science, and that balance is fun to play with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, oh god, reentering is so much more fun. I used to play with FAR and DRE, and I still find this better. I would like parachutes to break at high speeds and high g\u0027s to kill kerbals, but that is an easy fix with a mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really feel I will be playing for some time with just stock parts.

I suppose it\u0027s just a result of different perspectives -- the developers have known all along what they wanted the game to look like in a \u0027finished\u0027 state and what elements needed to be present, and we haven\u0027t. It is a big update though, and some of the new features should be pretty great when they\u0027re polished a little more. I\u0027m pretty excited about the new aerodynamics; up until now I\u0027ve flown only rockets because the old placeholder soupodynamics were just no fun at all to me. I\u0027m looking forward to giving spaceplanes another try. I\u0027m also excited about resources; I\u0027m looking forward to making missions that can go around to multiple locations and come home again, rather than one-way flights that eventually run out of fuel and are abandoned.

I like that I have to be much more careful about what I re-enter and how. But putting a heat shield on a capsule destabilizes it; how did nobody notice that in testing?! It\u0027s a problem that re-entry heating can destroy my craft, but I don\u0027t have any way to check the temperature of parts without using options hidden in a debug menu. It\u0027s also a problem that I can\u0027t see how far I can angle the capsule on re-entry to produce body lift before the heating starts hitting parts other than the heat shield.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the changes they\u0027ve made to the contracts in this version, at least so far. The problem I had with them in 0.90 was that the main new contract type that appears late-game (doing things with asteroids) didn\u0027t appeal to me, so doing the other contract types got repetitive. More contract types should help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think I agree regarding excessive funds. In version 0.90 I played career on hard mode and building up funds to pay for space center upgrades and unlock parts was the main limiting factor. This time I\u0027m playing on moderate and the upgrades are coming more quickly, but so far at least funds are still the limiting factor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn version 1.0 I just got my first ever Danny-style game bug -- when landing a capsule at the end of a flight, I noticed that the upper stage that crashed nearby had thrown some parts back up into the air. I switched to them and discovered a pair of goo containers, and they suddenly took off out of the atmosphere! By the time I switched back to the tracking station they were out around the orbit of Mun. I tried switching back to them again and the game froze. So it\u0027s still buggy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Aaaand, I just killed a tourist on re-entry. I was at something like 35km, coming in tail-first, not even seeing re-entry effects yet, and the capsule blew up. The probe core on top of it was fine, the heat shield and still-attached upper stage below it were fine, just the capsule blew.
