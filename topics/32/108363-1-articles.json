Maybe an astronomer published an article about it in Kerbin science monthly. Maybe a wealthy, crafty kerbal has a lot of relatives they\u0027d like to be rid of for a while, and put an ad about Pol in their favorite newspaper. \n\nIf you\u0027ve got the stuff, you could always just oblige them, you know, you don\u0027t have to visit the planets in any set order.\n\nBut, it\u0027s your game.

Maybe they have something they really REALLY want to get rid of, so they want you to get on a Sun-intercepting trajectory so when they toss it out the capsule, they can know it\u0027s GONE.\n\nAs far as removing a single requirement, no. I don\u0027t. You could look into the Rejector mod. Its \u0022reject by string\u0022 was pretty powerful and in .90 it allowed me to disable surveys on Kerbin and Mun while allowing them elsewhere.
