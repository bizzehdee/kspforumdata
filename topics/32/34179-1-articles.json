I have a very nice i7 2600 in my PC. It\u0027s wicked fast and very power efficient for a gaming PC processor and I love it lots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is it has HyperThreading which in most modern games isn\u0027t an issue any more as they multi-thread just fine. However, as most people know, KSP (or at least the physics?) is only capable of using 1 \u0027CPU\u0027 or \u0027Core\u0027. With HyperThreading, Intel divide each physical core into 2 virtual CPUs so, for example, my i7 has 4 \u003Cstrong\u003Ephysical\u003C/strong\u003E cores and HT makes that look like 8 \u003Cstrong\u003Evirtual\u003C/strong\u003E cores. \u003Cstrong\u003EEach virtual core is only capable of using a maximum of 50% of the cycles available on the physical core\u003C/strong\u003E it is on. So what? So that means KSP is confined to 50% of one CPU core\u0027s CPU power when it\u0027s running. As good as my i7 is, that makes it a bit slow. So what\u0027s the miracle cure?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis is for advanced users only who are 100% confident and comfortable changing their motherboard settings in their BIOS/UEFI setup screen, I also provide zero warranty and take zero responsibility for you messing up your PC doing this. It\u0027s purely experimental and done at your own risk.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you boot your PC up to play KSP, enter the BIOS/UEFI settings screen (this is usually a key press at the power-on self-test screen like Del or F2). If in doubt do some RTFM for your motherboard. Navigate to the CPU settings and look for the HyperThreading option. Set it to OFF if you can. You shouldn\u0027t need to change anything else. Save your new settings and reboot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you reboot the PC after the change you will notice if you open Task Manager in Windows that there are half the number of CPU graphs (if you have it set to graph per CPU) and they match the number of physical cores on your CPU. Also, now, KSP can use 100% of one of the physical cores to run meaning \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003Eyou get 2x the available CPU power you had before. It runs WAAAY smoother on my rig now\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E I\u0027ve done this and as far as I can see Windows 7 doesn\u0027t care and neither do any of my other games or programs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a feeling it might be a possible cure for some people\u0027s lag issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry but I really have a problem with certain kinds of people.

Nothing like shooting down misinformation with extreme prejudice. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly one minor thing to note - if you are using XP, the scheduler is unaware of which logical cores are on the same physical core, and so it\u0027s *possible* for two CPU-intensive threads to run slower. Still, extremely niche case. This is a nonissue in w7 - and i\u0027d assume in vista\u002Bw8 too - as the scheduler is aware of which logical cores share physical cores and so schedules threads appropriately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and for additional hilarity, the only way a single physical core would effectively run two logical threads at half speed is if both threads were no more than while(true) loops. In real world usage scenarios the worst-case performance per thread given two on the same physical core tends to be around 65-75% - assuming both would use 100% if they could.
