Two are currently in detection proximity. As I was experimenting with fuel lines on prototype rockets, I had brought one past the parking orbits of the three. Without even thinking I had sped up the timewarp to bring the experimental mission back down, and as it was descending, I witnessed something block my view for just the smallest of moments. After recovering from my WTF emotion, I brought up the tracking view and found I had managed to zip past my largest rocket sitting in orbit. Considering it blocked my view, it came within single digits of meters of my experimental craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrankly I am sorry I didn\\\u0027t see the pass happen in normal time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
