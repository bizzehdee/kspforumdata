Milster, Kenory and Geneemy were selected as the brave three for the first spaceflight of the space program. The mission of the flight was to test the rockects capabilities. It was concluded that the best way to do so was to try achieve as high velocity as possible. Somewhere after Kerbin escape it was realized that the return was poorly planned. The scientists had installed a parachute, but it started to look like it would have no use. The spacecraft was now on Kerbol orbit without any fuel left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe planning of a rescue mission was started immediately. The planning ang and testing took time. However, after two years, construction of a space station, several test flights, and personnel training, the rescue ship finally arrived. Geenemy was not really happy after eating beans for two years. Luckily the rescue ship had, amongst other necessities, a long awaited pizza delivery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the rescue ship \u0022Noutaja 2\u0022 (Noutaja means retriever) leaving Kerbin:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://googledrive.com/host/0B2RUAWS1gIrka3pWV0dxYUdvZ28/screenshot18.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot18.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately the target orbit had close encounter with Kerbin orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://googledrive.com/host/0B2RUAWS1gIrka3pWV0dxYUdvZ28/screenshot21.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot21.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERescue ship approching target after multiple orbital maneuvers:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://googledrive.com/host/0B2RUAWS1gIrka3pWV0dxYUdvZ28/screenshot23.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot23.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the stranded ship didn\u0027t have docking port, crew transfer was done as EVA.
