I have looked around for any news concerning new science parts, as I was a little disappointed that none were added in the last update. Has there been any talk about the future of that aspect of the parts? And are there any mods that are science heavy? I have always played pure stock, I mean no Sub-assembly or nothing (not that I think that there is anything wrong with it) but I would be willing to install a science mod. Anything out there? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, Brax\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESingularity Aerospace Innovations\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sapphire","CreatedById":67918,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T23:55:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDepends what you define as science. My science tab has three mods stored in it: One is ISA MapSat, which adds satellite dishes and GPS units for mapping planet terrain and it comes out with a heightmap (for example, see the Laythe map at the bottom). Then there\u0027s Kethane. which adds... well, Kethane, to planets, which can be detected from satellites in orbit, then mined via drills on the planet\u0027s surface, then converted into fuel. And finally there\u0027s the Lazor mod, which comes with a whole bunch of things like advanced targeting, scanning, resource transfer, afterburner for engines, tractor beams and hover modes, laser-guided flight, and various nice things like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhoo, a heightmap from ISA MapSat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9NeH3ky.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229NeH3ky.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-09T23:58:07Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2013 11:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Sapphire\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T00:17:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d recommend RemoteTech, adds dishes/antennas and remote control/command parts.
