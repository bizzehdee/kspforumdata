A second lifter from the same mission, originally meant to be used once, is refueled and reused to recover them. Rescue!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT - An example from my own game - I sent a mission to go find the [REDACTED]. A PROBE BASTARD FOXTROT and a pair of Kerbals in a tiny DEMV rover were dispatched to Ike. The Kerbals set up shop on the north pole of Ike and waited for the [REDACTED] to pass by, whereupon they sent commands to the PBF. I did not have a plan for getting them home. As I was winding up my 0.18 save, I decided to return all the brave Kerbals who I\u0027d gone so far with to Kerbin. Including the two that I had so callously stranded on Ike. So I sent a ship to recover them. Not a rescue yet. When that ship ran out of fuel in a strange, strange orbit around Duna instead of docking nicely with the fuel tanker in Duna orbit and I had to send the \u003Cem\u003ECity of Pomona\u003C/em\u003E to retrieve them, then it became a rescue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would also count if you have a vessel specifically designated for rescues that gets used.

They had to scrap the original mission due to explosion and then repurpose multiple parts of their craft in order to make it safely home.
