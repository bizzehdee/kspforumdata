Then I circularize so that the other side is higher or lower, depending on where the target is in relation to me.

If it\u0027s in front then I need to catch up, so have part of my orbit lower than the target so I can go around faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomewhere in the middle of all that I get my AN and DN down to 0 with a small burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that\u0027s left now is to orbit until such time as the encounter markers flip from your target being in front/behind to the other way.
