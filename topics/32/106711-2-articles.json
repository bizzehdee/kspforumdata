I explain why the l2p argument doesn\u0027t work and you retort with the same tired, judgmental reply style that I\u0027ve gotten used to by now for some reason.

Building wings and actually putting work into the craft to make them look good is something we simply can\u0027t anymore.

KSP version 1.0 only, entries from 0.90 or before will not be considered. (Please specify if you are using 1.0.1 or 1.0.2 as well.)\n\u003E \n\u003E - No cfg editing, save editing, debug menu, or any other shenanigans.\n\u003E \n\u003E - No physics exploits, the vessel must be lifted by thrust and aerodynamic lift alone. Decoupler force is permitted between propulsive stages, multiple stacked decouplers are not.\n\u003E \n\u003E - Payload must be mounted to a decoupler or docking node and separated from the lifter in a stable orbit with a periapsis of at least 70km. Update: The decoupler/docking port must stay with the lifter.\n\u003E \n\u003E - Payload must be inert and contribute nothing but incidental body lift and command authority to the lifter (crewed pod or probe core is ok). All reaction wheels, batteries and fuel tanks in the payload must be disabled via tweakables.\n\u003E \n\u003E - The base of the lifter must be close to the pad surface, preferably touching it. No kilometer-high launch clamps please.\n\u003E \n\u003E - Please keep part clipping to a minimum. In particular, do not clip engines at all.\n\u003E \n\u003E - Images or video of your design is required for entry, showing launch mass, payload mass in stable orbit, and enough in between to show how your vessel works. Craft files are encouraged so we can learn from each other\u0027s techniques.\n\u003E \n\u003E Permitted mods: Visual/immersion mods, informational mods, autopilot if that\u0027s your thing. This is primarily a design challenge.\n\u003E \n\u003E Forbidden mods: Anything that modifies stock parts, adds new parts, or changes the game\u0027s physics in any way.\n\u003E \n\u003E Aside from that, be creative. Build big or small, use exotic staging, mix and match propulsion types, whatever makes it more efficient.\n\u003E \n\u003E **The Scoring:**\n\u003E \n\u003E Score is a percentage, computed as PayloadMassInOrbit / TotalLaunchMass \\* 100, higher is better.

EDIT: (This desc is greatly simplified, go to the link in my signature for a detailed step by step for those new to flying spaceplanes to orbit)\n\nI make it to an UGLY orbit of 120km x 78 km , de-orbited with the RCS and landed in the great desert...\n\nThe only potentially relevant mod here might be Kerbal Join Re enforcement, but you can easily add spacetape if needed.\n\nI am a TAC LS user, and there is a LS container on this ship. If you want to use this ship you\u0027ll need to at least load the standard size LS container and then remove it. \n\n(NOTE I\u0027m using NecroBones\u0027s fuel tanks plus, makes the stock tanks LOOK pretty, but there are no changes, this craft file should load just fine for those that don\u0027t use that mod)\n\n[CRAFT FILE HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x228ku3tiydrmb9/F14%20Ace%20TEST%20I.craft?dl=0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T06:14:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 06:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rottielover**"},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T05:56:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Man, you couldn\u0027t be more wrong.
