Feel there is not much documentation about deployable science mechanism so I experimented it little bit and have my conclusions. Just want to confirm for all types deployable science (like go-ob, weather) will stop giving more science after reaching 100%\u00A0. Redeployment with new ones after that will not help.\u00A0So I only need to carry each type to a planet\u00A0once\u00A0 in the whole\u00A0game.\u00A0 Wonder if there is a real point for a 5-star scientist to deploy them since anywhere other than Kerbin will generate science\u00A0pretty quickly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-11T19:53:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is correct, and welcome to the forum. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
