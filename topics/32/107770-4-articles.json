They spend it and that\u0027s their fleet. They use it to defend, assault and conquer. The player with the most planets wins (to account for moons- we use a point system (1 point for planet, 1/2 point for moons)\n\nthat it\u0027s going to be that everyone gets a capitol ship to run all fleets (knock it out and the player takes a penalty that he loses a round to retailiate in combat and must always attack last (the capitol acts as the head and the coordinator of all attacks basically and you should therefore take a penalty on its loss)- \n\nThen you get large ships- what would be classed as destroyers or assault class battleships (large crafts built for attacking other large ships (using large weapons like SRBs cannons and so forth to breach heavy armor)\n\nThen you get support ships- these ships can provide fuel- ammo or other such for aid of the other ships. These lack direct firepower as they tend to linger away from battle to survive.\n\nThen you get mother ships- that can carry up to a maximum of 5 assault class fighters inside of one craft. These lack firepower or have no power at all since they rely on the ships they deploy and or other crafts nearby for aid.\n\nYou also get Frigates- or smaller vessels that can assault larger ships, yet are small in size and carry little firepower. They rely on smaller ships to help defending it from fighter firepower.\n\nThen you have Juggernauts ships- these are small, heavily armored crafts that usually carry larger ship bombs or loads of fighter firepower. \n\nThen there\u0027s bombers- which carry specifically large craft bombs and lack firepower against fighters.\n\nThen there\u0027s fighters, which come in several classes: Assault class- this is the largest class in that it carries heavy firepower built for both capitol ship attacks and also juggernaut or frigate class assaults. \n\n-Standard class- carrying firepower for both assaults on larger crafts and smaller crafts, this is the most balanced craft set.\n\n-interceptor class- carrying firepower specifically for fighter to fighter combat. Typically more lightweight and faster than any other classes.\n\nThen theres the Scout/Guerrilla Warefare class- this is for crafts that are very lightweight and are very quick. If they are minimally armed they would likely be classed scout- it they are VERY fast and armed they would be classed as Guerrilla Warefare class.\n\nHere is the class rundown in simplicity in order in which they would move (with credit purchase per unit listed):\n\nGuerrilla Warefare Class (12 credits)\n\nScout class (6 credits)\n\nFighters:\n\n-interceptor (8 credits)\n\n-standard (5 credits)\n\n-assault (8 credits)\n\nJuggernaut (9 credits)\n\nFrigate (10 credits)\n\nMother ship (25 credits)\n\nSupport (20 credits)\n\nBattleship (35 credits)\n\nMother ship (1 free at start- 50 credits)\n\nThen there\u0027s probe class objects- these can be anything from repair units to \u0022hacking\u0022 probes- each are special and unique. \n\nRepair drone- small lightweight, incapable of fighting directly but can repair, move other ships.\n\nRefueling probe- a moderate weight craft used for adding fuel to crafts, not capable of fighting directly.\n\nX drone- this is a drone of an otherwise manned craft- this can be anything from the first list, but with extra cost.\n\nHacking probe- this is a craft that can dock to an enemy craft and can for 2 rounds \u0022hack\u0022 that craft allowing to take control and manipulate their crafts. However after the second round you MUST undock.\n\nAlso this is REQUIRED for use of ANY unmanned crafts-\n\nYou must have a ComSat cruiser to control your probes- should this craft fall all unmanned spacecraft become \u0022dead\u0022- they can be saved by docking with them after the battle- but until you do so- they become inactive and unable to do anything at all.\n\nList with costs and order-\n\nRepair drone (2 credits)\n\nRefueling drone (3 credits)\n\nX drone ( 2 \\* the cost of the manned craft)\n\nHacking probe (30 credits)\n\nComSat cruiser (30 credits)\n\nI\u0027ll have more on this systems later."},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T03:03:05Z","Content":"Feel free to comment on the system- it is in no way complete or perfect.
