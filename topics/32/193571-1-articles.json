In the Transfer Window Planner GUI, the button to display it (Show Ejection Angles) isn\u0027t turned on. If you\u0027ve not used that info, turn it on and look for the ejection angle display in the map view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-03T13:21:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis should probably be in the \u0027tech support- modded installs\u0027 section of the forums.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour node is probably in the wrong place, to travel out from the Sun you need to have the maneuver node positioned so that you burn \u0027forwards\u0027 relative to the Sun and exit the planet\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E ahead of it; to travel towards the Sun the opposite is true and you need to position the node to burn \u0027backwards\u0027 relative to the Sun.
