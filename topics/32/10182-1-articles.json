I had a small spacecraft, and I was practicing touching the separated lower stage with it. Well, while I was doing this, I accidentally engaged the engine and rammed the lower stage, blowing everything to pieces. The capsule survived - but everything got blown off of it, including the parachute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, rather than let the crew die, I decided to mount a rescue mission.

On my first grab, it just rolled out. So, I got in front of the capsule, and as I grabbed it, I started up the engines on low power, hoping to pin it to the spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/81kM9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002281kM9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMiraculously, it worked!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/giRSt.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022giRSt.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uWzbt.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022uWzbt.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had just enough fuel to slow it down enough to get the parachutes to open and to slow it as it approached the ocean.
