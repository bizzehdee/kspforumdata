Personally I prefer to either build the launch rocket to have slightly too little delta-V to get all the way to orbit so that it will naturally fall back down while the payload itself does the last little bit of insertion burn, or build a launch rocket that can be returned and recovered to be \u201Creused\u201D later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Curveball Anders","CreatedById":107529,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-12T14:51:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223939343\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200930\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221615557880\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199902\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jimmymcgoochie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n43 minutes ago, jimmymcgoochie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Personally I prefer to either build the launch rocket to have slightly too little delta-V to get all the way to orbit so that it will naturally fall back down while the payload itself does the last little bit of insertion burn\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDitto.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEsp since I like standard launchers and normally use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E to handle the ascent to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich gives a scary high possibility of smacking into to spent stages or other debris.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy closest encounter wasn\u0027t 5km, it was more like \u0026lt; 50m ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ziggy Kerman","CreatedById":210324,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-12T17:34:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223939358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200930\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221615560675\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107529\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Curveball Anders\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Curveball Anders said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich gives a scary high possibility of smacking into to spent stages or other debris.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy closest encounter wasn\u0027t 5km, it was more like \u0026lt; 50m ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had a space station where the 2nd stages were the main propulsion unit until docking and then I ejected it, I had to do some odd \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E maneuvering to get it away because I forgot my deorbit motors, well, at this point it\u0027s only a matter of time until I have a strike with a station with a capulse trunk or SM piece that got blown off before the deorbit burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223939323\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200930\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221615553218\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022209823\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dientus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Dientus said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that, I clean all debris by deorbiting it to burn up, or if I can\u0027t, I hit the terminate button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy Hermes coms system is unnumbered, for some reason, so I\u0027m fairly weary of debris termination, so I\u0027m working on Allen, the Alligator; a giant BFR-esque thing with the Mk3 tail thingy to catch dead satellites or a MEPs\u00A0to do, what is says on the tin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
