From reading the craft file, it looks like what you had is very similar to what I had, except that you\u0027re using the 90/110 fuel tanks instead of the 45/55 ones and you also have tail fins. I read on another thread that the larger tanks somehow have less drag when stacked up than the smaller ones, so that may have made a significant difference. You also put less fuel in your upper stage and more in your lower than I did, which probably helped as well. Moreover, the tail fins probably helped you to maintain a better profile -- if you think that ship was hard to control you should have seen mine! The thing I didn\u0027t mention in my OP was that I was trying to do this as my second mission of the game, so I only had the first two nodes of the tech tree unlocked. No tail fins or bigger tanks for me. Anyway, you have shown that it is doable without upgrading any facilities!\u003Cp\u003EOh, and as to the Launchpad upgrade being first, I was thinking more that the astronaut facility would be the best one to do first, because then you can do space EVAs over all the different Kerbin biomes to get more science. Either way, the Launchpad would definitely be the next one for me. There\u0027s no getting to the Mun with only 18 tons! I guess it\u0027s really a matter of what you\u0027re trying to do. My goal has basically been to get as far as possible with as few flights as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah I don\u0027t think I can get the part limit in with the small tanks. Having the two down-fueled trash cans o boom actually made a bit of a difference too, Without them i would have wasted a lot of fuel trying to accelerate with ~ 1.1 TWR at the very beginning. instead then get me up to 120m/s in the first few seconds and then the regular engine maintains that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI put the exact amount in the lower stage that I did because of the dry mass on the tanks. Each of those tanks has ~ .125 tons of dry mass, and the engine weighs 1.25 tons. 8 empty tanks = 1 ton. I\u0027ve found just under the dry mass of the stage engine is where you can justify as additional stage. When weight limited there is a tradeoff between more fuel efficient by more stages, and weight wasted in an additional engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheMoonRover","CreatedById":136199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T00:57:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI play on normal difficulty.

Don\u0027t have any probes or solar panels yet though. Fortunately researching in that direction will also yield the thermometer and pressure sensor. Those unlocks help pay for themselves. And not having EVA sucks. I thought saving up for the VAB would be the smart thing to do, but am now seeing that might be incorrect. EVA reports should also help unlock parts, and at the same time contracts for those parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got a few contracts for 2 tourists, sub-robital. Very easy to do with the Mk1 inline pod, and the only cost is fuel and some grabage cans thinly disguised as boosters. 14k isn\u0027t much but at least it\u0027s something. Now if they want a full orbit... let\u0027s just say the ticket price better increase to match. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does seem that i\u0027m not getting any profitable contracts because i haven\u0027t unlocked some important techs.

It\u0027s quick, easy to fly, typically easy to land though your mileage may vary and you can score some survery contracts that pay pretty well. Typically they involve flying around KSC area and radioing reports. Since the basic jet engine is also a powerplant, a simple aerial will help you nab plenty of science, and you can easily fly over highlands or towards the desert. Best of all, landing back at KSC recovers at 100% so the only cost of the trip is spent fuel. Make sure you pay attention to survey requirements, because some require a high-altitude Turbo-Jet plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother (smaller) benefit of having basic aircraft parts is that you can build a wingless one that acts like an early rover.

It wont yield too much, but enough to offset the cost of investing in tech.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETourist contracts turned out to indeed be a bit of a dead end. Sub-orbitals can be done dirt cheap but pay about as much and orbitals plain suck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout a solar panel, it\u0027s still posible and desirable to have a satellite in orbit. I filled up a service bay with 6 batteries and 1 thermometer, stuck an aerial on the side and attached it all to a stayputnik.

Battery spam might help. A biger headache for me was the tight restrictions on the size and weight of my contraption. I can get (maybe) 1 Kerbal into the Mun\u0027s SOI, but other than a crew report and EVA report, it won\u0027t get much science. It will fulfill a Munar Pass contract though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVA suits upgrade is totally worth it. Much better than upgrading the VAB first. Don\u0027t forget that you don\u0027t need to achieve orbit to perform EVAs over Kerbins biomes, you can make a suborbital hop and pass several. I covered grasslands, highlands, shores and water on my way to a polar landing, so that was a very succesfull flight for it\u0027s cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, considering how diverse the KSC is regarding science farming, i was disappointed to find nothing but grasslands at the island runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, finally. Though some have labeled the early science farming programmes a \u0022grind\u0022, i have so far enjoyed every attempt. They can be tedious, but they can be fun too. It all depends on how you approach the problem and how you try to solve it. I usually do \u0022a bit reckless\u0022 followed by \u0022irresponsible and haphazard\u0022 and the results have been fun.
