From reading the craft file, it looks like what you had is very similar to what I had, except that you\u0027re using the 90/110 fuel tanks instead of the 45/55 ones and you also have tail fins. I read on another thread that the larger tanks somehow have less drag when stacked up than the smaller ones, so that may have made a significant difference. You also put less fuel in your upper stage and more in your lower than I did, which probably helped as well. Moreover, the tail fins probably helped you to maintain a better profile -- if you think that ship was hard to control you should have seen mine! The thing I didn\u0027t mention in my OP was that I was trying to do this as my second mission of the game, so I only had the first two nodes of the tech tree unlocked. No tail fins or bigger tanks for me. Anyway, you have shown that it is doable without upgrading any facilities!\n\u003E Oh, and as to the Launchpad upgrade being first, I was thinking more that the astronaut facility would be the best one to do first, because then you can do space EVAs over all the different Kerbin biomes to get more science. Either way, the Launchpad would definitely be the next one for me. There\u0027s no getting to the Mun with only 18 tons! I guess it\u0027s really a matter of what you\u0027re trying to do. My goal has basically been to get as far as possible with as few flights as possible.\n\nYeah I don\u0027t think I can get the part limit in with the small tanks. Having the two down-fueled trash cans o boom actually made a bit of a difference too, Without them i would have wasted a lot of fuel trying to accelerate with ~ 1.1 TWR at the very beginning. instead then get me up to 120m/s in the first few seconds and then the regular engine maintains that.\n\nI put the exact amount in the lower stage that I did because of the dry mass on the tanks. Each of those tanks has ~ .125 tons of dry mass, and the engine weighs 1.25 tons. 8 empty tanks = 1 ton. I\u0027ve found just under the dry mass of the stage engine is where you can justify as additional stage. When weight limited there is a tradeoff between more fuel efficient by more stages, and weight wasted in an additional engine."},{"CreatedByName":"TheMoonRover","CreatedById":136199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T00:57:33Z","Content":"I play on normal difficulty.

Once i was sure the Kerbals were gonna live, waiting to touchdown became so boring. I also went after unmanned probes early only to discover i can\u0027t lock SAS, then spent moar science on a SAS module... that also doesn\u0027t work without a living pilot. I was starved of science at that point and started a new career.\n\nI chose hard settings except i enabled reverting and quicksave. I\u0027ve yet to use quicksave. I may never use it, but i do revert rocket launches on occasion (never to save Kerbals from death, i like the having to think about actually bringing them back in one piece). I spent forever trying to reach orbit in finless rockets and lucked into it early with Jeb, but after adding science bits to the rocket i failed a million times. Investing in fins turned out to be a huge success. For some reason (my s\\*\\*\\*\\*y piloting) i can\u0027t reach the poles with a rocket that comfortably reaches orbit.\n\nLong story short, having the luxury of reverting flights is a huge bonus. Though if you use it too often you fail to learn and stick to the lessons learned. Think of every time you revert a flight as a major failure on your part. I like the idea of risking Kerbals and plan to use manned capsules for virtually everything, BUT i need some way of sanely testing certain contraptions.\n\n**On the subject of hard settings... anyone got any tips on earnng money?** I\u0027m at 140k and have no idea how to raise 450k needed to upgrade the VAB.

It\u0027s quick, easy to fly, typically easy to land though your mileage may vary and you can score some survery contracts that pay pretty well. Typically they involve flying around KSC area and radioing reports. Since the basic jet engine is also a powerplant, a simple aerial will help you nab plenty of science, and you can easily fly over highlands or towards the desert. Best of all, landing back at KSC recovers at 100% so the only cost of the trip is spent fuel. Make sure you pay attention to survey requirements, because some require a high-altitude Turbo-Jet plane.\n\nAnother (smaller) benefit of having basic aircraft parts is that you can build a wingless one that acts like an early rover. Load up on Science Jrs. and Goo, slap some thermometers and cruise around KSC collecting science. if you run out of power for radio transmissions, engage the brakes fully and power up the jet engine to recharge. It wont yield too much, but enough to offset the cost of investing in tech.\n\nTourist contracts turned out to indeed be a bit of a dead end. Sub-orbitals can be done dirt cheap but pay about as much and orbitals plain suck.\n\nWithout a solar panel, it\u0027s still posible and desirable to have a satellite in orbit. I filled up a service bay with 6 batteries and 1 thermometer, stuck an aerial on the side and attached it all to a stayputnik. It fulfilled 3 \u0022science from Kerbin orbit\u0022 contracts so far and still has 620 power left.\n\nA munar pass is very risky to try without solar panels. Battery spam might help. A biger headache for me was the tight restrictions on the size and weight of my contraption. I can get (maybe) 1 Kerbal into the Mun\u0027s SOI, but other than a crew report and EVA report, it won\u0027t get much science. It will fulfill a Munar Pass contract though.\n\nEVA suits upgrade is totally worth it. Much better than upgrading the VAB first. Don\u0027t forget that you don\u0027t need to achieve orbit to perform EVAs over Kerbins biomes, you can make a suborbital hop and pass several. I covered grasslands, highlands, shores and water on my way to a polar landing, so that was a very succesfull flight for it\u0027s cost.\n\nFinally, considering how diverse the KSC is regarding science farming, i was disappointed to find nothing but grasslands at the island runway.\n\nFinally, finally. Though some have labeled the early science farming programmes a \u0022grind\u0022, i have so far enjoyed every attempt. They can be tedious, but they can be fun too. It all depends on how you approach the problem and how you try to solve it. I usually do \u0022a bit reckless\u0022 followed by \u0022irresponsible and haphazard\u0022 and the results have been fun.
