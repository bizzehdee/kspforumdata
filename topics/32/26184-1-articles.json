In an open-cycle gaseous core nuclear rocket engine, the fissile fuel is in gaseous form and is mixed with the reaction mass (hydrogen, for example). This intimate mix allows the reaction mass to be heated to a higher temperature and you get a higher Isp. There is an attempt to retain as much of the fissile fuel as possible (by using spinning reaction vessels, for example, which cause the heavier uranium-containing gas to move to the outer circumference of the reaction chamber), but some of the fissile fuel gets lost as it exits through the nozzle with the reaction mass. So this type of nuclear engine has very radioactive exhaust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a closed-cycle gaseous core nuclear rocket engine, the fissile fuel is in a gaseous state, but it is confined inside structures (such as quartz walled containers) that retain the fissile fuel and its nuclear-reaction byproducts inside the rocket engine), and the reaction mass (such as hydrogen) only comes in contact with the exterior of the quartz containers and is heated and expelled through the nozzle. So this type of closed-cycle engine does not spew out fissile fuel and fission byproducts in the exhaust. It pays for this by having only one-half the Isp possible with an open-cycle nuclear engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe NERVA engine uses a solid-core reactor. The nuclear fuel and fission byproducts are retained inside the reactor core in the fuel elements. The reaction fluid (again, hydrogen is most efficient) flows through the reactor core and is heated by coming in contact with the casing material that encloses the fuel elements. The heated hydrogen then expands out the nozzle. The hydrogen spends very little time in the reactor core on its way through the engine, so it is not going to become very radioactive (just as in the closed-cycle gaseous core nuclear engine). What radioactivity the NERVA engine exhaust contains would primarily come from any material that is eroded away from the fuel rod casings or moderator material (which can become neutron-activated over time). The NERVA engnes are closed-cycle in that they do NOT spew their fissile fuel or fission byproducts out of the engine nozzle with the reaction mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-10T04:41:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2013 04:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"White Owl","CreatedById":10849,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-10T07:17:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy current series\u0027 house rules are something like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll designs must work with both FAR and Deadly Reentry installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo autopilot software ever, excepting ASAS for basic attitude hold.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo conventional rockets.
