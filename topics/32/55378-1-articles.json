When I first got the game I couldn\u0027t get a rocket into orbit. I just strapped a Kerbal onto a makeshift rocket and saw how far I could get him into the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlowly, I started getting things into orbit. I then starting gettings thing back to the surface from orbit. I then managed to get a rocket to do a free-return around the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, I successfully got a Mun landing AND got them back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been having a blast working through career mode collecting science. I\u0027m not efficient at it, as I try to create somewhat plausable rockets (no ungodly wide rocket designs). My current masterpiece is a rocket with a small lander than can get a Kerbal to the Mun and Minmus and back. I\u0027ve also gotten the same design to do an orbit of Duna and Eve with enough fuel to return safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first ever orbit of Duna, I royally screwed up the return window. I waited in orbit for the planets to align for a proper return window. I set up the return burn and realized I was orbiting Duna the wrong direction. Rather than try to fudge the return burn on the opposite side of Duna, I thought I\u0027d get cute and transfer to Duna\u0027s moon THEN do the return burn at the proper angle. I screwed up the time acceleration and ended up slingshotting myself out of Duna\u0027s encounter before doing the proper return burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbiting the with little fuel reserve, I waited until I hit my apoapsis and lowered my periapsis to just below Kerbin\u0027s orbit. In a stroke of luck, I wasn\u0027t too far away from a Kerbin encounter on the first pass. I fudged my trajectory a number of times until I was able to get a Kerbin flyby at 42k. Using the aerobrake and the last of my fuel, I was just able to enter an orbit around Kerbin as my fuel ran out. From there, it was just letting the repeated aerobrakes bring Jebediah home a little more than a year after he left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now, I\u0027m trying to build a lander that can redock with the rocket to allow a Duna moon landing. The increase in weight has rendered my previous rocket design obsolete, so now I\u0027m trying to either build a heavy lifter, or try to find out how to build a spacestation that I can lift the rocket and lander to so I can launch fully fueled from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a long way from not even getting out of the atmosphere. The game sort of reminds me of when I\u0027d play with legos as a kid. Just take a bunch of random parts and see if you can make something cool with it.
