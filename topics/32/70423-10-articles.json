They have realistic opening to avoid the \u0060chute explosion\u0060 effect. You can set the height they open, the time they take to open and how much drag they have so you could take, say, 5 seconds to open a very big chute on Eve and then slowly slow to landing speed for about 100m up.

You have to get you speed exactly right and align the docking ports really really well and then just thrust a little with your main engines and you\u0060ll (most of the time) dock ok.
