It\u0027s a drive-by shot intended to piss off all the regular players who love the game. And clearly it worked.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a regular player, I love this game, and I think the comment is important. It definitely hasn\u0027t pissed me off, but has shown that someone\u0027s expectations are missed and I\u0027m sure Squad would hear from this type of player in addition to the fans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LameLefty\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LameLefty\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELook, if you don\u0027t like the game, don\u0027t play it. If you have CONSTRUCTIVE feedback to the devs as they refine and improve Career Mode, by all means give it. But don\u0027t dump a massive insult-turd on the game\u0027s fan base and expect to be taken seriously.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe\u0027s pretty clear in his description, the progress is measly and he\u0027s gotten confused over what to do to power his transmissions, see it from a newbie\u0027s view and he\u0027s behaved quite rationally. I agree, a total nerd would know the basics of power systems, atmospheric drag, some orbital mechanics. I haven\u0027t even suggested my gf play this game for that reason, and she is a huge gaming fan (D3, Civ5, Sims etc) - it\u0027s just not accessible without some classroom time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LameLefty\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LameLefty\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E(And I\u0027m a former spacecraft design engineer so I\u0027m as nerdy as they come about a lot of things).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m in IT and have seen the same thing in this engineering field: experts have difficulty seeing a novice\u0027s perspective.

The very first Vostokhad no solar panels, so don\u0027t we. Career mode boosts your creativity. For example, I didn\u0027t have side decouplers, so I just placed the normal ones around on the sides and attached srbs to them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I didn\u0027t have solar panels, I just but a bunch of battery packs and did all turns carefully so as not to waste electric charge on the reaction wheels. I would transfer data till I was close to running out, then I would stock up on experiments and take them home. There is some sense in career mode, it adds a little challenge in a fun and (somewhat) educational way.
