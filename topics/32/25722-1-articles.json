One of my ships ran out of fuel while transfer burning from Kerbin to Eve and is now orbiting Kerbol unable to maneuver so I sent a rescue craft but I noticed several oddities when trying to dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, getting an encounter was way more difficult than around Kerbin and had to be done in multiple stages, from getting a 100.000km encounter from far away, then going to 10.000km, 1.000km and finally slightly below 100km which I was unable to improve by means of RCS anymore (no direction of movement reduced the encounter anymore). So after a hefty 1200m/s burn at closest approach to reduce the relative velocities to zero I burned towards the target and managed to get a 2.6km encounter. At this point I thought that I got it but I was very wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where things got really weird. Normally, when within a few km from a target, a marker starts to appear on the other ship, but not in this case. I could see the other ship pass by but there was no target marker as when docking in Kerbin or other body orbits. Furthermore, after reducing the relative velocity to zero again, the distance to target continued raising nontheless (Displayed Rel. Velocity stayed 0.0). Even thrusting towards the target, having my target-relative prograde-marker pointing directly towards the target, did help nothing, the distance to the target increased, but the relative speed stayed the same (so differently from what you usually get when burning directly towards a target in Kerbin orbit from too far away and messing up the orbits). Unfortunately, I then ran out of RCS fuel and had to abort docking since the ship did not have enough rotation authority without RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will try another attempt later with an improved ship but I wonder if anyone has ever tried docking a vessel in stellar orbit and noticed any oddities or if it was just a piece of cake. I expected the latter, especially after getting that 2.6km encounter, but was then struck by strange effects that I could not explain. Another oddity I noticed is that when zooming in on the system map, the ships were drawn quite off their orbital paths when zooming in far enough. So I wonder, was this my mistake? I docked countless times in Kerbin orbit and when something went wrong I could at least figure that out, but here I\u0027m completely clueless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI apologize if this is a duplicate but I looked for information regarding docking vessels in Sun orbits and could not dig up anything.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Banbite","CreatedById":5170,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T13:22:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EF4 toggles the labels of vessels, that could be the reason why you didn\u0027t see any.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t tried it but one reason why it could be so hard is that the increase in scale makes floating point errors much more prominent, maybe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T14:42:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, I remember screaming BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUG when I lost the tags in my early days.
