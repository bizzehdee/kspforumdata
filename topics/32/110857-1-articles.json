That\u0027s weird. I haven\u0027t encountered this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would do: Pretend you collected Jalotte, and legitimately land your rescue craft after rendezvouzing with the empty pod as if things had gone normally. Then, Use debug menu to force-pass that mission. If you don\u0027t get Jalotte Kerman, I would then recruit any random female astronaut from the facility and go into the save data once you\u0027ve closed the game and rename her Jalotte, all just to simulate the mission working normally. (persistent.sfs in saves) Then you can proceed, and pretend the bug never happend, and the result will be virtually identical.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T03:23:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you look for Jalotte in the Astronaut Complex?

This was my second trip to the Mun for this campaign. The first one just being a flyby as I didn\u0027t have enough Dv for a capture and return. Just to collect some science as I went past and back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI unlocked heavy rockets with that science and used the new 2.5m parts to do the rescue mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I figured it out now though. I\u0027m pretty sure this is a ghost left over from when I trialled Interstellar Flight Inc - Kerbal Life Support Mod. I installed to try instead of Tac Life Support. I tried a rescue mission around Kerbin previously with the mod and the Kerbal was gone which I attributed to having no life support on the stranded craft. I removed the mod and am playing this campaign now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t immediately make the association because it\u0027s no longer installed and the fact it has happened to me twice now I thought maybe it\u0027s actually bug in the game and was never the mods fault at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact no one else has experienced this issue now makes me think I need a clean slate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"uglyduckling81","CreatedById":129740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T23:28:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I have come across a weird issue on my very next mission.
