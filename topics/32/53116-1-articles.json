I set up my abort sequence on my newest rocket and loaded in a Kerbal to give it a test. Got it up to about 1500M, and hit the abort button. Everything worked beautifully, until... I had placed the three chutes on the fuel unit for RBS which was located just below the capsule. On top of the capsule I had one of those multiple docking port thingys. Everything was falling along just fine until the chutes fully deployed. Then the center of balance shifted and I watched as the whole contraption tilted to the side and the capsule separated from the RBS fuel tank and slid right off the edge. The absolutely hilarious part was after the capsule hit the ground and exploded here came the fuel tank gently gliding to the ground under three chutes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wish I had taped it.

Once when my Can Lander had chutes above it on another part. Was blissfully unaware of what was about to hapen when the chutes fully opened as normally nothing bad ever happened when I hade them above. Needless to say when they opened the can lander part went down minus its top section, one of those WTF moments. Luckly the Lander section landed upon its SAS and Monopropelent tank, both of which where destroyed but saved the lander and its crew from death. With the top part drifting down.

I didn\u0027t think much about it and I was happy when I got the SOI change, so didn\u0027t notice I was entering a retrograde orbit. I circularized low around Jool and did some science. Then I thought I\u0027d visit one of the moons and see them for myself. Made a node and wow! That was easy. So I zoomed in for the SOI change and Vall sped by me like lightning. This puzzled me a bit, and when I zoomed out and saw the massive, skewed, elliptical orbit I realized I was going retrograde. I was hoping to land somewhere but that was definitely out of the question. My orbit extended over half the moons on the periapsis side and four times as long on the apoapsis side, so I thought I could get some science by randomly stumbling into a moon. I got one SOI change (that wreaked havoc with my Jool orbit) and started waiting for the next one. By the time I noticed I HAD a SOI change it was too late, and passed over it at maximum timewarp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy probe then promptly left the Jool system, going escape velocity from Kerbol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving this episode on tape wouldn\u0027t be so interesting.

It was pretty simple. A hitchhiker pod, a probe pod, RCS and RCS thrusters, a battery, sepratrons, and parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst test, I learned that the hitchhiker pod is a bit on the fragile side, everything worked fine until the actual touchdown, at which time the hitchiker pod blew up. Tried it again with more radial parachutes, and this time it splashed down fine. Decided I wanted to make sure that it was safe for a ground landing as well, so I tested it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything was going fine. It came down, parachutes deployed, and the escape pod slowed down to a nice slow descent, and landed. On the side of a hill. The RCS tank was on the bottom, so the whole pod fell over, at which point it started to roll down the hill. I figured the radial parachutes or sepratrons would stop it. Nope, those got ripped right off. It starts rolling faster... and faster. I\u0027m wondering how long it\u0027s going to take to stop rolling, though at least it\u0027s rolling towards a valley rather than the coastline. Then, just as it hits the bottom of the hill, it either spun too fast or hit a bump, and the hitchhiker pod explodes. Again. At this point I was laughing so hard I couldn\u0027t even begin to work on the redesign.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taleric","CreatedById":92762,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T05:48:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am running kerbal economy and remote tech 2 climbing through the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was time to head for Duna.
