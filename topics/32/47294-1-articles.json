Worse, I a. couldn\u0027t time-warp at all because it was throttled-up, and without electrical power the throttle is stuck, and b. was losing my precious small amount of remaining Xenon at the rate roughly of 1 unit per 6 seconds, without generating any thrust, due to the thrusters being classed as flamed-out by the game. After 15 or 20 frustrating real-time minutes waiting to either run out of fuel or get some power back, the Sun finally reappeared. I had enough fuel to get into a nearly circular orbit, and absolutely nothing else, and there it stayed (until I downloaded 0.20).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArmchairGravy","CreatedById":78526,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-03T17:21:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENope.
