Earlier today, I landed Tosh\u0027s gigantic eight-wheeled truck on the Mun with a three-kerbal pod in the back. Since I\u0027m full of terrible ideas, I thought it would be fun to try and circumnavigate the Mun in that beast. However, I\u0027m worried about the life expectancy of my \u0022I\u0022 key, especially if I recruit the help of a rock to hold it down for a few hours. So I\u0027m wondering if anyone knows of a bug in which a key gets stuck down in-game without it actually being pressed. Alternatively, is there a way to map that key to the throttle axis on my joystick or something, so that I could leave it on without any crazy stuff happening to my keyboard?
