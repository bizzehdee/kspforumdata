When i booster Sep the noze dives into an uncontrolable spin. I need viable ideas and solutions! I tried damn robotics for a gimble but they are to obig and don\u0027t work well for my current engine! I want to try to keep this engine if possible because it has just enough power and weight for the rentry and landing phases( the 2 air breathing engines) the Main engine has 1200 KTU\u0027s of thrust just enough to stop me from rollign back when the booster are at full power and low on fuel. So i don\u0027t want to go with smaller engines for the MAIN engine. Or do i? I don\u0027t know what to do at this point i tried moving the fuel tank( middle tank attached under the belly) Up and down to see if it changed my centre of mass enough. i tried smaller/Bigger fuel tank.

Without seeing how it performs I can\u0027t be particularly specific. But basically, your nose is pitching down so you want a counter force at the nose to prevent this. Now, you *might* get away with winglets but I personally doubt it. In my experience winglets are best used on a fairly stable stable to prevent the slight build up of imbalances (fuel lines and such that can start to become a drama at higher speeds whilst deep in the atmosphere).
