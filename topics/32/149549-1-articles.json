This had left me with a craft that on paper looked like it\u0027d work. I also had \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E installed, as I liked doing assembly in orbit. Because using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E from early on, I had pretty much solely relied on launch-to-encounter, as it\u0027s more efficient, and a lot more fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe orange three were about to take of Duna, but with lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E remaining than I was comfortable with. I sent an engineer out to remove some parts that were deemed not critical: A few extra battery packs, the antenna (afterall, they were bringing the entire thing back home, no need to transmit), and all but one solar panel that I made sure to keep in the shade during the transit back to Kerbin. I also removed some empty TAC-LS containers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then launched, making sure not to let a single fart in the spacesuit go to waste for the little extra thrust I could get out of it. As soon as I was high enough to somewhat safely EVA around the ship (still it Dunas atmosphere), I sent out the engineer again to remove the landing legs. It was a pain in the aft to fight the atmespheric drag, but he eventually did it and got inside. The pilot started burning again, and I ended up getting a pretty much perfect escape angle, eventually resulting in a Kerbin encounter. Kerbin periapsis at 35km, which was as low as I dared go with Deadly Reentry. I then concluded that I had no choice but to hope for the best, as \u003Cstrong\u003EI only had 3m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E remaining\u003C/strong\u003E. From there on it was just a matter of coasting back and let the atmosphere do the rest. The 35km periapsis turned out to be perfect: It slowed me down for a capture, and after looping around Kerbin once I finally reentered for a \u0022safe\u0022 landing.
