I\u0027m guessing I\u0027ll have enough fuel to make it at least twice. Maybe. Going to be fun with all 3 docked on single standard ports. I\u0027m planning on landing the lander with the rover on top and then using the RCS to set the lander down on the surface.

Because you\u0027d have a really hard time getting it there as is. But as for everything else it looks good. Does the lander have an ascent stage to meet up with the transfer vehile to make a return trip? Hard to tell from the pic. As for getting the rover off the top via rcs..might be a bit nerve racking. It\u0027s not Minmus so Rcs thrusters might have a hard time and the rover might just end up falling off the top instead. Only one way to find out though I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bonyetty","CreatedById":57769,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T04:26:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks the goods to me. Go on do it. Horizontal velosity can be a problem with no atmosphere so it can be a good to cancel a few thousand meters up and then drop vertically. Although tipping over might help with deploying that rover. Good luck.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hailedbean","CreatedById":28683,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T04:32:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI try to cancel my horizontal velocity around 10k when approaching the Mun.

With a bit of experience, you could actually place the rover under the lander and use radial engines instead. Mun is quite an easy place to land, you don\u0027t need that much fuel, so less fueltanks and the addition of radial engines would work fine. You should try an Apollo style Mun mission, you can learn a lot from it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T04:59:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s always interesting to see how others approach a problem... For example, here\u0027s something I worked on earlier today:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/skycrane_base.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022skycrane_base.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the far right of my Mun station is the trio that went down to the surface: a base, a skycrane, and a rover. After leaving the station, the skycrane released the rover, grabbed onto the top of the base, and attached the rover to the bottom of the base. Then they all went down to the surface, and the rover was dropped off from a mostly-hovering state about 10 meters above the surface (with brakes already on, naturally). Then the skycrane moved over a bit and dropped off the base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/skycrane_base2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022skycrane_base2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It worked like a charm, and now I have a permanent base and rover on the surface that aren\u0027t marred by any sort of engine nacelles. The skycrane will be going back up to the station once I refuel it (Kethane is awesome, on a related note), making the whole operation 100% reusable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Steve-S","CreatedById":74649,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T11:29:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe station does not go, I already have a space hotel orbiting Mun. I\u0027m not sure if the RCS alone will be enough on Mun but I\u0027ll see when I get there. If not I can always lay it down and detach the rover that way. I\u0027m guessing it might just drop off a side when I un-dock it anyway. I thought about putting the rover on the bottom but couldn\u0027t wrap my head around that design for some reason. I wanted to have a separate ascent stage also but couldn\u0027t get my head around that either (slow brain week). Really like your setup SkyRender.
