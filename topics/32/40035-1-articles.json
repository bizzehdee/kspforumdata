My suggestion is see if you can use more efficient rockets (nukes \u002B aerospike/LV-45/LV-30/radials assist, 909s or aerospikes on their own). I know that with good fuel balance, two turbojets can carry twin nukes and an aerospike to 25km and reach 1.2km/s with good piloting (more difficult now since the new SAS is iffy) and reaches 72km orbit with some fuel left over if you turn off the aerospike at the right point (for me it\u0027s usually at around 1.8 km/s).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, you can always solve the problem more easily by clipping intake parts together to boost the flight ceiling of your jet engines.

So long as your speed is still increasing and your AP is still going up slowly then you should be ok. If you can maintain a small or no rise in altitude you should gain a ton of speed, and because you\u0027re jet engines are throttled back a bit you won\u0027t need as much air to run them. Then you can also squeeze a little more air into them by firing the rocket engines at the same time. THen like Swiftly said, once it stops accelerating pitch up and turn off the jets and close intakes (maybe assigned to a single action group) which in theory should decrease drag a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Merinsan","CreatedById":57629,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T12:32:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lammatt\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lammatt\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewell... i mean... 20km...\u003Cp\u003Esee...i am chinese... and i aint good at math (which is very normal for chinese people; especially those who are science graduates like me... nah... just kidding but yes.. i counted the numbers wrong it should be 20)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo problem, I was thinking you meant that.

You should fly horizontal for longer to pick up speed on the jets. At 25km you should be able to get to 1300-1500m/s, in my experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI try to limit myself to 1 LVN because they are so darned heavy, and you usually don\u0027t need more than 1 since SSTOs tend to be lightweight. Another note, I have recently found aerospikes to be inferior to T30\u0027s for SSTO rockets. They are heavy so they have a rather bad TWR. The issue is that at 1500m/s at 25km, drag is *very* significant (especially because your jets usually have much more thrust than your rockets). The most important thing when switching to rockets is to gain altitude quickly to reduce drag. Any efforts to gain significant speed below roughly 35km are wasted fighting drag (every 5km reduces drag force by a factor of 2.7). Thus, engines with high thrust and good TWR (like the LV-T30) that can power you up to higher altitudes quickly are most useful for SSTOs. Above 10km, the ISP gets very close to the vacuum level, so the high atmospheric ISP of the aerospike (its main strength) is completely wasted in SSTO configurations where they are not used until 20km\u002B.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor reference, my Minmus landing and return SSTO awhile back used 4 turbojets, 9 intakes, 2 aerospikes, and 1 LVN, though next time I do it I\u0027ll use something other than aerospikes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
