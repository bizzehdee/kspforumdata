Then I started to wonder, how much do other people mod?\n\nI felt the best way to satisfy my desire for knowledge is via a thread. \n\nBut how can I read the results without to much reading?\n\nThats why I added a poll to this thread, with these answers:\n\nVanilla: Not. Not a single mod. Not one!\n\nStracciatella: A few basic mods like FAR or VV, mabye a part mod. \n\nChocolate: A whole bunch of mods, and few part mods.\n\nRAM-Toaser: Many many mods, and many large part mods. \u003C--- That would be me\n\nAlso, feel free to explain your answers in the comments.\n\nThe reason I like the smell of burnt RAM in the morning, I cant resist. If I see a cool mod, I instantly install it.
