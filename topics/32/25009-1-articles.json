I\u0027ve been biten by the KSP bug last week, and I can\u0027t stop playing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve managed to build a space station in LKO and I\u0027m planning on sending the first Kerbals to the Mun soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such, I did a test this morning. I built a satellite using the ISA MapSat upgrade and using my usual booster, I sent it on its way to the Mun using Mechjeb 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I used the \u0027Ascent Module\u0027 and the \u0027Launch to Rendez-Vous\u0027 feature to fly the mission. My booster did a fine job of flying it the payload into LKO, but then things went awry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe orbit never circularized, so I couldn\u0027t use the \u0027Hoffman\u0027 manoever. I tried various buttons, but all it did was to send my satellite in a huge orbit beyond the Mun and then using other buttons I managed to make it intercept the Mun but it then crashed on the surface. Luckily, it was unmanned, so no Kerbals were hurt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m wondering what could be the best way to achieve a Mun orbit with Mechjeb 2. Do I send the payload up on a parking orbit at around 100km and then circularize the orbit and use the Hoffman manoever to reach the Mun or ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd how do you get the craft in a LMO once you get there using the MJ 2 controls?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"robly18","CreatedById":37651,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T20:26:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow do it without mechjeb.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"flightmaster","CreatedById":32617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T23:12:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb 2 still has some bugs, that\u0027s why it\u0027s still in pre-release. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get to the Mun with mechjeb just use the ascent guidance module and let that get you into orbit, then tell it to do a Hohmann transfer to the Mun. It should be two separate parts of your mission, the ascent and the transfer. Once you\u0027ve intercepted, then it becomes easy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T23:20:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Rendez-Vous part of mechjeb 1.9 was of the save before activate type. Not sure if this is updated. It usually missed and had to compensate by overshooting. If you dropped stages during the burn things goes wild. Like you start burn with mainsail from first stage, then switch to poodle from second.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sovek","CreatedById":57251,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-02T00:52:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMeh, I fly the thing myself, let MJ provide the SASS functions and more extensive telemetry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MC3craze","CreatedById":1636,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-02T01:11:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb is something you should try to wean yourself off of. Most of the functions can be emulated by flight engineer and the manuever nodes. While the newest version is a lot more manual friendly than versions previous, the autopilot can discourage people from actually playing the game. This is coming from someone who abused it when it first came out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, to answer your question, if your orbit after encountering the Mun has a periapsis, set up a manuever node at that point and set it up for a burn retrograde until you have a roughly circular orbit. If the trajectory is just a straight path into the surface, burn prograde until your apoapsis is above your target orbit height and circularize at perapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"comiquaze","CreatedById":62735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-02T01:39:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys, I\u0027ll try that out when I back from flying for the job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll let you know how it went.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
