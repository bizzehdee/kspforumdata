Though when I disconnect my last stage with one fuel tank and a rocket into a command module with parachute my trajectory towards the earth changes since the mass has changed. Also opening the parachute also changes my trajectory. My question is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- How does one pick their landing site using a rocket and then disconnect the command module and continue heading towards that state?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Does rotating the command module do anything?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The parachute also changes my trajectory, how should I use it to make sure I hit that perfect landing spot?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Asmosdeus","CreatedById":9051,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-25T12:28:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPoint the vessel at the landing spot when you decouple and it shouldn\\\u0027t change the landing spot too much, as for the parachute, deploy it when you\\\u0027re in a vertical fall towards your landing spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I prefer to just aim for the ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"what-the","CreatedById":6885,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-25T12:33:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest way to land somewhere near the spot that you want, is to obtain a low (circular) orbit which passes over the place where you want to land (I recommend 100km for Kerbin and 25km for the Mun).
