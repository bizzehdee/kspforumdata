Probes become viable, and combined with another tech, SAS on everything.\n\n- Docking ports: Orbiting fuel depots make biome harvesting much easier and more economical\n\n- LV-Ns: Suddenly, dV isn\u0027t so hard to come by. In particular, these make spaceplanes viable for a lot of tasks in kerbin\u0027s SOI\n\n- Turbo-Ramjets: The basic jet is useless for spaceflight as far as I can see. Sure its good for exploring kerbin, but I could already do that with a ballistic rocket.\n\nThe rapier is too far down the line. \n\nbut Turbo-Ramjets... with these, I can cheaply haul large amounts of fuel up to orbit.\n\nI can launch a large manner of craft that I might need: Science lab and half orange tank fuel depot? Check. Munar lander? Check. High-dV interplanetary probe to a destination outside the launch window? Check\n\nI don\u0027t even need the mk3 parts or to upgrade either facility (runway or sph) to lvl 3.\n\nMy cost of getting things to orbit just plummeted.\n\nCombined with the Nuke, the cost of getting things to the moons has plummeted, the science farming of kerbin\u0027s SOI is in full swing, and I simply need the fund to upgrade the R\u0026D facility to level 3 to unlock....\n\n- ISRU: Getting ISRU going, is pretty much conquering Kerbin\u0027s system.\n\nAre any of these not that useful to you? any that you feel I\u0027ve overlooked?"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T17:38:57Z","Content":"I was going to say the \u0022orange tank node\u0022 but, in reality, it was the 2.5m tank node that greatly increased the payload I could bring to space.

At the most extreme this does lead to asparagus staging.\nThe weight savings from staging the fuel tanks (2 empty FL-T400 weigh half a ton) as they empty can lead to some surprisingly large improvements to dV.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T21:26:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 09:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ghpstage**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ridge363","CreatedById":123194,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T21:54:35Z","Content":"I typically go for solar panels and science.

It allows you to build \\*smaller\\* by having a liquid fuel engine that is only 40% the weight of the reliant/33% the weight of the swivel.\n\nIts not such a huge improvement IMO\n\n\\* The advanced grabbing unit/ large docking ports: Sure its nice, but everything said for it, can also be said for the docking ports. Its a bit more convenient and versatile, but the earlier small docking ports can give you the same fundamental capabilities (minus asteroid attachment, which for me is pretty late game and a small niche)\n\n\\* The fuel lines: I would have agreed back in 0.23.\n\nSince then, the funds have changed things.\n\nSRBs are cheap, decouplers, liquid fuel engines and tanks... are not. There are also part limits - its cheaper to upgrade the launch pad and maximum tonnage, than the VAB and maximum parts. SRB launch systems have far fewer parts than cross feeding liquid fuel boosters.\n\nThen there\u0027s the new aerodynamics to consider... I rely more on the tall SRBs than asparagus designs now.\n\nSure I use some cross feeding (often two radial LFO boosters feeding to a core stage, with SRBs also attached ot the core stage)... but again, I don\u0027t consider it such a huge leap in capabilities.\n\nNot at the level of turboramjets and LV-Ns, or the efficiency gains from dedicated landers\u002Borbital rendevous\u002B fuel depots, etc.\n\n\\* 2.5M parts: They help get around part limits, making it easier to get more tonnage to orbit, but they don\u0027t feel like a huge leap to me.\n\n\\* Plane parts, pre-turboramjets: Meh... sure good for exploring kerbin, but I often find those contracts to be more time consuming than they are worth.\n\nThey don\u0027t help me get to other celestial bodies, or get tonnage to orbit cheaper (which helps get to other celestial bodies)\n\n\\* Science insturments: yes, they are a priority. Spending science to get more science... they all pay off in the end... but... its not really what I\u0027m talking about.\n\nUnlocking the seismic scanner doesn\u0027t directly help you get to \\*insert destination here\\*\n\nIndirectly, it does, by letting you get more science to unlock a different node, that will help you."}]}
