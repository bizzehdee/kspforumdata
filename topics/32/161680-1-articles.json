The part with the control systems would\u0027ve been too advanced since the people at my school don\u0027t even know how a ballpoint pen works, and I did an oversimplified version of the LqF\u002BLOX engine on chalkboard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso: the presentation already is in the past by now, got a straight A\u002B on it.
