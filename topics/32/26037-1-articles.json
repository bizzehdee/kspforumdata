Then I screwed that up as well, and ended up on Duna (and that was a rocket landing, no parachutes, because I didn\u0027t know you could repack and was saving them for the return trip). The amazing thing was that I got Jeb back to Kerbin in one piece, without a rescue mission; his rocket had no fuel and only seven units of monoprop remaining when he landed near the crater, but it worked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve\u0027s the easiest planet to land on, by far.
