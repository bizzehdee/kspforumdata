I had made the decision to\u00A0fly it back to Kerbin immediately because it had to have three pilots on it and didn\u0027t want that many pilots just screwing around out there. This is on my hard mode career, so I can\u0027t exactly pluck pilots out of thin air at will. Anyway, as soon as it was fulfilled I started burning back straight toward Kerbin in hopes of getting recaptured relatively quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOddly, the more I burned toward Kerbin, the father away my encounters would supposedly become. The very first one that popped up said it was 17 years away. I kept going knowing there was no way that could be true. Each new encounter was even worse until at one point, it said my next encounter was over 5400 years\u00A0away!\u00A0 What was really strange to me was if I tried to set up a maneuver node on the orbital path just before the encounter it showed me, the node was only a few hundred days away. Knowing this had to be an\u00A0anomaly, I just kept burning toward Kerbin\u00A0and ended up getting recaptured in less than a day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else ever experienced this?

Getting back from that is pretty easy, because all you have to do is more or less \u0022boost towards Kerbin\u0022 like you said, which is why I suspect that\u0027s what you did as well. As a matter of fact, if you actually exit Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E in a perfectly normal direction, all you need to do\u00A0 is wait until you\u00A0 approach your Kerbin nodal point and you will re-encounter Kerbin automatically. In fact if\u00A0you don\u0027t see that encounter in the map view right after you exit Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, then you know you\u00A0 had some non-normal component to your motion when you exited, which means your orbital shape/period is no longer identical to Kerbin\u0027s. In that case, if you\u00A0 wait too long to get back down to Kerbin\u0027s orbital plane, you will come in either ahead of it or behind it,\u00A0 potentially requiring a whole bunch more solar orbits before your intersect and Kerbin\u0027s position line up again.\u00A0 So it\u0027s not really an anomaly so much as an artifact of trying to encounter a body that is in nearly the same orbit\u00A0and position as yours. Of course if you boost significantly more towards Kerbin from this situation, so that you reach its plane again before you have time to get too far ahead or behind of it, this won\u0027t be an issue. Anyway, does that make sense to you or have I got the wrong idea?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
