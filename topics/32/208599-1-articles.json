I also guess, centripetal force is the same as gravity force.\u00A0 So - momentum, thrust, weight, gravity acceleration, center of thrust (plus torque) and mass are computed, when no atmosphere is present. It simulates much more attributes, ofc, but they are not affecting landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
