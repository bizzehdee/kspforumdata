I started playing this game a few months ago and got frustrated, so I stopped. The last couple weeks I\u0027ve started playing again. I created a sandbox world titled \u0022TEST\u0022 which was exactly what it is. It basically was a \u0022world\u0022 I could create and not have to feel bad about how poorly things worked or how many Kerbals I killed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus far my accomplishments have been:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Learning basic rocket building\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Establishing orbits\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Installing a few helpful mods\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Learning to dock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Orbiting the Mun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Landing on the Moon\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Rescuing stranded Kerbals in Munor orbit and returning them to Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still feel like there are TONS to learn, but I feel so much more comfortable with what I\u0027m doing and feel like I\u0027ve gained the knowledge to continue my journey. My question is what else should I \u0022Test\u0022 in the world before I move onto a new \u0022real\u0022 one. Any tips or suggestions of things I should do next?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for the suggestions!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPS: For those how are just learning to dock. It is the hardest thing I have had to learn. It takes time and patience to get it right, but it seemed like once I got it once, I could do it over and over again. I just watched about 5-6 different youtube videos on how to do it and put several hours into it. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-11T16:39:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELike Kerbal Test Associates \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe more I think about it... the more I feel that Kerbin IS a testing ground.

Here\u0027s things you CAN learn, but don\u0027t have to before moving on to the other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransfer orbits between two bodies orbiting the same celestial object: You can practice this transferring back and forth between the Mun and Minmus, which in theory will give you a handle on how to transfer from Kerbin to the other planets orbiting the same sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerobraking: Aerobraking can save a lot of delta-V when it\u0027s applicable. You could practice returning from Minmus and aerobraking into a low kerbin orbit, a kerbin geosynchronous orbit, or even a Mun intercept orbit, though to be honest, once you get the idea down, fine tuning your technique probably won\u0027t help much as other planets will have very different atmospheric heights and densities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERover transportation: Landing a rover on a celestial body, especially as part of a manned mission, can be tricky without practice since we don\u0027t have the option of shipping the rover disassembled and assembling it in place. Skycranes are an obvious choice for an unmanned mission, but if you haven\u0027t tried it yet, maybe try one on the Mun or Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeparate orbiter/lander missions: There\u0027s no reason to do an apollo-style landing on the Mun or Minmus, except to get practice for doing it in other places. It\u0027s not necessary to use this kind of mission on most other planets, but it will help in at least some cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny of these can be learned before reaching the solar SoI, or you can learn them as you need the ability in \u0022real\u0022 missions. The only real advantage to doing them early is that having to refly a mission all the way to a different planet because how you thought of detaching a rover from a manned ship not working the way you thought can be especially frustrating.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndOfTheEarth","CreatedById":24503,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-11T18:35:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe more I think about it... the more I feel that Kerbin IS a testing ground.

Most of the atmosphereless moons in the Kerbol system are within the same gravity range as the Mun and Minmus.
