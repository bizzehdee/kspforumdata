But so far my preference has been RAPIERs as primary propulsion, and Panthers as VTOL lift engines. The former offer simplicity and high jet speeds, while the latter have the highest static TWR of any jet in wet mode. In a design where the Panthers can thrust forwards, such as a \u0022tailsitter\u0022 or a tilt engine/wing design, then they can do double duty - extra power to blast through the early ascent, and range extenders for approach and landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot enough TWR is a problem during the push to hypersonic jet speeds and the switch to rockets. One iteration of my 40 ton SSTO \u003Cem\u003EGallifrey\u003C/em\u003E used four Panthers and one RAPIER, and I found the RAPIER just squandered its thrust fighting drag and it failed to make orbit.

I admit I still know very little, but one thing I\u0027ve found is it seems good to have some vertical speed before making the switch to rockets, that way you aren\u0027t pulling such high draggy AoA trying to pitch up to climb out of the atmosphere.

I generally build spaceplanes because I like recovering as much as I can direct to the runway ( and it makes re-entry with a payload rather easier ). This means unless it\u0027s a LKO shuttle I\u0027m effectively building a winged rocket, and what\u0027s most important is how it works in orbit as long as it can fly pretty well when it\u0027s mostly empty.

The next major step for me was the Panther ( and Thud ), because the packaging \u0026amp; performance balance made SSTO doable. I could probably have built something a little more efficient old-style out of a pair of Panthers and a LV-T but it\u0027d have been pretty large ( and draggy ), and this worked ok.
