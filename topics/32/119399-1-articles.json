On the other hand I haven\u0027t ever had a space station before as I\u0027ve never docked before (I did once, with MJ) as I can\u0027t rendezvous. So I\u0027m stuck for choice, Kerbin space station, More Mun stuff (landing/more orbiting) or more Minmus stuff (more orbiting/landing) or anything else, and I\u0027m generally in limbo as I have no clue what to do. The Mun is boring but it seems fitting to explore there first, Rendezvous and space station building seems very intimidating, especially the Rendezvous part, and I like Minmus, but it seems unfitting, and generally a bad choice.

So, use the \u0022push the retro marker\u0022 technique to gradually reduce both to zero at the same time--always correcting your heading towards the target as you approach and as you reduce velocity.
