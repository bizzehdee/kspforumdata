I could add more drag and control surfaces at the bottom, but that was just putting a band aid on a problem that only got worse the bigger the rocket had to be. I finally discovered that stacking fuel tanks is bad news, as it shifts the center of mass as I drain the upper tanks into the lower ones, affecting its stability as it goes and causing something that flies fine for a while after takeoff to go into a crazy spin once getting up there. So to get the same amount of fuel with approximately the same mass, I add the fuel tanks in radial symmetry, draining them into the central tank that feeds the main engine. This has the added advantage that I can mount them on decouplers, and shed the mass of the empty tanks during ascent, while keeping the center of mass in approximately the same place. So long as the radial tanks have appropriate nose cones (at either end) the drag is pretty negligible since they are dropped by the time the speed gets high enough that they would matter."},{"CreatedByName":"jackboy900","CreatedById":113949,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T17:19:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I had an issue trying to make efficient, cost-effective rockets that would not flip uncontrollably on ascent.
