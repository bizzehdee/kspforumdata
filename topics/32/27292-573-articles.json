The lander was still sent for a test run, but crashed into the Mun due to error in descent profile (a.k.a. I totally messed the landing, also it\u0027s better to increase the TWR).

That should allow for delivering 1500 units of LF and matching O to 75K orbit, for 600 worth of LF \u002B 200 O. So that\u0027s about half an orange tank?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel flow and balancing is fully manual. Only the Full liquid fuel tank aft of the probe-core and Clamp-O-Tron is ever enabled when air-breathing, and I manually top it from side tanks (either aft or front to keep the plane balanced) to not run out of LF. When in rocket mode, I tend to enable the tank aft of it as well as the center bi-coupler, to reduce fuel management related work-load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m able to rotate it easily off the run-way at full load, though full back elevon will lead to tail (prop) strike, so I aim for 7-10 degree pitch until establishing vertical speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding is way easier. You have to keep the front bi-coupler about full to keep it balanced enough (see dry configuration pic), but it flies slow and forever. I tend to align at 100-120 m/s, cross the threshold at 60 and glide from there until 30, which allows for gentle touch down and plenty of runway left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPilot correction is required past 27K to prevent yaw drift, but nothing unmanageable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlaying with a joystick, for what it\u0027s worth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s pretty slow to turn in orbit due to no additional reaction wheels and only 4 vernor engines (radial and normal axis), but it\u0027s supposed to be a plane anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd i reckon it could be easily derived into cargo or transport by swapping some of the tanks for bay / crew sections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/cxPbD\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
