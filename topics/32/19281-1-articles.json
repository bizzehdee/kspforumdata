It just adds extra steps, and interferes with the ability to just do a nice transfer burn, which over these long ranges, adds up to some hefty fuel penalties (since you would have to establish a stable, likely circular orbit, while you wait to change your plane in Kerbol orbit, because you can\u0027t do it from Kerbin for another planet).

Getting from point a to b is not interesting for me. I only want to be paying attention when something is going on. This would also be why my working space plane has such a short range. I\u0027m never going to fly it for more than 15 minutes, because all I do is takeoff\u0027s, landings, and a few loop-de-loops in between, so why would I design in extra fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nooblet68","CreatedById":11784,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-14T16:52:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMinmus is really taken as a harder challenge than it actually is.
