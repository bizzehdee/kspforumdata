I never got to ion stage, as I overdesigned the boosters and a final lift stage was still attached with plenty of fuel, I figured I would dump it during my eve flyby....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, since I was going to thrust hard, I figured that, for good measure I should retract my solar panels.... then I realized I needed to wait just a bit before my manuver, so I went into time warp.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course I met a time Kraken. The game froze up for a few seconds and when it came back, I had zipped hours past my node, and had run out of power.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Silverchain","CreatedById":83000,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T20:24:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FOrgx6R.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FOrgx6R.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkurj I Model AA \u003Cem\u003EDreadful Dream\u003C/em\u003E parked on the cold but sunny beaches of Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt turns out to be a wee bit underpowered as a rover - I landed on a plateau about 500m higher and 7km away and had to stop several times during the descent to the beach to recharge the wheel batteries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, looks like a tolerable runway for the launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"greg12","CreatedById":56261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T22:19:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI done some cool things today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA huge \u0022paper\u0022 plane:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/ufKOK\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
