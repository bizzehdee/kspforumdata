The proof being that I have changed Jebediah Kerman into Svetlana Limonova in all my early saves (before I changed the random seed generation in the latest build).

It\u0027s maddening!\n\u003E \n\u003E So here\u0027s my question: how do I make this more permanent?\n\nI have done it, but it takes a bit of save manhandling. I do suspect it is the name list at play, which is frustrating. The game shouldn\u0027t need to check the name for gender, when there\u0027s the separate gender variable. Plus, why must the police kerbal naming? It\u0027s gender discrimination that is! \\*goes of into rant\\*\n\nBasically, I found two tricks worked to an extent. Changing the name very slightly had the best result (I suspect that this might be because it takes it out of the lists) . Changing the name of an already female kerbal, and duplicating the kerbal, then changing the gender, and removing the original by in-game means were less effective, and wouldn\u0027t work reliably.\n\nSo I suggest finding a name that\u0027s very close, and changing it very slightly. Adding extra spaces between [name] and Kerman also worked, though of course, it may take a few goes if you want to conserve specialisation. Remember to change every other instance of that kerbals name in the file too, so they appear in the right spots.\n\nAnd update the name in other places. I assume this is for Kold War? The names in OoE/CoM needed a few edits too.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve heavily edited the names and genders of all the Kerbals in my save I\u0027m using for my series. I\u0027ve never ever had one revert back to what it was before.\n\u003E I suggest exiting the game, editing the persistent.sfs (backing it up first), and then loading the game back up.\n\nThat\u0027s interesting, I attempted to do it via the persistent file too, and ran into the same problem. Where the ones you genderbent also ones whose names you\u0027d edited? But it\u0027s possible you just got lucky.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I do it with Kerbal Renamer.\n\nI tried that. It did change kerbals, but it didn\u0027t seem to have the ability to make specific changes to an individual kerbal, which is what I, (And I suspect CalculusWarrior also) wanted to achieve.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-29T04:01:05Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2015 04:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tw1**"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T04:24:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s interesting, I attempted to do it via the persistent file too, and ran into the same problem.
