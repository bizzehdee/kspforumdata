Me, I just design a huge station as a single unit, and then launch it with a really big heavy-lift vehicle; my standard stations mass about 300 tons. The big advantage of this method is stability; you can use plenty of struts to keep your construction stable, without having to rely on large numbers of docking ports or quantum struts. Right now there\u0027s little downside to just using a larger launch vehicle, so it\u0027s not much of a problem to get a big station into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is, right now there isn\u0027t much of a use for stations. All they\u0027re really used for is as fuel depots, and you don\u0027t need a station for that when you can just launch a couple orange tanks with docking ports into orbit. But once 0.20 comes out, with the new resource system, all of that will change, for two reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1\u0026gt; There will be more fuel types, like Nuclear Fuel. That means more types of fuel tanks, which makes a small refueling ship a bit less useful. Right now it\u0027s not really a big deal to launch a ship that has fuel and xenon and monoprop, since only the basic fuel/oxidizer take up much space, but add a couple more fuel types and it gets prohibitive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; There will be refining. Right now, players who use the Kethane mod have little reason to haul raw Kethane back to orbit, when they can just refine it into fuel on-site. But this new resource system is more differentiated, so it\u0027ll be unlikely that any one location can provide all of the ingredients for any fuel type. That is, extracting Blutonium will be all well and good, but without some other material you won\u0027t be able to convert it into Nuclear Fuel. So, your Blutonium mining vessel won\u0027t refine the fuel; instead, it\u0027ll carry it back to some central refinery that can store all of the necessary raw materials, a refinery that\u0027ll then store the final fuel and/or ship it off to some other repository. Space stations are ideal for that role.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, we don\u0027t know the sizes involved. Kethane refineries are small (with the largest being only 4 tons), but if the refinery modules needed for the 0.20 system are much heavier than that, then it won\u0027t really be possible to carry one on your extractors; you\u0027ll ONLY refine fuel either in orbit or at large ground bases. And one weakness of the Kethane mod was that only the active vessel could refine; if refining is a very slow process, but one that can be performed by ships we\u0027re not actively controlling, then space stations would be the perfect place to do the job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, maybe this\u0027ll mean that you design a generic space station core and then attach resource-specific refining modules to it once it\u0027s in orbit. But I\u0027ll probably just end up designing a variant of my standard station specific to each planet, so that the Jool station will have tanks for all of the resources common to Jool\u0027s moons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sadron","CreatedById":61671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T23:13:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell for the guys who make the station all at once, how do you get that giant hunk of stuff up into the atmosphere?

This mod adds 2.5m and 3.75m ports, and also has a much higher bonding strength than a normal port, which is great when you\u0027re trying to dock vessels that\u0027ll hold together under thrust. To compensate, the ports are a bit more massive than normal ones, and also are a bit pickier on docking (each has a \u0022passive\u0022 half and an \u0022active\u0022 half, and you generally want the vessel doing the docking to have the active version).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; The Ion Engine mod. Besides just adding large Xenon tanks (critical if you want to use your station as a fuel depot for Ion-using vessels) and 2.5m batteries, it adds Hybrid Ion engines, which are a nice alternative to using LV-Ns on your station for orbital changes.
