Due to the light payload, the lifter had a lot of fuel left after reaching 130 km orbit, so I decided to keep it attached for the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe neck was a completely different matter. Somewhere around TWR 2.5, it started behaving like a pendulum and eventually broke free from the lifter. After a few failed launches, I finally managed to build a suitably weak and stable lifter, and got the neck into orbit. Pushing the neck into the forward docking port of the core module with a small utility tug was an interesting experience. Visual docking would have been pretty much impossible, but with the information provided by Docking Port Alignment Indicator, I eventually learned to compensate for the horrible RCS imbalance. Encouraged by that, I decided to intercept the lifter and pull it to the construction site with the utility tug. With the fuel salvaged from the lifter, I now have a full orange tank worth of spare fuel waiting for the thruster modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what the construction site looks at the moment:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/jltsiren/stuff/spaceship_construction.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022spaceship_construction.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship is going to receive its thrusters next, after which it\u0027s time to start designing the payload for the Laythe colonization mission.

At least assuming that the neck starts behaving better than it has behaved so far.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commissar","CreatedById":97416,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T05:08:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edesigning and testing more base modules. also built and tested a 5-ton capacity mobile tower crane for assembling the power station modules for my bases. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Einitially, I was just going to make the whole module one piece, but realized that it was far too tall for any of my existing movers, so I made it in two sections, with the lower portion (7-8 tons) consisting of 20 2.5m stack batteries, landing legs, chutes, and a 2.5-1.25m adapter; fits my large module transporter. upper portion is actually really light, just the balka solar wings, 2 balka truss segments, struc. fuselage, and parachutes; will be towed to the base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E probably gonna try out some of the docking clamps from kosmos on this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso, I first tried the obvious, a massive tower crane, but that wouldn\u0027t move, then went to the conventional telescoping boom, where i ran into the spaghetti joint problem. ended up doing a hybrid, with a shorter tower, on a conventional large-rover base, and a shorter telescoping boom. still has some joint flex, but not enough to be problematic with the fairly light loads it is intended for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/YwEWK#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
