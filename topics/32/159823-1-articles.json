These are the players that tend to test and retest their builds to make sure their capable of a long or complex journey such as grand tours, reaching specific orbital parameters or gathering as much of\u00A0the science from a biome or planet in a single run. These players take Kerbal Space Program to the highest standard and can achieve some amazing quality of work.

Good with working with people and helping them manage to get around their issues. Often seen teaching newer players how to get started and overcome their own obstacles.
