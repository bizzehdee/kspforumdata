Personally, adding more parts is kind of a waste of time considering they already have a good selection of parts, and if you need more there is always mods. Planets is another story, Planet making in very time consuming, and I think we already have plenty of planets and making more also isn\u0027t necessary.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou must have not watched KerbalKon.

And don\u0027t think i gave up after launching a couple of rockets. I have science stations on planets with tons of rovers and returncrafts, fully fitted science mothership even have an abandoned ghost station but there is nothing beyond this. kerbals still cant do anything with their cute hands, science still doesnt work or do anything in sandbox, SAS is still crap, aerodynamics is still absent etc etc etc. the game could have a ton of awesome feature after 3 years of development but in reality it has nothing. and im a dev so i know how development works. there should be priorities. finish something before you start to add extra. the amount of lifesaving mods show how little the vanilla game offers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moar Boosters","CreatedById":79218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-25T17:14:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPoll doesn\u0027t even make sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Are the devs doing the right thing right now?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, *negative statement*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo *Positive statement*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes not compute.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"syfyguy64","CreatedById":47714,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-25T17:19:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Moar Boosters\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Moar Boosters\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPoll doesn\u0027t even make sense.\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Are the devs doing the right thing right now?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, *negative statement*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo *Positive statement*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes not compute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHa!
