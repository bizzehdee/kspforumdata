Don\u0027t forget that Squad is not just a company that makes a computer game called Kerbal Space Program. There\u0027s a parent company which had nothing to do with computer software.

Even if all the initially announced features make it into the game without adding any new bugs and manage to fix all the old bugs and balance and polish everything (a really big if) the career mode is still fundamentally broken. All the systems might technically be in place, but they\u0027re not implemented in any cohesive way and progression is basically broken, and I\u0027m not sure a simple balance pass will really fix the fundamental issues. This is the mode that reviewers and new players will play because they assume this is how the game is meant to be played, which simply isn\u0027t true at this point. This game is still just a big sandbox, and career is sandbox that holds you back early on by forcing you to grind funds and science points instead of guiding new players through the game as was originally intended.\n\nI\u0027m still puzzled (and more than a little annoyed) by this whole thing, it seems like starting with the curse decision Squad has made major decisions behind closed doors with minimal community input (replacing spaceport with curse, the jump from .25 to .90, and now the 1.0 release) and haven\u0027t relented at all despite the massive community backlash (i.e. to all appearances they basically ignored the community), yet now that there\u0027s a hard deadline and Squad is getting worried we\u0027re finally being asked for input. I\u0027m not trying to put down Squad, but I am kind of frustrated with this whole situation, as there\u0027s obviously something going on behind the scenes that\u0027s not being communicated that has the potential to really harm this game by forcing Squad to cut corners and release before it\u0027s ready.\n\nThat said, if you really must go forward with 1.0, my priorities would be as follows:\n\n**Critical** (i.e. don\u0027t even think of shipping without these)\n\nFix frustrating bugs (anything gamebreaking, memory leaks, gui bugs, EVApult, editor, decoupler, etc)\n\nPolish (consistent textures and UI, fix typos and small glitches, IVAs for all parts)\n\nPart Balance (doesn\u0027t have to be final, but don\u0027t ship with broken placeholder values for parts)\n\nAero \u0026 heating (these are way overdue and have a large effect on the early game, you don\u0027t want to be changing this later)\n\nCareer balance (fix the nonsensical contracts and tech tree, fix early game balance and progression)\n\nProper tutorials so new players and reviewers aren\u0027t totally lost (make these easily discoverable, maybe have a way to jump straight to a tutorial from career instead of having to back all the way out to the main menu)\n\n**High** (Highly recommended for 1.0)\n\nFix more bugs (planet destroyer, occasional kraken attacks on very large vessels, stuff that takes a fair amount of effort and knowledge of the bug to reproduce)\n\nPerformance optimizations (game loading time, physics performance, memory usage, etc)\n\nDeltaV readouts and engineer reports (makes rocket building a lot easier)\n\nA few new parts to fill holes in the current lineup (nothing too fancy)\n\n**Medium** (if there\u0027s time, otherwise push to 1.1 or whatever)\n\nSome kind of main quest series of contracts for career (visit all the anomalies and bring back samples?)\n\nFemale Kerbals\n\nRobust modding interfaces for everything (i.e. nothing hardcoded, should also include a planet modding interface)\n\nImproved graphics (especially planet clouds and textures)\n\n**Low** (probably best to push to the next update at least)\n\nISRU/mining (doesn\u0027t affect early game at all, can be easily added later for more endgame)\n\nMore planets\n\nMore launch sites\n\nOther features\n\nUnity 5 (wait until it\u0027s ready first)\n\nReally hoping that this next update does the game justice regardless of what number it is.\n\nEdit: In light of the post below, I would also agree that Squad should focus more on parts of the game not accessible to modders. My list above would be for a situation where Squad is committed to continued development and wants to make the best initial impression given limited time constraints. If there is any chance at all that this game won\u0027t receive the dev attention it needs after release, then Squad needs to double down on bugfixing, performance and implementing a robust modding interface to build a solid foundation that the modding community can build on top of. Games that are mod friendly tend to have much longer lifetimes (and sell more copies in the long run because of it) even if the initial release isn\u0027t perfect (case and point: the elder scrolls games).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-19T17:04:23Z\u0022 title=\u002203/19/2015 05:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius**"},{"CreatedByName":"TMS","CreatedById":57134,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T16:43:00Z","Content":"Agreed with the above post.

If you\u0027re adding features *after the final beta test* then you have royally messed up your development schedule. The point of beta is to test new features and make sure they have the least amount of bugs and quirks possible, and that normal human beings can figure out how to use them.\n\u003E While I agree that bugfixes are ongoing in almost all software, it is the act of adding features that is most likely to also add bugs, and this is why you don\u0027t just say \u0022Ok, beta worked, now add 30% more cool stuff and ship it.\u0022 Add features, host beta, fix bugs, release or repeat.\n\u003E \n\u003E Management of expectations is key; if players see a feature in the game and it doesn\u0027t work, they get cross and the game gets bad reviews. If the feature is absent, and had never been mentioned as a thing, and the game works without it, then players are happy (and ignorant). You even get the opportunity for a post-launch update with the feature, which draws attention, and may pull back some lapsed players.\n\u003E \n\u003E - - - Updated - - -\n\u003E \n\u003E That!

It\u0027s no longer a release-and-then-done model. Games frequently add new features to the game well after initial release. Again, I\u0027ll use Payday as an example.

But here are some of the ones that plague me (off the top of my head), as a part-modder:\n\n\\* Parts that contain more than two decoupler modules will cause the VAB menu icons to zoom out of control. I\u0027ve seen mention of this also being the case if the part contains more that two types of resources (with a work-around being to not place those resource defintions contiguously in the part CFG). But with the decouplers, that work-around doesn\u0027t work, and I can think of use cases where you might want to decouple ALL BUT ONE of the attachment points, so the omni-decoupler option doesn\u0027t work either. Right now, to keep the parts bug-free, they can\u0027t have any more than two detachable nodes if they\u0027re not omni-decouplers. \n\n\\* ModuleJettison currently has a few issues. The jettison direction vector seems to impart spin on some panels, rather than define the actual direction, when using multi-panel fairings. The only stock part to do this is the nuclear engine, and it uses two panels, and it seems that the jettison directions are hardcoded and not truly honoring the settings in the CFG. Unless of course I\u0027m doing something way, way wrong.\n\n\\* ModuleJettison also disconnects ALL FAIRINGS FROM ALL NODES, and not just the ones associated with the node that actually detached, and whether the decoupler was in the same part or not. This makes it impossible to have a part that uses stock-style shrouds at both ends. \n\n\\* ModuleJettison-defined fairings currently can\u0027t be turned off in the VAB via tweakables, unless you install Tweakable Everything. IMHO, they should always be optional.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-19T19:05:51Z\u0022 title=\u002203/19/2015 07:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NecroBones**"},{"CreatedByName":"ddenis","CreatedById":89784,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T19:22:48Z","Content":"Polish it!
