I\u0027ve seen radiators were added to the stock parts and I\u0027ve heard a lot of people on these forums talk about having issuing with re-entry and ships just overheating in general. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe weirdness for me is that I haven\u0027t seen any of this while playing. The only time I\u0027ve noticed any kind of overheating issues is while doing a full burn on ascent and that rarely causes anything close to catastrophic overheating. Hell, I don\u0027t even bother with the new heat shields because it doesn\u0027t seem to make an difference. Even with heatshields I\u0027ve rarely lost more then a fraction of my ablator on re-entry. I\u0027ve never bothered with the radiators and used the 2.5 Nuclear Engine for long burns without issue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using the steam version so I\u0027m assuming I have the latest release and while I use mods, most of them are essentially part packs(FASA, Novapunch, one of the station part packs) as well as tools like KER and Mechjeb. The only one that really changes the game is KAS/KIS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not trying to sound like a ...., so if I am, I apologize, but I\u0027m curious what\u0027s the deal is with the heat issues? Or is this only something that happens near Moho and Eve? I\u0027m not even a particularly good rocket designer(as my many crashed rockets will attest to) so I would think somewhere along the line I would have encountered this accidently.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joonatan1998","CreatedById":97636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-09T04:13:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERadiators are really only needed if you use nuclear engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t really matter where you place them, I think they cool the whole craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-09T04:50:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/133777-Heat-mechanic-and-radiators\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EYou\u0027re missing something.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeat is not much of an issue anymore, except with certain mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-09T11:57:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to the latest dev notes there\u0027s a bug with a cool part which has several hot parts attached.

A real atmosphere does not have a a cut-off altitude. The higher you get, the thinner it gets, but it doesn\u0027t just end. With Jool, the atmosphere constants are wrong so that the atmosphere cuts off when it is still thick. You go from nothing to a thick atmosphere instantly, so aerobraking doesn\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest problem with the heat shielding is that we should be able to have a heavy heat shield for Eve and a light heat shield for Kerbin. Or better yet, the amount of ablator should be tweakable. But the other problem is that Kerbin is just too small. They have to tune the heating constants so that you get some heating on Kerbin without making Eve completely impossible, and that leads to Kerbin being too easy while Eve is still too hard. (Also, when v1.0 first came out and Kerbin re-entry was really hard, everybody complained. So they dialed it way back.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RidingTheFlow","CreatedById":111197,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-09T12:45:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mikegarrison\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mikegarrison\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOr better yet, the amount of ablator should be tweakable.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUmm, amount of ablator \u003Cstrong\u003Eis\u003C/strong\u003E tweakable since heat shields were first added.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-09T13:19:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RidingTheFlow\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RidingTheFlow\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUmm, amount of ablator \u003Cstrong\u003Eis\u003C/strong\u003E tweakable since heat shields were first added.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally?

For Eve and Jool (and Laythe but to a lesser extent) their atmospheres are still very like oceans: theya re very dense until the top, which is why you\u0027ll explode as soon as you touch Jool\u0027s atmosphere. For these planets heatshields are required due to the dense atmosphere (and also because of higher speeds). But if you play with RSS (with reentry speeds from 7km/s to 11\u002Bkm/s) or with Deadly Reentry (what the title says) then you\u0027ll definitely need a heatshield wherever you go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for overheating in space, the power output of nukes was reduced with 1.0.2? (.3? don\u0027t remember) and radiators were added. But as heat from nukes was reduced, you don\u0027t really need radiators for your craft not explode (unless you have several nukes or go sun-diving) anymore. In 1.0.something, I had a nuke powered ship that did a 3500m/s insertion burn at Moho while exposed to the sun, with no radiators, and everything went fine. So for radiators, it really depends on the design of your ship: some will do fine without, others will not stand any burn unless you use radiators. And, BTW, if your ship has no nukes, just forget about radiators.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, there exists a bug with heating that may cause sudden overheating of your craft and its explosion. For this, radiators won\u0027t be able to do anything so just quicksave often: the Kraken\u0027s flames are too strong for your puny radiators and they will eventually melt with the rest of your ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"metl","CreatedById":82406,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-09T16:13:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had the same thoughts as the OP.
