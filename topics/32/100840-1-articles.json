Separatrons do help, but it\u0027s annoying nonetheless, and very much not working as intended.\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, not only is it officially acknowledged to be a bug, but there\u0027s even a community fix available for download. Look up Claw\u0027s Stock Bugfix Modules. Even if you run no other mods at all, those are absolutely worth having precisely because they fix annoyances such as this, and others \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I use a lot of the long SRB and its hyper annoying, worse than before then they didn\u0027t have any eject force if you used struts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother problem is that the seperatrons tend to rotate the SRB more than pushing it out, probably as its hard to place it correctly, however seperatrons on each side also generates spin, the decopler might cause this too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn fin at the bottom reduce spin and give outward drag, add a seperator angled 30 degree upward seems to work, you don\u0027t need it to move far away from the core just enough to not hit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELarge liquid fuel boosters are more predictable probably as they have more mass and drag.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ColourOfFire","CreatedById":135926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T10:12:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESepatrons.
