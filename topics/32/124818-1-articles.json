That update is taking longer than anticipated, and we came to a point where a lot of content was ready to go through testing and be released on its own merits. With these parts ready we wanted to get them to you as fast as possible, and I think we have succeeded in a speedy delivery of this patch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe update is now available on the KSP Store, Steam and will soon be available on GOG.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs with every release this thread will be used to bundle all general discussion about the new version so that the forums can continue to actively host threads on other topics as well. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/358-KSP-1-0-5-is-live!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECLICK HERE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E for the official release announcement for Kerbal Space Program 1.0.5. Some of the highlights of the update are listed below, but you may find plenty more improvements and new content when you play the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5Oni5Qs.png\u0022 alt=\u00225Oni5Qs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe contracts system has had a major overhaul with the goal of providing you with more varied and relevant contracts. Front and center in this overhaul are the contextual contracts, which adapt to your progress in the game. Contextual contracts will take your existing infrastructure consisting of bases, stations, satellites and rovers, and will challenge you to do things such as adding new modules, rotate crews, fly in a Kerbal with a specific skill, explore the surface around it, move the orbit and so on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe goal of the integration of the contracts with your existing missions is to integrate them more in the natural gameplay. You will be asked to use what you have built already, alongside the existing contracts that mostly ask you to launch new items. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore changes can be found in the passive milestone rewards, which automatically reward you for any milestone you cross. These rewards are not only reflected in reputation gains, but also in funding and science bonuses. Higher rewards are still available to players who actively pursue a goal from a World\u0027s First contract they\u0027ve accepted. New milestones are also available, targeting objectives such as space walks, crew transfer and atmospheric flights on alien worlds, and if you\u0027re not someone who spends a lot of time at mission control then a new strategy available from the Administration Building is right up your alley: leadership initiative increases the passive milestone rewards at the expense of contractual rewards, providing a boost to more independent players. Finally, the game now tracks manned and unmanned progress separately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline\u0022\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tgz4UE3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tgz4UE3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate 1.0.5 features many improvements to the thermodynamic systems. The thermodynamics (\u0027thermo\u0027) system has been reworked to correct the various issues encountered in 1.0.4. In addition the thermodynamics at high timewarp feature more customizability, and support differential skin-internal temperatures and non-instant changes. We\u0027ve also corrected some issues with the atmospheres of other celestial bodies, and better tuned re-entry and aerobraking across the board. When loading a long-unloaded vessel, unloaded thermal changes will be applied, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe concept of core heat was also introduced, which in combination with various fixes should stop unexpected overheating of parts. Probably the best analogy of how this interacts with the rest of the thermal system (internal and skin temperature) would be to compare it to your computer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s case temperature, the temperature inside of the case, and the temperature of your CPU. For example, the ISRU should be capable of smelting materials, yet not melt the rocket it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s attached to. In game, this means that the ISRU works best with a core temperature of about 2000K, even if the part only has an internal temperature of 200-300K. This system allows us to be very expressive with the core temperature and simulate things such as warm-up time \u0026amp; overheating without it being directly coupled to the part temperature, which would become problematic as we enter analytics warp and temperatures equalize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline\u0022\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/syQ41bc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022syQ41bc.png\u0022\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe water buoyancy has been completely reworked. Water is now less soupy and it\u0027s very possible to build seaplanes. In keeping with our commitment to make the game as moddable as possible all the physics values can be tweaked in config files. The density of oceans differs across celestials bodies, invoking new gameplay challenges. The impact speed not only depends on the speed of the craft when it hits the water, but also the angle at which it hits the water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Aj1WVjH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Aj1WVjH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA wide range of new and overhauled parts were introduced. The toroidal aerospike rocket engine has had an overhaul, as did the basic- and ramjet engines, the radial air intake and many mk.1 spaceplane parts. Among the new parts we find a complete working kit for mk.0 jet engines, the \u0022Goliath\u0022 turbofan engine that would be a great fit on a large airliner and the \u0022Vector\u0022 rocket engine, which mimics the Space Shuttle\u0027s main engines. The mk. 3 Cargo Ramp is a brand new part as well. This\u0027ll allow you to drive a payload into the back of an aircraft, or perhaps you want to create a docking bay on a space station with it! These are just some of the updated parts, we\u0027re hoping to see many new creations that incorporate them. We\u0027ve also added new stock craft in the game for you to play around with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CYap4g7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CYap4g7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP 1.0.5 has seen a big focus on bugfixes. Over 100 issues were fixed, including launch clamps following you to orbit, . And good news for anyone with a fine eye for detail: the black stripes on the NASA tanks now line up perfectly! There were of course plenty more bugs on the \u0027fixed list\u0027, and a more comprehensive list is available below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E=================================== v1.0.5 ============================================================\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EParts:\u003Cbr\u003E* Added \u0027Juno\u0027 0.625m jet engine\u003Cbr\u003E* Added 0.625m air intake\u003Cbr\u003E* Added 0.625m Liquid Fuel tank\u003Cbr\u003E* Added \u0027Panther\u0027 afterburning jet engine\u003Cbr\u003E* Added \u0027Goliath\u0027 giant turbofan engine\u003Cbr\u003E* Added S3 KS-25-1 \u0027Vector\u0027 Rocket engine, with super-large gimballing range\u003Cbr\u003E* Added Mk3 size Cargo Ramp\u003Cbr\u003E* Added Mk3 engine mount piece\u003Cbr\u003E* Added Mk1 crew cabin, seats two\u003Cbr\u003E* Added new Mini-ISRU part\u003Cbr\u003E* Mk1 Cockpit model overhauled\u003Cbr\u003E* Mk1 Cockpit IVA space overhauled\u003Cbr\u003E* XM-G50 Air intake model overhauled\u003Cbr\u003E* Mk1 Fuel, Structural and Intake Fuselage parts overhauled\u003Cbr\u003E* T1 Toroidal Aerospike engine model overhauled\u003Cbr\u003E* J-33 \u0027Wheesley\u0027 Jet engine model overhauled\u003Cbr\u003E* J-X4 \u0027Whiplash\u0027 Jet engine model overhauled\u003Cbr\u003E* Engine Nacelle and Engine Precooler parts overhauled\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EContracts:\u003Cbr\u003E* Added Station and Base Contextual Contracts, requiring you to modify/expand existing bases and stations\u003Cbr\u003E* Added Satellite Contextual Contracts, requiring maintenance operations to previously deployed satellites\u003Cbr\u003E* Added Survey Contextual Contracts, which target existing landed vessels to request (applicable) survey missions of them\u003Cbr\u003E* Part Test contract generation logic has been modified. Each part now has a much more specific set of constraints before it generates, to give it much more consistent and realistic altitudes, speeds, and envelopes.\u003Cbr\u003E* Passive Progress Rewards: gives a light reward automatically to any new achievement. These are given independently of accepted World-Firsts Contracts, but are not as substantial.\u003Cbr\u003E* Contract Decline Penalty: A small reputation penalty is incurred when a contract is declined, to prevent Mission Control from being abused as a slot machine.\u003Cbr\u003E* New early game part haul contracts - easier part tests that only require you to bring the payload to a designated location.\u003Cbr\u003E* Early game focused surveys balanced to be much more forgiving.\u003Cbr\u003E* New part tests added for fairings and heat shields.\u003Cbr\u003E* Many milestones added that involve the player doing hidden fun stuff.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EStrategies:\u003Cbr\u003E* Added Leadership Initiative Strategy: increases passive rewards for achievements, at the cost of reduced contract rewards. Useful to boost self-driven playstyles.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EProgress Tracking:\u003Cbr\u003E* Added new World First contract types for space walking, crew transfers, and flight on atmospheric planets.\u003Cbr\u003E* There is also now a fourth record \u0022track\u0022 for oceanic depth.\u003Cbr\u003E* Many progress nodes now track progress in separate manned and unmanned tracks. This allows several contracts to appear at more relevant times.\u003Cbr\u003E* Base and Station, plant flag, kerbal recoveries (rescues), crewed surveys, tourism, and some World Firsts contracts now require manned progress.\u003Cbr\u003E* Satellite contracts now require unmanned progress.\u003Cbr\u003E* The algorithm to choose planets for all contracts is now more reliable. Max CB \u0022distance\u0022 has been reduced to two. This means you will no longer see contracts for Duna and Eve right after taking off from Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EScience and Comms:\u003Cbr\u003E* Science Transmission messages now show strategy changes to science, funds, and reputation.\u003Cbr\u003E* All antennae now cut a transmission that has been interrupted due to power loss to prevent severely devaluing the resulting science.\u003Cbr\u003E* Added an option to antenna context menus to manually enable partial transmissions.\u003Cbr\u003E* Interrupted transmissions no longer delete science data. The data will attempt to return to the container it came from.\u003Cbr\u003E* Transmission from orbital surveyors and science labs was tweaked slightly to look and behave more like standard science transmissions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ENavBall:\u003Cbr\u003E* The navball is now available on EVA to assist in surveys.\u003Cbr\u003E* The EVA NavBall follows the orientation of the camera, rather than that of the Kerbal. This allows looking around to get your bearings.\u003Cbr\u003E* The navball throttle and RCS lights are hooked up to the EVA jetpack. \u003Cbr\u003E* The IVA navball now functions with survey navigation.\u003Cbr\u003E* Survey navigation icon will now automatically target the next/closest adjacent waypoint in a survey upon completion of a targeted waypoint\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThermodynamics:\u003Cbr\u003E* Introduced the concept of \u0027Core Heat\u0027. Allowing part systems to work much more expressively with temperatures, reducing unwanted cross-talk between temp effects on internal logic and heat transfer to other parts.\u003Cbr\u003E* Radiators should have a significant impact on core heat, allowing ISRU modules to operate at peak efficiency.\u003Cbr\u003E* Incredibly hot cores should bleed off some of their heat to the parent part, with the vessel very slowly getting warmer over time. \u003Cbr\u003E* Parts should not explode from core overheating, but ISRU modules may shut down.\u003Cbr\u003E* Thermal efficiency should be consistent across all warp levels - no cheating!\u003Cbr\u003E* The mini-ISRU is balanced in that it cannot operate indefinitely. It will eventually shut down due to overheat and have to be allowed a cool-off period.\u003Cbr\u003E* The RTG is also part of this mechanic, making it a viable heater (Kerbals have the added advantage of not requiring any potatoes for unplanned long-duration stays on desolate planets).\u003Cbr\u003E* Fixed thermodynamics issues from 1.0.4 regarding unclamped conduction, shielded conduction, and other runaway cases.\u003Cbr\u003E* Reworked upper atmospheres of planets for better aerocapture experience. Added convection and shockwave temperature multipliers per body.\u003Cbr\u003E* EVA kerbals handled properly.\u003Cbr\u003E* Lowered max internal temperatures of crewed parts.\u003Cbr\u003E* Heating from engine exhaust rebalanced.\u003Cbr\u003E* Thermo at high warp is now no longer instantaneous, and is moddable via new interfaces.\u003Cbr\u003E* Unloaded vessels will have thermo applied for the unloaded time on reload.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBuoyancy and Water:\u003Cbr\u003E* Displacement is now calculated per part using dragcube information to estimate total actual volume of the part. \u003Cbr\u003E* Bodies now have an ocean density: Kerbin/Laythe is 1 tonne/m^3, Eve is 1.5.\u003Cbr\u003E* The lowest and highest points of parts are calculated with respect to the water, and a submerged fraction of volume is calculated to modify buoyancy force.\u003Cbr\u003E* Impact speed (tested against crashTolerance) depends on impact angle, with a configurable minimum multiplier.\u003Cbr\u003E* Drag in water uses drag cubes and an accurate dynamic pressure calculation.\u003Cbr\u003E* Drag scales from high on first vessel contact down to a lower value after a few seconds.\u003Cbr\u003E* Drag also ramps back up when the vessel is below a minimum velocity (to model the highly turbulent flow when starting from a stop, and to make sure vessels do come to a stop).\u003Cbr\u003E* Lift behaves similarly, starting near zero for the madly turbulent flow of initial contact or first movement, up to a reasonable value.\u003Cbr\u003E* Various hollow parts have their displacement tuned to account for hollowness.\u003Cbr\u003E* Solar panels lose flow rate underwater, rocket engines lose Isp.\u003Cbr\u003E* Added underwater fog and tint, fixed camera issues underwater.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EPhysics:\u003Cbr\u003E* PhysicsGlobals now properly create the default values when Physics.cfg is removed. It includes many new values.\u003Cbr\u003E* Drag coefficient changes based on the same factors as turbulent convection (a Pseudo-Reynolds number). This means higher drag high up in the atmosphere, and slightly lower drag when going very fast very low.\u003Cbr\u003E* Asteroids have correct drag cubes now.\u003Cbr\u003E* Fixed issue with radiator dragcubes being incorrect when the panels rotate.\u003Cbr\u003E* Add missing drag cube overrides for hollow parts.\u003Cbr\u003E* Kerbal EVA drag cube can now be specified in Physics.cfg.\u003Cbr\u003E* Fix issues with override drag cubes and root parts during revert/quickload/vessel switch.\u003Cbr\u003E* Fixed issues with female kerbal ragdoll rigidbodies.\u003Cbr\u003E* Fixed a bug in calculating how solar flux diminishes in atmosphere.\u003Cbr\u003E* Jettisoned Fairing panels now exist in a new layer (L19) dedicated to non-part physical objects.\u003Cbr\u003E* Contact with L19 objects does not cause vessels to shift into \u0027landed\u0027 state.\u003Cbr\u003E* Kerbals are allowed to stand on L19 objects, regardless of their own landed state (similar to how they behave when on ladders).\u003Cbr\u003E* Contact with L19 objects only allows Kerbals to stand and walk while within a surface-level altitude/speed envelope. (contact with these objects in orbit has the same effect as bumping into anything else).\u003Cbr\u003E* Eve and Jool had upper atmosphere changes to thin the top band. Duna now shares the molar mass of Eve but has a lower presure than before, leading to the same density (and drag) at sea level but better physical characteristics.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EMisc:\u003Cbr\u003E* Fix surface horizontal velocity being incorrectly calculated.\u003Cbr\u003E* Launch clamps are now properly kept at the launch pad, they will not follow the current vessel.\u003Cbr\u003E* Fix an issue with localisation and settings.cfg. Fix an issue with plugging/unplugging controllers breaking/losing settings.\u003Cbr\u003E* Save and load kerbal trait in save games, trait is generated from name hash only if not specified in the save.\u003Cbr\u003E* Fix issue with solar day length not being calculated correctly when setting Kerbin\u0027s rotational period.\u003Cbr\u003E* Workaround for kerbals becoming debris added, to prevent serious issues.\u003Cbr\u003E* Sped up finding a given AvailablePart (especially relevant when populating the Load Craft menu).\u003Cbr\u003E* Sped up craft loading slightly.\u003Cbr\u003E* Sped up FlightIntegrator and in particular the Occlusion part.\u003Cbr\u003E* Fix some bugs in resource requests that would lower throttle or miss resources.
