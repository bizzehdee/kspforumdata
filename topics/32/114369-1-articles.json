But I wonder about where you\u0027ve place the fuel, as it gets used faster now. If the CoL is too close to the CoM, as soon as any fuel is used mass gets shifted backwards(fuel runs backwards) putting the CoL in front of the CoM, effectively ruining any hope of stable flight.\n\nTurn on the displays in the sph and empty the fuel front to back you can see it happening.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T17:07:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 05:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by hellion13**"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T17:06:46Z","Content":"Pump all of your fuel to the forward-most tanks before beginning reentry.\n\nMaintaining COM by pumping fuel around is important in space planes and large aircraft."},{"CreatedByName":"mike9606","CreatedById":90275,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T17:33:28Z","Content":"I find that aircraft like to flip far too much now.

Due to aerodynamics the handle will behave like the tail in a dart and trail out behind as the hammer falls. Even a dart with the flights not fitted into the stem will still fly pointy end first, just not as stable as with them.\n\nHope this helps."}]}
