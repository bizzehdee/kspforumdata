That said, a lot depends on the design of the plane and way you approach the runway. It also helps a LOT to use basically any UI other than the stock one. Mechjeb or KER both offer great info panels. The key here is that your \u0022surface velocity\u0022 is actually a combination of two velocities.. your horizontal speed and vertical speed. The stock UI doesn\u0027t depict this. For example, you may have a surface velocity of \u002230 m/s\u0022 which is quite slow for an approach.\u00A0But if that 30 is 10 forward and 20 down.. you\u0027ll blow up when you hit the runway. If it\u0027s 25 forward and 5 down.. well, still pretty fast but you\u0027d likely survive.
