So the 60% income combined with 200% penalties means that buildings are stupid expensive.\n\nSet the penalties slider to match the income slider IMO.

Grinding is not fun, and doesn\u0027t equate to \u0022harder\u0022 in my opinion.\n\nI was playing around with the penalties slider at different levels to see what were decent building costs (since that\u0027s the bottleneck really, and the cause of the grind - contracts themselves aren\u0027t bad, it\u0027s just the requirement to perform repetitive operations that makes it so.\n\nThen I had a re-think, and just started a career on Normal.\n\n...and it\u0027s great! I am self-enforcing the lack of quicksaves/reverts (but those could easily be turned on), and I could see the argument for putting part costs back in, or decreasing rewards, but so far the new career is actually a lot more entertaining.\n\nTotal missions so far have been five - a basic suborbital lob, Jeb into orbit, Munar fly-by (only just), Two-ship rendezvous and Munar orbit. I\u0027ve unlocked half of the 45 science tier, and solar panels - I could land on the Mun right now, but I might wait for landing legs to be unlocked.\n\nThis is KSP career as I feel it should be - you can push for bold leaps before you\u0027re entirely ready, and make large-scale plans.\n\nOn hard, I was hitting a brick wall at unlocking the second tier VAB. Whether there will be similar vertical bottlenecks later in Normal remains to be seen, but this feels like this has been balanced pretty well so far."},{"CreatedByName":"Scrogdog","CreatedById":66879,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T12:52:18Z","Content":"I did something similar and I have to admit the money pressure is a bit exciting to me.\n\nMuch better than just \u0022I screwed up time to revert\u0022.

Then after I circularized orbit I didn\u0027t think I had enough fuel to get down. But I did... barely.\n\nEven though I was pretty sure my re-entry was going to be fine, I was still filled with fear during all the flames and such after all that.\n\nOne of the most thrilling missions I\u0027ve ever flown!
