It makes exploration much easier if you don\u0027t intend to bring the crew back to Kerbin. I think Laythe is a good option too (if a little far away) due to the large quantities of water, oxygen and some sort of sandy deposits.

Logistically, the proximity to Kerbin alone is a great advantage over everyone\u0027s favorite, Laythe. Remember, just because it has oxygen doesn\u0027t mean Laythe is any less hostile to imported life- the air is still toxic, the planet is still cold as hell, and since there is no plant growth, there is just as much topsoil (none!) on Laythe as there is on the Mun. The potential to purify oxygen from the atmosphere doesn\u0027t outweigh the fact that for a full colonization, you\u0027d have to import everything else necessary to break down and refine the natural minerals to grow plants. At that point, you\u0027re well on your way to a self-contained CO2/O2 cycle anyway. And it\u0027s even easier than that to ship raw resources back to Kerbin from the Mun than from Laythe, making the venture self-funding as well as self-sufficient, the Mun\u0027s lower gravity and lack of atmosphere make it a better location for stockpiling and shipbuilding, closer proximity to Kerbol and again no atmosphere is much better for solar power collection\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 the advantages are endless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then I vote LAYTHE because it has better POSTCARDS.
