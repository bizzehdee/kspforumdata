Do NOT attack other players\u0027 opinions because they differ from your own. Put all zealotry aside here.\n\nThe purpose of this thread is simply to amass data on how all members of the community deal with the issue of aerocapturing/braking at interplanetary transfer speeds. Being able to do this has long been a staple of KSP gameplay because it saves fuel when going to places with atmospheres. Now, some say this is totally \u0022unrealistic\u0022 based on how things are in our own real universe, and they\u0027re entitled to that opinion. If they never do it themselves, that\u0027s fine. But there are many who do use aerocapturing because they think it\u0027s perfectly legit, and in single-player games, what other people do in their own games is their business. So let\u0027s not get into the rightness or wrongness of the concept as a whole, OK?\n\n----------------------------------\n\n**THE CONTEXT**\n\n1.0.4 introduced a whole new heat system which, from what I can tell of its inner workings, is considerably more rational and \u0022realistic\u0022 than what we had in 1.0.2. So far, so good. But a set of equations is just a machine, mechanically crunching inputs into outputs. Thus, the results are only as good as the inputs. So the heat system must answer 2 questions. First, is the heat system a valid model for KSP and, second, what are the best inputs for it? When you reply to this thread, please try to answer both questions.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\n**MY ANSWER**\n\nI believe that using interplanetary aerocapture is perfectly legit and adds a challenge now that it can kill you. I deal with it by reducing the reentry heat value to 10-20% (still experimenting). This results in a challenge that\u0027s worth facing. Higher heat levels result in no challenge becuase they force you either to avoid the atmosphere entirely or use a mod or hack to negate the heat.\n\n1. Validity of the Model\n\nAs indicated above, I think the inner workings are reasonably valid as to how things work on Earth and, by extension, to other planets in our real solar system. However, KSP is in a radically different, toy-sized solar system so no Earth-derived system will ever be a good fit for all places in it. It can be made to approximate Earth-like results in 1 area, but that will produce strange/undesirable/wrong (whatever you want to call it) results everywhere else. So no matter what you do with it, you can\u0027t optimize it across the board. Thus, it all boils down to where you prefer to optimize it, which is a question of inputs. Therefore, I will accept the model as \u0022valid\u0022 (considering it\u0027s the one we have to deal with) and move on to the inputs.\n\n2. Validity of the Inputs\n\nBecause the model is incapable of producing *what I consider* desirable results at all planets simultaneously, I have to choose which planets I want desirable results at, and what I\u0027m willing to accept as a result at other planets. If I make reentry from LKO very dangerous, I preclude being ab le to aerocapture at other planets or when returning from them to Kerbin. OTOH, if I make interplanetary aerocapture doable, then I make returning from LKO a doddle. HOWEVER, in 1.0.4 with 100% heat, I find returning from LKO a doddle anyway, and my interests all lie at other planets, not Kerbin. So, turning that down costs me nothing. Therefore, I choose to do that so I have an achievable challenge at other planets.\n\n[My testing](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127129-1-0-4-Aerocapture-Testing) indicates that 1.0.4 increased reentry heating by a factor in the neighborhood of 4-5x over what it was in 1.0.2. That is, setting 20% reentry heat in 1.0.4 produces about the same amount of heat as 100% reentry heat in 1.0.2. Because the reentry heat slider only moves in 10% increments, I have been loath to try entering 5% increments.\n\nNOTE: For them as started a 1.0.4 game with 100% reentry heat and now regret that decision, it\u0027s easy to change. Open the save file. Up near the top is a block called PARAMETERS. Scroll down in this to a sub-block called DIFFICULTY. The last line in this is reentry heat. 1.0 = 100%, 0.1 = 10%, etc."},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T16:30:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E **CAVEAT**\n\u003E This is an attempt to have a rational discussion.

I find interplanetary travel more interesting, if I have to use different techniques for different missions.\n\nThe first step is always having good encounters. When you\u0027re arriving from Kerbin to Jool, you hit Laythe\u0027s atmosphere at around 3000 m/s. You only need to lose a few hundred m/s in the initial aerobraking pass to get captured in Laythe\u0027s SoI. Alternatively, you can play with gravity assists from Tylo and Laythe or burn engines before and after aerobraking to make the pass through the atmosphere even safer.\n\nThe second step is choosing the tool according to the ship. A probe can land on Eve directly after arriving from Kerbin, while a heavy ship has to use its engines to slow down first. A plane can lose a lot of speed in the upper atmosphere, while an interplanetary ship coming in engines first probably has too small cross section for any meaningful aerobraking. A ship with its fuel tanks empty can find aerobraking much more useful than the same ship fully fueled.\n\nThe third step is not being too ambitious. You only need to lose just enough speed to get captured on the first pass. if you\u0027re trying to land or to reach a low orbit, you have all the time in the world to lose speed on the subsequent passes."},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T16:35:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Now I know why this thread hasn\u0027t had any replies...\n\nI\u0027m really, really into this topic but I don\u0027t have any atmospheric entries on the mission board for about 177 game-days and 21 real-days.

By that I mean that other game systems and mods can use values generated by FAR in their own calculations much easier. For instance, if you have FAR, then the wonderful Trajectories mod will work for you, but Trajectories can\u0027t handle stock aero under a variety of circumstances (such as using fairings). By this token, I would assume that (whatever it does to other aspects of the game) FAR would simplify designing ships for interplanetary aerocapture because the player would get an emperical feel for what works and what doesn\u0027t easier than with stock air."},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T17:29:13Z","Content":"The only time I aerocapture in KSP is when doing something like the MSL and, since I find no need to do an MSL-type mission in KSP (because we\u0027re talking about a toy-sized solar system and I don\u0027t have to worry about fuel costs or carrying large amounts of hypergolics to slow down), I don\u0027t aerocapture.

Not because of the heat system though. My problem is that KSP doesn\u0027t give you the tools and know how necessary to avoid aerocapture entirely. This change leads to a resulting game that is harder for most players for the sake of \u0027more realism\u0027. Which in that particular case doesn\u0027t mean \u0027more fun\u0027. Also doesn\u0027t make the game any more realistic.\n\nReal world missions don\u0027t use aerocapture or aerobraking (those are technically two different techniques btw.) Except for two notable exceptions (the Magellan probe and the Mars global surveyor) interplanetary missions usually use other measures to adjust velocity. Either gravity assists, burning rocket fuel or a combination of both. Sometimes the delta V budget is so limited that a mission can only achieve a fly by. (New Horizons for example).\n\nCassini-Huygens had to do two gravity assist fly bys of Venus, a gravity assist fly by of Earth and one of Jupiter to be able to end up at Saturn ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens_timeline#/media/File:Cassini_interplanet_trajectory.svg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens_timeline#/media/File:Cassini_interplanet_trajectory.svg)) and it took the probe 6 years to arrive there.\n\nYou can\u0027t plan such a trajectory with the limited simulation model KSP provides (it would be very hard at least). You\u0027d need a \u0027true\u0027 n-body simulation. Even then you\u0027d need the know-how and mathematical planning necessary to design such complex trajectories. Even if you\u0027d have all that you\u0027d still probably have to wait years or even decades of in game time for a launch window.\n\nThe game doesn\u0027t help you in any way either. There is no tutorial that explains gravity assists to you. There is no launch window planner if you don\u0027t install mods. The default patched conic approximation won\u0027t show you your trajectory through the Kerbol system (it stops after 3 conical patches) so that you couldn\u0027t even plan something like this in stock without mods even if the simulation model was magically accurate enough to make such an endeavor worthwile.\n\nAll it achieved is to make the game harder for most players without adding more realism to it, Just because some players are under the false impression that this is \u0027more realistic\u0027. Even worse it isn\u0027t even half as good as deadly reentry, a perfectly fine mod anyone that craves added realism should have already installed anyway. \n\nRight now you can\u0027t really do interplanetary missions via aerobraking. Worse you can\u0027t really do an interplanetary return to Kerbin via aerobraking. So you\u0027ll either have to haul huge rockets with insane delta v budgets through interplanetary space (space truckin\u0027) meaning that you\u0027ll spend more time assembling your mission in orbit over Kerbin than actually doing it. Usually using \u0027near future\u0027 type means of propulsion which doesn\u0027t really make the game more realistic (it only exchanges added realism in one game system by making another less realistic). Or you use ore extraction and refuel to generate the insane delta-v requirements in-flight which is not necessarily realistic either. Or you build ridiculous contraptions with a truckload of heatshields and/or abuse the added radiators.\n\nOr do what you did and basically turn it off entirely (limiting it to 20% you might as well turn it off completely).\n\nAll done just because a few vocal players didn\u0027t find stock heating quite challenging enough yet were too lazy to install DRE.

Because I wanted a challenge, I took the time to do tests to figure out what is, IMHO, actually challenging and what is not. Let me explain.\n\nI used to be an indy gamedev myself so I look at gameplay challenges from that perspective. Viewed this way, a challenge worthy of inclusion in a game has to satisfy 2 criteria. First, the challenge must be doable or it\u0027s not a challenge but an unavoidable constraint on player actions. Second, the reward has to be worth the effort when compared to the option of NOT doing the challenge or there\u0027s no incentive for players to attempt the challenge. Challenges that nobody takes up are a complete waste of game designer effort.\n\nThe reward for interplanetary aerocapturing is merely a reduction in the dV required for the trip. And that just means you can do the trip with a smaller, simpler, cheaper ship compared to not aerocapturing. This really isn\u0027t that huge of a reward, which means that any solution to interplanetary aerocapture that adds much to ship/mission size, complexity, and expense will significantly eat into or exceed the benefits, especially when compared to the baseline \u0022MOAR fuel\u0022 option. IOW, from an effort/cost-to-reward POV, the options of building a monster heat shield or setting up the whole ore-mining infrastructure really aren\u0027t valid solutions.\n\nThis means that for interplanetary aerocapture to be a worthwhile gameplay challenge, it must fairly easy. IOW, something you can\u0027t ignore but which still doesn\u0027t require a huge effort to solve. The higher the effort required to achieve it, the more attractive the option of ignoring the challenge entirely becomes, either via \u0022MOAR fuel\u0022, just turning heat off completely, or using some mod/hack/exploit that simply negates the heat.\n\nIt was this thinking that led me to use 20% reentry heat. Any higher and \u0022MOAR fuel\u0022 wins, so there\u0027s no challenge. Any lower and there\u0027s not enough heat to be challenging at all.\n\nI admit, 20% compared to 100% doesn\u0027t sound like much, but I submit that this is an artifact of trying to force a system designed for real life into the totally different KSP universe. Simply recalibrating the scale of the GUI reentry heat slider, so that today\u0027s 20% becomes the new 100%, would solve that problem.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-29T19:00:10Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2015 07:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T19:13:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You can\u0027t plan such a trajectory with the limited simulation model KSP provides (it would be very hard at least).

You don\u0027t have to be as precise as in the real world, because launches are cheap and the solar system is small. Some players have even mastered them while playing 100% stock.\n\nThe reason why we don\u0027t have proper mission planning software in the stock game is that the development team is too small for such a complex game. Unfortunately, it Squad hired more developers, it would just delay the development until the new guys are up to the speed. To be of any real use, those new developers should have been hired a couple of years ago at the latest, but there was probably not enough money for it.\n\nFortunately KSP is quite mod-friendly, and we have a huge pile of mods, with at least an order of magnitude more developer resources than the stock game. Most of the features one would want have already been implemented at least once.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Right now you can\u0027t really do interplanetary missions via aerobraking. Worse you can\u0027t really do an interplanetary return to Kerbin via aerobraking. So you\u0027ll either have to haul huge rockets with insane delta v budgets through interplanetary space (space truckin\u0027) meaning that you\u0027ll spend more time assembling your mission in orbit over Kerbin than actually doing it.\n\nI\u0027ve found that the delta-v budgets for interplanetary missions are quite similar in 1.0.4 as they used to be in 0.90. You need less delta-v to reach orbit and more delta-v after interplanetary transfers. While typical rockets used to have a 15% payload fraction, simple designs now lift over 20% of the launch mass, and interplanetary ships can be correspondingly bigger.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I also don\u0027t really understand why Squad assigns its limited development time and budget to implement a feature only a vocal minority claims is needed. Especially when there is already a mod that does the same.\n\nIt\u0027s not about a vocal minority or a vocal majority, but about the original concept. The idea has always been to make realistic spaceflight games more accessible than Orbiter. For every major feature Orbiter has, this involves trying to figure out whether something similar can be implemented in a way that adds interesting gameplay, but does not add unnecessary complexity to the game or drown the player in excessive details. For a long time, Squad was sceptical whether reentry heating could be implemented in such a way. The success of DRE ultimately convinced them, and they\u0027ve been tweaking the amount of heating since then."},{"CreatedByName":"1of6Billion","CreatedById":46191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T19:20:56Z","Content":"Ah, that\u0027s why my Jool mission keeps exploding as soon as the craft hits the atmosphere........ ![:sealed:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif)\n\nPoor Bill c.s. ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"clivman","CreatedById":139191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T19:24:23Z","Content":"I use a mix of light aerocapture and burns"},{"CreatedByName":"ShadowZone","CreatedById":112420,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T20:16:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 1.0.4 got me to learn gravity-assisting.
