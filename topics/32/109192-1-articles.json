The more thrust an engine can produce, the more efficient it will be. Thrust is decreased in atmosphere because the engine exhaust must first overcome the pressure of the atmosphere to escape the nozzle (If the atmospheric pressure is high enough, the engine produces zero thrust), reducing the amount of effective forward thrust it can generate, hence lowering it\u0027s Isp. Fuel consumption remains constant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 0.90, (I\u0027m not sure of the WHY behind it) engine thrust was not variable.
