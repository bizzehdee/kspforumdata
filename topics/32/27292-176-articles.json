The IPTV stayed in orbit while the lander came back to Kerbin. In truth, this was a test run, as I plan to send the IPTV [Ceres 01 Dres Surveyor] to the aforementioned dwarf planet.

There was a tiny probe attached to the top but it came in too fast and that probe was really better suited for Minmus anyway, and it crashed in quite a pathetic way.

This one is supposed to actually come back, if all goes according to plan. This shot was taken after all the bad stuff happened, but the ship I\u0027m talking about is the farthest to the left. First of all it had an escape pod docked to the copula just like the station itself, but that decided to fly apart for some reason when I staged the second set of boosters so I dropped what was left of it and brought a replacement up with the hitchhiker containers for the station. It basically is the main section of the station but without the hitchhiker and it\u0027s got a docking port on the rear to tug a lander, and ports on the sides for engines I haven\u0027t brought up yet. But before this shot I had docked it to the science lab which was apparently a really bad idea. The entire station started to buck and sway when it connected and I thought it was going to rip itself apart, SAS couldn\u0027t do anything about it and I couldn\u0027t even stop it myself. Finally I had to undock and switch to the station to help SAS sort the problem out, then pick a better place to dock after everything settled down. Physics got me again... But I knew the risks when I tried it. Bob, Jeb, and Kurt are currently hanging out in the main hitchhiker container arguing over who gets to fly the new ship to rescue Bill from Duna, assuming it gets that far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2014-01-0120-55-50-83.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2014-01-0120-55-50-83.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-02T08:40:43Z\u0022 title=\u002201/02/2014 08:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Duke23\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T08:44:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been sick, and so have done almost nothing in .23 so far.

This is crazy... So, I launched a kethane mapping satellite to the Mun and carefully mapped out the electric charge capacity / consumption / regeneration to pretty much a tenth of a unit. By all accounts it should have had enough juice to survive a blackout flying behind the Mun at a 200km orbit, and recharge fully before passing behind again. Unfortunately KSP seems to have a mind of its own at times (I blame the Kraken) and during time warp the sat didn\u0027t recharge quite as fast as I was expecting. It ran out of juice about halfway behind the Mun on the second pass, so I nuked it and added an extra solar panel to the next model (better to overengineer than underengineer).

The lab would burn, after a rescue mission. First, I hooked the lander to the lab and used what gas I had left to return to Kerbin orbit. Then I sucked the last of the fuel from the lab to the lander (since there wasn\u0027t enough to deorbit both), and the lander successfully returned home. Then it was time for the rescue missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first one was a three-man capsule. I gave it a pilot, leaving the two-man can empty. (This will be important later.) The rendezvous went as planned, and I hooked in with the ladders aligned. I went to EVA the station crew and realized... I\u0027m a seat short. The station held three - two for the lab, one in the cupola. D\u0027oh! No matter, I\u0027ll send up a second unit to recover him. Anyway, I load the kerbals into their can and begin reentry sequence. All goes as I expected until it was time to pop chutes. Due to the docking/undocking, my staging didn\u0027t fire when I hit [space]. (There\u0027s probably an extra command I haven\u0027t learned yet to fix this.) So I popped my drogues manually. There were two, and they fired non-symmetrically. A couple things happened. First, the two-man can fell off my rescue craft. The two trapped kerbals began to freefall. Then, my drogues snapped. Because the lander was heavier, it impacted the two-man capsule, detonating my nuke engines. Two kerbals dead, most of my rescue craft disintegrated. Amazingly, I still had the pilot\u0027s can, with one chute attached. Maybe it would land safely? ...nope.

The docking port was on a \u0022stalk\u0022 of RCS fuel and reaction wheels, and it flopped back and forth with every RCS thrust. Took me almost 15 minutes of finagling it to get it to lock. Got my Kerbal to the rescue pod, and began the deorbit burn. This rescue craft I engineered better. The pod itself separated fully from the engines and lab, so once the whole thing broke 30k, I popped the decoupler.
