To this end you want to orientate your target craft\u0027s docking port to face perpendicular to it\u0027s orbit vector. That sounds a bit wordy. Simply - if your target craft / station is in an equatorial orbit (ie. travelling east/west) then manoeuvre it such that it\u0027s docking point is facing north or south; this way, as it orbits around the planet the docking port will stay pointing in the same direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine the craft below is your target craft, at the top is it\u0027s docking port, the arrow shows it\u0027s orbit direction\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E   ---\u003Cbr\u003E  /---\\\u003Cbr\u003E /     \\\u003Cbr\u003E/       \\\u003Cbr\u003E|       |\u003Cbr\u003E|       |      --------------\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u003Cbr\u003E|       |\u003Cbr\u003E---------\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T19:54:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stargate525\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Stargate525\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe biggest thing that helped me go from \u0027I can dock and the ships might keep all their parts after their mating dance\u0027 to \u0027one touch ultra\u0027 was to learn to COMPLETELY ignore everything but the navball.\u003Cp\u003ENow, when docking, I use the actual ship view for two things: one, to check my rotation, and two, to make sure that the navball is not obviously lying (pointing to the ship\u0027s COM instead of the docking port, for instance).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis, pretty much.
