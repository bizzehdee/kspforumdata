The Pyramids, containing as they do a huge statue of a Kerbal, indicate that Kerbals have been on Kerbin a long time, since at least the dawn of civilization when the invention of the mud brick was big news. This seems a bit too low-tech for stranded extra-Kerbin colonists. Also, the statue doesn\u0027t have a helmet, which indicates that Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere back in those days wasn\u0027t harmful to Kerbals. I have, therefore, had to come up with another theory. In fact, I have 2 competing theories:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E1. Kerbals Are Artificial\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are monoliths all over Kerbin, especially at KSC, and also on Mun. These demand an explanation. And Kerbals die, they disappear in a puff of what looks exactly like Mundust. So it could be that the monoliths create Kerbals from materials gathered on Mun and spawn them at KSC as needed. This is all the experiment or idle diversion of some hyper-intelligent, pan-dimensional beings, who watch their creations evolve and struggle to develope technology for reasons of their own. In this theory, the other monoliths on Kerbin and the Pyramids and other ruins, mark former locations where Kerbals used to spawn in the past. There has never been more than a handful of Kerbals at any one time, hence no other ruins, and new Kerbals are created as needed. Kerbals wear helmets outside just because they were created wearing them so feel incomplete without them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E2. Kerbals are Troglodytes\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals are naturally biological, native to Kerbin, and exist in huge numbers, but all underground in vast subterranean cities. Most of them are quite happy there and only the few nutjobs among them ever venture up on the surface, let alone want to go to space. They are a type of fungus similar to puffballs and the dust released when they die is actually a cloud of spores. Those on the surface wear helmets out of a delusional vanity (they are nutjobs, after all).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless of Kerbal origins, the whole helmet I think has to be more costume than necessity. Kerbals lack noses and keep their mouths shut most of the time, so it\u0027s really open to argument as to whether they breathe at all. Maybe they absorb something through their skin, but I suspect the main practical purpose of the helmet is merely to maintain pressure while in space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T12:40:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe will probably have to ask the mice about the true purpose of kerbin...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T12:43:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022oliv897\u0022 data-cite=\u0022oliv897\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewe NEVER see any Kerbal outside (does this mean the air is toxic?) the few we do see (ship crew) always wear a space suit even on the surface with no option(yet) to remove it (another tip that the atmosphere is Toxic?)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see Kerbals walking around in the SPH and the VAB in civilian clothes, with open doors.
