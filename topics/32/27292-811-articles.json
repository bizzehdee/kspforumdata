I landed the two tourists to satisfy part of the tourist contract, but completely forgot that they cannot do EVAs so I could not get any EVA or surface samples, which would have satisfied another contract. I returned the tourists to orbit and then brought Valentina to get the surface science. Completely successful mission.

Initially this used small gear bays, but they were a little too short to feel entirely comfortable landing with the bay open, and it forced me to place them in locations that caused such bad clipping that the plane blew itself to pieces the instant the gear tried to deploy, so I had to swap them for medium gear instead. A little fuel balancing and it is balanced well enough that I do not have to fear tail dragging. It does actually fly pretty well, nice easy takeoff, smooth motion, controlled landing, though its thrust is a little lacking, but that should be expected since those four tiny jet engines do not output much. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nLooks pretty good, though I could not replicate the shape of the actual F22\u0026#39;s internal bay since we have no square cargo bays in stock.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mjarf","CreatedById":16666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T00:15:12Z","Content":"\nFinally got back into the game after a way too long break.

I only had enough fuel for about two landings and takeoffs, since the mothership was hydrogen-fueled with only a small tank of liquid fuel for refilling the lander; but thanks to those newfangled \u0022wheels\u0022 it can reach multiple biomes per landing, and a SCAN-satting of Ike revealed some rather strange biome placement (the north pole is a tiny patch of \u0022South Pole\u0022 and many biomes have a border of \u0022South Eastern Mountain Range\u0022). So, I landed on a mountain, tediously drove 20 km through three other biomes, and climbed all the way back up to save fuel for takeoff.

SAS locking to prograde helped tremendously, and I didn\u0026#39;t have a single problem. Until just before reaching the last biome, that is, when I hit a bump climbing a mountain of mysteriously un-illuminateable terrain, tumbled over, and broke all the solar panels! But it landed upright, so by disabling the motors on the back wheels (which weren\u0026#39;t getting much traction) I was able to get most of the way up... then I had to resort to pushing myself along with RCS. Somehow reached the last biome, and by disabling power flow from one of the batteries, was able to conserve enough power to complete a wobbly flight to orbit and rendezvous with the mothership.

Playing in my fully stock 1.0.5 sandbox game I launched an unmanned Munar X to get him, landed within 200m (that was the easy part, not tipping over took a couple reloads). Then I discovered the Munar X doesn\u0026#39;t have the delta V to get him home, so left him in an eccentric orbit and sent another rescue mission out. Realized this was the first rendezvous I\u0026#39;d done in a while without MechJeb, but all went smoothly and we got him safely home, which is good because Jeb and co are still mysteriously MIA.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T22:12:01Z","Content":"\nAnd made a Cobra maneuver with a rather large aircraft.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPic removed\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-25T20:02:54Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2015 08:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mikki\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EPic removed\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T23:11:48Z","Content":"\nArrived at Titanus, making a Tylo gravicapture into the system: [url]https://flic.kr/p/BkSELQ[/url]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTook a picture of its rings backlit: [url]https://flic.kr/p/AqDAd3[/url]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOrbited and landed on its innermost moon, Ete, and got this picture of almost the whole family: Tylo (the grey one), Kalus (the little red one by Titanus), Titanus (the ringed one) and Ete (below).
