However using Earth as a basis, O2 in large quantities would only result from photosynthesis. At 5x the distance from the sun, that would be 1/25th as much light... photosynthesis doesn\u0027t really seem that viable. I\u0027m not sure what the lower limit for light exposure is for life on Earth, but I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if 1/25th is simply too little. Even if photosynthesis at ~1/25th the rate on kerbin was enough to support life, we should expect a substantial reduction in O2 concentration as a result - maybe 2% O2 instead of ~20%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs with many things in KSP, it breaks down if you try to apply real science to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther points:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Jool: unliekly to be many complex chemicals in the atmosphere. The upper layers (assuming its similar to jupiter) will be just hydrogen and inert helium). Lower layers will have nitrogen containing compounds, then even lower will have sulfur and Oxygen atoms in the compounds. None of that is sufficient for life. It will also get hot as one gets lower, which will disassociate larger compounds. No life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Laythe: The radiation isn\u0027t from Jool, its from the sun -\u00A0its charged particles trapped by Jool\u0027s magnetic fields. Unlike the moons of Jupiter, Laythe has a thick atmosphere which would protect against these particles. A surface pressure of 0.8 atmospheres\u00A0on a world with 0.8 G surface gravity\u00A0will have the same atmospheric mass above a given point as a world with a surface pressure of 1\u00A0atmospheres and a surface gravity of 1 G. They changed Laythe\u0027s atmospheric pressure from 0.8 to 0.6... but that still means it has 75% the mass of air shielding it as kerbin does. That would be a lot, the surface of Laythe should be a benign environment as far as radiation is concerned. Since its got O2, we can assume its also got Ozone, and that would protect against UV, which would be 25x less intesne to start with. If lathe has its own magnetic field to provide additional charged particle radiation, even better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
