But maybe everyone is over-reacting a little to this. It was one video that has been proven false. Behind those videos is a real person, and for whatever reason, he was dead-set on making a tilt-wing to Tylo, and he couldn\u0027t do it fairly for some reason, whether that be stress limits or time constraint, so he cheated to make it happen. I\u0027ve cheated in this game a couple times, and God knows that all of you have too, so don\u0027t go hating on him. Yes, it was cheat-y and yes, it was wrong, but he obviously has a guilty conscience about it, so just forgive and forget. Don\u0027t be a hater. Don\u0027t be a hypocrite.
