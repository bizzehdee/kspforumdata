It mostly comes down to \u0022how many identical mini-satellites are you willing to put on the same vehicle before you decide KSP was not meant to be a slideshow?\u0022 The primary issue is often that going big is usually limited by framerate rather than any aspect of the in-game physics, so it\u0027s a matter of patience and possession of high-end hardware moreso than any real skill at KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne excellent entry in the field, however, comes to mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/n2eBwgW6sig?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Single stage to ocean","CreatedById":210256,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-07T05:19:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA decoupler and a octo with a solar counts as a probe, which is 3 parts, so the max i believe would be 3000 sats. Again, with settings as low as possible, and laucnh vehicle siplified as much as possible, i think 10000 sats are possible if you use bradley 1 million ton launcher, which could safely launch 200k tons with a terrible pilot. See his last video. Maybe even adding some seperaton deorbit motors is possible. An octo and a solar panel weigh 50 kg\u00A0together, doubled if an unneed r wheel is added. You could launch a theoretical maximum of 5\u00A0million sats on that rocket. Wow!
