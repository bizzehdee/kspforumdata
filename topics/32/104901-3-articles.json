Basically the differences between 0.90 and previous versions (like 2.23 ect) are not all that much at the core, aerodynamics is the same, and aside from extra parts, nothing massively changed between part performance, ect.\n\n1.0 (hopefully) will be the final major change, and subsequent updates will mostly add parts, fix balance, add features, ect, but wont do any major changes to how stuff flies, how heat works, ect. Hopefully after 1.0 there wont be much craft breakage, and stuff will remain functional afterwards.\n\nThat said, i still hope 1.0 doesnt break everything (especially non atmospheric craft), as id HATE to loose my capital ships with their insane armor (50t heavy ship got rammed by a 500t rocket at 300m/s and i survbived it with engines and weapons intact!)."},{"CreatedByName":"Freshmeat","CreatedById":111048,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T14:44:40Z","Content":"I absolutely need zitronen to update KSPserialIO first, as my rig depends upon it.
