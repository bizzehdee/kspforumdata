By the time that patch was applied, I had already given up on Mk1 fuselage-based stuff and was working with Mk2. There were a fair number of us in 1.0.4 working on high dV spaceplanes for long-range missions, and based on this thread none of them seem to be very happy. The thick atmosphere high up makes trying to circularize on the nuke engines quite a bit harder. Doing that is always a narrow-margin exercise, and that little bit of extra drag up there made it seem to me like I would have to increase TWR a fair bit, i.e. boost less fuel and/or ship more oxidizer. On top of that, while I could just get to 1500 m/s on air plus the nuke, I couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t sustain that speed to nearly the same altitudes as I could in 1.0.4, so I had to switch to bipropellant quite a bit earlier. It will be interesting to see later how getting the body lift back may mitigate all these problems. It also seems like they fixed the intake air situation with that patch, as I noticed I needed significantly more intakes to keep flying up high afterwards, but OTOH my range seemed higher once I had enough. If they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve fixed it so that this thicker air now sustains combustion in proportion to its drag, then we might be in a different movie...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm of the same opinion, right now i can barely pull 6000dV with a craft fully stripped of weapons, docking ports, RCS, and anything that isnt 100% essential to flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm not one to instantly say the patch sucks, as i usually give it a few weeks before i go all out and say something is unbalanced or not fun or whatever, but from all my current experienced SSTOs are way less enjoyable then they were in 1.0.4. Back then, i went to insane levels to try and cut drag, i basically made a ship with a fuel tank on each end of a cargo bay, air intalke in front, cockpit\u002Bengine behind. That let me cram every other part including most of the fuel tanksj inside the cargo (or should i say bomb) bay, disabling drag on it all, and making breaking past the sound barrier with a single rapier pushing ~40t possible, barely but possible. Now, its another issue, sound barrier is nolonger much of a concern (i can even get past it with terrible designs that couldnt even dare before), but now im completely screwed when it comes to ejecting from the atmosphere. there is WAY more drag between 20 and 40km, the area most critical for spaceplanes, and well, a single nuke pushing over 35 tons just cannot cut it anymore, and oxy is EXTREMELY wasteful as not only does it burn itself, but it steals LF from the nuke too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, the absolute maximum ive managed to pull off before switching to rockets and before i get fried in my burning cockpit is just under 1500m/s. Before, i could pull 1650 if i was patient enough, now, anything near that speed = instant death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may just be my style of design, so if anyone manages to pull off a super high speed (without exploding) craft then id love to see what you did and how it works. Until then, ill be suffering anywhere from 500 to 1000 less dV with my SSTOs \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, i dont know why squad did this?

When I sent up my 1.0.4 workhorse spaceplane for the first time in 1.0.5, my first impression was that I was accelerating a bit slower on takeoff, but I wasn\u0027t sure. My first *clear* impression was that I was about 50 m/s faster than in 1.0.4 when I began leveling off after my post-takeoff climb, and I leveled off about 5000 meters higher than I\u0027m used to. At that point the big issue became heating, not drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI amended my launch procedure to use a shallower initial climb to level off at about the same altitude, and higher airspeed, than before. I then continue in an acceleration phase at about 10-15km, as before, but instead of using speed as my criterion for beginning my climb to orbit, I now pitch up and light my nukes at about 70% temperature for my critical part (as measured in Kerbal Engineer). The pitchup is shallower than I used to do, but I end up going faster from 26km up, and for my spaceplane, which is about 25 tons light load, 30 tons heavy, I end up with in the range of 100 fuel or so more than I used to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T11:52:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022herbal space program\u0022 data-cite=\u0022herbal space program\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWe\u0027re not talking about payload fraction, we\u0027re talking about dV. \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Calibri;\u0022\u003EIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not like we don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know how to build a ship that can get to orbit.

I spent months working on a very specific problem \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 how to design the longest-range, useful (i.e. not purely ion-powered) crewed SSTO possible. Now, just as I was about to do this huge triumphant mission to visit Laythe, Duna, Minmus, and back to Kerbin on one tank of gas, Oops! fugeddaboudit! That ship won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t even make orbit anymore. Since the silent patch it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not nearly as appallingly bad as it was initially, but still I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m looking at a good 0.8-1km/s haircut on how far I can go with an SSTO.

For a very experienced player like me to be just able to wring that sort of performance out of an SSTO design, after months of tinkering and learning from others, was really quite gratifying. Now the possibilities are quite a bit more limited again, and \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Crealism\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 notwithstanding, that is a drag for players like me, for whom these sorts of challenges are the only thing that still really holds any appeal. I dunno, maybe one of the threadmeisters who was proclaiming earlier how much better this air is for SSTO\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s will come back and show us how to do it so that you can get the same or even better performance, but this time I rather doubt it. I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t see how you overcome all that new air resistance at the top end.
