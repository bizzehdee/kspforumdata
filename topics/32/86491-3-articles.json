His point on that post about the educational angle was just that, if you want to tout a game as educational, you can\u0027t teach lies, and as it stands, the KSP physics are too far from RL to do so ( I know, I\u0027ve been introducing KSP to some of the kids I tutor and been pretty much focusing in the orbit mechanics part much more just to avoid questions about reentry shields and aerodynamics ). On the rest of his suggestions, he pretty much just pushes out things that in his opinion would balance the game better ( and yes, people, game balance is important ... ).
