Im not saying it is impossible to actually SSTO, heck i have a working craft right now, but it feels that 1.0 has truly killed any viability in SSTOs, with the new drag increases. I know that its most likely more realistic, but common, i think even FAR is easier to work with now.\n\nNow im not questioning whether its realistic or not, thats a discussion for another thread, but is it actually more fun this way? SSTOs were already exponentially harder to make once 1.0 hit, and now it just doesnt feel enjoyable anymore to try to engineer something that just lags, flies liek a pig, and barely manages to bring any useful payload when i can make a basic rocket in 3 minutes and have whatever payload i wanted to get in jool orbit much faster then before. Now to get to anywhere you need insane part counts and weight, and things like laythe roundtrips are as good as dead, despite managing to pull it off under 1.0\u0027s drag. \n\nIm still going to enjoy this game, but it seems that SSTOs have been excessively hard hit by the recent updates, to the point of loosing almost all practicality over rockets. Or at least thats my experience.\n\nFinally, does anyone think its even remotely possible (without using exploits and bugs) to get to laythe and back without any refueling or IRSU useage? I used to make many SSTOs with an excess of 5K dV, now it seems that there is no way to make a long range SSTO, as small sized craft dont have the fuel to burn to orbit, and larger craft arent really my thing. Is it even possible to get a SSTO thats under 10t to the mun and back, as thats what im trying to pull off, but it doesnt look very promising?"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T23:33:25Z","Content":"[Whackjob threw together an SSTO that could almost land on the mun](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117164-Arkingthaad-in-1-0?p=1872848#post1872848) in 1.0, im fairly certain it can still make orbit in 1.0.2.\n\nKeep the faith and persevere."},{"CreatedByName":"Radam","CreatedById":79910,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T23:35:57Z","Content":"Well my mk2 spaceplane still works in 1.02, it has about 25% payload fraction.

Getting back in general is much harder, but then we are talking about one of the key aspects that needs to be dealt with when it comes to winged crafts, how to survive re-entry. \n\nPersonally I like the tilt tward larger craft going further rather than smaller crafts going further. Not only does that make practical sense, it makes game play sense. Why use rockets when a tiny SSTO can get the same job done?

A single Rapier with a fuel tank and some wings tacked on can do the job easily.\n\nNaming conventions aside (i consider SSTO anything that doesnt dump and parts, SSTO to LKO is the most common, but i also make SSTO to other planets).\n\nId liek to see a WORKING design with a single rapier that can do mun and back, and is UNDER 10t! If thats even possible (i doubt it myself), then i take back everything ive said about single-stage-to-wherever being dead. Also, it has to be a legit craft, no cheapo fuel tank\u002Bengine\u002Bprobecore. It should have a MK1 inline cockpit (or another cockpit of choice), and at least some stubby wings/fins.\n\nAlso, based on some quick calculations, you will have roughly 4 tons of dry mass (1 for cockpit, 2 rapier, 1ish for stuff like solars/rtgs/wings/ect), and the rest would have to be fuel tanks, but i just fail to see how you can get enough fuel to pull off BOTH orbit, mun burn, landing, AND return burn! I dont think its doable anymore, that is without exploits like massless batteries\u002Bion cluster (which is nolonger doable as massless parts actually have mass, they just dont shift the CoG as much). The absolute max dV assuming that half your craft (5t) is rocket fuel, would be around 2000, this is nowhere near adequate for the mission id like to do. Even if you had 4 tons dry mass, 6 tons fuel (not achieveable realistically for a 10t max limit), you STILL wont be able to pull it off as the dV for the rapier would be 2700, perhaps doable, but since you arent ever going to get this without refueling in orbit, i pretty much consider SSTOs to other planets or even the mun (which are ALSO lightweight) done!"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T00:40:26Z","Content":"Do you know why you can\u0027t get to orbit?\n\nIt\u0027s simple: the rules have changed.\n\nAs a player who wants to make an SSTO, it is your job to figure out the new rules because it\u0027s pretty obvious the old ones don\u0027t apply **at all**.
