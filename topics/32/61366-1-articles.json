Looks nice and realistic, I like it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis 1/2 scale worked really nice for Delta and Falcon sized rockets. Unfortunately this scale doesn\u0027t work out with huge Saturn sized rockets. There are no parts big enough to match the Saturn main tank. Stitching Rockomax tanks together looks a bit hackish. Using a 1/4 scale works for big rockets but produces really small toy rockets (?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I wondered \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 has anybody scratched his head about this?
