I was told to share this, as it made my friend literally fall off his chair laughing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had played around with the free version and, after deciding to buy, went for a proper Mun landing. You know, since I had all the parts. It took me two tries to get into orbit, but my third try yielded a success. Munar III had a perfect de-orbit and Munar landing. It was then that my Kerbal decided he needed to take a spacewalk to the edge of the crater we\u0027d landed in, see why it was so dark. He runs out of fuel, 6km away from the command pod. Radios the others to come get him. They try it, but... And the end of the debacle, the command pod is rolling across the munscape in a cloud of debris. Three kerbals, stranded on the Mun, and the first ones to land there, no less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA program was immediately launched to get them back. Named the Dove I, the mission used a slightly modified version of the Munar III, with rungs outside for the extra kerbal to hang on for dear life. The plan was to get into Kerbal orbit, then use a suborbital spaceplane to bring the extra kerbal down before deorbiting Dove I\u0027s capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDove I failed to make the Munar orbital burn, and returned to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDove II, carrying additional fuel, failed to make orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDove III made the Mun.
