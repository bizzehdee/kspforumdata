If it\u0027s touching the water and stays touching it or it\u0027s above and stays above you\u0027re fine. Hydrofoils seem to be the safest at speed (submerged floats with a long strut that keep the upper parts out of the water). Just don\u0027t have any individual parts that leave or enter the surface when you\u0027re moving fast.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jason Patterson","CreatedById":44388,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T17:14:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEvery stock part is buoyant by default. The way that water works currently is that parts are tested for collisions with the surface of the water only when they pass through it. Any part completely above or below the water\u0027s surface will survive even at high speed, and parts that are partially submerged can also survive, as long as they stay partially submerged (never sink entirely or emerge entirely.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest parts to use for floats are wings, turned so that the long edge is parallel to the water. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as flipping, it works exactly as you would expect. A broad, long base for your boat will result in a more stable design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"annikk.exe","CreatedById":58049,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T17:55:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for this! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Omg, so many new crafts to design...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
