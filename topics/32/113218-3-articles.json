Being able to seeing your colonies growing and expanding. Of course this might take years or decades of in-game time (for Kerbals, not for the player :-D ).\n\u003E \n\u003E An other addition I would like to have is some sort of automation. Being able to assign tasks to Kerbals that they can accomplish while you\u0027re away, or by Artificial Intelligence. Or being able to install a powerful AI on a rover and command it to go exploring the neighborhood.\n\u003E \n\u003E Also, Kerbin is a bit desolate for being the base of an intelligent life form that reaches the frontier of Space Travels. And other planets are a bit dull and empty, beside the biomes. So it would be sweet to have some more geological variety. Something worthing spending hours (years of in-game play) on planets.\n\u003E \n\u003E Duna could even offer some biological samples, like primordial bacteriae.\n\u003E \n\u003E Of course there is also the multiplayer frontier, where players compete against each other for reaching goals.\n\u003E \n\u003E And you?
