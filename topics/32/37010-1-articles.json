A jet makes life easier still, and tons of intakes the easiest.

It gets up to around 25km/1500m/s on jets, then kicks on all the rockets to get up a bit, uses the LVN to finish getting to orbit and circularizing, and really only uses the LVN from there (more than enough power to land on Minmus). Fuel goes further than you\u0027d think with a LVN.
