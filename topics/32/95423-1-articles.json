I mean cmon, it\u0027s like a 3 hour trip to the moon. You get there, deploy your probe, land with a subassembly that you used on your first Munar mission, and go home. You can\u0027t aerobrake, making things even harder. Why not just go to Jool where you can visit it\u0027s moons and even fit in an Aerobrake, or visit Eve where parachutes are acceptable or golly where the force of a decoupled launches you to a 10k Apopsis. Why not Duna? Aerobrake, A Mun like moon, Ike, and a nice size planet? What is the point of going to these planets? To say that you did. This thread is for the discussion and sharing of these ships prepared to go on their voyage. Also, please answer the poll. I\u0027m sure we are all curios to see what you have achieved.
