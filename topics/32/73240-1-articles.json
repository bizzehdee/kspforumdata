Since Apollo 18 hit the Commodore 64 in 1987, there have been a couple of dozen maybe, often produced by small teams writing for dedicated fans. Microsoft\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s 1994 title Space Simulator was one of the most notable examples, incorporating an array of astrodynamic space mechanics, but the company never produced a sequel.

Here, the player\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s aim is simple; design and construct spacecraft in your own personal space center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you succeed with flight missions, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll accrue more funding and expand your expertise, but the game also acts as completely free sandbox experience with myriad options for inventive design. The possibilities for construction are almost endless, and the most experienced players are able to dock craft in orbit to create space stations, land on the nearby moon, and venture into deep space.

Users began modifying the code and adding new features, and when it was released onto leading PC games platform Steam in spring 2013, it became one of the top five best-selling titles on the site\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cearly access\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 section \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 a huge new audience joined the experiment. Felipe Falanghe, Kerbal\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s creator and lead developer at Squad, has perhaps been surprised by the success of the title, but understands its appeal. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s about seeing your creations explode and trying to figure out why,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 he says. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s about how you can improve the design so it doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t happen again\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 he says. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s about exploring and reaching out to something that was a complete unknown not too long ago.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe success of the game hadn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t gone unnoticed. In March 2013, Squad received an intriguing tweet: \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CInterested in exploring an asteroid with us?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 It was from Nasa, and after a year of cooperation, the Kerbal team was able to implement the real-life Asteroid Redirect Mission into its game. Players can now experiment with a genuine space programme, using Nasa rocket parts. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been a truly amazing experience,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 says Falanghe. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhen we first started, we had very little help from experts, save what we could research on our own.

The public relations boom of the moon landings and the 1980s shuttle programme has long faded, and amid a biting recession, there is apathy and misunderstanding about the organisation. The American public doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t just lack understanding about what Nasa undertakes, it also grossly overestimates the budget it receives from the US government. As recently as 1997, the public estimated that up to 20% of government budget was allocated to Nasa \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 a $328bn injection that would almost certainly have meant a successful manned Mars mission by now. In truth, Nasa has requested a budget of $17.5bn for fiscal 2015. Of that, just $89m is allocated to educating the next generation of astronauts, scientists and engineers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI think it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a shame,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 says Falanghe, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cnot just for Nasa but for mankind in general, that there isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t as much interest in space exploration these days as there should be.

Thomas Pedersen, PhD is lead space strategist at Copenhagen Suborbitals, a non-profit aerospace organisation founded almost as a hobbyist venutre by Kristian von Bengtson and Peter Madsen. Since 2008, the organisation has launched several rockets, funded partly by corporate sponsorship and partly by a group of around 1,000 supporters. There was definitely something game-like about the way the outfit started. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhat is more challenging that starting out completely from scratch, two men with a simple sheet metal workshop at hand and the ambition to send a man on a suborbital trajectory into space?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 asks Pedersen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor him, games have been a key inspiration in his career, not just the worthy simulations, but the more fantastical adventures of galactic exploration. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CGames have gone far beyond [real life] for decades \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 ever since David Braben\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s classic, Elite,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 he says. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CAh, those memories.

It was only after we released we saw players not only liked the orbits, they wanted more of it.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was a turning point for Kerbal, which Falanghe says was not originally intended as an authoritative simulation of space flight, complete with orbiting space stations. After feedback, the design emphasis changed entirely, and a new ethos emerged around progressive learning. With Nasa\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s involvement, Squad has now teamed up with educational specialist TeacherGaming to produce KerbalEdu, a version of the game intended for classrooms, allowing teachers to create set tasks for pupils. The project is in its early stages right now, but TeacherGaming has had huge success with MinecraftEdu, bringing the game to schools around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom space sim to space career\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA career trajectory from interested gamer to space industry expert is one that Falanghe and his team consider plausible. As Squad perfects the balance of education and game, and nurtures its relationship with space organisations around the globe, the team edges closer to that goal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s clearly what Falanghe dreams of: \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIf we hear of a new generation of astronauts and engineers, and a renewed interest in space exploration, and if even one of them was inspired to pursue that career as a result of our little game.
