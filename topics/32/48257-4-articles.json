I haven\u0027t watched too many videos about career mode, so, just taking what I\u0027ve read in this thread, here\u0027s my two cents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree that the message you get in sandbox about science seems a bit... heavy handed, as if they are saying \u0022You\u0027re lame, playing sandbox, too bad\u0022. There should be some kind of message other than, \u0022You can\u0027t do that, you just put a useless hunk of dead weight on your rocket, haha, joke\u0027s on you\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should give you at least some recognition for the feat, but I also don\u0027t think it should be the exact same result you\u0027d get in career. Some kind of funny message, such as \u0022Science module found some dust\u0022, or \u0022Science module reports that the sun does rise here\u0022. I don\u0027t know, maybe those are the kind of messages you get in career mode? I\u0027m kind of trying to stay away from spoilers on that front. I\u0027m not crazy about the science points adding up in sandbox either, unless they are completely off the wall and not at all related to the points you\u0027d get in career.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those saying they want to use sandbox as a simulator, this could work the same way, you\u0027d know your ship works, and gets your science module to the planet/orbit you want to get to, and you\u0027d get an acknowledgement of that fact, but you still wouldn\u0027t know exactly what you\u0027d get until you do it for real in career. Using sandbox to find the \u0022sweet spot\u0022 for getting the most science points in one mission seems a bit cheaty in my book. Knowing you can get a module to the exact spot where you get the most return ahead of time seems to make the whole point of career mode, well, pointless. Sure, IRL space agencies do tons of simulations, but they are just that, simulations. They know about what\u0027s going to happen, as mentioned before, but not the exact results. Now, if career mode opens up more in later versions of the game, where sending an orbiter to a planet first to find the best spots for ground based stations or rovers to land, that would be just great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would even be better if sandbox and career mode had different science results, so no matter how much you do in sandbox, you\u0027d not get the same results as doing it in career.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
