As I\u0027m zooming over the surface, I notice something peculiar: there\u0027s a giant \u0022X-marks-the-spot\u0022 in the terrain! I try to memorize what the terrain surrounding the \u0022X\u0022 looks like, and I quickly send a rover. I land in a nearby flats, forgetting where this rift was to begin with. So I just picked a direction and started roving. Luckily, I chose the right direction, because my path ran right towards the rift! I actually had a pretty close call when nearing the rift and slowing down, my rover barely made the jump from the lower level to the higher level of the rift. This is in \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003EHIGH terrain detail\u003C/span\u003E, I do not know if it still exists in lower levels. \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003ECoordinates for it are 41\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B045\u002751\u0027\u0027S, 63\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B022\u00279\u0027\u0027W\u003C/span\u003E. I\u0027m very surprised that this hasn\u0027t been spotted before. I aptly named it the X-Rift.
