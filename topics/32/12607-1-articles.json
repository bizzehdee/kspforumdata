This is my first post! (and I will do an introduction in the Intro forum eventually). There\\\u0027s a bunch of (small) pictures, so I apologize if it lags your browsers! I wish I was able to record a video of this, but I didn\\\u0027t actually expect to have a successful flight. I have yet to try again, but I\\\u0027ll record it next time. And I\\\u0027m not sure if recording will work because the game already sort of lags when the camera is not looking at the ground/Kerbol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA not-so-little back-story (you can skip ahead, I won\\\u0027t be offended x]):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I just started playing this two to three weeks ago (playing the demo), and only this last weekend that I bought KSP (that snap to angle option is a godsend). I do have some physics background, and I love fighter airplane games and some flight simulators, so this prior knowledge and related experience does help me out a whole lot when I was making the, uh, Spacey series. That\\\u0027s not to say there were a lot of lost Kerman lives for my trial and error (though I do try to get them to at least land and still be alive), but I learned a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I wanted to make something that\\\u0027s visually and functionally close to the Space Shuttle (the Atlantis, Endeavor, Discovery, those shuttles) with stock parts (actually I\\\u0027m not too interested in mods and plugins, so I don\\\u0027t have anything other than stock parts...for now). I had to use structural fuselages that are jettisoned at the start of the launch so the space shuttle setup won\\\u0027t tip over. Came the birth of Spacey 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpacey 1 featured the space shuttle with the avionics package at the nose and 3 LV-T45 Liquid Fuel Engines (mid-size liquid fuel engines) connected by a stack tri-coupler, 7-stack FL-T500 Fuel Tanks (the full-size rocket tank) for launch fuel (as the big orange fuel tank) with 3 RCS thrusters and 2 RCS fuel at the top, and two solid rocket boosters for launching. I do remember seeing someone use the Mk2 or Mk3 fuselages as the big orange fuel tank used in the real space shuttles, but I\\\u0027ve already made and done tests with Spacey 1 before I searched for anyone doing anything similar to what I was doing and I didn\\\u0027t want to change the overall design (plus, the space shuttle that I found in these forums had problems with achieving an orbit, which is probably because of the Mk2/Mk3 fuselages\\\u0027 drag). However, I did have to add a rocket engine at the bottom of the 7-stack because it would immediately pitch at launch otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, Spacey 1\\\u0027s highest height was 5000m before it starts going haywire (the space shuttle\\\u0027s 3 mid-size engine were far too powerful and tended to pitch down a lot, and simply loses control). When I sense it is about to lose control, I just jettison all of the stages and at least be able to land the space shuttle, uh, somewhere. I took this time to practice flight and landing with the space shuttle, but I forgot to put landing gears on it, so I wasn\\\u0027t entirely sure what I was going to do when I\\\u0027m over land. I always landed on water, though, but at all times it splashed down hard. This is when I learned I needed a canard because I couldn\\\u0027t control the shuttle much when it was just gliding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpacey 2\\\u0027s changes from Spacey 1 was the 3 LV-909 Liquid Fuel Engines (small liquid fuel engines) for its main engines, the canards, and the addition of a full-sized tank attached outside of the 7-stack with a liquid fuel engine (I tried all sizes for this but it still ultimately didn\\\u0027t work). This time it achieved 10,000m, but it still pitched down considerably after that height. After trying different configurations of engine sizes for the 7-stack\\\u0027s engine and the extra outward engine and rolled the shuttle during launch to counteract the pitching (like the real space shuttles!), I managed to get to the 70,000m mark, but still no orbit because the shuttle now uncontrollably pitches up and goes out of control when it escapes the atmosphere (no drag on the wings, so that extra outward engine to help counteract the downward pitch in the atmosphere is now making it pitch up too much). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike Spacey 1, I jettison the 7-stack when I know Spacey 2 is not going to achieve orbit and attempt to land the space shuttle. I try to land on the water because I still don\\\u0027t have landing gears (I was just trying to achieve orbit/I keep forgetting until I launch). During these tests is when I learned the dangers of a pair of large canards in the front of the shuttle: when I\\\u0027m falling in the atmosphere at a high speed and usually at a steep angle, the shuttle tends to flip around and approach Kerbol backwards, and it likes to stay that way. Anyway, one time, I was able to land on water and keep the cockpit intact (and the Kerbins alive). The wings, the canards, and the engines were stripped off, but the cockpit and the fuselage were fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I figured I needed to jettison the outward engine when it starts to pitch up (cue is the RCSs trying to counteract the upward pitch), add an SAS to get a bit more stability, and have a one-engine setup for the space shuttle itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe now have Spacey 3: a detachable outward engine, an additional SAS at the top of the 7-stack, a Mk3-to-Mk2 adapter at the back of the space shuttle, and a mid-size liquid fuel engine attached to the adapter. The advantage of the adapter is it holds fuel as well, so I have more fuel while still looking aesthetically nice. After several failed tests, I had one successful full flight, including landing on the runway (failed tests include splashing down too hard, landing on the terrain too hard, flying and crashing backwards, and a stable orbit with no fuel left). With some aggressive controlling, this setup works. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnto the story of Spacey 3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, some pictures of Spacey 3 in the VAB (I don\\\u0027t have any pictures when it was still sitting in the launch pad). The structural fuselages with the radial decouplers on the wings and the stack decoupler on the extra outward engine are only there to keep the shuttle standing on the launch pad. It\\\u0027s detached as soon as the launch starts.

Even with this extra engine, an advanced SAS, and a normal SAS, it still pitches down if left alone, so I hold the pitch-up key pretty much the entire launch. The canards are also there to get better control of the shuttle when gliding, but there is a risk of having the ship flip around and descend backwards when the descend is too fast and too steep (this happened a couple of times in other attempts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first successful orbital journey of Spacey 3!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI rolled right away so I can already start approaching east:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v390/j13jayther/KSP/screenshot5s.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot5s.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESRBs are already gone at this point.

Without this extra engine and the 7-stack still attached, the shuttle pitches down again when we\\\u0027re above the 70,000m mark. There\\\u0027s a little bit of fuel left in the 7-stack, so I use that intermittently to adjust the orbit to be more circular, then I detach the 7-stack and start using the shuttle\\\u0027s fuel to adjust the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome nice views during the orbital flight and the orbital map:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v390/j13jayther/KSP/screenshot8s.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot8s.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v390/j13jayther/KSP/screenshot9s.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot9s.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v390/j13jayther/KSP/screenshot10s.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot10s.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime to decay the orbit and land on the runway!
