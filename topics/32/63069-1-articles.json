However, I only fast-forward months at a time if I\u0027ve got nothing else going on, which is usually only at the beginning of the beginning of the game. See, I send stuff everywhere, and build on previous missions to various places. Thus, I try hard never to let a launch window for any place except Moho go by without sending something there (Moho\u0027s are so frequent you can skip a lot of them). The end result is that before too long, I never have to wait more than a week or 2 for something to happen. If it\u0027s not a launch window (which can be for coming back to Kerbin, not just leaving it), then something will be arriving at its destination or something en route will need to make its mid-course adjustment. In between such events, I play with the stuff already at its destination, mapping planets, doing science, exploration, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T14:08:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz/\u003C/a\u003E to give me the launch windows. I take the phase angle it gives me, and I draw an angle on a sheet of paper. I label Kerbol (The Sun) as the vertex, and the planets on their respective rays. In KSP, I go into map view, set Kerbol as the focus, and put the paper up to the screen, then time warp until they line up. You could eye it, but this way you can make a perfect hohmann transfer, for minimum fuel usage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis method is much, much more efficient then launching out of Kerbin, then fiddling with maneuver nodes until you get an encounter. You will find the maneuver node for the transfer will be in the same position as Kerbin if you would have waited for a launch window.
