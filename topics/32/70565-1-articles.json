The more ion engines you have, the more power structure you need to provide. So the real question is what the TWR of (engine)\u002B(minimum solar to fully power engine) is. I\u0027d mention fuel, but you never stipulated how LONG it had to run for, so one tank for 50\u002B engines is fine, right? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T06:19:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERadial batteries, static solar panels, and cubic octagonal struts are massless, so you can have as many of them in the ship as you want.
