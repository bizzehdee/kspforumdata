Watching it I was reminded of 2001: A Space Oddysey, the opening of the film, if I recall correctly, and I also thought this would make a very nice screensaver. You know, like the fishbowls or fireplaces that were popular for a while, but with more Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I\u0027m writing this I\u0027m realising that this would probably involve booting up the game just to save your screen, but wouldn\u0027t it be cool? Screensaver pops on, Jeb\u0027s floating by calmly, a transfer pod docks at a massive space station, things launch. I\u0027m thinking that would be some great ASMR-stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I haven\u0027t even got the skills to properly think about it, so feel free to steal the idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
