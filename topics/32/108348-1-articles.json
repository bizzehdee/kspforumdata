Has anyone actually attempted Eve yet with the 1.0 overhaul in a return mission of some sorts? I\u0027ve put nearly a 1,000 hours into this game as of today and in the older versions of KSP, I never successfully got a ship to return from Eve, just such a monstrosity of a mission and time consuming to build the appropriate vessel for. I\u0027m wondering if it got easier in the update. I see some people saying it takes less delta V now but I don\u0027t see how that is possible when rockets are now more dramatically affected in atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T04:20:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei bet infinite ladder still works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MisterFister","CreatedById":85686,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T04:28:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m playing hardcore career, and as such, haven\u0027t yet made it out of LKO with about ~45 hours in just since 1.0 release. (I also have several hundred hours from prior to release, as I started back in 0.18.) My instinct is that you\u0027ll need some sort of airfoil lifter design, likely with aerospikes unless you can manage a different engine from a mod (either a kethane jet engine that doesn\u0027t need oxygen, or some super-high-impulse nuclear engine similar to what Scott Manley used a few months ago in 0.25\u0027s ISQ.) I make the suggestions that I do because the two primary problems with an Eve return are the atmospheric density, especially at ASL, and the high gravity. With a wing-lifter design, you can use those in your favor with a TWR \u0026lt;1.2 (Eve is 1.2g, iirc).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fire-Dragon-DoL","CreatedById":113470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T05:15:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUhm, the key point should be using an engineer instead of a pilot (with remote guidance in addition) for the parachutes, refueling directly on eve (possibly sending a veichle AND a spaceship) or maybe composing the spaceship with docking ports directly on eve, I don\u0027t know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m scared, took me a lot of hours of try-die-repeat to go to eve and come back\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd almost a new GPU =S\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xyphos","CreatedById":139010,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T05:29:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been trying to get a Mk3 spaceplane designed for EVE landing and return, but alas, KSP doesn\u0027t have a Mk3 hybrid engine (yet?) and my attempts to SSTO and dock with a refueling station in Kerbin orbit have failed every single time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eperhaps I should model my own engine. it seems like no matter how many RAPIERs I add, it\u0027s never enough to get it in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rhadamant","CreatedById":119663,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T06:25:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done a round trip Eve mission but with some troubles.
