So no more spamming crew reports since you can only hold one and not be able to transmit it without an antenna?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It looks like each capsule has some sort of basic heat shielding, but there doesn\u0027t seem to be any metion of it on the part itself or way of telling how it is working. I launched a capsule about 100km up and brought it down with no heat shield (since you don\u0027t start with any) and it survived. Admittedly, I haven\u0027t really played around much with the actual heat shields, but from what I know, they have a lifespan and if you come in too steep, you can burn them right up. Why no such info for the capsules if they appear to have a basic heat shield?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Also heat shields as \u0022aerodynamic\u0022 parts? Doesn\u0027t make sense to me; they seem more like structural parts in the same way as a stack seperator/decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The camera wobble is nauseating and annoying. That said, I\u0027ll probably get used to it eventually. I know you can adjust it in the settings, so don\u0027t jump all over me about that. I want to try and play this with all the new \u0022features\u0022 to see what I like and what I don\u0027t. For now, I\u0027m not a big fan of the camera wobble, but I\u0027m giving it a chance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Haven\u0027t really played around with the fairings too much yet, but the one time I tried them out, I liked how they worked. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- New aerodynamics haven\u0027t really made an impact on the stuff I build or fly, but I\u0027m still doing very basic stuff. Never was a big spaceplane fan, so not sure how much this will impact me. But I\u0027m flying my rockets same as before without any real issues yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, I\u0027m having fun with 1.0.
