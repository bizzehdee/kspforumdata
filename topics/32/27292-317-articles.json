I was going to do a full powered landing and set it down nice and easy, but something about the orientation of the command seat caused the navball to be off and I couldn\u0027t kill all my horizontal velocity before impact. The top stage and the Kerbal survived, but the Kerbal glitched out and was uncontrollable.
