The reason why i posted this thread is because I\u0027ve suffered a huge disappointment in a game I \u0027ve been waiting for its release for more than 5 years!! during those five years i read every article mentioning it, watching every video demonstrating it, joining every forum talking about it.... the game was:Spore. For every body who hasn\u0027t played it, it;s a game in which you control a life form, starting from a micro single celled organism, to a spacefaring civilization. You can creat and design nearly every thing in the game: creatures, clothes, buildings, vehicles, weapons, even terraform other barren planets and colonize them! There are several planets in your solar system...but there are millions of other planets in the galaxy...you may spend really LONG time visiting just 1/1000000 of all the planets and solar systems....But after i played it i was bored and the game is very monotonous and very childesh cartoony like. also the planets are very repetative in looks, and it\u0027s not hard to find alien races, because you find them too aften without any hardness (which may kill the \u0022achievement feeling\u0022)..the main feature of the game was enabling the player to create and design his own game, which was a great feature, but once you keep playing it for a while you realize that the developers ruined this great feature by making lots and lots of bad updates and tweaks that turned such great game to a huge desappointment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that KSP developers keep up the good work in the coming versions and keep thinking about How Spore failed and try to avoid this scenario.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope they make this in KSP:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Sandbox explorations: not a \u0022mission\u0022 type of a gameplay with limited time, but a free style exploration.
