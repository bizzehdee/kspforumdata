It was really interesting in the very-very beginning. But in 1 flight I got into suborbital flight, then in orbit, and after I got stack decouplers, I sent a Kerbal to M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and home. Then I had to fly to other biomes on Kerbin, and so I got the science canister. After opening the 4th level of science I have almost all I need, except a docking port. But the gameplay starts being really boring, all the same: probe here, probe there. Doesn\u0027t matter if you do smart things and bring stuff back: if you don\u0027t return the science pod back, you just transmit the data from several science tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d change the system a little: science tanks give too much of data right away, while small instruments are still unavailable.
