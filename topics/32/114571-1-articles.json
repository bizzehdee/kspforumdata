It\u0027s hard to say with franchise games that change like Civ but while Civ 5 was pretty rudimentary, Civ 4 was incredibly detailed in micro management. You could play for a very long time and still find things you didn\u0027t know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would have put SimCity as #10, StarCraft doesn\u0027t really have a steep learning curve at all... it has tutorials in-game!
