Things were going fine until it was time for an inclination change, at which point I noticed I had no control over the probe. My solar panels were pointed toward Kerbol, but I had no power. Turns out I had been flying in the shadow of the Mun for a while, and my transfer orbit happened to line the probe up with the Mun rather nicely. I was surprised how long it took to get out of the Mun\u0027s shadow and get some power back. No worries, though, as I still had plenty of time later in the transfer to make adjustments to come in near-polar around Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have also self-shadowed all my solar panels before while in orbit around the Mun, pointing directly away from Kerbol. I had to wait until slightly later in the Mun\u0027s orbit to get a little bit of power and change my probe\u0027s orientation. Modified the probe design so that won\u0027t happen again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Norpo","CreatedById":113342,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-25T15:52:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, something similar happened on my Moho probe mission, the solar panels were the single, non-tracking variety, so as I was going to burn the Moho Inclination Change burn, I wasn\u0027t facing the sun, and the probe had no power.
