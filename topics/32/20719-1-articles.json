I have a battleship-class vessel, complete with four rotating deck guns. My only issue is trying to get her afloat. I\u0027ve tried launching it from the shore, but that only brought about catastrophic failure, as the ship capsized upon entering the water at an angle. Plan B was to try launching the ship upwards, and parachute it safely into the ocean, but the shear size and weight of the ship makes this impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recently tried editing the coordinates in the persistent.sfs file, so that the ship would simply translate to a position in the water and begin its flight there. I launched the boat in-game, left it sitting on the runway, and exited KSP. I edited the longitude in the persistent.sfs (with Notepad), saved the file, and re-launched KSP. I resumed the flight through the tracking station, and the boat was now floating on the surface of the ocean just east of the launchpad. Except the flight was unresponsive; I could not throttle, engage stages, or EVA/IVA. I was only forced to end the flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone some advice/insight to offer on the subject? I\u0027ve a bit of a challenge set in front of me and I\u0027ve reached the last page in my book of ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl,dr: My boat won\u0027t float.
