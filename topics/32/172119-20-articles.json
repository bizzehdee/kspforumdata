Licensing a song on iTunes and buying a vinyl record of the same song carry completely different entitlements. The difference is owning a copy that belongs to you, vs owning a licence to have copy that does not belong to you but that you are \u003Cu\u003Eallowed\u003C/u\u003E to possess and use by the IP owner.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou might be right locally.

It represents a distinct departure in substantive commercial exchange (as claimed by the EULA writers) even though superficially it appears almost identical to traditional \u0022own a physical copy of media on which a copy of IP has been transcribed.\u0022 It is certainly true that physical media do not last forever; so the traditional dimensions of access to copyrighted material bear some similarity to these more contemporary assertions in so many EULAs. Meaning: CDs/DVDs/Vinyls/VHS tapes/even books WEAR OUT. No court in the world would ever argue that the IP owner was required to provide a replacement copy once the media itself wore out. But that is a rather different constraint than one in which the IP owner specifies in the EULA that they can cease to provide access at any time and for any reason. If book publishers or traditional vinyl producers included substances in their media which cause the ink to fade or the engravings to crumble after X period of time, I don\u0027t think that would have been deemed legal. It was understood: you purchased one copy and you get to keep it for as long as the media is intact, thus \u0022collectors.\u0022 That is a very different kettle of fish than \u0022you get one copy for as long as we choose to provide it.\u0022 The latter would facilitate utterly capricious and unfair practices on the part of IP owners, and it would set a precedent which would be devastating to commerce of copyrighted material. If a case established that an IP owner could in fact provide a digitally distributed copy of a work with a proviso stating that they can withdraw services at any time and for any reason, thus depriving purchasers of any access to the product they paid for, it would spawn a brief period of rampant abuse and exploitation globally. Fly-by-night organizations selling units at ridiculously low prices would be opening like tulips in the spring, customers flocking to them and shoveling lucre at them; and once they had reaped what they deemed sufficient revenue, they would pull the plug and leave all those users high and dry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is not to say that, I expect any court of law would hold that Steam is bound to provide eternal access to all of us to our libraries. If they go out of business, or sell their business or experience any manner of other changes to their operations, it is of course reasonable that the nature of their services to us users might necessarily change. But again, that is also a different kettle of fish, and I reckon that if litigation ensued, most courts anywhere on Earth would recognize the precedent established by the pre-digital download age, and thus reach a finding which was at a middle-ground between the interests of consumers and the service providers. Many of us retain copies of some portion of our libraries on our own media, and were it not for \u0022auto-update\u0022 and similar client-server handshake features (which btw, are completely optional it seems even within Steams terms with the publishers they serve,\u00A0 Paradox titles acquired through Steam\u00A0for example function normally once they are installed and undergo initial validation, whether Steam is installed in the games environment or not, or so I\u0027m told by various websites I\u0027ve perused . . .) we would all have the unfettered capacity to \u0022own\u0022 copies of those games with just as much (if not more) perpetuity than traditional corporal media-based distributions. Steam would thus have an uphill battle with most reasonable courts (and definitely the more consumer-indulgent ones in the EU) to argue that they are justified to \u0022pull the plug\u0022 either without warning, or without provisions for users to retain their own personal copies. Moreover it would be child\u0027s play for them to do so. They simply make it known that services will terminate at some point in the future (perhaps the most difficult part for them) and then the include in all subsequent Steam updates external files that disable the functionalities which prevent games from operating without the client-server handshake. I have to be slightly vague here because, I have not spent the time to fully understand how these functionalities work, but I am confident based on what investigation I have done, it would be perfectly simple for Steam to accomplish. They could do it RIGHT NOW and we could all download all of our games, delete our Steam accounts and \u0022own copies\u0022 of all our games just as if we had purchased them on traditional DVDs. The technicalities are absolutely accessible.

I don\u0027t even have the latest version of the game installed. I think I had version 1.28 or something along those lines? I have an enormous number of mods that I knew would break when 1.3 was released, so I simply \u0022bypass\u0022 Steams client-handshake nonsense. Even if they were to make it more intrusive than it already is, it could still be bypassed. The files that control these functionalities are, if I understand correctly, not baked into the executables; this is why third-party launchers are able to \u0022fool\u0022 the client-server handshake and launch the applications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of the games in my Steam library which are installed on my local machine have \u0022Auto-Update\u0022 set to \u0022Disabled.\u0022 I only leave this functionality active for games like Stellar Tactics or Freeman: Guerrilla Warfare, which are still in very early alpha, and consequently I generally will WANT any updates the publisher pushes through Steam. This combined with keeping Steam in Offline Mode 97.5% of the time, means that anything TT or Squad, Steam or any other party involved in the products I own say or do is largely irrelevant to me. I OWN copies of the software on which their IP is transcribed. I will NOT engage in any usage which would be deemed illegal by a 1990s court of law, but I\u0027m not required to log in and update my software to their latest version simply because they expect me to do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless Steam wishes to shift its position from \u0022questionable distributor of intrusive software which some might argue borders on malware\u0022 into fullfledged \u0022malware distributor,\u0022 they have zero capacity to enforce anything beyond the terms of \u0022traditional\u0022 pre-digital download EULAs, i.e., they CANNOT \u0022take away\u0022 my access to their \u0022service\u0022 nor can they impose new terms of service on my possession or use of services which were originally procured with a different set of ToS. That is the reality; and as I said in a preceding post, here we are, loyal, law-abiding, supportive customers and fans of the IP and its creators (if not also its publishers and distributors) and WE are the ones who are made to \u0022jump through these hoops.\u0022 Meanwhile the pirate sites continue to run business as usual.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I contrast this with how small \u0022cottage\u0022 industry outfits operate (take for example Mojang in its early days or John Tiller Software as it has always existed and right up to this day and a host of other small fry developer/publisher IP owners) the only conclusion I can reach is that: lawyers will barge in with fear mongering and gain a toehold in any organization that exceeds some minimal threshold in head count or total annual throughput of money. In confederation with managerial or even technical managers who understand how they might personally gain by saddling the organization with byzantine legalese wards of protection and strange click-wrap rituals of end user licensing these kinds of things are inevitable once a product gets \u0022big\u0022 and the vultures in suits start circling.
