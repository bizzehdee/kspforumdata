The first stage was powered by a LFB KR 1x2 \u0022Twin-Boar\u0022 Liquid Fuel Engine. The second stage was powered by a RE-I5 \u0022Skipper\u0022 Liquid Engine. These engines were selected because my previous v0.90 tests found them to be an ideal pairing for a two-stage rocket. The first stage included four AV-R8 Winglets and the second stage included an Advanced Reaction Wheel Module, Large. Both stages included a Rockomax Brand Decoupler.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe payload was just a dummy mass with a RC-L01 Remote Guidance Unit and Protective Rocket Nose Mk7. The test payload provided good drag characteristics, but not optimum. Actual performance will vary depending on the drag characteristics of your specific payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo the first and second stages I added propellant tanks in various sizes and quantities until I found the ideal combination that maximized performance according to three different modes of measurement. First, I found the configuration that resulted in the lowest total \u0394v. Second, I found the configuration that resulted in the highest payload fraction. And third, I found the configuration that resulted in the lowest cost per unit mass of payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tests were performed using a computer simulation rather than performing test flights within the game. This eliminated unwanted human error and variation in performance. The tests launches were performed under carefully controlled and ideal conditions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn all cases, the payload mass was found experimentally as the mass that resulted in 100% of the propellant being used to achieve a 75 km circular orbit. The payload includes everything not described above as being as part of the first and second stages. Thus, a fairing, if used, is counted as payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ascent profile consisted of a slow gradual turn beginning after 100 meters of climb. The launch vehicle maintained a constant negative angle of attack throughout the turn. The angle of attack was found experimentally as the angle required to produce the most efficient ascent and to deliver the maximum payload mass to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy tests show that high thrust-to-weight ratio is best for minimizing the \u0394v required to attain orbit, while low thrust-to-weight ratio is best for minimizing the cost per tonne of payload. This is because lower TWR is obtained by simply adding more propellant tanks on top of a given engine. The engine is already paid for, so our marginal cost is only that of the relatively cheap propellant and tankage. With more propellant we can launch a heavier payload. It is found that the cost per tonne of payload goes down as more and more propellant is added. Although unit cost goes down, the vehicle becomes less efficient in terms of \u0394v. We can only add so much propellant before the vehicle becomes so inefficient that unit cost begins to rise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow are the results of my simulations. Although there is an almost unlimited number of launch vehicle configurations that you can come up with, the data below might help in establishing some general design guidelines. Note that this is theoretically ideal conditions; actual in game performance is likely to be lower. Cost is for the launch vehicle only, payload is extra.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan

I only tested one design, which is shown below:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022LauncherSRBs.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.braeunig.us/pics/KSP/LauncherSRBs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wanted a design that made extensive use of solids so we could really see how much of a difference it made in comparison to an all-liquid design. As you can see, I went with six SRBs. Two of the six are set to 100% thrust and burn out after about 42 seconds. The other four SRBs are set to 50.5% thrust and burn out after about 84 seconds. The center sustainer engine is a \u0022Skipper\u0022. All engines and motors ignite at liftoff. The top propellant tank is just ballast to simulate a payload (the propellant is not used).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough I\u0027ve test flown this vehicle in the game, the data that I report here is from the same computer simulation used when recording my opening findings. The results should be comparable. In the game, the test vehicle flew well and was easy to control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis time I didn\u0027t bother optimizing for \u0394v because I see no practical reason why anyone would want to do so. There was very little difference between the payload fraction optimized and the cost optimized versions\u00A0- the cost optimized version had just one small additional propellant tank. (The picture shows the payload optimized version.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is no surprise that with the lower performing solid propellant, the payload fraction of the SRB launcher is significantly less than that of the all-liquid design. I am surprised, however, to discover that the SRB launcher is more expensive per tonne of payload. One of the main reasons for this appears to be because of the large amount of \u0022extras\u0022 needed, such as decouplers, nose cones, struts, etc. If we add up the cost of just the propellant, tanks, engines and SRBs, then the SRB launcher is less expensive - 917/t vs. 1035/t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fleet of launchers that I used prior to version 1.0 typically delivered payloads to orbit less expensively when solids were used. I assume the results that I\u0027m now seeing are due to the rebalancing that has taken place since v0.90. Of course, it\u0027s also likely that a more cost effective SRB design can be found than the sample tested here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are the test
