I\u0027ve also got a fuel station and mining outpost on Moho, along with one en route to Dres and another one planned for Eeloo (fully designed but not launched yet due to my tugs being needed for higher-priority missions) but those are mainly to support missions to those planets themselves, since their inclinations make them unsuitable as stopping points for longer journeys.

In the stock system (or in any system which doesn\u0027t move Kerbin or its moons around) Minmus is obviously best for refuelling, but the Mun is perhaps preferable for a general-purpose station if you\u0027re doing something like NASA\u0027s deep space gateway for training crew and such. Alternatively, for the Jool system in particular, Bop is pretty good but Laythe is probably preferable if you\u0027re able to build a fairly large cargo spaceplane since Jool missions will spend most of their fuel on the inner three moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn New Horizons (see the diagrams below for the locations I\u0027m talking about), I\u0027m probably going to build such a station around Serran to practice for long-duration missions, and excursions on large atmospheric worlds, because Serran is the most distant moon of Sonnah (making it far enough for long-term missions but also accessible enough to be practical) and the only one other than Kerbin with an atmosphere. It\u0027ll also serve as a spaceport for testing experimental spaceplanes destined for Laythe and Asclepius, since conveniently Serran\u0027s atmosphere allows jet engines to work (unless that\u0027s been changed).
