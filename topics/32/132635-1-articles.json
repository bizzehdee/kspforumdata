As career players know these sort of contracts require you to visit several small areas in a cluster while carrying a specific piece of equipment. Thus you need to not only land on the planet but aim your landing, and then travel horizontally somehow. Of course the easy method is to install the right mod, or build a tiny rover, but here at KSP we don\u0027t do things because they\u0027re easy. So I\u0027ve designed a high lift rocket powered aircraft. I\u0027ve tested on Kerbin, but not Eve. To be honest although I\u0027ve logged many hours in KSP I have yet to fly an aircraft to or on another planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe high gravity of Eve and Jool multiply your weight, and thus the needed lift and thus presumably the size of your wings. In addition you can\u0027t use jet engines. Though any rocket plane will still have less range than the equivalent jet plane, or a plane using a electric engine from a mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEve has a notoriously thick atmosphere which I believe will increase the lift provided by the wings, but also increase drag, making high speed travel impractical. Though I do believe a slower craft with an excessive number of wing parts could maximize the advantage of lift and minimize the disadvantage of drag. A rocket powered craft should glide most of the time, and only use low throttle bursts to maintain speed without losing altitude, and also during take off and turns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn Duna, I am guessing the reverse would be true. There will be low drag, but also low lift. You could compensate with extra wings, but I would imagine a better solution would be to throttle up your rocket engines and travel at high speed in a quasi-ballistic arc. The orbit line need not reach your destination, but you ought to travel fast enough to make it visible. High speed increases lift which will help you stay aloft, but you will still be burning plenty of rocket fuel. Stopping might be tricky, but will either require excessive parachutes or excessive turning ability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaythe, so I\u0027ve read, makes flyign easy. With low gravity, and a similar atmosphere anything that can fly on Kerbin will fly better on Laythe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJool would be similar to Eve except that landing is obviously not an option, and returning from low altitude flights is barely an option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a related note, how does one deliver a flyer into space in the first place? The most obvious answer is to make a capable space plane, but I don\u0027t have to in game technology or the personal KSP experience for a space plane, and I don\u0027t want to borrow someone else\u0027s design. Straping two planes to a mother ship is easy enough, but launching it from the KSC launch pad seem to require that the drag producing wings are near the bottom, but also requires that it can jettison stages at various points in flight without anything impacting the wings, which ofcourse extend fairly far. With nuclear engines, a sufficiently large mothership can make the journey and drop off the flyers at low orbit, though I wonder if there are any tricks for staying intact on the way down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously I am most interested in the situation I\u0027ve described but I also wanted to open up to discussion to flight that utilizes the atmosphere of other planets, and also getting an aircraft from the KSC to another planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-21T14:36:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0The atmosphere on eve\u00A0is five times thicker but the gravity is not five times greater you really should be able to get away with Lesswing.

That\u0027s indeed only works if you don\u0027t plan to jettison the lower parts before getting to orbit, but if the plane is small enough, this method doesn\u0027t need too high tech. I had a working design where I jettison the upper parts of the rocket - that\u0027s a bit tricky: you need to pitch away from prograde for a short while, so the debris doesn\u0027t hit anything. The higher you are, the easier it gets. A separatron or two could also help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the easiest solution is to just radially attach boosters to a single plane.

So... if you aren\u0027t happy with the performance of a rocket glider on kerbin, don\u0027t expect to be happy with it on Eve. You won\u0027t even be able to climb nearly as high, and since you\u0027ll have basically the same glide ratio, you won\u0027t go nearly as far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe really should have some electric fans, or air augmented rockets/ramrockets for this planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Duna\u0027s atmosphere is so thin, that LV-Ns work at near optimum Isp. Its atmosphere is denser than you\u0027d expect based on the pressure reading because (like eve) the MW of the gas is higher. You don\u0027t have to use such copious amounts of fuel to fly on Duna... due to its low orbital velocity, you won\u0027t need as much lift as you start travelling at speeds that are a significant fraction of orbital velocity. A LV-N at 800 Isp will use roughly 3x more liquid fuel than a rapier powered space plane on Kerbin (3200 Isp) for the same thrust, and its static TWR is actually comparable to a rapier\u0027s static TWR on kerbin (~6.5 static for the LV-N on Duna, 5.35 static for the rapier on Kerbin), but LV-N powered spaceplanes are fine.... as are Poodles if you want more TWR. I haven\u0027t used nukes much as I described since i use a modded electric propulsion, but I have made working designs that cruise on LV-Ns in 1.05, though I prefer to just get to orbit, or to have a design that I don\u0027t worry about fueling if I\u0027m not aiming for orbit. In my stock duna spaceplane, I ascend in basically a ballistic arc, but then steer and can extend my trajectory with wings when I deorbit and try to land in a specific area, then I pop chutes for a tail sitting landing. The wings in this case are also critical for allowing the design to even slow down enough to deploy drogues and main chutes before it smacks into terrain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, consider lift rockets and retrorockets which I\u0027ve also tried and had success with (thought I prefer the simplicity of vtols). You shouldn\u0027t neccessarily try to pack on enough chutes or wings to allow you to make a completely unpowered landing... if you only need to reduce parachute descent velocity by 10 m/s... the mass in fuel needed for that is negligible, and for most longer ranged flights, you\u0027ll use more fuel just carrying the extra mass of chutes or airbrakes or wings or whatever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022SWancGN.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022623\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SWancGN.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPre-1.0, if it flew on kerbin, it flew on laythe even better... because it was 80% the atmospheric density and 80% the gravity. So you\u0027d have the same landing speeds (80% lift needed due to lower gavity, 80% lift given by wings due to lower atmospheric pressure). So it would be the same take off and landing speeds, but you\u0027d have a 25% better TWR (and slightly better Isp for rockets).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow its 60% atmospheric pressure at sea level, 80% gravity. As jet thrust declines with atmospheric pressure, this means your jet engine craft will generally have worse sea level TWRs (while rockets will do even better due to 80% gravity and higher thrust as they get more thrust as it gets closer to a vacuum)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022THsiqdx.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/THsiqdx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny engine with a value of less than 1.33 at 0.6 atms will have a worse TWR on laythe than on Kerbin. Note that the real thrust curves are cubic splines that fit those points, so I think the real Juno values are under 1.33 at 0.6 atm. So... just the afterburning panther will do a little better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had seaplanes that took off of Kerbin\u0027s oceans easily enough, but wouldn\u0027t lift off from Laythe... although with minor tweaks I was able to get them to liftoff, it was still a much harder process with narrower margins.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA jool ascent is much harder than an eve ascent. Take an eve lander... then make an eve lander that can lift that first eve lander, then strap on wings and try to fly that.... not going to happen.
