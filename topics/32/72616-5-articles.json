There was no moon and no stars. It really felt like a god was creating the universe step by step: first there was directed light (which meant that no one was able to see big parts of Kerbin for a few weeks, at least not in sunlight). Then they added rotation, then the Mun, the universe skybox, the sun (yes, in that order. First we had light, then a sun), the atmosphere got multiple layers and was made less dense, then Minmus was added and a whole solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember that the Universe skybox was one major step ahead, because it allowed at least some kind of orientation. Navigating without an orbital map (and of course any navigation point) and without any point of orientation (everything dark around you, especially behind Kerbin) is really irritating.

So I promptly built a small ship with a liquid upper and solid lower stage, which got up to about 15 kilometers when the engine burned out. I added MOAR FUELS to it, and succeeded in reaching space. At that point, I left the game to read some tutorials, and learned of the Mun. I promptly decided I was going to land something there. So I built a stupidly large rocket (remember, I hadn\u0027t orbited yet), and lifted off for the Mun- only to realize I put an SAS on the wrong side of a decoupler. It didn\u0027t go very farther. I then tried to orbit after yet more tutorials, and succeded with a design I named the \u0022K-1\u0022, a simple number with upper stage and tricoupled lower stage, no boosters. I was filled with excitement after I watched my crew float down from orbit in the night sky... and then they exploded on landing.
