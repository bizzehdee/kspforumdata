Since I\u0027m a relatively new player (and a complete newb on the forums) I thought I\u0027d give my perspective after playing with the new update. I started playing KSP in late August, early September, so before the update I played for about a month and a half. That said I\u0027m a bit addicted so I\u0027ve played a lot in that time. So far I haven\u0027t tried any mods and I\u0027m just playing the stock game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInitial Rection\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, if I hadn\u0027t lurked on the forums and watched some youtube videos I wouldn\u0027t have had a clue at all about how to do science. As it is my research let me know that I could take samples from the launchpad and do other experiments without flying at all which got me started and let me learn the ropes. For now I\u0027d recommend new players start playing in sandbox mode since the science is still pretty opaque, but I assume that this will change as career mode is fleshed out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tech tree is decidedly odd in places and doesn\u0027t always make logical sense, but it is a gameplay mechanic so some artistic license is to be expected. I didn\u0027t find it overly difficult or overly easy to unlock nodes, but as I progressed I started unlocking nodes much faster than I could use the parts in them. There were parts (like the sepratron) that I\u0027d never used in sandbox mode and I had assumed that I\u0027d find a use for in career mode, but they flew by so quickly I didn\u0027t really need them. This may change as other aspects of career mode place more constraints on the game (escape towers?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found some of the messages about storing samples confusing. I only found out that I could store multiple EVA reports for different biomes stored in one capsule by reading the forums. Had I known I would have spammed the radio less. The distinction between a crew report and an EVA report is also a bit hazy and confusing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESAS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve only tried the SAS in the demo, 0.21 and now 0.22 and I must say my favourite was 0.21. It might be because I use a joystick (I bought it just for KSP). With the new SAS my ship bounces around a lot more and I have to give more jerky input on the joystick like I did when I was using the keyboard and \u0027feathering\u0027 the input. I like the joystick because it lets me give very small steady inputs, but the new SAS doesn\u0027t seem to like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECollecting Science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do like that the science doesn\u0027t interfere with the open nature of the game. Science is plentiful enough that I don\u0027t have to extract every last drop of it and I can still pick what missions I do to collect it. It feels right that science isn\u0027t something that I can exhaust in an area since it\u0027s not a crop. That said, my OCD kicks in, and when on a mission I find it hard to not transmit repeatedly until I\u0027ve exhausted an experiment in the current biome. Even though I chose to do this it does become tedious. I stopped reading the science text and just kept retransmitting until I got a 0.1 return value. Making multiple flights to extract the same information seems like a waste of fuel, and a big part of space flight is about being efficient, so there is a gameplay mechanic that encourages this spamming in addition to my OCD. I agree with other players suggestions that fewer transmissions be required to extract all of the science and that there be two pools of science points per experiment, one that can be transmitted and one that must be returned to make sample return more valuable. (Though requiring sample return for a thermometer reading does seem pretty weird).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinding Science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinding biomes on Kerbin and the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn from orbit did add a sense of exploration to the quest for science. This got tedious as well, but I feel that was due to the repeated transmissions, not having to search. Putting myself in an inclined orbit that swept a lot of the terrain below was interesting and seeing the world scroll by below was pretty neat. I could spot the different biomes from space, but I only knew they existed because of information I read in the forums. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like having to \u0027search\u0027 for the biomes and wouldn\u0027t want it changed so that I started the game with a global map of where all of the science and biomes are. It would feel too much like just picking stuff up and that doesn\u0027t really seem right for \u0027science\u0027 even if it is just a technology currency. That said I think some mapping tools would make exploring the biomes more rewarding and fun. I looked into the persistent file and noticed that each science report contains the planet and biome where it was made. If it also contained the lat/lon these could be plotted on a 2D planetary map (or the 3D map) so that I could see where I hadn\u0027t explored yet. (I\u0027m assuming there will also eventually be a UI that lists all of the science collected without looking in the persistent file).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make hidden science easier to discover early scientific discoveries could lead to more science (which is how real science works after all). For instance an initial EVA report could tell me that scientists would like to have EVA reports from orbit over different areas (one of the current M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn reports suggests landing in craters, another could suggest observing them from orbit to indicate that they are separate biomes). I should be able to learn how the science system works by using it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother enhancement to science discovery would be an active mapping tool that would help discover biomes. Essentially it would be an instrument that I could activate and would do EVA reports constantly for me, and update a biome map of the areas I had covered in a \u0027fog of war\u0027 style. I could review this map and see which areas of the planet I had \u0027explored\u0027 by orbiting. Instead of showing every EVA report created by the auto map I\u0027d only see the unique ones. By checking the map I could see where EVA reports suggested a sample landing. It would also be cool to see the pattern of my orbits painted on the map as I filled in areas :-) Different mapping tools could detect different science targets, so it would be worth scanning again when I had different technology (i.e.: a satellite camera would detect biomes that were good targets for sample return, later I could return with a gravity meter and detect areas worth sending a seismograph to.) This way there would always be new areas worth exploring and I wouldn\u0027t be stabbing in the dark. The map views would have to allow different \u0027coverage\u0027 overlays to allow science reports and coverage maps from different scanners to be displayed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis kind of mapping could prove useful for other aspects of gameplay such as using a radar map to find level landing sites (I often don\u0027t realize I\u0027m landing on a hill until it\u0027s too late) or to detect resources (don\u0027t know if this is how kethane works or not).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother twist to make discovering science more interesting would be to randomly upgrade several biomes in the solar system when a new game is started. This would be superficially similar to the original biome but would have a much higher rate of return for surface samples or ground experiments. The orbital EVA report could hint that the scientists want a sample from that particular biome. For instance \u0022This mountain looks like it\u0027s made of quartzite. A sample of those rocks would help us understand how the area formed.\u0022 or \u0022The gravity of this crater indicates that the ground is particularly dense. It would be an interesting place to locate a seismometer\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts On Overall Direction\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s hard to evaluate career mode overall at this point since it\u0027s obviously not complete. This makes it hard to comment on the balance of the science system or the tech tree without knowing how they will be affected by money, government, public opinion, kerbonaut management, etc. What I can say is where I\u0027d like to see it go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the brilliant aspects of KSP is that there\u0027s so much to do - there\u0027s literally an entire (small) solar system to explore. If I decided I want to land on Duna it\u0027s challenging because of the way the game models the orbital mechanics. If I then want to get a sample return from Duna\u0027s poles that mission has it\u0027s own challenges. Neither of these missions had to be coded by the devs, but they\u0027re both challenging and interesting in their own way because of the constraints imposed by the games physics model. In a sense there\u0027s an infinite number of these \u0027procedural missions\u0027 that are challenging and rewarding without having to be individually crafted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my mind the goal of career mode (and science in particular) is to steer me towards these missions and challenges without (excessively) limiting my choices. If I\u0027m a Manley man I can choose to fly to Jool from tier 1 of the tech tree, or I can build and learn slowly with other missions nearer to Kerbal. But the extra limits imposed by career mode give me an increasingly difficult set of goals to work towards like landing or observing new areas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s pretty much what I was doing in sandbox before 0.22. I did return missions to Minmus, the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, Duna and one way trips to Eve and Jool as well as building a space station in Kerbin orbit. I did these things to figure out how to do them and learn skills such as transfer orbits and docking, but I didn\u0027t do any of them particularly well (it\u0027s amazing what a few orange tanks will do). I intend to revisit each of these missions being more efficient with my delta V (and hence my costs) by refining my ship design and my transfer orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think it matters if the game starts with probes or with Kerbonauts, but there should be times when it makes sense to use probes instead of Kerbals. There should be a reason to build a space station, a reason to build a surface base, a reason to do fuel transfer, and a reason to use almost every one of the stock parts. Elements such as resource mining that radically change the way you reach distant planets (by eliminating the need to boost fuel out of Kerbins gravity well) should be introduced late in the game once the solar system has been explored traditionally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think that the game needs to mirror the history of terrestrial space programs (all of which are under performing for various reasons compared to predictions when we first put men on the moon) but career mode should create similar constraints and opportunities for the player. There\u0027s a reason we\u0027ve sent many probes to Mars but no humans. It\u0027s very expensive and dangerous to send humans to Mars. And while Kerbals may have little regard for safety (green goo) it\u0027s still easier to send a probe to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn than a Kerbal because life support is heavy, complex to develop, and expensive. If the game ever gets life support then I imagine that the first tier should be enough to let a Kerbal breathe for a few hours (like a scuba tank) for suborbital, or brief orbital flights but not enough to get to another planet or moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn summary, I\u0027d like to see career mode progress to where it preserves the open nature of the game, but offers the player new and interesting challenges that encourage the player to explore all of the aspects of their space program. Ideally the player should still choose the challenges. There\u0027s a balance to be struck between gameplay, realism and breadth, and also between having goals and preserving the players free choice. I hope that the devs have a vision similar to mine and are heading towards taking career mode in this direction by expanding the science and tech in the ways I\u0027ve outlined or that they have better ideas that achieve the same goals. I\u0027ve been blown away but the depth and breadth of what they\u0027ve produced so far and already feel that I\u0027ve got more than my money\u0027s worth, so the future is just gravy. Not only am I having fun I\u0027m learning a lot. :-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MythicLionMan","CreatedById":90146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T03:25:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mr. Scruffy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mr. Scruffy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout kerbal skills: I think most games make a big mistake when it comes to experience-accumulation - they reward success, instead of failure. But it is from our failures from which we learn most (if we survive them, that is). Piling experience on top of game-progress for success, while giving none for failure just leads to \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4save-scumming\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 and the degeneration of any skill-based random element (take spells or mixing potions in Elder Scrolls, as an example), in general. Considering that building rockets will at some point cost you credits (or some other in-game currency), your pilots should gather most experience (in \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4atmospheric piloting\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 anyways) if their rocket goes to a thousand pieces before even reaching space - if they survive.

I always have an internal debate about whether or not I should revert a launch or restore a save. I justify reverting as a \u0027simulator run\u0027 but I like the idea of having to fix my mistakes occasionally. Penalizing people for restoring saves usually doesn\u0027t go down well, so rewarding them for not saving is a great idea. And learning from mistakes just makes so much sense.

Maybe not so much as success, but in such a way to discourage me from reloading a quicksave or relaunching the mission. After all, if I fly a mission so poorly that my little probe rover ends up an impact crater on Minmus, some data should have been learned in the moments before impact that teach the Kerbals something, anything, about what not to do.

Why are you guys letting 3d modelers have a field day and make everything all realistic and nondescript? I enjoyed the game more when i first got it! You are losing the simplicity and charm of the original concept! The updates are inexorably pulling towards an unartistic escalation of detail with no design. The new buildings have no character, even though they have all those tiny prickly details and little lights. Whoopty-doo!
