Sent a rocket similar to those the OP made straight up and it hit an apoapsis of 95k before running out of fuel. Maxed out at around 950 m/s too. Then I sent another with the two nose cones on the bottom like the OP did, and it maxed out at 305k and around 1300 m/s. Crazy.\n\nCan\u0027t really test how a rocket engine would affect it sadly, as there are none that come close to matching the radials in TWR/Isp and the drag created by the radials is also an issue. The skipper seemed the closest match, but that required throwing fins on in place of the radials and limiting the thrust to 73% to match the TWR of the radials. Still not really a good match though, as there are too many variables.

So the destabilizing effects of boattails are modeled. Recall that stability lies in having the CoM above the aerodynamic center; if you decrease the drag of the tail of the vessel, that moves the aerodynamic center up (because, well, the AC is the center of all aerodynamic forces, and you just decreased the forces at the bottom)."},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T21:08:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well, when an object (in this case a rocket) passes through the air it pushes air around itself leaving a zone of low pressure behind.

It doesn\u0027t require any large-scale vortices for this effect to occur.\n\nWhat you are trying to describe is called \u0022form drag\u0022 or \u0022pressure drag\u0022. When you push a solid object through the air, the air in front gets squished, giving it a high pressure. In a completely inviscid flow, this pressure is recovered at the back, and the net effect is no drag. But real air is not inviscid. In real air, the flow does not completely fill in at the back. Instead, a boundary layer forms around the object, and this boundary layer prevents the freestream flow from completely closing at the back. So you have low pressure at the back and high pressure at the front. The difference between the two is a net force from the pressure: drag.\n\nThe more that you leave a blunt surface at the back, the more that you get a big area of low pressure pulling back on you. Or another way to put it, the bigger of a hole that you punch through the air. A shape like an airfoil, however, gives the air a chance to fill in behind your object without leaving a huge hole of low pressure. That\u0027s why an airfoil shape has less drag than other shapes. It\u0027s also why airfoils have a sharp and pointing trailing edge.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T21:16:06Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 09:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mikegarrison**"}]}
