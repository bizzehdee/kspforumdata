You could always have a detachable probe, that isn\u0027t really seperate... With ISRU, you\u0027ll land, and can launch in a polar orbit to pick it up (and you can plan for a polar insertion for the same dV as a non-polar one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, it would be nice to get partial scans from non-polar orbits\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.
