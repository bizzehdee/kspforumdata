If they are releasing a 640bit version then that means they have done work to make sure that those 28% of players won\u0027t see those crashes: they would have had to test, track down bugs, fix any 64-bit-hostile code, and test again.

They have wanted to release a 64-bit version for a long time: it just took this long for Unity to get their act together and build a game engine that is reliable enough that Squad can generate working code code.

Like there was talk of small cleanup and fixes the day I was hired back in May 2013. (I\u0027ve been here over a year now, wow) but due to the significantly higher expectations that the community has taken over our development, we felt 64 bit was still rather unstable and not really ready to be brought kicking and screaming into the public eye. Work continued on and off, with the release of 23.5 marking another \u0027yeah its not really showable yet\u0027. Yet here you came! Enterprising and quite the explorer like most of our players seem to be, and you figured out how to access the work that had been done on the 64 bit client without having to wait for us to make it public.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thread has been monitored constantly and quietly since you showed it to the world, and the response was far beyond our expectations.
