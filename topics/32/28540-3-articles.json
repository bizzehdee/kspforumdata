Not really sure what is causing it since no one else seems to have placed any compaints so far. I put my rover on the Mun and it did not behave according to the laws of physics at all. The wheels simply could not get any traction and just spun despite clearly being on the ground ... oh, and breakdancing all over the place. This is the first one I built without a probe core (thanks seats!) so perhaps some other kinks need to be worked out. I\u0027ll probably put SAS on the next one and see if that\u0027s the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, I LOVE the new update. The flags are as awesome (and as simple) as I could have hoped, seats are there, but what really stands out for me are the changes visually. They\u0027ve clearly done more work on the lighting engine, the addition of normal mapping and additional texture layers make it much easier to visually gauge how far from the ground you are, and just looks good. I know this isn\u0027t final, and that\u0027s the best part, these small changes add up in a big way, I can\u0027t wait for it all to become even better!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nubcaker","CreatedById":63205,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T23:24:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks to the update, my game runs better than ever.
