Or try, at least. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI took one to explore Eve, one to send data back from Jool, one to take readings around Mun, and one to scout some areas on Minmus via rover. Naturally I launched them all pretty much at once, and royally screwed up the Mun mission (lucky for me also the cheapest) twice. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the Eve and Jool transfer Windows are still about 120 and 200 days away respectively, the Minmus and Mun missions had a schedule conflict, so I babysat the longer burning and more expensive (and manned) Minmus mission, then made corrections on the Mun mission. But then I screwed up the Mun mission and ran out of fuel before I could get into the right orbit because of the corrections and late burns. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I sent a second one directly after which was looking good until I went to adjust my Mun approach and realized I hadn\u0027t opened the solar panels so I watched it crash into the surface. The third one I got right so far. The Minmus mission is already touched down and underway. Sad thing is I launched an identical lander and rover for a different mission a few (game) days ago but I accidentally mangled the lander and had to rescue the Kerbals with a nearby ship. Sigh.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Liowen","CreatedById":94498,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-06T17:08:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got the center section into orbit today for testing purposes, with interesting results (to say the least!). It is probe controlled so it can build up the needed life support before the crew arrives, as the crew of 10 will be the last thing to arrive to this ship/station. One thing I did notice after I had it in space, besides the interesting bit, is that I will need RCS ports on the craft to help move it around. While again this does not look like much it is only a small piece of the whole craft, and it needs to be pieced together in high orbit before it leaves on its mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i61.tinypic.com/2yoqql2.png\u0022 alt=\u00222yoqql2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now for the interesting bit....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce in orbit I could no longer revert to launch or the VAB building, the buttons are there but no function, and I can not go to the space center either. Also I can not go to any other craft on the save, mostly due to the fact that they are no longer in map mode. Not only are all current mission gone from map mode but all bodies (with the exception of Kerbin, Mun, and the sun) are gone as well. This is something a bit new for me and I am not sure what is causing it either, but I will be figuring that out soon\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Edit: Apparently soon\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 means shortly after posting this.
