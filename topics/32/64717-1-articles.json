Also keep in mind that the developper of this simulator is all alone and do it for free. You can\u0027t expect the level of polishing from one man on his free time vs a team of programmers paid for it. There is a new client for improved graphics, most of the main vessels have good skins and textures. The devlopper is even adding terrain fom the various sattellite images availables (by terrain I mean elevation and texture) but that will be for the next version of orbiter. Keep in mind that the scale is the actual scale of the solar system, and the physics are more realistic so you cannot expect too much realism for the graphics. Also, I doubt about the 8 years update for some add-on, since most of them are not compatible with the 2010 version of orbiter...
