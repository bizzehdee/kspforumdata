I have used and still enjoy the Kethane mod, I would love anything that expands the game in this direction. I can only agree with others who have said that complexity is a major part of what makes the game fun, and am therefore very disappointed at the news that it (probably) wont happen. I just don\u0027t see the appeal of multiplayer in the context of this game, unless the developers think of some amazing features that can only be achieved through multiplayer (and surpass the problems that come with it), it will become a small part of the game that people will try, and become bored with very quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T17:28:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had to go with multiplayer. When I first got KSP I was so excited and I thought instantly that it would be so much fun to build a station with my friends in orbit and explore together. Having races to the Mun or other planets, building bases together, stuff like that. Mind you, I had these thoughts before I had really gotten into space and needed time warp, so that thought hadn\u0027t occurred to me. While I would love to have resources, I\u0027m content with what I\u0027m given by the wonderful modding community that KSP has. The fact that there\u0027s multiplayer as a mod, without access to the underlying game structure, is amazing to me, so I can only imagine how much better it will be when the people with the source code take over. Resources can come afterward, and I hope they\u0027re not as complicated as they originally were going to be. If I have to send out a bunch of massive ships to refuel one ship, I may as well just send more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore either of those I\u0027d like to see better aerodynamics and reentry heating.

I go away from the forums for a month or two and when I come back there\u0027s a brand new topic that everybody is up in arms about. It certainly seems like Squad has kicked a hornet\u0027s nest with this one, but before I give my opinion I\u0027d like to clarify that I haven\u0027t seen all of the Kerbalcon footage, and so probably missed the comment(s) that has(have) so incensed everyone. All of the input I have to provide on the matter comes from information I\u0027ve gathered through other posts around the forums, so there\u0027s that. If somebody could tell me what exactly was said, well I\u0027d appreciate that!\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, here we go...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResources should most definitely be an integral part of the core game. I think Squad knows that some level of resource gathering would enhance the core gameplay\u0027s richness and provide more incentive for the exploration which is essentially the *entire* point of the game. That said, I think what is in question here is the extent to which resource gathering needs to be implemented. The resource chart provided by Squad is certainly complicated and could probably be simplified significantly without impacting the learning curve too hard. The main argument around here seems to be \u0022it\u0027s too complicated so new players wouldn\u0027t be able to figure it out and would probably give up playing,\u0022 to which I say \u0022there is nothing in the proposed mechanic that would explicitly require new players to learn and use this mechanic, making it completely optional.\u0022 Also, let us not forget that KSP is and always has been a game about space program management, which in itself requires a base level of ingenuity and wit. If somebody is able to learn and master all other mechanics in the game then I see no reason why resource management would be anything special.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have also heard rumor that multiplayer has been officially announced. Again I did not hear this get said during Kerbalcon so perhaps somebody could enlighten me, but if this is indeed the case then I feel it is a gross misapplication of resources available to Squad. The formal stance has always been to provide an outstanding standalone single player experience to the player, wherein they could play around in a consequence-free sandbox mode or try their hand at a deeper and more rewarding career mode. Adding a third mode specifically for multiplayer seems extraneous, and in my opinion does not provide anything to the core experience unlike resource management.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, I sincerely hope I am missing something, because if the new stance is \u0022resources no, multiplayer yes\u0022 then I am none too pleased with the development path KSP seems to be taking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steveman0","CreatedById":64580,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T17:54:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI choose resources because even as fun as it is to build rockets and go to various places there isn\u0027t a reason beyond saying that you did it.

I need a bigger rocket and a slightly different landing configuration but otherwise most planets are the same. Launch, transition, capture, circularize, land, return. The resource adds so much in terms of base building, satellite senors for resource detection, supply chains, orbital refineries, and probably a lot more.

Resources would add much more depth to the game. Multiplayer on the other hand changes very little. Right now it would add very little to the game.

I also play WoW and get all the multi-player fix I need from there. But having a reason and a way to look for something on other worlds seems really cool. As a side note, and I don\u0027t mean to hijack this thread, but I\u0027d also really be interested in being able to build large complex space/moon/Duna stations without having huge amounts of video lag. So, enhancements = really good, but optimizing = really good too!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
