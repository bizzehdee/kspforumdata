As others have said, putting heavy payloads into specific and unusual orbits, or something like docking a lab to a hitchiker on the surface of Tylo, would present you with something out of the ordinary, which you might not have done many times before. Perhaps this is the direction Squad will take things, but I\u0027m afraid that until they do, I\u0027m still setting my own objectives. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond contracts, there is very little in this update.

Instead of having meaningful goals it simply provides arbitrary part tests. It forces one to build contrived rockets that has as many \u0022unnecessary\u0022 parts as possible for part testing. I like to play the career mode as realistically as possible, for example no asparagus staging until the very late game (when that sort of technology is available in my opinion). I don\u0027t see any reason at all why I should have to test a SRB that is splashed down or one at 70km altitude. Why not have meaningful and realistic small missions? Deploying satellites of various designs at various orbits around Kerbin should be a good way to make money for a private space corporation. Ferrying say 8 rich tourists to one of the two moons and back should also be a great way to make money. Putting a scientific space station that generates science slowly would also be a great mission (compared to ISS where they carry out 0G experiments).
