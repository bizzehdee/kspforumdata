I also use a Microsoft Sidewinder Precision 2 Joystick (USB). Sadly, the GPU on this laptop is \u0022merely adequate,\u0022 however KSP V1 runs fine once the graphics settings have been adjusted.\n\nAll in all, it\u0027s an amazing piece of software, and I\u0027ve been pretty happy with it! However, I\u0027m a bit frustrated at the seeming lack of good documentation for it. Apparently there is no \u0022official\u0022 user manual, and while I\u0027ve gone through the Wiki, I didn\u0027t find much of it to be all that helpful.\n\nPerhaps I\u0027ve overlooked something? If not, does Squad intend on publishing a comprehensive user manual any time soon? If not, then..?\n\nTIA."},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T00:57:15Z","Content":"Welcome into the fold, lurker!\n\nThere are specific tutorials available both on the Wiki and here in the Tutorials section of the forums.\n\nThere are also a number of video tutorials available on the web.

Clear explanations of parts and of how to use facilities (most notably VAB and SPH) are handy.

It generally keeps your rocket pointing in the direction you point it to start with ---\u003E but other forces can easily overpower SAS since it has a torque limit. In the situation you describe its likely to be a result of some aerodynamic force or a very slight offset to your thrust vector.\n\nOthers who are more switched on than me can probably contribute a more detailed assessment - however, posting a screen shot of your vessel would likely help quite a bit."},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T12:07:53Z","Content":"The planet is round, SAS goes straight, result, drift upwards on navball"},{"CreatedByName":"HolShot","CreatedById":146720,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T21:48:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The planet is round, SAS goes straight, result, drift upwards on navball\n\nCouldn\u0027t have said it better myself!

Scott Manley\u0027s tutorial guide goes over a LOT of what you might be interested in, but does take quite a bit of time to sit through.\n\nSo! Here\u0027s a bunch of links that\u0027ll take less time to read!\n\nOld and with some spottiness of outdated information, but mostly applicable for the current version still. Has a few handy hints about the VAB/SPH too!\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/21dco6/things_you_may_not_have_known_about_playing_ksp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/21dco6/things_you_may_not_have_known_about_playing_ksp/)\n\nTo fill in a bit of my own knowledge about the VAB/SPH; Keys 1 through 4 will change the current tool you use. 1 is the regular part selector and placement tool, 2 is Offset, 3 is Rotate and 4 is changing root part. Enabling and disabling Angle Snap with the C key or the circle/hexagon button down to the left will also have an effect on the Offset and Rotate tools, making it so that changing offset and rotation happens in discrete steps rather than smoothly. Really helps for tweaking craft just the way you want them. Pressing the F key with the Offset and Rotate tools will change the reference orientation for the tools. These tools are very handy for pointing parts in the right direction, especially aircraft engines and wings!\n\nEntropius of these very forums put together a beautiful, illustrated guide for getting to other objects in orbit. It\u0027s also applicable to getting to other planets; the principle is pretty much identical, with only the scale being different!\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92480-Illustrated-Tutorial-for-Orbital-Rendezvous](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92480-Illustrated-Tutorial-for-Orbital-Rendezvous)\n\nkeptin, also of these forums, drew up a lengthy and rather comprehensive tutorial on the principles of aircraft design. This will really help with making things that fly straight!\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures)\n\nThere\u0027s also a number of mods that help with designing spacecraft, such as Kerbal Engineer Redux, but seeing as you\u0027ve lurked around for a while I\u0027m sure you\u0027re already familiar with it!\n\nAs for aircraft behaving strangely, there are to my knowledge still a few small details that make aircraft not perfectly symmetrical with respect to the air that can cause drift. Trim (Alt\u002BWASDQE) will help with that, as noted in the Reddit link.\n\nEdit: I just remembered another detail with the SPH in particular I haven\u0027t seen mentioned anywhere. Your placement of the craft inside the SPH will actually change where on the runway it appears. There is a center line in the SPH that will match the center line of the actual runway out in the world. This generally doesn\u0027t matter, as your aircraft will still point straight down the runway at default orientation, but it\u0027s there.\n\nI hope this helps!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-25T08:44:14Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2015 08:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cerbis**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T08:22:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Couldn\u0027t have said it better myself!
