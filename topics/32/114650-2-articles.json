The impact energy is proportional to the **square** of velocity -- so something traveling twice as fast delivers four times the impact.\n\nNot to mention that a long-period comet -- the fastest-traveling ones -- would give us much less warning than a nearby asteroid that we can track for years. Add to that the possibility that the Kreutz family of comets is more typical than we think, and comets are clearly the much bigger threat on a per-impact basis.
