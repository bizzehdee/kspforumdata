There\u0027s no really good solution to this, as they all have drawbacks. Squad tried the silent treatment, people got just as frustrated and upset until they had to come forward and talk again. The best solution to date seems to be the compromise, simply thinking through what is said but making sure to provide regular press releases when they can do so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome communication is necessary so people don\u0027t feel like the developer abandoned them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is problematic is forming a hypetrain for a feature that isn\u0027t even written yet.

Either way, less than two days till the update comes out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe developers do have their own image for how KSP should be, and to date they have stuck to this fairly well even if not necessarily in any particular order. It would be nice if they factored in some feedback, and they do a fine job through the play-testing group during the experimental program. But by that point in a cycle the features are implemented as fully as the release, and they are just checking for bugs as well as providing last minute balance changes if the testing group identifies a particular issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-16T07:54:16Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2013 07:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by OdinYggd\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maxpower","CreatedById":16625,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T07:05:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Crush\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Crush\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELesson learned for the development team: Communicate less.

The problem is actually a lack of communication. Most of the community dustups over the years could have been avoided, or at leased lessened with more straightforward communication. This whole resource snafu for example could have been prevented if SQUAD simply informed the community of their decision when it was made (likely several months ago), and were very strait forward with the whole situation. That would have allowed them to get out in front of it, and most of the community would have been fine with that. Instead they made some off hand comments about it and ran away from the community. Its not the amount of communication, its how you communicate... and despite all their efforts SQUAD is still really bad at it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-16T08:02:29Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2013 08:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by stupid_chris\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eremoved deleted quote\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Unabled","CreatedById":75171,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T08:05:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI keep seeing this assumption that resources have been \u0022dropped\u0022, \u0022scrapped\u0022, or \u0022indefinitely postponed\u0022 etc. I have been wondering where this keeps coming from because I did not get that impresssion from the KKon statement at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERough quote(s) from HarvesteR\u0027s own words:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022We put it on the backburner for a long time...It\u0027s been sitting there while we focus on scope complete.\u0022... \u0022We ended up redesigning it because we felt that it was over-complicated...but still we weren\u0027t very happy with it. It just felt too complicated and too frustrating, because it\u0027s a feature that requires you to master the game before you can appreciate that it exists.... It was becoming very much unfun, top-heavy, and not what we wanted exactly.\u0022 \u0022Resources \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ethe way we had it planned back in .19\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E just isn\u0027t going to happen like that. We tried it, and it wasn\u0027t fun.\u0022... \u0022I know it\u0027s not what a lot of you guys wanted to hear, especially since many of you have been very much in love with that chart.\u0022... \u0022It ended up not being what we wanted with the game.\u0022 \u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIts not saying there wont be any new resources at all\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E. There are still kind of plans for other ideas that involve being able to extract things, maybe not from the surface...but this is all kind of theoretical...\u0022 \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat last line it would be nice to have cleared up because I don\u0027t know how you extract things without doing it from the surface, but I just write that off as a slip or nerves or whatever. So Squad very much wanted to include resources, they tried what they had originally, redesigned it, and decided it still wasn\u0027t working right. Bummer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHarv then talks about wanting to have mechanics that would allow you to do what resources would have allowed...like fixing things while on missions and to do problem solving Apollo 13 style. When I think Apollo 13, I think along the lines of life-support problem solving, which was on their original list but that\u0027s just me. Of course, no one should read into any of his statement too much. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me it seems like Squad will be trying to design something that would be more inline with what their overall vision is while they work on bringing KSP to \u0022scope complete\u0022. I see nothing wrong with that, and I see nothing indicating it will be scrapped indefinitely. Could they have communicated this sooner and more clearly? Absolutely, but it seems they really did not want to just stop the attempt and say so until they had tried it as much as they could. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know some can argue that those that want this feature are the ones who have mastered the game, so it wouldn\u0027t be complicated and would be appreciated! Yes that is true, but stop for a second and take into account all that they are proposing with career mode. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a previous video, HarvesteR talks about wanting to add contracts next which give you cash and reputation. There will be three main \u0027currencies\u0027: science, money, and reputation points, which will all be convertible with one another. Then they go on to say this will be the core of the tycoon part of KSP. With 3 different currencies, I am not sure I see where resources \u003Cem\u003Eas it was originally designed\u003C/em\u003E could fit. Not to mention the ability to mine resources and take them back to sell seems like it would be hard to balance with the science and contracts. Balance issues aside, if you were to progress through career mode taking contracts and doing science etc., by the time you got around to having the capability of setting up a mining operation on an alien body you would have gone beyond \u0027mastering the game\u0027. Not just skill wise, but you would probably have enough cash and capability that mining resources wouldn\u0027t have much of a point other than just something else to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus who\u0027s to say you couldn\u0027t put some of those elements into either science or the contracts systems? Contracts alone you could probably do almost anything with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow don\u0027t get me wrong, I think resources would be a cool idea. It might even be the way to make include \u0027end game goal\u0027 of sorts, but I just don\u0027t know that the whole crafting system as they had set up before is the way to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at that flow chart everything led to basically a fuel, monoprop, or a small bit of life support. I suppose they could simplify all the superfluous stuff and let you get just that, fuel resources and some means of life support; I just don\u0027t know. In a way resources have already begun to be (very) partially implemented with solar energy and electricity, taken straight from that flow chart no less. Who knows what bits future updates will bring along. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the best thing the community can do is start up some brainstorming threads in the suggestions \u0026amp; development forum on this very subject; how to implement resources in general and have it work well with the other systems. How to implement life-support, which almost seems like it would be to kerbals what the power is to probes right now. It would be cool to have, but how do you do it right? How do you keep it in line with the theme of game? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think all the energy in this forum needs to be turned towards this instead of the back and forth I have been reading for 29 pages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-16T08:13:51Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2013 08:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Unabled\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EToo early.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T08:12:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay guys, we had to do some thread cleaning here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease be aware that your personal opinions may vastly differ from other people\u0027s opinions.
