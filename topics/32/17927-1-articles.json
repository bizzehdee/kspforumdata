If the Mun is analogous to the Moon, and Kerbin is analogous to Earth, then the Mun has a geometric albedo of about .11 and kerbin has a geometric albedo of about .37. However, as Kerbin doesn\u0027t presently have any clouds I think that may have a diminishing effect on its actual present albedo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d say Minmus is definitely on top in Kerbin\u0027s local system, being an iceball, I\u0027d say probably a Bond albedo of something like .4, .5?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the new planets, I\u0027d wager the Desert Planet, being fairly analogous to Mars, will be beneath Kerbin but above the Mun (Mars\u0027 geometric albedo is about .15). Eve I imagine to have a fairly high albedo, perhaps something like .6, .7? The gas giant is fairly bright, so something like .5? No idea about the lavaless planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: If we\u0027re talking percentages, then let\u0027s use Bond albedo for everything. In which case:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoon: .12 (12%), so about the same for the Mun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarth: .3 (30%), so about the same for Kerbin (when it gets clouds?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus: .4, .5?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesert Planet: .25 (same as Mars)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve: Huge, like .9 if it\u0027s a Venus analogue (Venus is .9)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGas Giant: Like .3-.5?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously this is all just educated conjecture on my part.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-27T10:00:44Z\u0022 title=\u002208/27/2012 10:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 27, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by BurningSky93\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
