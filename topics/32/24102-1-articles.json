Depending on which part, this can cause your craft to torque itself as the two clipping pieces try (unsuccessfully) to resolve their collision. This can\u0027t be fixed in-flight, really; you\u0027ll just need to go back into the VAB and fix the design to not clip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; There\u0027s a bug where if you go into accelerated time mode while the craft is trying to adjust its position (either from SAS or because RCS jets were firing), the game might not clear that velocity correctly after leaving the time acceleration. If your craft has flaps, you turn off SAS, and they don\u0027t return to their default position, then you\u0027re bugged. If your vessel rotates while in time acceleration, you\u0027re bugged. Exit to the Space Center and re-select your vehicle, and it\u0027ll clear this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3\u0026gt; If you weren\u0027t quite out of the atmosphere and your craft isn\u0027t perfectly symmetrical, a spin is very easy to initiate. Especially common if your struts aren\u0027t symmetrical. Will only happen in-atmosphere, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3a\u0026gt; This also happens if you use a flat aerodynamic surface as a separator. For instance, I\u0027ve often used the rectangular wing segments to link non-ejecting fuel tanks and engines to my centeral core. These surfaces sometimes are treated as having distinct \u0022up\u0022 and \u0022down\u0022 sides, so using them vertically can cause a spin. Again, this can only happen in-atmosphere, so if this is happening to you while in orbit, it won\u0027t be this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the biggest cause, in my experience, is just that the game has a problem with really huge craft. Maybe it\u0027s just rounding off certain forces to a given number of significant figures, and that the remainder is enough to, over time, generate a torque that overcomes whatever SAS you have. Regardless, I\u0027ve had this happen on my ultra-huge boosters (like my 4000-ton heavy lift vehicle); by the time I\u0027m ready to stage, the thing\u0027s starting to spin pretty severely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NannerManCan","CreatedById":27019,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T22:06:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh and also you only need one asas for the whole ship.
