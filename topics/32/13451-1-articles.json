If you are on the antiorbital side of the mun, lifting off at 500m/s will drop you to a periapsis within kerbals atmosphere, at which point you only need a whisper of fuel to slow to a safe landing, or alternatively a parachute. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ramses","CreatedById":26418,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-30T03:08:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EF1 for some reason didn\\\u0027t work so just changed settings for screenshot to p.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust hada devastating thing happen to the crew on Minmus though. :\\\u0027(\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas time accelerating to get a day time shot when all of a sudden their ship toppled and exploded???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlad to say they survived and are now awaiting rescue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Akaliwolf","CreatedById":26129,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-30T03:11:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the ship falling over and exploding, I believe its some bug with the terrain colliders or whatever, I had something like that happen to some of my craft on the mun and min where it would just fall over and explode..or just explode, I believe 0.16 will fix this?:3\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ramses","CreatedById":26418,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-30T03:33:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELet\\\u0027s hope so, those brave fellas deserve better 8)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-30T06:28:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Tipping thing can happen sometimes if you slide a little over time.
