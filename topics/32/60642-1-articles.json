Granted, most of these reports conflict due to the tendency of Kerbals to cause explosions in the vicinity of anyone who attempts to contact them, but this is less due to self-defense and more due to their rather poor grasp of rocketry. That said, at least one correspondant of ours has managed to glean some information about the spacefaring civilization on Kerbin known as the Lovothorians.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Lovothoria (a Kerbal term which more or less translates out to \u0022we\u0027re better than everyone else\u0022; points at least for being honest about their nationalism) is a nation situated near the equator of Kerbin, on the large peninsula commonly known as Lovotrazi (a Kerbal term which directly translates out to \u0022our landmass is better than everyone else\u0027s\u0022). The population ranges across the entirety of this region, though most of them are concentrated to the far west of the large mountain range in the center, the Lovobagits (which is Kerbal for \u0022our mountain range is better than everyone else\u0027s\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The Lovothorians were reportedly quite egoistical even before they first started launching things into space, and often tout the fact that they have launched things into space as justification for their tendency to go \u0022nah-nah-nah-NAH-nah!\u0022 at Kerbals from other nations. It is perhaps unsurprising then that they also sport a very large diplomatic force, which is mostly tasked with apologizing profusely for the behaviour of the rest of their people to the other nations of Kerbin, mostly because Lovothoria does not have any sort of standing military. Indeed, they possess no weapons at all according to their standards, though other nations around the planet argue that their frequent failed rocket launches should really be classified as ICBMs (even though most of them hit Lovothoria itself).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E While the civilian population of Lovothoria is very proud of their nation\u0027s accomplishments, their space exploration and rocket design team tends to be far more humble. Mostly because they know that if the rest of Kerbin gets sick of the constant spent fuel stages falling down onto their cities, they will be the first ones up against the wall when the revolution comes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASAFanboy","CreatedById":57300,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T20:16:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUnited Proviences\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELEADER: President Madfield\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGOVERNMENT: Three political parties, the Liberals, Conservatives, and the Liberatian Coalition\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EECONOMIC: Capitalism\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMILITARY: 500,000 regular forces Kerbals, and around 2,000,000 in reserve/militia forces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPOPULATION: 400 million\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe United Proviences is situated on an entire continent, with population mostly focused at the center of the continent and the western and eastern coastlines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"McDaddy23","CreatedById":76122,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T20:30:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGlory to Kerbstotzka!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Krosulhah","CreatedById":83946,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T20:31:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerman Republic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeader : Jeb Kerman, Of course!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGovernment: One party rule\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEconomic system: Mixed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMilitary: 500,00 regular infantry, 100 mechanized units, consisting of 16 vehicles each, and 30 UAV\u0027s, and about 1000 Military aircraft, and 13 subs and one aircraft carrier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas WMDs?
