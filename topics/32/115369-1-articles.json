I launch all of my rockets dry (obviously SRB\u0027s start out full). I then drive a fuel truck out to the launch pad and fuel the rocket, or several trucks really. I also leave a small structure near where I park my trucks that is really just a probe core with an upturned rocket engine on it (this thing is firmly attached to the ground) that my fuel trucks dock with to burn off excess fuel before they get parked again... you know, for safety.\n\nWhere do the fuel trucks get their fuel? From my fuel depot of course, a row of large tanks, but what about them? Well they get it from my refineries... on Kerbin. Yes, I do on occasion when those tanks run dry actually drive tankers several hours to my KSC for the sole purpose of refilling those tanks.(I do admit to sometimes using hyper edit to make the tanker suddenly appear at the KSC or just fill the tanks, can\u0027t be micromaning everything all the time after all). \n\nSo I am wondering, what other sort of odd things do you people do that really serve no purpose other than for some strange reason you like it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T05:42:26Z","Content":"I kinda do a similar thing, but I use the Liquid Hydrogen rather than boring ol\u0027 LFO.
