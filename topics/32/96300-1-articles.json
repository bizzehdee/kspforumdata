For one thing, it wouldn\u0027t be KSC anymore. But anyways, what would it be like? I\u0027m assuming that science is nerfed relative to the new home of the KSC (the home planet gets little science, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thoughts-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Kerbol - The center would vaporize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Moho - Interplanetary is very difficult - you start from an inclined orbit and have to burn more to raise your orbit. Landing is too, being a non-atmospheric body. But takeoff is fairly easy with lower gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Eve - You wouldn\u0027t reach orbit until you are approaching the end of the tech tree. More biomes need to be added to satisfy this need for science, as does more balanced tech tree nodes. Maybe another asteroid moon for when you get to orbit. Or more than 1 extra moon. The high gravity means that low orbit hinders interplanetary transfers are a bit hindered(maybe?) But moving on...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Gilly - You orbit and land with a Kerbal jetpack after rolling a capsule to the pad. You go interplanetary quickly, but getting home requires some slightly tedious maneuvering. Eve\u0027s atmosphere helps you slow down for capture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Kerbin - The purpose of this thread is defeated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Mun - You have easy takeoffs and normal transfers, but need to make powered landings. Kerbin, however, will let you slow from deep space..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Minmus - Very easy takeoffs and normal transfers (in the grand scheme of things, that inclination can\u0027t be THAT much of a big deal.) Landing is easier than the Mun, but getting to Minmus\u0027 SOI isn\u0027t as easy as getting to the Mun\u0027s SOI. Aerobraking at Kerbin is a big help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Duna - This would be very interesting. You have low gravity, but you also can, to some extent, parachute. Overall, this is probably easier than Kerbin. And Ike is easier to get to than either of Kerbin\u0027s moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ike - Easy takeoffs, easy to get to Duna. You don\u0027t have an atmosphere, but Duna can do the initial capture for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Dres - Same as Moho, but Jool and Duna are both more productive targets early in the tech tree than Eve is for a Moho KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Jool - The center would be crushed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-All moons of Jool are simplified due to aerocapture at Jool (and at Laythe, final landing.) However, you still need more delta-V to get to essentially anywhere from Jool. You will always have more science nearby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Laythe - This would be like an \u0022easy mode\u0022 Kerbin, but with lots more science targets nearby. Maybe this would be the easiest to start with, even if Jool\u0027s moons were accordingly nerfed for science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Vall - Like the Mun, but more science nearby and harder interplanetary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Tylo - Takeoff is not very hard, but landing is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Bop - Like Minmus , but at Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Pol - Bop with less gravity (but still more than Gilly.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-11T03:36:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat if the KSC was a floating airship base on Jool?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-11T04:03:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GigaG\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GigaG\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-All moons of Jool are simplified due to aerocapture at Jool (and at Laythe, final landing.) \u003Cstrong\u003EHowever, you still need more delta-V to get to essentially anywhere from Jool.\u003C/strong\u003E You will always have more science nearby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI disagree with the bolded part. outbound flights from jool are cheaper to most destinations than leaving from anywhere else (baring trips between a primary and a moon like duna/ike trips). the return may be more expensive as your going to need at least a couple K dV to climb back up the gravity well without geting a couple slingshots off eve or something but going down the well is easy. With a gravity assist off tylo you can sling your PE down to duna, kerbin, or eve\u0027s orbit for only a couple hundred dV. From there you use either gravity or an atmosphere to bleed off orbital velocity and if your final destination is not one of those planets sling yourself into a more ideal orbit. You can go direct to one of the other planetary orbits but it will cost more to slow down without an atmo or gravity assist. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only expensive part of leaving jool is your looking at a couple year trip each way so plan accordingly if you play with a life support mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"samstarman5","CreatedById":12469,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-11T08:41:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe part I love is Squad\u0027s confirming that such things will actually become possible to experience.

You also have tons of targets needing little delta-V to get to: Mun, Duna, Ike, and Gilly are all cheap for return missions. Kerbin is a bigger challenge though you can use jets - it\u0027s also nice to have it relatively \u0022on hand\u0022 to test out aircraft designs for the other atmo bodies. Eve is an easy one-way mission too. There is though one gotcha with Minmus - aerobraking at Kerbin is all well and good, but mess it up and you\u0027ll crash onto Kerbin!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIke might also be a good place. It\u0027s got a relatively low delta-V to orbit, and its own fairly low orbit round Duna means a direct interplanetary departure is efficient unlike with Minmus. Duna is a much easier early-game target from Ike than Kerbin (big) or Mun (worrying about transfer windows) from Minmus.
