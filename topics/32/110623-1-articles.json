If you increase the amount of engines, the ratio gets even worse. So yes, the Nuke is now less desirable to use.

It clocks in at around 2000 dV with the parts as they are. If those LFO tanks I had to use had pure LF variants, vehicle mass would increase to 290 tons, but dV would rise above 3000. So once again: the problem isn\u0027t the behavior of the LV-N, it is the options players have how they can use it. The vehicle is still more efficient with nukes than with any other chemical rocket.

It is irrelevant what is possible in the game, only what is realistic. It is unrealistic to use the LF-only tanks with the LV-N, as the fuel density is far too high. That is the only necessary factor to make me consider it to be cheating to use them with it. It is a hack by the game, to avoid introducing another fuel type, and is quite clearly balance around using LF\u002BO tanks with the O part empty.
