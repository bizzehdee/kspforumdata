Show me that is actually the reason KSP is doing well.\u0022. Which is implying that KSP isn\u0027t doing well financially despite this, so I gave reasons why. KSP does well because there is little interference by Squad to heavily change the game into a monetization machine, which would make a few people hesitate buying a game given the current features it has. KSP in fact, gives a lot of things away for free in terms of it\u0027s updates and expansions, plus also giving the consumer a choice to have it linked up with Steam or to have it standalone. I should also add in that Squad also gave a demo, which is rarely done these days, which allows people to make informed choices on whether they should buy KSP. Which makes people less hesitant to buy a game in development if they liked what they saw in the demo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso DRM has little to do with a good game or not, or a companies financial stability.

The games industry is simply having the same teething problems as the movie industry because of the shifting market towards digital goods and the inability to adapt to it.

EA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEA has been blasted in recent weeks by accusations that it subjects some of its workers to grueling hours--such as 80-hour weeks for months on end. Exhausting work demands are part of the game industry in general and have long been associated with software development overall. But in the wake of an anonymous Web log posting by an EA employee\u0027s fiancee, game developers have been speaking out, effectively saying companies are pushing workers too far.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIn July, an EA employee filed a lawsuit claiming that the company improperly classified image production employees as exempt from California overtime laws. - \u003C/em\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://news.cnet.com/Electronic-Arts-promises-workplace-change/2100-1022_3-5476714.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ehttp://news.cnet.com/Electronic-Arts-promises-workplace-change/2100-1022_3-5476714.html\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have the time to go hunting all over the internet for sources for all the articles on how bad it is to work there, but it\u0027s pretty straightforwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell I said KSP was doing well because it gave Harvester the independence to make the game without interference, then you asked me \u0022I would like to see whre you get your proof on that. Show me that is actually the reason KSP is doing well.\u0022. Which is implying that KSP isn\u0027t doing well financially despite this, so I gave reasons why. KSP does well because there is little interference by Squad to heavily change the game into a monetization machine, which would make a few people hesitate buying a game given the current features it has. KSP in fact, gives a lot of things away for free in terms of it\u0027s updates and expansions, plus also giving the consumer a choice to have it linked up with Steam or to have it standalone. I should also add in that Squad also gave a demo, which is rarely done these days, which allows people to make informed choices on whether they should buy KSP. Which makes people less hesitant to buy a game in development if they liked what they saw in the demo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lack of DRM has a lot to do with how it benefits the consumer, and you\u0027re right it has nothing to do with a company\u0027s financial stability, which is further reason why it shouldn\u0027t even exist. The games industry is simply having the same teething problems as the movie industry because of the shifting market towards digital goods and the inability to adapt to it. So they try things like PIPA, SOPA or DRMs to shift the burden to consumers instead of actually adapting to the new market.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve actually read the article you linked earlier to another guy, but the articles themselves have a comment section, in particular: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-07-19-gamestop-exploiting-developers-and-consumers-says-ready-at-dawn-boss\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-07-19-gamestop-exploiting-developers-and-consumers-says-ready-at-dawn-boss\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich has various people from the industry also disagreeing to the logic of the written article. You really can\u0027t just disregard the comments just because they didn\u0027t have the opportunity to have their articles posted, I felt the comments helped put the articles in perspective. Because what you have here is an article saying one thing, and then a long comment section of his industry peers telling him that he\u0027s wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, most comments do not out right disagree with that article so no idea what you are talking about.
