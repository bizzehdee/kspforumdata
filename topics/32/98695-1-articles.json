You are put in charge of the space program for a fictional race called the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CKerbals\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. Your space program is based out of an Earth-like planet called Kerbin, which revolves around a sun, much like in our own solar system. There are 6 other planets that also revolve around this sun, and each planet, including Kerbin, has its own moons and assorted unidentified objects like asteroids orbiting around it. The physics in this game are built to closely mimic the same basic newtonian physics that govern our solar system, and the level of technology you have to build rocket ships and space planes is fairly similar to what we have right now on Earth. No crazy \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cwarp drives\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 or \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cflux capacitors\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2- just parts to build things like rockets, landers, satellites, and other spacecraft akin to what we have today.

You\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll have to build staged rockets, much like in real life, and each stage has to be capable of providing enough thrust to actually get where you need to go. Not enough thrust? Your rocket will fall over before it leaves the ground, burning up all of your astronauts in a fiery explosion. Even if it has enough thrust to get off the ground, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d better hope it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s structurally stable enough, or it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll fall apart as it reaches high speeds in the atmosphere. It also has to be balanced, or it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll begin flipping and spinning out of control, often ending with a fiery, deadly explosion. And don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t forget to pack a parachute so that when your rocket does eventually come down, you can recover your astronauts safely. In general, any mistake you make in Kerbal Space Program can result in a deadly ending to an attempted mission. For example, I wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t sure if Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s first moon, called \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CMun\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, actually had an atmosphere. Of course, Earth\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s moon doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t, but not everything translates over from our solar system to KSP.

I spent around 7 hours just learning the game\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s controls and trying to achieve orbit around Kerbin. At around 30 hours of playtime, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve managed to land on Mun safely- with no fuel to return to Kerbin. There are difficulty settings, but turning down the difficulty doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t make the physics any more forgiving- it just allows you to revert botched flights, gives you stock ship options to choose from, and makes your facilities indestructable (yes, even at normal difficulty falling rockets can destroy your space center facilities). You\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll lose countless rockets and astronauts as you trial-and-error your way up to building decent, stable rockets- the kind that only catastrophically fail every dozen launches or so. Then all of the sudden you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll find yourself making more daring missions- graduating from orbiting Kerbin toward orbiting or even landing on the moon. And when you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve mastered space around Kerbin, there are 6 other planets to reach. All along the way there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be catastrophes, but at least those catastrophes end in epic, fiery explosions- hell, the spectacular failures make the game that much more enjoyable.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://thezb.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-31-at-11.48.44-PM.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://thezb.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-31-at-11.48.44-PM-300x223.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Screen-Shot-2015-01-31-at-11.48.44-PM-300x223.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:inherit;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Lato;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#2B2B2B;\u0022\u003EThe majestic \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CFail Whale\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 a clumsy ship destined to run out of fuel in a horribly botched attempt at orbit.

Just build rockets to your hearts content- see where you can go with everything opened up to you! The next step up is science mode. Here you start with just a handful of spaceship parts, and must accomplish scientific tasks like surface samples and crew reports in order to gain points to put towards researching new parts. This is arguably the best mode for beginners- a solid introduction to most of the concepts of the game without the insane, overwhelming number of parts in Sandbox Mode. Finally there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s career mode- the point where the game crosses from \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSandbox\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSimulator\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and ramps up the difficulty. Whereas in Science and Sandbox modes you can try anything you like, as much as you like, career mode places a cost on each of the spaceship parts as well as limiting your technologies like in Science mode. It also gives you bare-bones facilities with severe functional limits and you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll have to pay to upgrade them. You\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll have to take on contracts from other companies- things like collecting data on certain celestial bodies, launching communications satellites, and testing certain ship parts under specific conditions- and fulfill them in order to gain funds towards pricier spaceships, gain reputation to put towards administrative policies, and gain science in order to research new parts. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a careful and delicate balancing act that adds a whole new level of depth to the gameplay, as well as a whole boatload of new objectives to strive for.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Lato;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#2B2B2B;\u0022\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://thezb.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-02-01-at-12.15.39-AM.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://thezb.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-02-01-at-12.15.39-AM-300x225.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Screen-Shot-2015-02-01-at-12.15.39-AM-300x225.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:inherit;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Lato;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#2B2B2B;\u0022\u003EYes, this ship, like most, ended up tumbling out of control and crashing with a fiery explosion\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Lato;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#2B2B2B;\u0022\u003EThe soundtrack to the game is limited, but enjoyable.

The controls are exactly what they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re supposed to be- they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re by no means especially responsive, but that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a function of the style of gameplay- 80 ton rocket ships aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t going to fly like fighter jets. The controls felt realistic, and that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s exactly what I want from a game like this.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Lato;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#2B2B2B;\u0022\u003EKerbal Space Program is an odd game. Certainly, I would not recommend it to everyone; not even a majority of people. Its steep learning curve and lack of concrete objectives make it unplayable to many people- especially more \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cmodern\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 gamers who expect objectives spelled out with step-by-step instructions on how to do it. Kerbal Space Program does none of that, instead opting to let you learn for yourself. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s also a game with literally no story, and no developed characters, so if you prefer story-driven games you should pass on KSP. In some ways it reminds me of classic games, like the original Legend of Zelda, which throws you into its world and forces you to learn for yourself the ins and outs- and to me this makes KSP a fantastic and immersive game. If you really like science- especially branches like physics and astronomy- play Kerbal Space Program. If you like challenges, and figuring things out for yourself with no handholding, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll love KSP. And if exploration is your favorite part of videogames- reaching new places just for the sake of the challenge, the prestige, and the mysteries of the unknown- you need to play Kerbal Space Program right now. For the people who can get past its steep learning curve and intimidating openness and depth, Kerbal Space Program is a fantastic gaming experience, one that has endless depth and incredible longevity, and it is indeed one of the best and most enjoyable games I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve played (and will continue to be playing) for a long time.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Lato;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#2B2B2B;\u0022\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:inherit;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Lato;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#2B2B2B;\u0022\u003ENotes: This is an early access game currently in beta; the game may be different in the final release but these are my current impressions.
