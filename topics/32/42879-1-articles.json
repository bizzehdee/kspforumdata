I am doing my own campaign based on the one found on the KSP Wiki, but I have also bloated it out with additional elements from the real space race. As I have been following the Wiki format, everything is done in stages so far. Now I am in a place where I need to make a decision, as the real space-race at this point started jumping about a bit. For instance, the Venera missions began while the Lunar probes were still being sent out. And then there was the Mars probes too, while Mercury and then Gemini were under way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is simple, because I can\u0027t make a decision and I\u0027m just curious as to what others do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould/do you follow a \u0027block\u0027 campaign like the Wiki and focus on one particular thing at a time, or is the jumping about between programs your method?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T18:12:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring 0.20 I followed the plan on the wiki because it was a good way to wrap your head around all the things to do in KSP. By the time 0.21 came out I was setting my own goals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I first started my current save in 0.21 I sent a rover to Moho and Eve; both failed. This got me thinking about when I could next launch, which turned into me sitting down and plotting out the launch windows to all the major bodies of the Kerbol system for the entire first year. In-between interplanetary launch windows I\u0027ve been prototyping Kethane stuff on the Mun and Minmus, and generally just farting around with rovers and landers. I haven\u0027t committed to building a space station just yet, but it is on my list. I might do that after my Dres mission gets underway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far I\u0027ve got missions on their way to Moho, Duna, Jool, and Eeloo, with a Dres mission in a parking orbit waiting for the window. The next windows after Dres are Moho, Eve, then Moho again. In fact, there are so many launch windows to Moho during the year that I\u0027ve been considering a permanent base there complete with orbital station and rotating crew. Sure, the delta-V requirements are pretty high and its a hard target to hit, but the trips are damn short and I\u0027m a fairly practiced hand at the orbital construction of interplanetary craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy goals in the game shift a lot but my aim is to get a ton of \u003Cem\u003Emeaningful\u003C/em\u003E flights into space and hit as many launch windows as I can.

The a station at Karbin and a few practice runs at Mun and Minmus.

All the new mods and updates give me crazy ideas. It is my NASA moment there.

So what I decided to do was to start taking it slow in sort of a step by step method, the first thing I\u0027ll do is get some satellites up around Kerbin, then tinker around with some escape pod and launch abort system designs to make sure the crew of manned vessels will be safe, after that I do some sub-orbital and orbital flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly after some successful orbital flights will I actually begin to reach out to the Mun, once there I typically do some orbital stuff and get some satellites up followed by some landings. Usually will get some Kethane mining going on and then I\u0027ll begin to reach out to Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see I try to keep it going fairly slow and work my way up in distance from Kerbin, actually in my last 2 saves I\u0027ve been doing so much stuff with the Mun that I haven\u0027t even gotten to the point of getting anything out to Minmus, let alone other planets. Recently my last few sessions on KSP I\u0027ve been working on a reusable launch vehicle that I can launch up to orbit, undock the payload, land back at KSC, then use KAS to refuel and reload a new payload back onto the docking port again.

I started playing in 0.20 and I didn\u0027t venture further than the Kerbin moons (last thing I did was land on Minmus). And then when I heard about the saves breaking I concentrated on building space shuttles. Along side that, I started designing a program to follow based on the Wiki \u0027Kampaign\u0027 -yes, those damn \u0027K\u0027s\u0027- which I threw in a lot of additional elements from the real space race, taking bits of both America and Russian (I\u0027m going on the basis that Kerbin is a united planet). Reason for it is because I didn\u0027t want to do too much too quickly and then get bored, which I see posted form time-to-time - even on this thread.
