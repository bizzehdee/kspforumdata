All of the friction generated between Jool and the other moons could cause a lot of heating in the planet. Laythe could have been an icy moon like Vall, but maybe the friction melted the ice which evaporated, and enough evaporated to form an atmosphere, which trapped the small amount of heat from the sun, causing more water vapor to form. I would guess that Laythe\u0027s atmosphere could be mostly composed of water vapor and some other strong greenhouse gases. Laythe\u0027s oceans could also be extremely salty to help keep it liquid at very low temperatures.

Laythe is the closest moon to Jool. Same as Europa is the closest of the Galilean moons to Jupiter. Scientist think that their might be liquid water under its surface because of tidal forces. Just like the Moon makes tides on Earth, Jupiter pulls on Europa stretching and pulling on the rock, this then causes friction which heats up the core of the planet and then some. This could be the same thing happening to Laythe with Jool, tidal friction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S I am not 100% sure on the information above and do not claim it to be right.
