On the plus side, it\u0027s likely those planets will have a much larger SOI. I\u0027m rather hoping that they make the spheres a bit larger for planets. This should make it a lot easier to correct for a slight mistiming, as it\u0027ll show you hitting the SOI from quite a way out.

What would be really useful is a way to show your trajectory relative to a body.
