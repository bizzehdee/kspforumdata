I\u0027m doing my science on it and I will mine it once I unlock the parts but my question is, does mining an asteroid reduce its mass?\n\nThe thing is 95% ore so I figure if I strip mine it, I can drive it to Jool far more easily; if it will end up with just 5% of its mass. And I\u0027m also hoping it doesn\u0027t get destroyed or shrink?

You found a good (even the best?) ore/rock ratio asteroid!\n\u003E I wish you success\n\nThanks! I was just afraid it would go poof if I were to deplete it. And the mass ratio is indeed great, 90% is normally a good ratio but with 95% a depleted asteroid is half the mass it would have been otherwise and 3.5t (5% of 70 something the asteroid was) to Jool is easy peasy.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-06T09:47:42Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2015 09:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by More Boosters**"},{"CreatedByName":"Xyphos","CreatedById":139010,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T10:56:17Z","Content":"Mining asteroids will reduce their mass, but not by a whole lot; I\u0027d guess about a 30% reduction maximum.\n\nImagine if you will, that the asteroid itself is a vessel, and the ore it contains is it\u0027s fuel, your drills just transfer the ore from the asteroid to your holding tank(s), kind of like a fuel duct, if it had an active pump.\n\ndepleted asteroids stay spawned but should be considered \u0022empty\u0022 vessels.\n\nyou can still mine them, but they will have nothing left to give.\n\nif your mission doesn\u0027t have an ore restriction, then depleting it is your best option. use a Nerva tug with Mk1 fuel tanks if you have them available."},{"CreatedByName":"More Boosters","CreatedById":147303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T11:00:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Mining asteroids will reduce their mass, but not by a whole lot; I\u0027d guess about a 30% reduction maximum.\n\u003E Imagine if you will, that the asteroid itself is a vessel, and the ore it contains is it\u0027s fuel, your drills just transfer the ore from the asteroid to your holding tank(s), kind of like a fuel duct, if it had an active pump.\n\u003E \n\u003E depleted asteroids stay spawned but should be considered \u0022empty\u0022 vessels.\n\u003E \n\u003E you can still mine them, but they will have nothing left to give.\n\u003E \n\u003E if your mission doesn\u0027t have an ore restriction, then depleting it is your best option. use a Nerva tug with Mk1 fuel tanks if you have them available.\n\nErm, what do you mean? The game explicitly states that 70.8 something out of the 74 something tons is ore, unless you\u0027re saying I can\u0027t mine all the ore in an asteroid? That would make no sense as I figure they would simply omit the un-minable ore in the UI."},{"CreatedByName":"Stargate525","CreatedById":53585,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T11:11:28Z","Content":"...uh, why not transfer it with a nerva and a ISRU?

As I said once I run this dry it will be lighter than a Command Pod, so why bother with the headache of hauling 74t with slow burns and a shaky Klaw?"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T14:36:37Z","Content":"FYI\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128707-PSA-how-to-not-waste-ore-when-mining-asteroids](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128707-PSA-how-to-not-waste-ore-when-mining-asteroids)"},{"CreatedByName":"More Boosters","CreatedById":147303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T15:40:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E FYI\n\u003E [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128707-PSA-how-to-not-waste-ore-when-mining-asteroids](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128707-PSA-how-to-not-waste-ore-when-mining-asteroids)\n\nRegarding that, wouldn\u0027t a 2:1 ISRU/Drill ratio remove the problem?"}]}
