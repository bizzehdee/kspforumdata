But a kerbal can survive re-entry sitting in a command chair that\u0027s shielded by some regular (non-heatshield) parts in 1.0.4 (tried that recently), so....I would have thought it could still work.\n\nAside from the heat aspects there are other issues;\n\n- you can\u0027t timewarp with a Kerbal on a ladder, so you have to let go and get a close to 0 relative velocity and then timewarp. \n\n- burning engines can be problematic, too much thrust will push the kerbal off.\n\n- during re-entry you need to be focused mainly on the poor guy rather than on the craft, because forces will try to push him up the ladder and you need to keep walking him back down a bit. And the lower you go the more walking force is needed. To start with you just tap down every few seconds, by the end you\u0027re desperately holding the key down! (you could try putting strut cubes at either end of the ladder as blocks, but I did this before unlocking those). \n\n- because of that the recovery craft needs either a pilot or probe core that\u0027s able to maintain its pitch. and you must come in so the Kerbal on the ladder is as close to perpendicular to the line of descent as possible.\n\n- also as you can\u0027t switch back to the craft in the low atmo (or the ladder rider will just fly off), the chutes need to be in reach of the guy on the ladder so he can EVA deploy them. \n\nThis is a shot of a 0.90.0 Kerbal on re-entry (sorry it\u0027s a dark shot)\n\n[![bwpK0g6l.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/bwpK0g6l.jpg)](http://imgur.com/bwpK0g6)\n\nThe other funny thing about doing this for rescue missions is you get the Kerbal back to land before completing any aspects of the rescue contract."},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T11:23:26Z","Content":"I have returned kerbals home on EVA (like when I make a rescue mission and the game auto inserted a pilot I climb by pressing f and glitch myself between the pod and the heat shield"},{"CreatedByName":"Cairol","CreatedById":145279,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T12:42:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This is a shot of a 0.90.0 Kerbal on re-entry (sorry it\u0027s a dark shot)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/bwpK0g6l.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/bwpK0g6l.jpg)\n\nHaha.

Nothing overheated, not even Tenemmy here, who had to wait for several orbits to be picked up by the mothership. But in the future, contientious players might equip chair-based scooters and rovers with roofs, and provide retractable awnings on the sides of their Moho landers.
