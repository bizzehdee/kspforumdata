And the lower you go the more walking force is needed. To start with you just tap down every few seconds, by the end you\u0027re desperately holding the key down! (you could try putting strut cubes at either end of the ladder as blocks, but I did this before unlocking those). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- because of that the recovery craft needs either a pilot or probe core that\u0027s able to maintain its pitch. and you must come in so the Kerbal on the ladder is as close to perpendicular to the line of descent as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- also as you can\u0027t switch back to the craft in the low atmo (or the ladder rider will just fly off), the chutes need to be in reach of the guy on the ladder so he can EVA deploy them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a shot of a 0.90.0 Kerbal on re-entry (sorry it\u0027s a dark shot)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/bwpK0g6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bwpK0g6l.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bwpK0g6l.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other funny thing about doing this for rescue missions is you get the Kerbal back to land before completing any aspects of the rescue contract.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T11:23:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have returned kerbals home on EVA (like when I make a rescue mission and the game auto inserted a pilot I climb by pressing f and glitch myself between the pod and the heat shield\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cairol","CreatedById":145279,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T12:42:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022katateochi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022katateochi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a shot of a 0.90.0 Kerbal on re-entry (sorry it\u0027s a dark shot)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bwpK0g6l.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/bwpK0g6l.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaha.
