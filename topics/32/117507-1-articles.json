The issue I have is with the consequences of that bad design decision. Presenting me with an error message stating the doors are blocked, so I can\u0027t get that mystery goo measurement is far more reasonable than having the doors force their way open so strongly that they rip my ship apart, though. I mean if I move a chair in my house so that it blocks a door opening, when I try to open the door, it just hits the chair.
