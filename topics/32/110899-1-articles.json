First is my main game were I try to play with no reverts unless I feel I was cheated by the game or some other issue. Second is my engineering save were I gave myself a ton of money and science and I keep my tech tree and facilities at the same level as my main save.\n\nI have spent about a week building and testing a space station with a Lander to grab the science from each biome and return it to the station for processing. Sense I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want to do any reverts I make sure I can get both halves of my ship into orbit, make the transfer, land, have solar panels, return and deliver the science to KSC.\n\nDay 1, Kids are in bed wife watching TV, I get both halves in Kerbin orbit, rendezvous, and docking go as planned. Just as I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m about to start my Hohmann transfer my wife asks if she can use the PC to do bills and schedule our next week. I tell her I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m about to make and interplanetary transfer but it does not impress her and I have to log off.\n\nDay 2, wife is napping, kids watching a movie, I have time. I make the transfer with no problem. Once in orbit I make the personnel transfer to the Lander. The Lander is fully fueled and ready to roll. Docking clamps released.\n\nJeb makes the first biome no problem and gets back to the station to dump his science and resupply. Jeb begins the second trip down. De-orbit burn goes well. At about 5km I hear \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CDaddy I spilled my juice\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6.F\\*\u0026%. I go clean up juice from the carpet, table, and kid. When I get back to my game that I thought I had paused as I left for real life emergencies I find the Flight Results window up. The mission I have spent over a week on is now a crater. \n\nA juice box ended the mission I have worked so hard on. Normally I would revert a kid caused KSP event, but I had not saved my game in a long time. All I could do was stare at my screen and feel defeated. I tried to explain my feelings to my wife\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6.all I get is that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s nice dear, really that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s the best I can get after your spawn have destroyed my Lander and killed my #1 pilot. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s hard to get any sympathy from a house full of women. I know you guys will understand my pain.\n\nThe station is still there and manned so I guess now I send another Lander out and try again.
