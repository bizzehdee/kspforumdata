Also worth a mention that my opinion on this subject has changed since first playing with installed mods...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n~Firstly, lets consider the name of the game: Kerbal Space Program. Space. It isn\u0027t a war program, so no, I don\u0027t feel like BDA is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eever\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0a part of that by default. Sure, I would agree it\u0027s fun to blow stuff up, but how does a little ol\u0027 missile you can pack on your wing not equate to a tiny little rocket you could\u0027ve made yourself?? Cannons? PLEASE! Unless it\u0027s centered around interplanetary\u00A0or at\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eleast\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0intercontinental warfare AND comes with some antagonist(s) to defend/kill off, I\u0027m not even interested. TBH, that deserves a game unto itself-- oh wait... there are loads of those. Maybe I\u0027ll just play them a while\u00A0to get out the destructive feels so I can get back to work on the next venture of creativity.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n~Secondly, consider the nature of the little green kerbals\u00A0we know and love (in various ways.) The relative size difference between their head and the rest of their body should speak for itself here. Seriously... why are so many so enamored with aesthetics of a mess of planes and mostly phallic-looking contraptions? Oh, scale. xD Right. It not only has to be the biggest, but it also must be the\u00A0\u003Cu\u003Eprettiest!\u00A0\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u00A0Suit yourselves. It\u0027s still not a necessity with a well-thought-out design. In the worst cases, is \u0022work-around\u0022 a dirty word or something?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n~Last, but certainly not least, the aircraft-specific parts\u00A0mods. YES. Most definitely, I would agree that this is a part of interplanetary space travel and should be included. The Making History expansion gave no credit to the Wright brothers, Henri Giffard or DaVinci... nobody but CCCP and NASA. More friggin rockets, as if there weren\u0027t more rocket parts than I know what to do with already... I digress. The first powered flight was steam-driven, not a propeller, BUT! the vast majority of successful models through history have been/still are propeller-driven. I don\u0027t care nearly as much about using them at Kerbin as I do on Eve, Duna or Laythe, but that\u0027s on me. Especially with such awesome potential in hybrid electric or completely battery-operated propeller-driven planes as are on the real world market today.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven if some propellers getting in the part list is\u00A0all I can agree with being stock from your short list there, there are a great number which you don\u0027t bother mentioning which I believe KSP should not be without. I will not bother listing those here though. Mainly because I\u0027m of the mind that only some small part of the mod is truly necessary, or perhaps too niche to be considered. For instance, I\u0027ve wished for better piloting GUI and more than 10 action groups since I began. Work around that..? Can\u0027t. How about some moving parts? Oh sure, you can work around some stock hinges and things, but good luck with your part counts on a craptop like mine... Sadly, the only response I\u0027ll likely\u00A0get to that is not the stuff I need to streamline the game, but instead a list of minimum system requirements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RealKerbal3x","CreatedById":183830,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-12T09:41:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTweakscale\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emaybe\u003C/em\u003E, but definitely no BDA.
