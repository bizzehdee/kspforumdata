But since I play on a laptop those keys are always right in front of me and I rarely (never) used them on the joystick.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T04:53:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I put RCS translation (left, right, up, down) on the hat, but I use button 4 for RCS backward and button 6 for RCS forward since it seemed more forward/backward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI kept accidentally hitting that thumb button (#2), so I put Lights on that (since it\u0027s innocuous if accidentally pressed). I have Brakes on the trigger since I never activate any weapons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe buttons on the side are (top row): \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8 - landing gear\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10 - SAS toggle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12 - RCS toggle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(bottom row):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7 - Map view\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9 - SAS hold (I still find it useful when driving rovers)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11 - Throttle cutoff\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would have liked the rover forward/backward to be on the throttle control, but then I\u0027d have to keep remembering to turn off all other rocket/jet engines on my rover (which is inconvinient on my BirdDog airplane/rovers)\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 So I currently have rover forward/backward on the main pitch motion of the stick, but also on 5 and 3 buttons on top. Neither is very satisfactory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing able to yaw and roll simultaneously by tilting and twisting the stick is cool (although I saw somebody in a thread saying stick twist control was the work of the devil, or whatever), but I do have to set up a moderately wide dead zone on the twist control so I don\u0027t accidentally do it. That may be because my stick is situated too far off to the side at a bad angle on my desk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hardly ever used the arrow keys to control my view direction, but I find them very useful when using the joystick since trying to use both stick and mouse simultaneously is difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
