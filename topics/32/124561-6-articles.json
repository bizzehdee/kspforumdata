Obviously there will be stretches where you won\u0027t need to be doing anything, if we\u0027re going to integrate sleep periods into the actual mission, but when you\u0027re just flying through space or knocking around on the surface, there should probably be a plan in place for what to do to fill out the time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this could actually be a good thing PR wise, as you could take these opportunities to may be have people come onto the \u0022stream\u0022 (I imagine we\u0027ll be having this available for people to watch at some point, if not in real time) to talk about space, what they\u0027re doing, KSP, etc etc. Stuff like this would be excellent for the trips to and from the Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then for surface work, it really depends on which mission you want to emulate. Apollo 11 would be relatively simple (as it was in life), but wouldn\u0027t be that terribly interesting. Apollo 12 would be a bit more complicated with its pinpoint landing near an already landed Surveyor, but even so still not that interesting and including the launch and landing of an extra spacecraft as well as a requirement for launch windows (not necessarily a bad thing). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApollo 13 would be a given if something on the mission goes wrong, so no sense emulating that one on purpose. Apollo 14, again, would not be that terribly interesting. All thats left then is the last 3 Apollo missions, and thats where things get interesting, with the inclusion of the LRV as well as a wider focus on science and what not. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor our mission, it may be wisest to combine bits and bobs from 15-17 to fill out the surface stay, which I imagine we\u0027ll stick to being 1 day.[/quote\u0027]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember we may do more than one mission\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-08T11:47:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FCISuperGuy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FCISuperGuy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI suggest maybe running a few shorter simulations, such as perhaps one or two 1-2 hour 1=man orbital Mercury missions to gain experience controlling an orbital spacecraft, a 2-man Gemini mission lasting a few hours long to test docking and EVAs, and finally 2-3 day 3-man Apollo missions which can go to the Moon and perform tests with the LEM (like Apollo 10).
