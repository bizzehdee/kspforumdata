In addition, a lot of features are waiting for the release of a new version of Unity which will support better User Interfaces - putting these features in too soon will mean they need rewriting when the UI changes are implemented which will cause a lot of extra work; so it is better to leave them until later. Docking is quite an advanced feature in many ways and I *guess* it is very likely to be one of those features that is best left until later.

Every time they release a new update, it is like a whole new game. Most of the old ships I built need to be tweaked or redesigned. Plus there are planets and other challenges to try before docking. At first, when docking was not included in .15, I was angry. Then I realized, if I want Squad to make something good, I need to give them time. Honestly I would rather see the IVA for the remaining 2 cockpits first, then some sort of expanded IVA (with a payload bay or whatnot), then the idea of interior construction (for Space Lab-esque stations) for long term space missions, then docking and orbital construction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I had to guess, I would say that the next update would be the next 2 iva cockpits and sound stuff, possibly with the addition of a payload part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-13T07:28:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI personally think Squad is not quite taking docking seriously enough.
