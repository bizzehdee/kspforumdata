So I can\\\u0027t take off again ^^\\\u0027\n\nIf the shock is too big, it should be the gear that have to fail first, am I right?\n\nPs: sorry for my english mistakes ^^\\\u0027"},{"CreatedByName":"TheLowestBidder","CreatedById":12367,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-26T20:28:19Z","Content":"Do you mean the engine?

You\\\u0027ve attatched your landing gear to the part your engines are attached to, so the force of landing is transferred to the engine and it falls off. Put the small hardpoints facing downwards on your wings and stick the landing gear (plus struts so it doesn\\\u0027t twist and break) on those. That should fix it."}]}
