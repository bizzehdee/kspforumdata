Why will it be pointless? Well you will have a gas giant sized planet, with a gas giant sized gravity and extremely thick atmosphere, most likely much more so than Eve. Many long time players already know the challenge of getting around and off of Eve. Now imagine Eve infinitely worse though, a trap where nothing you land there will be able to get only a few meters off the ground at best, G\u0027s would be so extreme that it would kill Kerbals if you did manage to make a craft that could potentially escape (when G effects are added anyways). Then there would be the gravity issues, your craft will break extremely easily due to the extreme gravity, if a Kerbal fell over would they even be able to stand back up for that matter? Also it\u0027s distance would make it that much less favorable for some players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point is, if Squad went ahead and put this planet in, why would a player want to visit it? Unless they had modded engine parts and quantum struts it would just be so much more trouble than it would be worth with so little reward. I know there are a few players that like the near-impossible challenges, but this just seems plain impossible, like trying to land on Jool and return with stock parts impossible. I think a better decision would be to make this planet a gas giant and instead give one of its moons an extremely thick atmosphere with the mountainous terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T04:37:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps the uranus analog may get oxygen.

Jool has a surface gravity of 0,80G. Gas giants are heavy and have a huge SOI, but they\u0027re also not very dense. Saturn has an overall average density of about 0,8kg/L IIRC, which is similar to oil. Their \u0022surface\u0022 is so far away from the center of the planet that gravity this far out is already weakened. If gas giants were as dense as rocky planets, you would have insane surface gravity, but really surface gravity is rather low in that case.
