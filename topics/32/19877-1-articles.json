I made some weird contraption, and after my orbital mission, I had just enough fuel to get my orbit down. But something amazing happened. At the 36000 mark, it started going back up. I was upset because I could not get a picture, but I promise you it happened. When I went back around, it decided to enter the atmosphere and bring me home... I don\u0027t know how this happened but it was amazing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-22T15:43:51Z\u0022 title=\u002209/22/2012 03:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 22, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by NuclearWarfare\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"swiftgates24","CreatedById":22280,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-22T15:42:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E360,000m?

In 0.16, I did a variety of tests using high speed reentry starting from Minimus\u0027 height. Doing that, I determined that 30km was a good perigee to shoot for for reentry.
