As your apoapsis starts getting high enough, you can let the climb rate drop slowly and turn even closer to horizontal.

I was starting with a 12km apoapsis/periapsis. At that point, I was decoupling from the injection stage, burning to bring the pe down to just above terrain at my chosen target, and then when I was close (I calculated a 180-190s burn for the various designs, so I was starting the final burn about 90s to peri), I was burning purely horizontal at first, and then slowly pitching up to maintain descent rate close to zero. This exposes the craft though to dangers, specifically because the Map view uses a somehow-different model (yay for faulty LOD) for the planet as the actual space view, and you can find yourself intersecting a mountain or crater rim that looks a lot shorter on the map...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jouni\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jouni\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy standard approach to low-TWR landings is that landing is the inverse of reaching orbit. When you launch with low TWR, you first climb vertically to clear any nearby obstacles. Then you start to turn, still increasing the ascent rate, while also trying to gain horizontal velocity. When the ascent rate is high enough, you start concentrating on the horizontal velocity, while maintaining the ascent rate roughly constant. As your apoapsis starts getting high enough, you can let the climb rate drop slowly and turn even closer to horizontal. Ideally you should be at a somewhat circular orbit at the right altitude by the time you reach the apoapsis. To land with a low TWR, you just do everything in reverse order.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s.. roughly what I was doing for landing (in reverse. see above).

It\u0027s only the landings that differ. Also, one other thing about the high TWR design - it\u0027s significantly faster not only in real world time, but also Kerbal time. That could be important for a life-support enabled game (and is, for BTSM).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jouni\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jouni\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGetting that right usually takes much more than three attempts, because the game doesn\u0027t have any mission planning tools.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeh, I stuck my very first Mun landing using a high-ish TWR plan.
