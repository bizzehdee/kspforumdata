I started to think that after i see the caracteristics of Eve and Gilly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEve is really big (is the biggest\u00A0rocky planet of the game). And Gilly is really small (is the smallest body of the game, with the exception of the asteroids).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEve is the planet with the biggest gravity in the game (1.7 G).

Since 1.0, I believe. When 1.2 came out, I switched to it and it flew off the surface. I reloaded and landed another ship near it instead (to get it within physics range). I was then able to switch to it and discover the problem. It\u0027s not heavy enough, first off (I didn\u0027t know enough to make it bigger at the time), but the biggest problem was that 1.2 changed the drills. The large part of the drill (the top part of the drill itself) would no longer go into the ground. My drills were set too low and were now popping up off the ground (the same with all my ore-1.2 miners); and taking the base with it. I docked it to a science module, and I always keep the ore and fuel tanks full for ballast, and thus far, it\u0027s stayed on the surface. Even without it trying to float away though, it\u0027s tedious to use for refueling, and always has been. I\u0027ve only used it a handful of times because of it. It\u0027s still there though. Have to see how many more updates it survives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Space Kadet","CreatedById":166557,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-31T15:09:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmaybe its a nod to\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neith_(hypothetical_moon)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENeith\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taylanian","CreatedById":194830,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-17T14:33:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you\u0060ve got a point\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fixsme","CreatedById":186447,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-18T10:21:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223207914\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022167020\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221509462577\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166557\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Space Kadet\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/31/2017 at 4:09 PM, Space Kadet said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmaybe its a nod to\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neith_(hypothetical_moon)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENeith\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually Venus has at least one\u00A0quasi-satellite\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_VE68\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E2002 VE68\u003C/a\u003E, which is more like an asteroid to me (0,5 km)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
