I\u0027d actually say that Kerbals are more serious about space exploration than humans; they have a constant wide-eyed childlike curiosity toward their universe, without any political or nationalistic baggage. Exploring space is all they\u0027ve got to worry about, so they can very well make a damn good job of it. I do love the pride of a rocket with U N I T E D S T A T E S printed down the side, but KSP (as it comes \u0027out of the box\u0027, stock) is about the pure undistilled wonder of space exploration, and it needs its own characters and setting to draw sufficiently far away from the historicity that might drag these themes into... well, historical simulation. KSP isn\u0027t a historical game. You can mod it to be one, but as provided it\u0027s about possibilities rather than limitations and I think the childish characters go hand-in-hand with that; after all, it is children that ask the most poignant questions about everything until adults typically shut them up.
