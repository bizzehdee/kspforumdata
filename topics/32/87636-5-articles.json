But that was on their real homeworld, when they had a very different name for themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMillions of years ago, a space-faring species secretly visited the homeworld of what we now know as Kerbals and kidnapped a male member of the dominant species. They took him back to the planet that we now wrongly call Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou see, these kidnappers needed a slave species and had a key technology; \u003Cem\u003Ecloning\u003C/em\u003E. Unwilling to clone and enslave members of their own species, and lacking a native species that was usable for productive work, they found these little, green, peaceful simpletons to be ideal. The abductee they chose - whose name was Jebediah - was particularly good with machines, easily trained, lacked any care for his personal safety and so suited their purpose perfectly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Time rolled on and every home eventually had a Jebediah. Leisure time for the kidnappers increased exponentially and much like the Roman empire, they became decadent. Eventually an argument over wallpaper led to one of them launching a comet at another\u0027s house. That\u0027s where the big circle crater came from. In the following devestation, the entire population of the planet was wiped out. But one clone factory survived, still automatically creating Jebediahs. Unfortunately, it was subtly damaged, so small errors in replication were introduced. Bob and Bill were created. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith their masters gone, the \u0022Kerbals\u0022 inherited their late masters\u0027 technology, and started using it. And that\u0027s when we discovered them. And now we\u0027re going to give them females to give them back their heritage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlot twist: Not all of the kidnappers were on-planet at the time of course. Some survived, and we know them as \u0022Krakens\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s my back-story for them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-28T19:35:05Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2014 07:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Frannington\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tg626","CreatedById":112361,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T19:50:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Frannington\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Frannington\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s my back-story for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot bad! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"I_Killed_Jeb","CreatedById":84817,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T21:27:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elol at the ridiculous logical contortions and mental gymnastics people at undergoing to \u0027prove\u0027 kerbals aren\u0027t obvious representations of males\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallace","CreatedById":77574,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T21:53:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use texture replacer so I can have boy and girl kerbals, having different kerbal faces is the main reason I use it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T22:19:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey are the neutral worker drones distributing space spores while the queen and her male concubinos live in the underground city.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E/silly\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Holo","CreatedById":39606,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T17:03:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerbMav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerbMav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Econcubinos\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey look, my new favourite word.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T17:50:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAsexual semi-plantlike humanoids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey reproduce by spores.
