It works by multiplying the weight by the \u0027drag\u0027 stat of the part, which is more like a coefficient than an actual amount of drag. There\u0027s no accounting for shape or parts being blocked by other parts. The only thing it takes account of are speed, atmospheric pressure, weight, and the drag stat of the parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means, for a start, that both of your \u0027nosecone\u0027 setups are presently less efficient than *using no nosecone at all*. You\u0027re ADDING drag on top of the additional weight. This isn\u0027t the case if you use the FAR mod, but in stock it very much is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, the general idea goes a lot further: The new cylindrical radial RCS tanks have the same dry weight as the size 1 inline tank, but holds half again as much monopropellant. This means two cylindrical radial tanks hold as much monopropellant as three inline tanks, for the dry weight of only two inline tanks. The Delta-Deluxe winglets provide more lift than the AV-R8s for the same weight and drag (although possibly weaker control force, I\u0027m not sure). The Canards provide stronger control forces, for twice the weight and twice the drag. The Ram Air Intake provides more intakeair than any other intake, and is tied for the lightest (which should negate its higher drag coefficient), and has the same cap on the extra drag as all the rest of them (it just gets there faster, but if you\u0027re hitting the super to hyper sonic regime they ALL get there anyway). The AV-T1 has more than twice the weight (and thus drag) as the Tail Fin, for the same effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe list goes on and on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut as one of my friends points you, you have to remember there are other balancing factors here we don\u0027t have yet.
