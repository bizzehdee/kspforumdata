The first is to claim the mod is a derivative work, and thus as the copyright holder of the original work they have considerable power to restrict the distribution of the derivative. I don\u0027t know if there\u0027s any case law on whether a mod is considered a derivative work though. The second would be to claim the restrictions are part of the contract, ie the EULA. That might be less likely to hold up since contractual terms can be deemed unfair or otherwise void by a court, but then again I suspect that an outright ban on modmaking and mod distribution would be upheld, and that\u0027s more restrictive than an only-through-official-channels rules. Again, no idea if there\u0027s been any similar cases in the past.\u003Cp\u003E/armchairlawyering\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpsterMan","CreatedById":32671,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-13T01:13:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay fellas, I would like to put out this smaller fire early.
