So I suddenly couldn\u0027t RCS backward (because the station was thrusting in the same direction..) and the shuttle slammed into the back of my station blowing off the last docking port and the last module attached and destroying two of the four parachutes on my shuttle... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDidn\u0027t quicksave during any of that... and now my station can\u0027t expand any more (since it has no more docking ports..) and I don\u0027t know if my shuttle can land safely (Columbia...)so I may have to send a rescue team up to bring them back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo frustrating!!

I eventually landed it and felt proud of myself, but then when I tried to warp it back to KSC I forgot to account for the Kerbal getting tons of Experience and me getting tons of Reputation and Science for landing on Tylo. In order to undo this I had to scroll through my save file and remove all references to having visited Tylo, and I came uncomfortably close to corrupting the whole thing and losing the whole save.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-04T00:55:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had one incident recently early in a career where bob was in a ship orbiting mun colecting EVA reports. several reports had been taken just fine but then right after he got out of the pod to take another his orbital velocity droped to 0 for no apparent reason. So here he is at 35km above the surface falling strait down as his ship takes off without him. no quicksave to undo the bug so I boost him to orbit on his jetpack. He has just enough to make it to orbit and get close to the same orbit as his craft but ran out just as he was geting close with about 2 m/s difference and not lined up enough to hit the door. Couldn\u0027t control his original pod (had probe for SAS but RT2 and I forgot to extend the antina) Sent up a rescue craft but after several faild passes trying to manuver a craft so a free floating kerbal could grab a ladder I gave up and edited the persist to give him a touch of EVA fuel.
