It had science labs, a reusable lander (over 5k dV, but I would have had to use the one-time staging to achieve that) that I only ended up using once and I\u0027m glad I did that, and science like crazy. The mission was worth about 2,200 science and I probably could have brought back more had I been able to run the science lab at full power more of the time. It only cost like 225k funds. I made it to Duna but unfortunately I hadn\u0027t hooked the fuel lines up right for the nuke so the transfer stage was gypped of maybe 1k dV or so, just a guestimation. Then I get there and my periapsis was too high for an aerocapture, so I had to expend maybe 150 dV to get it right. I finally made it to orbit. The landing went great, no issues with that, even rendezvous went smoothly with MechJeb\u0027s autopilot. Then I burned out of orbit back to Kerbin. Neither transfer was optimal -- the initial transfer cost me 1.6k and the return cost me 1.3k (which was not using a nuke by the way, it used a Poodle), which is at least 400 more than optimal in both cases. I get back to Kerbin, and used a Munar slowdown to put my periapsis down to 26k. Then I realize I\u0027ll have to land the entire science lab -- which is huge by the way -- on Kerbin, because there are 4 Kerbals and the lander only takes 1. And the only thing with parachutes is the Duna lander. So I keep it attached and come screeching into the atmosphere at over 4.5 km/s pulling 14 G\u0027s on these poor guys, and of course Jeb and Valentina are all happy while Bill and Bob are freaking out. I come down and figure out that the Poodle engine really sucks deep in the atmosphere, and I really have a sub-1 TWR and the science lab can\u0027t take hitting the ocean at the 11 m/s the parachutes can slow it down to. After a few reloads in which the lab smacks down and only Jeb in the lander survived the crash, I bailed everyone out at 800 meters up and the science lab (with about 300 or so potential science in the form of data inside) blows up, and so does the 2-man capsule containing about 100 science. But the lander is intact, the one with all the surface samples from duna and most of the scientific instruments. And all the Kerbals are alive! So I recovered the vessel and now I know for next time, plan ahead better/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T05:05:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn recent memory... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a doomed mun colony mission.

I had my CSM in orbit around the Mun at about 25k and my lander on the surface. I guess I under-designed my lander or over-burned on landing because I barely had any fuel left in the lander after touchdown. I figured I had enough fuel to get as high as a 10k sub orbital trajectory, but I had nowhere near enough fuel to get orbital at any altitude. So i fired the lander up at a 45 degree angle and flew on that trajectory until the fuel ran out. I had timed it so the CSM would be flying by and managed to get 2 intercepts of the lander\u0027s trajectory. I switched over to the CSM and was able to get it close enough to dock on the second intercept (as the lander was now heading back down to crash into the surface). I was able to dock the two craft about 4k above the surface and then use the CSM engine to boost both craft back up to a 25k by 25k orbit. Once safely in orbit, I transferred the crew to the CSM, ditched the lander and sent them back to Kerbin. And i did this all on the first try!
