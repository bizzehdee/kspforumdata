This happens with most every game release nothing to see here really. Change can be hard, but it is often needed. A lot of the complaints I see are ones that are easily resolved by just revering back to your previous version of choice. \n\nI for one am enjoying the changes but do agree that they are going to make me relearn a lot of stuff. A lot of the changes that are causing me trouble are ones that make the game more realistic so thats a good thing in my opinion."},{"CreatedByName":"Gunso","CreatedById":103860,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T04:50:41Z","Content":"i like the changes\n\nit made me feel like playing a new game with new toys to play around\n\nthis game really worth every penny"},{"CreatedByName":"Dizzle","CreatedById":31588,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T05:28:29Z","Content":"A lot of people ARE happy, myself included, but it doesn\u0027t mean the criticisms are invalid."},{"CreatedByName":"Daid","CreatedById":32171,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T05:29:20Z","Content":"People need to change how they where playing, due to changes to earo, heating and chutes.\n\nPeople don\u0027t like changing in general.\n\nWait 2 weeks, see that the complains will have gone down to a minimal.

They changed things that didn\u0027t need changing. And I\u0027m not talking about aerodynamics and rockets flopping upside down. I can adapt to that. Parts have been changed that didn\u0027t need changing. Like the MK1 Inline. Looks like a damned jelly bean on a bagel. Like solar panels you can no longer retract. The keyboard has been remapped. Wait till you try to dock. Toggling between translation and rotation does nothing. And NOW, if you have stages and you try to switch between the two... you stage. And... to make it even more fun, to switch between translation and rotation, you have to move your hand across the keyboard OR use two hands.

Unlike many others, I took a 2-3 month break from this game, I haven\u0027t touched it most of this year since beta actually. I did this specifically because I knew they were reworking significant parts of the game. That means old ships, saves, mods, and everything inbetween may not work anymore.\n\nTonight is the first time I started up the game in a long time and I started with a clean slate; no mods, no old saves, brand new career mode, relearning the new physiques engine.
