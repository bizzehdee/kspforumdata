But during the last 2-3 Days I\u0027ve written down everything that I\u0027d wish the devs would address. Most of my issues are editor related and they announced already a big rewamp of the editor in the next version, so some points might be obsolete by then. Also, although I\u0027ve clocked already 200 hours inside KSP I still consider myself a beginner and learn new things about it on a daily basis, so maybe some of the issues are only an issue because I don\u0027t know how to do it right:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEditor:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Rocket vs Airplane Hangar: Please replace the two hangars with one hangar where you can switch by hotkey between Airplane or Rocket editor mode. It\u0027s not so easy to add a modell that you have build in the airplane hangar , say a Rover or Shuttle, to a Rocket you\u0027re building in the Rocket Hangar. I\u0027d really love to see a better way of integration between this two modes. Right now the only way is to save the model you\u0027ve done in one editor as a Subassambly and than use this in the other Editor. This would be fine if there would not be one major issue: The part from the Subassambly menu only has one connection point for whatever reason, in my example I could attach the Rover only in the middle of one of it\u0027s Axis, although there are plenty more as I see in the original Editor where I\u0027ve build it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Make the parts more snappy in the right place. Attaching a Booster to radial Decoupler in 4, 6 or 8-way symmetry mode is one of the most annoying tasks in the game. When I drag the booster near the decoupler it should just snap into the right place, not be attached to the left or right of the decoupler as it is very often the case. It\u0027s only an issue when you are at least in 4-way mode because the view then is limited and for the love of the universe I just cannot see if the booster is positioned right until I let go of the mouse. No sorry mate, it\u0027s again left, let\u0027s try again. To make things harder, when you click on the part it \u0022snaps\u0022 onto the mouse pointer so you literally have to guess each time if you\u0027ve positioned it right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Therefor, please don\u0027t make parts snap onto the mouse pointer when you click on them but do not move the mouse. It should stay in place where it is so I can micro adjust (shift\u002Bwasdeq) it\u0027s position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Some parts \u0022sink\u0022 into others, I tried to attach a ladder to a structural platform but instead of getting placed on top, it was placed inside the platform, no chance to have it \u0022on\u0022 the platform. I hope this will be fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It would be great to have a hotkey that when I press it, it let\u0027s me move a part vertically up and down while staying on the same horizontal position. Say I select a part, press and hold ctrl and scroll the mouse wheel or move the mouse forth and back, this should move the part up and down. Would help alot when you want to achieve placement symmetry between lower and upper parts of a larger rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Navigating inside the hangar with the mouse around the modell can also become quite a frustrating task, especially in Rocket mode. There seem to be two areas in the Rocket Hangar, inside and outside of the white circle that is painted on the ground. It happens sometimes that a rocket get\u0027s outside the white circle and then you are in troubles. The zoom is very limited, once the modell is outside the circle you can only zoom in half the way to the object and you also cannot longer go around the model. Getting it back into the circle is also tricky and took me a while to figure it out, you need to flip the rocket up, circle and flip it down again. Therefor please introduce a hotkey or similar to reset position of the model, so it gets placed on the ground in the middle of the hangar and eliminated the issues with the white circle. A zoom that is always free would be nice but even better would be the possibility to switch between build- and navigation view, the later being totally free and not focused around an object. Having Airplane/Rocket Editor in one hangar would achieve a similar effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I\u0027d also love to see more parts for everything Rover, more structural parts to build them, more different drives (chaindrive, kerosin/gas driven), better deployement and attachment possibilities, maybe some sort of a buildable cargobay with moving doors or even a crane if you really want to get crazy. There are probably addons for this but given the volatile state of the game (as in \u0022many things change from version to version\u0022) I prefer to stick to stock parts. And rovers are a really cool way to get around the planet as I just discovered recently \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay this post becomes too long for probably anyone besides a dev, so I\u0027ll hurry up now.

Or at least give us an option to click on a modell nearby and switch to it. It\u0027s possible in the map view but my planets and moons get more crowded day by day and then the map view select is useless because all models are drawn on the place, making selecting a specific model impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Just a small request but while you\u0027re at it... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E Could you make the default orientation for rocket editor and launchpad 90 degrees?

Landing on Dunna with only Tier 5 Parts painted a big at grin on my face for the day. It combines two of my favorite things, space and science and also let\u0027s you build stuff that really works. I spend hours sometimes thinking about new concepts on how to do this and that and other hours just thinking about what \u0022this and that\u0022 could be next. So I hope this post is regarded as an appreciation for the game and the work the devs put in it and not as pure criticism.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-16T15:54:24Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2014 03:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by milosh\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"I_Killed_Jeb","CreatedById":84817,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T15:52:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fingal\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fingal\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027d like to see accomplishments required to unlock part of the tech tree.

You are then given points to unlock tech. Unlocking it gives you an experimental version (the game already does this sort of). The difference is that this version would be below the nominal spec of the part we see now. Upon completion of the mission (which might include \u0022test\u0022 contracts), you get points to really \u0022buy\u0022 the tech, at which point you get the better version (\u0022buff\u0022 to the units normal capability).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis gives a much more open-ended campaign, too. You could spring for missions farther afield right off the bat, or slowly build up better tech. Note that modders could then make the X tech have some chance of failures...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
