A tanker sitting at the station is the same as permanent tanks. However, for lag reasons, a tanker ship is going to be many more parts than some fuel tanks (maybe ~50 versus ~10), so that tanker could make it annoying for other ships to dock, better to just dock the tanker, refuel the tanks, and get out quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hoylemd","CreatedById":116129,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T23:10:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eooh, good point. it doesnt have to be refuelled from Kerbin.
