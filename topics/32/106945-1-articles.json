If you do not adapt now, then waiting for v1.1 will only leave you disappointed, because I believe the new aero system will simply be more enhanced--perhaps more forgiving (and I don\u0027t know who will win the tug of war) but still, you have to get used to the fact that it requires a different approach now to reach orbit on any world with an atmosphere."},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T01:54:54Z","Content":"I do have at least two other copies of 0.90 saved, but as far as my main playthrough is concerned I am in 1.0.2.

While I think that \u00221.0\u0022 brings a lot of great new additions, it seems quite rushed and still has a lot of place holders (water, terrain scatter, career). I feel the same with the indecisosphere that is KSP 1.0, 1.0.1 and 1.0.2, so until FAR is updated for 1.0 I\u0027ll be playing 0.90-FAR."}]}
