It has lots of compatibility issues with other mods. It has issues every time KSP has been updated/changed etc. For better or worse, you can get away with the limitations of the mod, but for squad to release an official MP it will have to play nice with third party mods etc. The main point still being that MP will be a challenge best suited for after they get 1.0 nice and stable."},{"CreatedByName":"FrostyMug","CreatedById":141766,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T16:17:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E FrostyMug, perhaps you should try the DMP mod before citing it as an example for what stock should be.
