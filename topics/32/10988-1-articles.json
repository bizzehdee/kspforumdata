Persistence was my one singular issue that I had with the early updates, I am soo happy that they added it!\n\nAnd the new mun... Now time to make ANOTHER vanilla rocket powerful enough to explore it... Does it have the same mechanics as the original Mun?"},{"CreatedByName":"Imandreas","CreatedById":18071,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T04:26:22Z","Content":"The new second one is smaller, has an inclined orbit, and is farther away.

I have some time to explore the new updates this week before more stuff comes up, so I am very happy to do so. I\\\u0027m extremely interested in the new vanilla stuff that has came out. Unfortunately for my own learning curve, I absolutely hate using other people to learn the functions of these parts, so it is going to take me DAYS to figure out the functions, and the paterns of everything."},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T04:50:46Z","Content":"I will gladly help you with whatever you\\\u0027re having trouble with.\n\nKosmo-Not here at the forums is also ***really*** helpful when it comes to stock parts and efficiency.
