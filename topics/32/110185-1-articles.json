I try to play \u0022reasonably realistic\u0022 e.g. no clipping and reasonably well designed flight-worthy rockets. For me, the revert button is sort of like the simulator or trainer that any good space program would have. I\u0027ve played long enough to avoid my \u0022rookie mistakes\u0022 of forgetting parachutes or solar panels, but still getting a feel for the new aero and new parts. Flipping rockets can be quite humorous, but eventually I\u0027ll revert to the VAB and look to fix things. Because there is no way a rocket should flip end-over-end and still get to orbit.
