In Level 2, though, it\u0027s clear as day. persistent.sfs even has \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003ESpaceCenter/VehicleAssemblyBuilding/Facility/SouthComplex\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003Eintact = true\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/zcQt61g.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zcQt61g.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-03T02:35:05Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2015 02:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by amorymeltzer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ededupe\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Random Tank","CreatedById":104325,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T06:47:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the upper limit for high atmosphere definitions it\u0027s always where the atmosphere ends; for Eve this is 96.7km, for Duna it is 41.4km, and for Laythe it is 55.2km. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the border between upper and lower atmosphere on Laythe is around 10.2km, and for Duna it\u0027s roughly 11.7km. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEeloo\u0027s high/low space border is definitely 60km; and there is a typo on Jool\u0027s Low Space lower limit, it needing to be 138km, not 118km.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
