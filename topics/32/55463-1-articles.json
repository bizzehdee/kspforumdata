But I think it\u0027s important that the stats of all existing bodies don\u0027t change significantly (except moving Eeloo to be a moon of a second gas giant, as has been talked about for a while) so I wouldn\u0027t use the third option; yes, the Joolian moons are bigger than any in our own solar system, as is Moho, but honestly I think that makes for a better game. The Galilean moons have surface gravities comparable to our own Moon, with no atmospheres, and that just isn\u0027t a challenge. You can land on Mun with very primitive designs, after all, so scaling down Jool\u0027s moons would mean the only challenge would be getting to Jool from Kerbin, and that\u0027s a non-issue once you get LV-Ns. KSP\u0027s smaller scale adds a sort of surreal quality to the gameplay, and the relative scales seem to reflect that well (unless you download the realistic solar system mod, of course).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main reason for liking the status quo for existing bodies is simply one of community. These boards are one of the things that really separates this game from the others I\u0027ve played recently, and it\u0027d be a shame to lose the commonality at the core of that. If we\u0027re having a conversation about designs that can reach Laythe from Kerbin, there\u0027s a big difference between accomplishing that in the core game, where they\u0027re halfway across the system from each other, versus in your proposal where they\u0027re adjacent moons of the same planet. Adding new planets and moons, or changing aesthetics, won\u0027t affect that. Minor gameplay changes are fine, like adding a very thin atmosphere to Moho (just enough to give it a haze, without really affecting takeoffs or landings), but I don\u0027t think you should do anything that\u0027d require you to preface your accomplishments with \u0022...but I\u0027m using this mod\u0022 when describing them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I\u0027d suggest is simply this: add a second gas giant using that nice blue coloration you\u0027ve assigned to Jool, at Eeloo\u0027s current position. (Keep Jool green. As the wise man said, it\u0027s not easy being green.) While Saturn is a bit smaller than Jupiter, and Uranus/Neptune even more so, I\u0027d like this one to be bigger than Jool to make it more visible from the inner planets. Give it four moons, in order from near to far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; Innermost is that small red Minmus, with a pretty severe orbital tilt. No atmosphere, no water, just a low-gravity rock in a painful orbit. (It\u0027s a captured Kuiper object, not a natural moon, so the usual patterns of orbits don\u0027t really apply.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; Next is a rocky Titan-type moon, smaller than Kerbin (~0.5g surface gravity) but with an Eve-thick atmosphere, containing just enough oxygen for jets to function at low altitudes. This\u0027d be the best place to play with planes and the thick atmosphere would make it a significant challenge to take off from with rockets despite the lower gravity. It\u0027d only have minimal oceans (\u0026lt;10%), with large mountains extending most of the way up through the atmosphere (a la Olympus Mons).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; Then comes your Super Tylo, huge surface gravity and a thin atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; Finally, Eeloo as the outermost moon. Ideally this\u0027d get cryovolcanoes and a very thin atmosphere (like that Moho suggestion above), but even as a naked almost-featureless ball it\u0027d be nice as a convenient place for a mining base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you could give this new gas giant rings (remembering to leave gaps where the moons are) and tilt its moons\u0027 plane relative to the ecliptic, even better. Regardless, the net result would be to add what is, in effect, a \u0022hard mode\u0022 planetary system containing a bunch of very challenging, interesting bodies for people who\u0027ve accomplished all the important feats in the stock game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat way, all accomplishments involving the existing bodies are unchanged. (Also, savegames wouldn\u0027t suddenly fail as objects orbiting each existing body crash due to changed gravities. Rovers and such on planets with changed terrains would have issues, of course, but I think the terrain changes are a bit more necessary.) If I talk about how I finally landed on Adlivun and Svarga, the first and third moons of Ghoti (or whatever you name them), people won\u0027t think I\u0027m talking about Tylo, the second moon of Jool in their stock game; they might not get the particular reference I\u0027m making, and would need to search the boards to find your mod, but there\u0027d be no question of whether they\u0027d accomplished the same feat already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, more planets and moons gives us more stuff to do.
