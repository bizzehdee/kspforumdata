In game code it may be implemented that way but (presuming they\u0027re smart in how they present in game), it will, in fact, be kerbals learning how to drive better, not the engine getting more horsepower. Is the effect between the engine increasing horsepower and the kerbal flying better effectively the same?

If there was a autopilot-esque system whereby the player could order the Kerbal to perform a planned manuever or finish up a docking, then yes, having the Kerbal do better or worse at that would be the Kerbals skill.

As you get better at performing tasks in KSP, you use less resources to do those tasks and get better results. Even though it makes perfect sense that Kerbals too would get better at them, the fact remains that \u003Cem\u003Ethe player is the one controlling the craft\u003C/em\u003E. Having them be able to make vessels suddenly get better ISP or thrust just by being inside of them doesn\u0027t really compute. Improving the control of the pitch/yaw/roll of the craft subtly based on the pilot, however, makes a bit more sense if we assume that the baseline control values listed are when you have an average pilot in the command seat. A skilled pilot genuinely can outperform an inexperienced one when it comes to maneuvering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I see no issue with Kerbals getting better science and reputation rewards from their experience.

It should never be a bonus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample - You can put me behind the wheel of a Formula 1 car and I am not going to be able to get nearly the performance out of it that a professional driver can. Why? Because I\u0027m not experienced. The overall physics of the car remains unchanged - what changes is the driver\u0027s ability to make use of it all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the same way, if a particular engine has an ISP of 360, then that\u0027s what it has. An inexperienced pilot not using it at the exact right time or in the exact orientation could be abstracted by assigning a penalty to an inexperienced pilot, but it should never go beyond what the physics sets. The only way logically I can see around this is to say \u0022oh by the way, every single part stat only represents 90% of the actual physics and game capacity of that part\u0022 which will annoy a lot of people, but we\u0027ll get over it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most important thing in my mind is to keep some sort of log, a la Final Frontier (which I\u0027m currently using and enjoying very much). That way you have an idea of who has done what, with a record kept in the game. It can be used for everything from contract generation \u0022take three kerbals who have each performed at least five missions and land them on Duna\u0022 to a bigger reputation hit for losing an experienced kerbal, to perhaps unlocking minor special abilities in the game. An example of this last one would be that someone would have to have the engineer trait to do something like attaching a part via KAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only gameplay mechanic I can think of that would really work is reaction time. Experienced pilot equals instant response, while inexperienced pilot means that there\u0027s a slight delay when doing what the player tells the kerbal to do. Of course, it would be annoying, but probably realistic - the inexperienced guy panics and has to consult the manual when the rocket is disintegrating around him.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Franklin","CreatedById":89718,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T04:39:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor those curious what our Reddit cousins think on it, it\u0027s just more of the same,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/sM9Fl1T.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sM9Fl1T.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this tidbit thrown in, which clarifies but doesn\u0027t make the proposed system sound any better,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/1zKhgw5.png\u0022 alt=\u00221zKhgw5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
