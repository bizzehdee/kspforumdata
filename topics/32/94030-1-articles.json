After running a few missions, I noticed that my reputation... was not going up. It seemed to be more or less frozen in place, in fact, despite the fact that I was still getting appreciable amounts of it from contracts. Curious, I checked the quicksave file before and after running a contract with a decently high reputation payout. Before the contract was completed, my rep was 490.8923. After, it was 490.1023. Even though I was supposedly gaining reputation from the contract according to the game, it was actually stealing my reputation away! Something\u0027s definitely buggy here, so consider this fair warning: use reputation-to-anything strategies at your own risk!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aragosnat","CreatedById":60487,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T21:13:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah. Noticed that too. Just not in depth. Would be nice if we could gain max rep even with our rep being eaten up. But, I guess since we are beating up our rep.
