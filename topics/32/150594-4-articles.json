At that point I did have the impression the game was about throwing nuclear submarines into Jupiter or whatever it was. Years later a colleague at university told me that he was playing this game (KSP) in co-op mode and that it was incredibly hard and realistic. Apparently he wasted a day with his colleague building a space station... Asked him a few questions, downloaded the demo and gave it a try. Landing on the Mun, Minmus and rendezvous\u0027ing in the demo version became easy at some point, so I decided to purchase the full game...after all, wasting a lot of time might be worth an investment.
