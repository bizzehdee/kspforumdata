I almost have quit using the game. I barely play it anymore because I know exactly what\u0027s going to happen. I\u0027ll get frustrated by incomplete features that have been incomplete for a very long time, with multiple requests over that time period to actually sort them out that haven\u0027t been heeded. - Rocket wobble is a great example, and Unity engine and Development Asymptotes a poor excuse. 2.5m parts have been around for a long time and still are very poor. Extra rigidbody connections, which are placed at a spacing determined by the difference in mass of the two parts could solve this. See? A possible solution!\u003Cp\u003EOr how about a lot of talk about how we could stick a Kerbal on SRB, even an endorsed comic showing it so - when in actuality we can\u0027t without having some way of spawning the Kerbal first, as apparently seats aren\u0027t crewable! Look at it this way - Assign Kerbal to seat, seat starts with the Kerbal\u0027s data (this can be done with ANY part at all, I have made seats able to do this part) and then the seat during physics loading spawns a new part, which is the Kerbal. They should have all the code they need available to do that in their hands, very quickly - same with the previous suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth have had quite a few requests floating around to be done and I know Devs have had contact with both. Why has there not even been acknowledgement of these and other problems? Its always about the next big feature. I\u0027ve only heard of \u0022fixing ASAS\u0022 for updates on previous updates, but that isn\u0027t the best solution. people are asking for options to have BOTH the old ASAS and new SAS.

The games continual development (and its community for that matter who support it) are its biggest PR pluses (which will lead to sales of course!). New features is great, but listen to the feedback of the community and update those new features on the next update based on the feedback, to provide the strongest basis for the next features.

Because even if this exists right now, there doesn\u0027t seem to be any evidence for it. How about the weekly having a section on previous version feedback and intended changes based upon that?
