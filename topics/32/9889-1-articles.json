Why not add asteroids that orbit the Sun and we can land on them. creative add ons would come where you could mine the asteroid.. And perhaps sell the loot to buy new parts for your ship (if money ever has a role in the game). Plus, as there would be a lot of asteroids to explore, there would be a lot of places to put easter eggs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Candre","CreatedById":15181,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-25T04:17:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/story/2012-04-24/mining-asteroids/54507782/1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPlanetary Resources\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the OP intended to link to the article ^^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsteroids, AFAIK, are planned.

Would be cool do stuff like they plan on doing such as mining water, setting up a processing facility to separate the hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel. Then set up a refueling station in orbit. Sell the usage to other space programs. Or to move small asteroids into earth orbit, mine them for metals, send some home for profit or build space stations. This would be fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
