The numbers say it should now be capable of pulling off a landing on Moho and a return to orbit afterwards. Combining that with the Mohole 7 rocket I designed just the other day, I\u0027ve got the tools now for a Moho Orbital Rendezvous mission, so plans are now in the works for my first trip out that way. Not sure the Storax Sedan 7 design as it sits could make it to Moho; in fact I\u0027m pretty sure it can\u0027t, but I need to crunch the numbers to be sure. It\u0027d be nice to have something to drive/do once I make it out that way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T16:37:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlayed around with my ICBT.
