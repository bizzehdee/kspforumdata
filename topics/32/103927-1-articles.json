This is true if you use a lot of mods and no Texture Management tools. The 32-bit EXE is far more stable on Windows, so it\u0027s probably best to stick to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerformance wise, there\u0027s not a lot in it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T16:28:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo more then the 32bit .exe.

Also, beware that many mods will not run with the 64bit Windows version, as modders don\u0027t see any reason to code around bugs in 64bit KSP. (The mods do run with the 64bit Linux version though, which is about as stable as the 32bit Linux version.).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
