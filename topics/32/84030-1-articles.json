I\u0027ve had ups and downs, amazing successes, and many catastrophic failures. But something\u0027s putting me off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI prefer the game with mods, so I often have quite a few mods on. Annoyingly this means I often have to start a new career whenever a new update comes along. I don\u0027t mind doing that, I can try new things and missions I\u0027ve never done before, and experience new emergent narratives my imagination comes up with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut each time I start a new career, the first couple of hours is always the same, getting the first few tiers of the science tree by doing quick Kerbin missions, and of course landing in the moon and collecting all the science. These first few basic things I\u0027ve done so many times I couldn\u0027t put a number on it. And it\u0027s starting to get really boring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know about mods like \u0022better than starting manned\u0022 which would give me a fresh new career. But that\u0027s designed to work without other mods, and I want other mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo do you have any suggestions to keep KSP fresh? To keep it interesting for those first few tiers of the science tree before I unlock the mod parts to make it feel different?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-07T12:20:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheat enough science to unlock jets, then play as normal.

I took advantage from the fact that there are some contracts that give a lot of science to avoid going the same science collect route as always. Here\u0027s what I did:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- With just a command pod, I gathered all the science I could get from the launchpad and runway. This allowed me to unlock the first three or four nodes, giving me enough parts to build a basic spaceworthy rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Then I took all the contracts for testing parts landed on Kerbin and in Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- For the \u0022landed\u0022 contracts, I treated those as if I was just testing the parts in my R\u0026amp;D facility: attached the part to a command pod, staged it and recovered the craft. Easy money and science --\u0026gt; useful to unlock a few more nodes, but not the main mode of advancement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The \u0022orbit\u0022 contracts I treated like satellite deployment contracts: if they wanted me to test the LV-1 engine, for instance, I created a small satellite with a probe core, batteries, solar panels and antennae (and, of course, fuel tanks and the aforementioned engine). After a few launches I ended up with a network of satellites around Kerbin, each one with a different engine type, and each on an eccentric orbit going from 70km to about 1000km high. That way, I could just use the same satellites over and over again if I get new contracts to test again those parts that were already on a sat that I put in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy doing that I managed to unlock the whole tech tree while doing only two visits to the Mun and two to Minmus, and gave me a much more satisfying sense of roleplay.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Schmonzo","CreatedById":5728,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-07T13:23:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInstall realistic construction time and final frontier (don\u0027t reload and permadeath) and your choice of other mods.
