Utilize lighter armor (wing plates) and/or less armor, as steel plating and/or custom hulls in general do indeed add dry mass to your ship.

Improve your propulsion system- this could be cramming more fuel tanks inside your hull, swapping your engine(s) out for alternative designs, and/or adding \u0022booster\u0022 modules that can be added or removed depending on whether the ship is engaged in active combat or not. The trade-off here is that varying engine setups come with varying sizes and dry masses, and more fuel tanks means more vulnerable, squishy, low-impact-tolerance stuff squeezed into the same size space within your hull.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Learn to plan your logistics around your ship\u0027s existing range- if this means having a fuel tanker/supply ship accompany it in a flotilla, then do so.

Why would the US and China go head to head in an all-out conflict over some mining pits? That has absolutely nothing essential to do with what I\u0027m trying to say, and your assumption of a \u002290% unobtanium asteroid\u0022 goes to show that you either hardly read what I wrote or barely comprehended it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I want to say is that there is room for open conflict in space. That does not just mean \u0022gigantic battles between Earth-based empires, but in space\u0022. Open warfare is carried out on Earth on a daily basis without the world\u0027s superpowers escalating immediately to DEFCON 1. That doesn\u0027t necessarily mean that the first asteroid miners in space are going to go beating each other up with mining lasers or whatever. But if you have an in-space economy large enough to support large-scale asteroid mining, you have an in-space economy large enough to support open conflict in space. That doesn\u0027t mean that people are going to instantly invade one another on Earth over some mining pits in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt may be cheaper to recycle precious materials but that isn\u0027t a sure bet, and doesn\u0027t guarantee that it will be done. Rare metals such as gallium are useful in developing advanced electronics, and manufactured scarcity can be just as useful as physical scarcity in controlling prices and thus profits from the supply side. I\u0027d wager there\u0027s a reasonable chance it\u0027ll go either way, but there\u0027s also another motive: Rare metals on Earth are limited, as you acknowledge. They\u0027re intensely useful, again, in electronics: metals like gallium, indium, tantalum. Once the supply on Earth is exhausted, recovery via recycling will only be able to provide so much material. If technology manufacturers want to produce more gadgets incorporating rare metals, then there is a potential motive for asteroid development. That\u0027s not to say that it will happen quickly if it does, but that it can eventually happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn either event, there is another route to space development: satellite repair and refurbishment. An orbital servicing platform that can refuel, repair, and manufacture satellites on-orbit could certainly be cost-effective. In the long run this demands access to in-space mined material, thus asteroid mining, and so on from there, starting at a small scale and working up, potentially setting the stage for larger-scale asteroid mining. Even on this scale conflicts can be significant - conflicts between countries\u0027 space infrastructures using ASAT weaponry may not exactly be as glamorous as space battleships, but it is an interesting battlefield in its own right nevertheless, and probably the most relevant to KSP since it covers \u2206V regimes within the low 1000s of m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222557708\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138706\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462255370\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022145678\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nich\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Nich said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough I now see you said nation states implying multiple countries colonized something and those colonies\u00A0revolted declaring their\u00A0independence. \u00A0Then the colonies get so big that they run out of minable asteroids in the asteroid belt.

My claim was nearly the exact opposite of the words you\u0027re putting in my mouth: I\u0027m hardly presuming that the entire solar system will be easily converted into habitat material. I think that asteroids will be difficult to develop - just not difficult enough to entirely preclude asteroid mining and space habitation in general. This does not necessarily mean that space nations will be entirely divorced from the influence of Earth, or that they will grow exponentially until the whole solar system is filled. The latter in particular is a ridiculous prospect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd again, large imperial powers in the modern day regularly carry out large-scale wars without immediately escalating to absolute world-scale devastation or nuclear warfare. How about the Middle East wars? The Vietnam war and Korean war, proxy conflicts against the Soviet Union? And so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven then there is room for nuance. The global geopolitical situation will evolve in the future, and the same will be true of any nations that arise in space. The United States did not go \u0022bankrupt\u0022 in the wake of World War II despite it being the largest conflict between imperial powers in history. That\u0027s not to say that space war will be \u0022just like\u0022 WWII, obviously, but there can be similarities. Space nations will not be \u0022the US versus China, both go bankrupt\u0022 any more than they will be an exact repeat of WWII. Modern warfare is a long-term investment, and the political and economic maneuvering carried out by an imperial power against a subjugated state is both equally important to and enabling of large-scale open warfare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-03T08:50:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2016 08:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Accelerando\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-03T14:34:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/543-accelerando/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022543\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/543-accelerando/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Accelerando\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0HAHA I had to google strawman. \u00A0After reading your post and considering it your 100% right. \u00A0I was giving people way to much credit. \u00A0Infact after thinking about it I now believe space \u0022conflict\u0022 is a 100% chance certainty however I have some points. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off all the \u0022wars\u0022 you listed were not wars. \u00A0I do not want to offend any veterans but these conflicts were more policing then wars. \u00A0I am no expert in history but in Vietnam we were not allowed to send troops into North Vietnam out of fear of starting a war with China and Russia. \u00A0Thus we were sitting ducks just waiting for the North Vietnamese to go south and attack the South Vietnamese. \u00A0Afghanistan was not a war against Afghanistan but a war on Terrorist that claimed no nation state and many experts believe simply fled to other countries after the invasion of Afghanistan. \u00A0The Iraq war lasted what 9 days before their\u00A0military was crushed? \u00A0Might as well mention our most expensive war to date. \u00A0The war on drugs has been the biggest loss yet for the US lasting 35 some years and only increasing the value and profits of the drug lords while costing the US Trillions of dollars. \u00A0As for WWII the reason it did not bankrupt the US was because the world economy was basically non-existent at that time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo I see space terrorism in our future Yes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo I see space piracy(gangs) in our future Yes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo I see space policing in our future Yes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo I see a space arms race in our future Yes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo I see a space based Civil war?

Major players know where every \u0022warship\u0022 is at any given time. They move around and hopefully they\u0027re not going to blow you out of the water today. Any weapon worth firing would completely destroy a single vessel (like the Moskit), so heavy armor isn\u0027t really effective, better to be light and efficient. Warships would probably be more akin to glorified troop transports with pods for fast assault on space stations or maybe even planets/moons. The thing is, they could only be used for the first strike... after that they will all be blown out of the sky when the defending group launches land-based or orbiting weapons at all known locations of the enemy fleet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the only armor you would see on such a vessel would be for defending against debris and energy weapons, something like a metal foam that can completely stop a fast moving space rock and absorb energy from a laser type weapon as a nice side effect.
