Why is that cheating? Is it because others have agreed to a certain set of rules? Or is it because the cheater pretends to agree to the rules, but chooses to break them instead? Both reasons can apply to cheating in non-competitive single-player games as well.\n\nPerhaps you didn\u0027t phrase your question well enough or I misunderstood what you were asking. Sorry, but I\u0027m still not sure what you\u0027re asking.\n\nCheating is breaking AGREED UPON rules. \n\nIn a single player game, you make (and change) the rules. Hence you can\u0027t break them. Hence you can\u0027t cheat. In a multiplayer game, ANY rule change MUST be agreed upon by ALL participants, OTHERWISE a rule change is cheating. A rule change can mean ANYTHING. Whether it\u0027s within the framework of a game, or outside it. \n\nFor example, an in-game rule-change might be turning on assisted targetting mode in a hypothetical multiplayer FPS. An external rule-change might be allowing a certain mod (eg, to give players unlimited ammo). Cheating would be doing either of those without first consulting and agreeing with the other players.\n\nIn the same FPS playing the single-player campaign, using either of those options is IMPLICITLY agreed upon by yourself (ie \u0022all the players\u0022), hence you\u0027re not cheating yourself. In the mod case you\u0027re playing the game differently to how the developer wanted it played, but it\u0027s still not cheating. You can \u0022feel cheated\u0022 if the game is now too easy and you blast through in 10 minutes instead of 2 hours, but that\u0027s not the same thing."},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T16:13:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E In the same FPS playing the single-player campaign, using either of those options is IMPLICITLY agreed upon by yourself (ie \u0022all the players\u0022), hence you\u0027re not cheating yourself.\n\nThis is where your argument fails. People don\u0027t always agree with themselves.\n\nMaybe the player does a stupid mistake and uses cheat codes to rectify the situation, because they forgot to save the game often enough. Maybe one of the levels is hard and tedious, and the player decides so skip it, because they\u0027ve already beaten it once. Maybe the player uses self-imposed rules to avoid some cheesy tricks, but then resorts to them \u0022just a bit\u0022 to beat a particularly hard situation.\n\nNone of that is cheating as such. However, sometimes the player feels an urge to justify their actions, either to themself or to others. Some part of them may suspect that what they did was cheating, and another part tries to prove that that was not the case."},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T20:30:15Z","Content":"I see no reason not to, but I also don\u0027t use copious quantities of them.
