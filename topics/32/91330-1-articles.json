I believe that Bobcat addressed something similar to this in a video. On a moon his rover would hit a bump and be launched into space because of the microgravity. He solved this by pointing his ion exhaust upwards which created a downward force for his rover to remain on the surface of the moon because the downward force approximated regular gravity. So why not use your astronaut kerbal\u0027s rocket pack descent jets which would cause him (her?) to stay on the station surface?
