Memory size is not as much of a defining metric as people think it is, though nowadays you want something in the neighbourhood of 1 GB or beyond. More importantly though, the card GPU chip needs to be half decent. I would suggest looking for something like a GTX 750 Ti, a R7 265 or a R9 270 or even 270X.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore we get in too deep though: what CPU and other hardware are you going to combine it with?
