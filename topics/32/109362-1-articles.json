Do they have a higher impact tolerance now or is this a matter of their drag in the new atmo?"},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T15:18:38Z","Content":"If you activate their jetpack, they will bounce. Even from orbit, if they don\u0027t burn, they will bounce. (unless you come in at a ridiculous speed and they go through the terrain before it registers the impact, then they will poof from the 1/40 second calculations.)"},{"CreatedByName":"tg626","CreatedById":112361,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T20:27:13Z","Content":"I\u0027ll have to check, but I think they were bouncing without me using the jetpack, and certainly it was stowed on impact...\n\nEVA-\u003Eplummet-\u003EBOING!!!-\u003Eragdoll for a few seconds."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T20:40:11Z","Content":"They used to be able to fall from the Mun and bounce...
