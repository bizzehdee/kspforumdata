Also, don\u0027t look at this as a rant or an attack on Squad. I\u0027m just curious about one thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say I just started a thread in the suggestions forum saying: \u0022We already have visuals of reentry. It would be great to also have the effects on our vessels.\u0022. Let\u0027s also say it\u0027s the first suggestion of this, so we won\u0027t have people shouting: \u0022OMG, USE THE SEARCH FUNCTION NOOB!\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure one of the first replies would be: \u0022Well you\u0027re in luck. There\u0027s a great mod called Deadly Reentry that does just what you ask for.\u0022 And there\u0027s more. You want resource mining? There\u0027s Kethane and Karbonite. Flight information display? MechJeb, VOID or Kerbal Engineer. More parts? Try the amazing B9 and KW packs. The list goes on...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I\u0027m not against mods. Quite the contrary, I love them and if only a game supports it I download a ton of modifications. However that applies mostly to finished games. With early access we buy games that are still in development and adding features should be the developer\u0027s job. Making a game so easy to change by third parties, wouldn\u0027t it be treated as an excuse for the devs to postpone new functionalities? Don\u0027t get me wrong. I\u0027m not saying Squad is doing this, but probably most will agree some features should be made stock a long time ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the main question is: Do you think excessive modding of early access games can slow down the process of development?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corw","CreatedById":7116,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T09:36:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESquad has recruited several modders over time and we have seen integration of several mods into the core game, starting long long time ago with plane parts. So modding has improved and speeded up the development of core game. Mods had also provided very good info which features are viable and desirable. There is only hald a dozen of Squad devs and over time probably over hundred modders.

Note that I disagree with most of that, but that\u0027s what they said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther stuff, like Atmosphere always has been on the list. The inclusion of Fine Print and Spaceplane Plus shows that they are in principle willing and able to include high quality mods. This is a great hope for me!

Developing the core base game is hard, even when the core base game adds the ability to create mods. Now, that mods may serve has inspiration for the devs is one thing, mods that should be stock along time ago is other. Like Corw said, Squad already recruited several talented modders, but even if KSP get to his final version and with the status of developed, there will always exist mods for this or that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, thinking like that, imagine that Squad put into stock all the mods I use in the game, things like life support, remote tech, kas, etc, how do you feel of been forced of using something I do like and makes my game harder and more real, if you just want to play for fun while I want to play in the most real simulation I can get?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot everyone likes to play like I do.

Considering that was a game made for consoles, when the modding community started working on the PC version, many console gamers regret not having a decent PC to run the game. Skyrim was a hard game to put mods working, you could spend about 12 hours installing mods and testing to see if the game was stable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are lucky that here we just \u0022copy contents of zip folder into game\\data\u0022 and you done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkyrim with no mods, is just...well...empty if you do not exaggerate in the type of mods you use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same cannot be said about KSP, it\u0027s still in development, so mods, can really add a big value to the development of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a lot respect for the modding community, they hard work to to make mods and give us things of so much value is incredible...and I\u0027m not talking just about KSP modders which in my opinion should be paid their weight in gold for some of the gems they create, even so, they do it because they love the game and they do it because they want to improve their own game experience, that\u0027s when someone mods a certain game. I have played many games and used many mods, but I was amazed with the quality of many mods in KSP.
