Predictions? Is anyone crazy enough to try this in 1.0 (and get the bragging rights of being first?)"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T22:26:55Z","Content":"I\u0027m thinking an EVE SSTO is now within the realm of possibility.\n\n Just getting started, tho\u0027.\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"hoojiwana","CreatedById":57079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T22:29:19Z","Content":"Changes to the way engines work (atmospheric pressure changes engine thrust) mean engines are going to be much lower thrust in Eves thicker atmosphere.
