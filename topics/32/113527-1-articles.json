Yes it adds more weight, but it lets you top off your tanks on the surface. This gives you more fuel to make orbit again, and lets you air on the side of caution with your suicide burns (since fuel efficiency on the way down is no longer an issue unless you actually run out of fuel before you hit the ground). Granted I have a tendency to make large / heavy landers, so adding an ISRU doesn\u0027t add that much weight to the craft. It also makes doing several missions on a planet surface with a single lander possibly, since you can fill up the tanks at each surface stop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways what do you all prefer and why?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LittleBlueGaming","CreatedById":144665,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T18:12:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELander.
