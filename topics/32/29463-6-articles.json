For the position of crewing the one-man lander, no other options presented themselves but distinguished Kerbanaut Raybin Kerman, commander of three space-station resupply missions and consequently the most experienced pilot in Kerbin history. He followed flawlessly in the path of m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar flyby pilot Chad Kerman, plugging data collected by his predecessor into the state-of-the-art MechJeb autopilot system in order to perform a smooth orbital transfer. (Yeah, it was kind of pointless automating a m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar flight, but I had never done it before and I just wanted to see what would happen.) Entering into a smooth, flawless equatorial orbit with almost a full Rockomax Jumbo-64 fuel tank and Mainsail engine aboard the service module, he paused for a moment to enjoy the view. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommand told him to stop messing around, ditch the service module (still with a couple km/s of delta-V aboard), and perform his deorbit burn. He obediently did so, and landed perfectly (read: danced his ship around a cosmic game of spin-the-bottle until he managed to extend his lander legs the right way) after a few minor hiccups (read: crashes and reloaded quicksaves). With light feet, he danced atop the dusty, space-kissed regolith of the virgin m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar surface, took vital data samples for the science techs back at KSC, and reascended his vehicle\u0027s ladder. That was when he noticed the fuel gauge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat worthless, bulky service module with its thousands of liters of fuel, now nothing more than a fresh crater on the pitted m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar surface, was looking pretty important right then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a few more weeks (three-ish hours of gameplay) and many frantic reassurances to Raybin, a better-designed three-man rescue craft (incorporating the novel innovations of radial-mount engines) was sitting on the launchpad. Naturally, one Kerbal had to get out to provide space for the newcomer, and Lunfel Kerman happily volunteered for the job. He leaped joyously out of the 80-meter rocket to his death on the concrete launchpad below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinor technical difficulties aside, the Munar Rescue Vehicle was landing smoothly with the aid of MechJeb data gathered by Raybin on his own manual landing. It touched down, Raybin got out of his ship to meet the rescue crew, and...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i40.tinypic.com/2wmkwuo.png\u0022 alt=\u00222wmkwuo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...well, hope he likes long-distance running. (I didn\u0027t think to use his EVA pack on the first try, and I wasn\u0027t confident enough in my flying abilities to try \u0022hopping\u0022 either vehicle. By the time I had accidentally reloaded the quicksave from the MRV\u0027s initial landing halfway through, started the journey again, skidded Raybin on his face for 5km using his personal RCS, and walked the rest of the way, I had spent two two-and-a-half hour sessions just watching a Kerbanaut waddle across endless grayish hills. Luckily I managed to keep him walking in the KSP window while I surfed the Web in Firefox, but it was still ridiculous.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, the rest of the flight was much less eventful. After a Minmus flyby and EVA, the MRV reentered Kerbin and splashed down safely. Sadly, it was too late for Raybin. He had been driven mad, partly by isolation on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, partly by having to run a 10k in an EVA suit, and partly by spending almost a month crammed in a capsule with fellow Kerbanauts Alan and Lanfel. Upon landing, he wrenched the hatch open, laughing maniacally, and greeted the recovery teams by ripping off the capsule\u0027s AR202 MechJeb module and balancing it on his head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i44.tinypic.com/6quw6o.png\u0022 alt=\u00226quw6o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(...yeah, I don\u0027t know either.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rage097","CreatedById":66193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T12:48:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had been landing rovers on Duna and Eve and decided to take a step back and put someone on the Mun. first attempt left me stranded with no fuel.

The boosters are sticking together via struts meant to increase stability, but that causes the mass to crash into the central booster. To remedy this, I\u0027ll place the boosters as low on the final booster as I can, minimizing the chance of impact.
