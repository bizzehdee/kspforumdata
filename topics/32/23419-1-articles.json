At this point, I have a tiny launcher that will get up to ~114km on jet engines alone. It\u0027s 28 parts, including the launch scaffolding. It can reach about 1300 m/s before the engines cut out due to lack of oxygen.

Add a bunch of ram air intakes (use cubic octagonal struts to mount them), aim for level flight around 35-40 km altitude. Keep a close eye on the engine, kill the throttle immediately if it flames out, that\u0027ll bring it back online and you can feather the throttle back up to just less than what you previously were using.
