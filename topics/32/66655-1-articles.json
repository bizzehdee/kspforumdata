This is based on the videos I\u0027ve seen so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- We want to capture an asteroid into an orbit around the Mun. It could be Minmus or Kerbin itself, but let\u0027s go for the Mun as a baseline. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- SLS parts and stronger joints allow us to put a lot of payload into space reliably. Still, let\u0027s leave the absurdly big stuff to the expert (yes, expert, singular - I\u0027m looking at you Whackjob).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EProfiles:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EHeliocentric Orbit Rendezvous (HOR)\u003C/strong\u003E. Launch a spacecraft as soon as possible and rendezvous with the target before it reaches Kerbin\u0027s SOI. This gives the lowest relative velocity at rendezvous and allows you to tune the target\u0027s Kerbin encounter at minimal delta-v expense. It does mean you need to push your craft beyond Kerbin escape velocity to get an intercept, greatly increasing the initial delta-v investment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EHigh Kerbin Orbit Rendezvous (HKOR)\u003C/strong\u003E. Launch a spacecraft to intercept the target as soon as possible after it enters Kerbin\u0027s SOI. The spacecraft will not need to be accelerated up to escape velocity and the relative velocity to the target will be fairly low still. It does make it more expensive to adjust the target\u0027s trajectory because you\u0027ll be deeper inside Kerbin\u0027s gravity well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003ELow Kerbin Orbit Rendezvous (LKOR)\u003C/strong\u003E. Launch a spacecraft to intercept the target as close to its Kerbin periapsis as possible. This requires the least amount of intercept delta-v, but rendezvous and orbital adjustments will be much more expensive due to the high relative velocity and being so deep inside the gravity well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EMunar Orbit Rendezvous (MOR)\u003C/strong\u003E. Launch a spacecraft to intercept the target inside the Mun\u0027s SOI. This requires a target that is going to encounter the Mun naturally and you need to push your spacecraft out to there first. On the other hand, it is potentially the least complicated mission, requiring only one burn after rendezvous to complete. Delta-v cost of capture is lower that H/LKOR profiles as the target will not be as deep inside Kerbin\u0027s gravity well, and with any luck you can use the Mun\u0027s gravity well to help out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOther Considerations:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003ENumber of spacecraft\u003C/strong\u003E. It seems sensible to have two separate spacecraft: one dedicated probe to capture the target, and one crewed follow-up spacecraft to meet the captured target and perform SCIENCE! This way the capture craft won\u0027t need to haul around scientific equipment and crew, saving dry mass on the most delta-v intensive part of the mission. On the other hand, the additional cost/hassle of a second launch may not outweigh the savings made on a lighter capture craft. This becomes more pronounced the heavier the target is. On a particularly challenging rock, you could consider using even more craft: one for the initial capture into Kerbin orbit, another for adjusting the target\u0027s orbit to a Munar encounter, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003ETarget trajectory\u003C/strong\u003E. Your mission profile may be dictated to some degree by the trajectory of the target. A target which will naturally encounter the Mun will lend itself to an MOR profile. A target on a highly inclined Kerbin encounter might be best captured with the HOR profile. A target coming in at a gentle inclination might best be captured using H/LOR, depending on its Kerbin periapsis. The target trajectory may in turn inform the choice of number of spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EKerbin aerobraking\u003C/strong\u003E. This would totally get you fired at NASA. It would also be totally \u003Cem\u003Eawesome\u003C/em\u003E.

It\u0027s basically the method of incremental gravity assists that folks have been using to send probes towards far-off destinations for a long time. Sure it takes patience, but it gets a lot done on a relatively small budget. Good thinking!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still not sold on what the most efficient rendezvous profile would be. Catching up in high-Kerbin orbit is definitely a good option, as it reduces the initial transfer delta-v for only a small loss in relative velocity at rendezvous. But you\u0027ll be pushing your craft out a long way in its heaviest, fully-fueled condition. Ideally you\u0027d want to catch up to the asteroid just as it enters Kerbin\u0027s SOI, thereby minimizing the amount of extra velocity it picks up due to Kerbin\u0027s gravity (gotta love two-body physics). This seems to be the best of two worlds (HOR and HKOR). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a practical note, I don\u0027t know if the \u0022closest approach\u0022 display will work if the bodies are in different spheres of influence. So if the asteroid is still orbiting the sun, but has a patched conics trajectory in Kerbin\u0027s SOI, could I get a closest approach indicator on a maneuver node trajectory while I\u0027m orbiting Kerbin? Or, to make it even more complicated, while I\u0027m orbiting Minmus and plotting a maneuver out of Minmus\u0027 SOI? There\u0027s a lot of SOIs to keep track of there and I don\u0027t know if KSP can handle all of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally I don\u0027t think Minmus would make a very good waiting station. The odds of an asteroid encountering Kerbin while Minmus is in a good intercept position are pretty low, even less than the MOR profile which is also a long shot. Given that you\u0027ll have to burn out there anyway, you might as well park in low Kerbin orbit and take it from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, I really like the idea of catching up with an asteroid and using a string of incremental gravity assists to achieve capture, but I don\u0027t think Minmus is the best place to hang out and wait for it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-24T21:15:27Z\u0022 title=\u002203/24/2014 09:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Wayfare\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Francesco","CreatedById":58274,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-24T21:17:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone knows what an asteroid\u0027s speed relative to Kerbin would be?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-24T21:18:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Javster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Javster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf one (read: me) were to make a few new Muns for Kerbin, one (read: also me) would try to clump a bunch of asteroids together (maybe using KAS)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh gosh, how about... a space station for docking asteroids...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lohan2008","CreatedById":80945,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-24T21:26:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDidn\u0027t someone make an earlier comment on another thread about\u003Cem\u003E landing\u003C/em\u003E an asteroid ?

That means that to rendezvous with it you\u0027ll have to do a big burn to get your apoapsis out near the asteroid\u0027s path, then accelerate from basically a dead stop at the top of your highly-elliptic orbit all the way up to the speed of the asteroid, which will be some fraction of Kerbin\u0027s orbital velocity around the Sun, so we\u0027re looking at around 1 or 2 km/s, maybe more if the asteroid has a very different orbit from Kerbin\u0027s.
