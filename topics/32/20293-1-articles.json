Flying to anything and don\u0027t know the timing for orbit transfer? Do your transfer late so you cross orbit ahead of your target. While you are passed it\u0027s orbit, it will catch up and you capture planet or whatever on the return. Just make sure you get your orbit plane aligned right and it works every time. Heading to the inner planets, do the inverse arrive a bit late and pass it on the inside. I have never even added 2\u002B2 ever in my life of playing ksp and can get most anywhere if I have the desire to make it. Before planets came out, all my landers were VTOL space planes made entirely by trial and error. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst get orbit. Then correct orbit, then just adjust orbit length until capture. That is why arriving early (outer) or late (inner) is beneficial. The map does all the work. When you do this, you can keep burning to increase catchup time until you capture on the return trajectory. Works every time if done right. Give a quicksave before your burn in case you were wrong. Also avoid burning too fast or you might miss a very tiny capture window. Sometimes it only blinks for a second on the map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, I do it all by visual. Pass and return capture for any orbital body (or if possible such as minmus or other long range objects, fly counter orbit) Need to change your angle, all you have to do is wait until your orbit plane crosses the target orbit plane. Once that happens, burn perpendicular to your direction of travel while aligned to your orbit body horizon. The orbit will pivot on this axis until they align. Works every time if you have the fuel. No fancy calculators needed. Those are only needed if you want to maximize your efficency. I just make overkill rockets. I always arrive with fuel to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frostiken","CreatedById":1837,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T16:01:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022spikeyhat09\u0022 data-cite=\u0022spikeyhat09\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIts really not all that complicated. albeit, there is some more thinking involved vs the easy peasy mun/min mission, but seriously, a 6th grader could do it with this guide: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz/\u003C/a\u003E. bookmark it. really helpful.\u003Cp\u003EIt includes a visual aid as to when/where to burn, and even a calculator that tells you everything you need to know. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhen it gets down to it, \u003Cstrong\u003Eall you need to know is 2 angles.\u003C/strong\u003E thats it. two (2) angles. if you know how to use a protractor, then you can do it.
