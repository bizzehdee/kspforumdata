Turbojets have a MAJOR speed factor in their thrust determination, so on a relatively low TWR lifter like this one, they actually don\u0027t work as well as Turbofans do.

They all have intakeair quantities and drag determined by the size of the intake, except that there\u0027s a cap on how high the drag will rise...and the cap\u0027s the same on all the different types of intakes. They all max out at \u00272\u0027. Not sure if that\u0027s the drag coefficient or what(If it is, the Nacelle and the Radial are both far heavier as well, so that\u0027d be EVEN WORSE!) Anyway, what happens is once you get some speed up, all the intakes end up with the drag capped, and yet they all produce less intakeair than the ram intakes. The radials don\u0027t produce much, and the engine nacelles barely produce any at all, and yet end up with massive drag anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-01T13:53:17Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2013 01:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rryy","CreatedById":57357,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T13:53:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELike this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i59faU6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022i59faU6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe payload for this alone is 75 tons and because I could not make a decent lifter to get it into orbit, I decided to spam jets and intakes.
