However, it depends WHY you\u0027re clipping; there are a few cases where the game is just not well-designed for the parts it uses, and clipping is the only way to make an effective design. The most pronounced example of this is jet intakes; barring the huge radial intake, the others all need to be placed on the front of a tube. However, the intake capacities of these are so low that you need many intakes per engine to provide enough intake air. So, if you try to make a spaceplane that has enough intake capacity to function well, it has to be constructed in ridiculous ways... or you clip the intakes. Another situation where this comes up is with RTGs, which are extremely useful as a source of electrical power for all the minor things you need it for. But, the things are awkward in shape, and just look horrible hanging off the sides of your ships. So, I stick them inside my fuel tanks, where they\u0027re out of the way. Same goes for Avionics modules; some mods have added a pseudo-ASAS that uses the avionics steering constants, but without that the stock avionics controller is just awkward to place, so I\u0027ve taken to placing it inside my cockpit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, we currently don\u0027t have a drag model, so sticking something inside another part doesn\u0027t actually make any difference to your performance; it\u0027s purely aesthetic. But once we get a real aerodynamics model, I\u0027m hoping that the core game and/or mods will provide us with the means to do without clipping abuses. In the long term, we should be provided with things like high-capacity stack intakes, or stackable 1.25m RTG rings, so that we don\u0027t need to do stuff like that. So once the game is released, then I\u0027d say yes, part clipping WOULD be cheating.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pinolallo","CreatedById":47075,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T22:55:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEverything can fly and can easily launched is fine (clipped or not), is a sandbox game so cheating is just meaningless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust don\u0027t share ****ty ships.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ROFLCopter64bit","CreatedById":58314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T22:59:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pinolallo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022pinolallo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEverything can fly and can easily launched is fine (clipped or not), is a sandbox game so cheating is just meaningless.\u003Cp\u003EJust don\u0027t share ****ty ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt isn\u0027t going to be completly a sandbox game for long, but I think clipping is \u0022merging two parts together\u0022 or \u0022shaving a bit off the side\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"loppnessmonsta","CreatedById":58525,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T07:47:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t even figure out how to actually do it.
