The smaller part has more versatility and scalability, not to mention it is researched considerably earlier, so the larger one get much better mass/electricitynumbers. And it makes perfect sense form a gameplay mechanics point of view! Otherwise, what would be the point of having two? This way, you get interesting design conundrums, even in sandbox, where one is efficient but the other is easy to build with. Maybe you have to go slightly bigger on your ships in order to be able to use two and go all symmetric around the problem? Or sacrifice efficiency for compactness. In any case, an engineering *choice*.\n\nRune.
