I was told the docking tutorial wasn\u0027t that good and they had problems matching orbits. So I delved in to see how and why they were failing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oljvm3P.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oljvm3P.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far so good, we have two ships on different elliptic orbits. Our rescue ship is low, so it goes faster compared to our stranded ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what\u0027s our first order of business?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/05iobsU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002205iobsU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUh oh. The descending node is way, way too far. Let\u0027s, for a second, assume we do go with what the tutorial suggests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/myTEbcm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022myTEbcm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, that done, now the tutorial asks us to place a maneuver node for intersection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8yn88zu.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228yn88zu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s not really good. We\u0027re too far in our orbit compared to our target, and doing an intersection with a single maneuver is only possible roughly 10-12 orbits later. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://gfycat.com/AlarmingAcademicBlackwidowspider\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EYou can see here how the intersection moves away as we continue along our orbit.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy proposed change is to make the first burn on Ascending Node instead. It ends up like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8jfHZVr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228jfHZVr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat gives us plent of time and dV left to get a favorable intersection, like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5d0GyKc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225d0GyKc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA bit of RCS and maneuvering after, docking complete!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XtvG6ct.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XtvG6ct.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the problems of the tutorial doesn\u0027t end here. Let\u0027s say you managed to delete the maneuver node with say, 1-5 m/s dV left. Your intersection will still be further away than what the game requires - 5km. But even if you do manage to get your intersection under 5km after that point, the tutorial still thinks you skipped a step and will not progress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if we DO get the stranded kerbals down to kerbin, the staging is set to discard the hab first \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sealed:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love to be able to point my friends to a tutorial that gives them a better understanding.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:kiss:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T08:57:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree that the optimal burn to align the orbits is at the ascending node, but by following the tutorial and doing it at the descending node just means that when you do your intersect burn, the rescue ship orbit needs to go higher than the stranded ship.
