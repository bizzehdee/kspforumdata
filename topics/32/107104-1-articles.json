I was told the docking tutorial wasn\u0027t that good and they had problems matching orbits. So I delved in to see how and why they were failing.\n\n![oljvm3P.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/oljvm3P.jpg)\n\nSo far so good, we have two ships on different elliptic orbits. Our rescue ship is low, so it goes faster compared to our stranded ship.\n\nSo what\u0027s our first order of business?\n\n![05iobsU.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/05iobsU.jpg)\n\nUh oh. The descending node is way, way too far. Let\u0027s, for a second, assume we do go with what the tutorial suggests.\n\n![myTEbcm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/myTEbcm.jpg)\n\nOkay, that done, now the tutorial asks us to place a maneuver node for intersection.\n\n![8yn88zu.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8yn88zu.jpg)\n\nBut that\u0027s not really good. We\u0027re too far in our orbit compared to our target, and doing an intersection with a single maneuver is only possible roughly 10-12 orbits later. [You can see here how the intersection moves away as we continue along our orbit.](http://gfycat.com/AlarmingAcademicBlackwidowspider)\n\nMy proposed change is to make the first burn on Ascending Node instead. It ends up like this:\n\n![8jfHZVr.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8jfHZVr.jpg)\n\nThat gives us plent of time and dV left to get a favorable intersection, like this:\n\n![5d0GyKc.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/5d0GyKc.jpg)\n\nA bit of RCS and maneuvering after, docking complete!\n\n![XtvG6ct.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XtvG6ct.jpg)\n\nHowever, the problems of the tutorial doesn\u0027t end here. Let\u0027s say you managed to delete the maneuver node with say, 1-5 m/s dV left. Your intersection will still be further away than what the game requires - 5km. But even if you do manage to get your intersection under 5km after that point, the tutorial still thinks you skipped a step and will not progress.\n\nAlso, if we DO get the stranded kerbals down to kerbin, the staging is set to discard the hab first ![:sealed:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif)\n\nI\u0027d love to be able to point my friends to a tutorial that gives them a better understanding.![:kiss:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T08:57:15Z","Content":"I agree that the optimal burn to align the orbits is at the ascending node, but by following the tutorial and doing it at the descending node just means that when you do your intersect burn, the rescue ship orbit needs to go higher than the stranded ship. Your closest intersection then becomes the point where the rescue ship crosses from being higher than the stranded ship, to being lower.\n\nHaving said all that, I ran in to the same problem subsequently, in that the tutorial wouldn\u0027t progress beyond telling me to perform the intersect burn. I\u0027m not sure if it thought I had missed a step, or if I didn\u0027t perform the burn quite to it\u0027s liking, but as a novice if I had got this far with the tutorial I would have been stuck.\n\nI didn\u0027t proceed with the tutorial beyond the actual docking, so can\u0027t comment on the staging and how you get everything back to the surface."},{"CreatedByName":"Kordy","CreatedById":76891,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T09:53:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I agree that the optimal burn to align the orbits is at the ascending node, but by following the tutorial and doing it at the descending node just means that when you do your intersect burn, the rescue ship orbit needs to go higher than the stranded ship.

Docking 101 where you get to use the oberth effect and easy inclinations, and Docking 102 where you have a really eccentric orbit where you have to burn more fuel to get there, I dunno."},{"CreatedByName":"Bandock","CreatedById":28934,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T10:05:08Z","Content":"Playing around with that tutorial, I find it interesting that if you plan to rescue the stranded Kerbals they\u0027re likely to die anyhow if you ever decouple. :|"},{"CreatedByName":"DarkGravity","CreatedById":143383,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T20:05:43Z","Content":"The default view should be focused on the planet when you are adjusting your orbit.

I even tried EVAing Jeb over to the stranded ship after the rescue ship spontaneously disassembled itself but as soon as he tried to manoeuvre it that ship also disassembled itself and flew off into space at high speed"}]}
