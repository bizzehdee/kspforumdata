We all know Bill, Bob and of course Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo after only a few days playing KSP, I decided to do some kind of really interesting/different fanart... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the time (mid-late 2011) I was messing around a lot with models for 3D printing, after having my first 3D print ordered at the start of 2011 from a company some of you might know - Shapeways (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.shapeways.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.shapeways.com/\u003C/a\u003E). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was spending my spare time throwing some other big 3D printing project ideas around, so it was a pretty logical that my final idea developed pretty fast: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI wanted to make some real 3D printed Kerbals, hopefully the first - ever!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that was it, I whipped up a basic Kerbal mesh from the limited pictures on the Kerbal website (in my program of choice - Blender), and after then being distracted for several months by other projects, uni, life etc etc... I finally got around to making a new 3D print order (at the time it was an order for another project). This is when I remembered the Kerbal model Id been working on, which was in a state almost ready to print. So a bit of tweaking later, and I had the model \u003Cem\u003Eproperly \u003C/em\u003Eready for print, along with a highly experimental helmet piece and a visor section which could (in theory) plug into the helmet allowing for a visor\\\u0027d helmet, or an open helmet, and sit on the kerbals head. This was tricky to work out, and all 3 parts had to be accurate down to millimeters for it to work out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, a week or 2 after ordering, the models arrived! Id ordered one kerbal - a test version of Bob with a goofy pose, along with a test helmet (both of these objects were printed in a \\\u0027full colour sandstone\\\u0027 material, meaning they came out of the 3D printer in full colour (no painting needed at all)), and a 3rd object - a visor. The visor was printed in a material named \\\u0027transparent detail\\\u0027. Unfortunately the visor material turned out to not be as transparant as Id hoped, but the visor itself (after a bit of sanding and tweaking), fit right into the helmet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epic of the failed visor model - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EGkMH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EGkMH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I was impressed, and a month or 2 later made another order, this time with a Jeb model, another helmet, and 2 new visors. Both visors were being printed in a new material \\\u0027Transparent Detail\\\u0027, with one model being super thin, and the other just being as thin as I dared. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat order arrived, and this time the visor was better. Not perfect, it had a yellowish plasitc tint and wasnt as transparent as Id hoped, but it was good enough for now.
