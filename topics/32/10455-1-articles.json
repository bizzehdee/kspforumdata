But my impatience got the better of me! \n\nWanted to share and get some feedback from this awesome community ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nFirst, heres some pictures, then I have a bit of a \\\u0027making of\\\u0027 story with additional details and even moar pictures for those interested.\n\nBob 3D model with helmet:\n\n![8YIf5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8YIf5.jpg)\n\nJeb 3D model with helmet:\n\n![LHGpp.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/LHGpp.jpg)\n\nJeb 3D model, helmet off:\n\n![2urLZ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2urLZ.jpg)\n\nJeb 3D model, helmet on, visor off:\n\n![pI3pp.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/pI3pp.jpg)\n\nBob freaking out as per usual, without his helmet:\n\n![QnqXp.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/QnqXp.jpg)\n\n**So, now that I have you interested!** \n\n**The story:**\n\nI started playing KSP way back, about 10 days after it was first released and I found myself (like everyone else on this forum), completely loving the game and especially the hilarious little Kerbals who would scream or smile with joy during flight. We all know Bill, Bob and of course Jeb.\n\nSo after only a few days playing KSP, I decided to do some kind of really interesting/different fanart... \n\nAt the time (mid-late 2011) I was messing around a lot with models for 3D printing, after having my first 3D print ordered at the start of 2011 from a company some of you might know - Shapeways ([http://www.shapeways.com/](http://www.shapeways.com/)). \n\nI was spending my spare time throwing some other big 3D printing project ideas around, so it was a pretty logical that my final idea developed pretty fast: \n\n**I wanted to make some real 3D printed Kerbals, hopefully the first - ever!**\n\nSo that was it, I whipped up a basic Kerbal mesh from the limited pictures on the Kerbal website (in my program of choice - Blender), and after then being distracted for several months by other projects, uni, life etc etc... I finally got around to making a new 3D print order (at the time it was an order for another project). This is when I remembered the Kerbal model Id been working on, which was in a state almost ready to print. So a bit of tweaking later, and I had the model *properly* ready for print, along with a highly experimental helmet piece and a visor section which could (in theory) plug into the helmet allowing for a visor\\\u0027d helmet, or an open helmet, and sit on the kerbals head. This was tricky to work out, and all 3 parts had to be accurate down to millimeters for it to work out. \n\nEither way, a week or 2 after ordering, the models arrived! Id ordered one kerbal - a test version of Bob with a goofy pose, along with a test helmet (both of these objects were printed in a \\\u0027full colour sandstone\\\u0027 material, meaning they came out of the 3D printer in full colour (no painting needed at all)), and a 3rd object - a visor. The visor was printed in a material named \\\u0027transparent detail\\\u0027. Unfortunately the visor material turned out to not be as transparant as Id hoped, but the visor itself (after a bit of sanding and tweaking), fit right into the helmet. \n\npic of the failed visor model - \n\n\u003E ![EGkMH.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/EGkMH.jpg)\n\nSo I was impressed, and a month or 2 later made another order, this time with a Jeb model, another helmet, and 2 new visors. Both visors were being printed in a new material \\\u0027Transparent Detail\\\u0027, with one model being super thin, and the other just being as thin as I dared. \n\nThat order arrived, and this time the visor was better. Not perfect, it had a yellowish plasitc tint and wasnt as transparent as Id hoped, but it was good enough for now. (for the record, the super thin version of the visor was a deformed blob, since the walls of the object were way too thin, Id guessed it would probably not work, but wanted to try just incase)\n\nHeres the helmet object on its own:\n\n\u003E ![0r7w7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/0r7w7.jpg)\n\u003E ![sr02p.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/sr02p.jpg)\n\nHeres the helmet with the visor not inserted:\n\n\u003E ![O3HDR.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/O3HDR.jpg)\n\u003E ![96DOO.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/96DOO.jpg)\n\nHelmet with visor inserted:\n\n\u003E ![mhISl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/mhISl.jpg)\n\u003E ![9Adsa.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9Adsa.jpg)\n\nSo the helmet isnt quite finished, Im still going to tweak the visor a bit (you can see in some of the pics its not quite fitting at the bottom). But its pretty damn close. \n\nJeb and Bob with helmet:\n\n\u003E ![LJzaU.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/LJzaU.jpg)\n\u003E ![KDmal.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/KDmal.jpg)\n\nAs for the Kerbal model, it was pretty much spot on with what I wanted, very impressed with the material and how vivid the colours turned out. Id spent a lot of time on the details as well, everything from the teeth of the chracter, to the belts and buckles of the suit, even the mun boot tread!\n\nMunar Boots!\n\n\u003E ![neAWX.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/neAWX.jpg)\n\nYou might notice with Jeb as well, hes got some little bits prodding out of the \\\u0027spacesuit disk\\\u0027 which attaches to the helmet underside, these were added and made the helmet a lot more stable (with Bob the helmet sometimes slides over the disk completely and didnt position itself properly)\n\nHeres a few different angles of the Jeb model:\n\n\u003E ![JVPQG.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JVPQG.jpg)\n\nBob \u0026 Jeb closeup (some printing artifacts easily visible):\n\n\u003E ![luIOA.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/luIOA.jpg)\n\u003E ![ORQU6.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ORQU6.jpg)\n\nAll KSP parts that have been ordered as of May 2012:\n\n\u003E ![TTytL.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/TTytL.jpg)\n\nI designed the kerbals to stand about 2 inches high. \n\nThe helmet is about 1.5 inches - these Kerbal fellows must have some strong necks to life such a drastically proportioned helmet O\\_o\n\nModels in my hand, for an idea of the general sizes:\n\n\u003E ![1MJ26.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1MJ26.jpg)\n\u003E ![2R1ty.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2R1ty.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![eAnob.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/eAnob.jpg)\n\nSo, I guess thats it for now! Look forward to hearing some feedback from you guys and what you all think. \n\nIts been a lot of fun working on these little models, 3D printing is an exciting area to play around in. \n\nThe next step for this project is to get a final Kerbal printed (Bill), and 1 other helmet (so theres one for each of them), and some more finalized/tweaked visors! Thinking of making another order in June, so we\\\u0027ll see what happens. Once I have all 3 models completed, Ill more than likely do a quick little video for my youtube channel to show them off. \n\nAnd if shapeways ever adds a completely clear material to its available materials, Ill more than likely get all the visors reprinted, although the golden visors are starting to grow on me.... Hmmm. \n\nShould also say - thanks to Squad for this awesome game!\n\nAlso the entire album of 32 images (some extra ones not in this thread) can be seen here - [http://imgur.com/a/Q2gdD](http://imgur.com/a/Q2gdD)\n\nCheers for now,\n\nAD-Edge ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tobu91","CreatedById":24654,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-11T16:45:45Z","Content":"![844.jpg](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/288/653/844.jpg)\n\nThat is absolutely amazing.

If it did, you could arrange to have it printed head-vertical to avoid that issue.\n\nYeh the orientation can have quite an effect on the result of a printed model, but this is not linked to the orientation of the exported model from a 3D program, the Shapeways staff usually get the file(s) and can then rotate them, and put multiple models into a single \\\u0027print job\\\u0027 for the printer, so they can get rotated and moved around at this stage. \n\nThese guys look like they have been printed lying down. Unfortunately the user has no control over what orientation the model is printed at (at least with Shapeways that it), but there has been talk of bringing in such an option in future, which would be very handy of course. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Those are incredible. The only suggestion I have is that it might be worthwhile to polish the visors to smooth out the artifacts and make them more transparent.\n\nYes, Im looking into some options for polishing the visors in some way. Could work out very nicely. The only down side, is that I like to have my 3D prints come out of the printer and *not* need much tinkering. But Ill see how nice I can make the visors, would like to be able to see those faces a bit better ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThanks everyone for the feedback so far! ;D"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T06:45:21Z","Content":"Congratulations!
