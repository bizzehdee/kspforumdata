At first I was lost as to what to do! Youtube videos did help me, however once I joined this forum I\u0027ve learnt much much more!\n\nI think the most impressive part of this forum is its members.......you lot! Ive been helped soooo much here, even when asking noob style questions I ought to know, however, unlike other forums I\u0027ve been on, not one member has mocked the question. That to me is a sign of a great community.\n\nIve managed to introduce a few of my friends to KSP recently and they love it as much as I do, yet the first thing I tell them to do is come here, possibly the greatest forum on earth.\n\nThankyou to each and every one of you, and I honestly mean that ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T11:18:40Z","Content":"That\u0027s great to hear!

Joe McNally said something relating to if you\u0027re good enough sharing your knowledge makes the field and yourself better, so you have nothing to fear.
