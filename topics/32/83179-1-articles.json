I did just that, and after slapping it on top of a rocket it flew all the way there, even making a successful landing and everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt all started going wrong after Munar departure. I throttled up the engines, and the spacecraft with its three crew members were carried into a suborbital trajectory. After that engine ran out of fuel, I was about to detach it, but luckily I noticed a staging error that would\u0027ve stranded the Kerbals. So, I moved around the little boxes in the staging menu and then I slammed the spacebar. However, the staging was \u003Cem\u003Estill\u003C/em\u003E wrong, and the re-entry decoupler fired instead! Now, the crew had no vessel, and they weren\u0027t even in orbit yet! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the only thing possible was to get each crew member out individually and use their EVA packs to get them into orbit. Luckily, all three made it, but in different orbits. Nevertheless though, they were alive, and right after the incident I sent a shuttle to the Mun to rescue our stranded Kerbonauts. All three got in the spacecraft and made it home alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was \u003Cem\u003Emonths\u003C/em\u003E ago, perhaps last year, and I wasn\u0027t very good at KSP yet. That, along with the fact I never kill a kerbal, made for one heck of an intense experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
