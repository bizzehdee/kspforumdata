That, my friend, was my attempt to build the Saturn V system, accurate down to fuel and thrust. You\u0027re seeing the first and second stages. Because I had to build them vertically, there\u0027s only one coupling that holds them apart. All that weight... that\u0027s the reason that massive external trussing was put into place.

In that situation you should be able to launch at least 4000 t rocket to space and if you use asparagus technique payload can be very large too. Building of huge rockets is thing which have to learn by yourself, because it is hard to tell where you should put struts. This kind of rocket has needed several hundreds of experiments if whole development process from smaller rockets is taken into account. Just increase size step by step and see how it works.
