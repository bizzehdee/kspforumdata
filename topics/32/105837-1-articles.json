Depending which science module you\u0027re using you might find it\u0027s a bit light, which means that the heavy part of your re-entry vehicle (the pod) is furthest away from the heat shield. Unless you\u0027re very careful, the vehicle ends up flipping heavy side down, which means you end up doing a nose first re-entry, making that heat shield useless. At which point Bad Things happen.\n\nI found that out the hard way with the Science Junior.

You are only protecting ~5 square meters of a ~20 square meter pod and presumably deflecting a significant amount of heat from the protected area to the unprotected area (I have no idea if KSP models this or not).\n\nIf mass is a problem (when \\*isn\u0027t\\* mass a problem), the first thing to do is stop using a Mk1-2 pod and switch to a Mk1 pod \u002B Mk1 crew cabin.  You\u0027ll save over 2 tons of mass and can now use the 1.25 heat shield.  Another option is moving the slider \\*way\\* down on the amount of ablator on the heat shield.  It\u0027s presumably built for Eve aerobraking and overkill for nearly any Kerbin reentry.  Check out how much ablator is left on a working orbiter (presumably while slowly dangling from the parachutes) and notice that it barely uses 10%.  Of course, you might need a certain amount of ablator to make sure the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E is low enough to have the whole contraption to reenter ablator-down.\n\nFor the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E, if you can spacewalk (in career mode this isn\u0027t unlocked until a couple buildings are upgraded: I think it is the astronaut complex and science center) there is no reason to attempt to return the science jr with a capsule.  Just take the data out and put it in the capsule and just bring the capsule home.  If you must bring it back, I would try mounting it on top of the capsule (expect explosions) and use side-mounted parachute as I wouldn\u0027t be at all confident that the science jr will survive (try putting center-mount parachute on top just for the aero), but I\u0027m pretty sure this often works, just be careful about a good reentry (note I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve used this method for anything beyond returning from Low Kerbin Orbit: you mileage may vary if attempting a Minmus or Duna return).  If you don\u0027t have a kerbal on board, make the whole thing as light as possible, yet still with a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E low enough to keep the ablator pointing down (try using a full ablator for maximum ballast) and letting the low mass make rentry easier (don\u0027t bother with any aero reduction, just the ablator, science jr, probe core, and parachutes).\n\nOne final note about the Mk1 crew cabin.  Since it is the lightest way to bring kerbals to space (.5T/kerbal), I tend to abuse them a lot.  One nasty issue they have is that they have no external exits (not necessarily true if an end is exposed, but that is a pretty weird design).  You have to transfer crew between another exit (like a mk1 capsule) to perform any sort of spacewalk."},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-02T15:56:08Z","Content":"This thread is pretty ancient.\n\nHowever I\u0027ll add that you don\u0027t even need a heatshield for most returns from anywhere in Kerbins \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, especially with the Mk1 command pod.\n\nYou shouldn\u0027t be going that terribly fast anyways when you de-orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"Cpt Kerbalkrunch","CreatedById":175588,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-02T16:20:43Z","Content":"[@Rocket In My Pocket](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154640-rocket-in-my-pocket/) is correct in that you don\u0027t really need a heatshield with the Mk1-2.
