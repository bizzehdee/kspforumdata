Even for finding science on the planet they lack a use for getting places because rockets will get you there much faster. When it comes to jet engines in general the normal jet engine is even more useless. It seems like the only way jet engines could ever have much of a use is if you had to use them before you unlocked rockets. It would be great if someone else knew more about this and what plans are currently made for jets and their functionality. Maybe another type of career mode could be made for just starting with jets? Possibly a difficulty for career when easy you start with rockets and on hard you have to start with very basic jets and get samples from flying around the planet. Normal could have you start off with hard stuff but with better science equipment so it is easier to get science. It would nice to see what you guys think/know about jets in career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"95tiger59","CreatedById":92346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-21T21:49:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think they are fine as they are, besides taking the points you made on their usefulness in career is pretty much the same in sandbox. to be honest if you want to start career with jets instead Tree loader has a tech tree that starts with plane tech\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-21T21:55:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do hope for a rebalancing of the tech tree eventually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lockpicker","CreatedById":74102,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-21T21:56:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m with the OP on this matter.

I struggle big time with rockets, but once I\u0027ve got wings, I tend to do well for throwing planes into orbit. The hardest part of career mode, for me at least, is getting my wings and then getting my fuel lines. Struts aren\u0027t super necessary, but they\u0027re useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess some of it comes down to the old knowledge bin. I knew nothing of orbital mechanics when I first started playing. I barely knew much about rockets, but I\u0027ve built remote controlled aircraft from nothing but electronics and foam. A rough working knowledge of aerodynamics got me into space in KSP, as once you\u0027ve got a design that flies, all you need is to increase the amount of thrust behind it to increase speed. Go fast enough and you\u0027ll settle into an orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as I\u0027ve noticed, with the jets and wings buried several layers deep (to get the good parts, at least) in the tech tree, it cuts out the ability to really do spaceplanes early, making the aerodynamically-minded strain unless they\u0027re willing to learn to make pancake rockets. With delta wings, a good turbojet, and two LV-T45 engines, I can make my first cruise to the Mun or to Minmus. With three LV-T45\u0027s, 6 solid fuel boosters, and a few winglets for stability, I struggle to get to orbit. It\u0027s a matter of perspective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat, and it\u0027s bloody hard to make a VTOL without a jet, you know.

It took 3 different rocket-plane designs to get enough to unlock a basic jet. Then it played out very \u0022realistically\u0022 in terms of the sequence of doing things. I slowly worked my way up from short-hop flights to inter-continental (the first few landing on skids), to suborbital and then into orbit. Then a series of SSTO\u0027s that could make it to LKO and then to the local moons, just doing fly-bys to start, then orbiting and eventually I got one that could land and return. After more Mun missions I eventually landed on Duna in a glider and then the final mission was to Laythe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took a while and was the hardest career I\u0027ve ever done but I managed to unlock everything using only aircraft and without setting foot into the VAB.
