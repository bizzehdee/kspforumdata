I want to use a transportation ship to transport 2 planet lander, 2 mun lander, 3 rover \u0026amp; 3 satelites to eve. To prepare this mission I have 2 space stations. Space station 1 is a refuel station where all lander and ships will be refueld before they travel to station 2. Station 2 is a space dock where alle parts will be refueld again and when the transport ship is in orbit they will be put on in there. But the more landers, rovers, satelites and supplyships I place at the spacedock, the bigger the lag gets and docking gets verry hard. My refuel tanker can make his 180 degree turn in 5 seconds, next to the space dock (within 2,2km range) he needs more than 30 seconds. Is there a chance that there will be a performance update some day? I already turned down the graphic settings to the minimum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-10T15:14:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might rather want to break your mission down to several smaller parts than to wait for a performance update because the physics-lag that you are experiencing with big Ships does not come from KSP but from the Unity-Engine which Squad has no developing power of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry to rain on your parade \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-10T15:22:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there a chance of a performance update someday?

KSP only runs smooth up until I hit the 100 part mark and becomes unplayable in the 250-300 part range running with low settings, same resolution (playing on a 42\u0022 LCD TV). Please don\u0027t take that as complaining because I expected as much going in (read plenty of reviews, searched these forums for issues people had, and said \u0022I can accept that\u0022), but I\u0027d just like to be able to take full advantage of my crap hardware because the same crap hardware plays other games just fine.

With better multi-core support, KSP would be a lot more playable for me. I know a lot of that is Unity\u0027s fault, especially the physics calculations, so hopefully Unity 5 will make KSP run better on my system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the curious, Linux usually plays smoother but doesn\u0027t jive as nicely with mods so I normally stick to Windows x64 version....it works just fine for me with minimal bugs...better than Windows 32 actually. Also, most of the above came out of a garbage can. Found an old PC in the can at work, took it home, and it booted up to Vista (nothing of real interest on the HDD...), threw $300 towards a motherboard, ram, GPU, and watercooling and it works just fine. Threw in my 2TB drive, my non-stock power supply, and it runs like a dream. Not the best, but better than my old dual core AMD system. That\u0027s also why I took a bit of offense to the poor people excuse above...I\u0027m poor and I have a decent rig...granted it was a chop shop from dumpster diving and used parts from eBay (sans GPU, bought it brand new for $120 during a Christmas sale)...but financially challenged people (and even kids) have ways of obtaining decent enough PC\u0027s to warrant multi-core support. That doesn\u0027t apply to dumb people...they\u0027re screwed regardless \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stealth2668","CreatedById":57377,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-14T00:50:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Commissioner Tadpole\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Commissioner Tadpole\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe economically-challenged and those who have questionable computer knowledge(or are underaged and have parents like that) - or both - do have single-core PCs.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople under those circumstances wouldn\u0027t be playing games then.

Look as Skyrim. Seems like there are just as many mods to make it playable on older PCs as there are mods for enhanced graphics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I can\u0027t get any more than about 250-300 parts in orbit at a time else the game is unplayable. My system, while nothing great, can play games like BF4 and Skyrim on high and ultra, with graphics packs, mods, ENB, \u0026amp; SweetFX while pulling 30-60 fps in 1080p (capped @ 60fps most games) with smooth gameplay. KSP only runs smooth up until I hit the 100 part mark and becomes unplayable in the 250-300 part range running with low settings, same resolution (playing on a 42\u0022 LCD TV).

Single core machines are extinct. There is no reason to consider them in this discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond off, the Unity engine already does multithreading for a lot of stuff, the problem is that physics isn\u0027t multithreaded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn to the physics. The main problem is the lack of a cylinder collider in Unity, forcing them to use mesh colliders. The lack of a cylinder collider is due to the high mathematical complexity of doing cylinder collisions. With U5, the PhysX is being upgraded to v3.3, which has more support for physics multithreading, however I have heard that situations like KSP, where the calculations are a series of linked objects, cannot be multithreaded. I haven\u0027t been able to find any definitive verification of that though. Whatever it may be, I wouldn\u0027t advise getting your hopes up about what is possible until we have better info.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
