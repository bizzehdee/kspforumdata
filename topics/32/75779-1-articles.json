It\u0027s purpose is to provide provisional mapping for the surface of the planet until better technology can be applied. For a mapping satellite, a polar orbit seems fairly crucial, or else you\u0027ll miss parts of the planet off (made that mistake before...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrough sheer luck and coincidence, upon entering Duna\u0027s sphere of influence, the orbit happened to be headed right over the poles (Albeit at 8,000,000km). With a bit of retrograde burning, I managed to get a great polar orbit at 100km. In no way had I planned for that, and actually I was kind of worried I\u0027d run out of fuel adjusting the orbital plane, but I guess some things just work out that way!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it got me wondering. What are some of your best and luckiest coincidences, that you never planned. For but the end result was perfect? What were your worst?

So I was relying on pure gravity brake and engine power. Because of a bug (or misunderstanding of some game mechanics on my part) I was burning super inefficiently and would not have enough fuel to capture the asteroid in a stable orbit. (Pro tip guys: do NOT attach multiple probe cores at different points on a single asteroid and then try to target center of mass. The navball goes crazy. Or maybe I do, not sure about that one).
