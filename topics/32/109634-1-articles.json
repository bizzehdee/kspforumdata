It\u0027s definitely been extended, I think I saw a figure of 22.5km mentioned\n\nSince I almost ran out of money early in my career, most of my boosters are fitted with parachutes, and it\u0027s good to see them being pulled outwards away from the main rocket and each other by the chutes.\n\nYesterday I installed Deadly Re-Entry again, jettisoned the engine section on a return from Mun and dipped into the upper atmosphere. I could see the jettisoned section burning up a few clicks away, better still it was gradually BREAKING up too. I lost sight of it when the solar panels on the crew section started exploding, but this could have repercussions for those of us who try to land near the KSC, raining debris all over the place..."},{"CreatedByName":"Xkay7","CreatedById":129537,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T12:58:32Z","Content":"This is great news!"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T13:00:20Z","Content":"Yes.

I think it does powered descents too but I haven\u0027t tried that.\n\nYea, but that\u0027s no fun imo for the stage to just be magically recovered. Back in .25 I used BDArmory to increase the range to 150km. I was able to perform barge landings and boost backs to the launch pad AND still put something to orbit at the same time. It was incredibly difficult to manage two vessels ( or one honestly because mechjeb flew the second stage to orbit ) and often times very buggy due to floating point errors. Switching to and from vessels over a 75\u002Bkm away from each other is asking for a kraken attack.\n\nBut I tell you it was so much fun and so challenging. If Squad were to implement a large loading range or a system where you can specify which parts on a craft to keep loaded ( and squash the bugs that came with it ) it\u0027d become standard practice to perform boost back maneuvers or barge landings.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T15:41:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 03:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600**"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T15:39:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E For anyone wondering, range in atmospheric flight is 22.5 km, anywhere else it is still 2.5k (I have no idea why some people are saying 7 k).\n\nI thought ground range is 5KM?"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T15:51:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I thought ground range is 5KM?\n\nTest it yourself, my ground ships always unload at 2.5 km."},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T15:53:14Z","Content":"I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s 22km across the board.
