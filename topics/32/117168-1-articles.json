For the tl;dr crowd, skip to the bottom.\n\nLast night, playing a career game. Still relatively early in the career, so I only have about half the tech tree unlocked. Got a contract to rescue a Kerbal marooned on the Mun. Figure I\u0027ll do a quick and dirty rescue mission. Throw together a lander craft, put in a Kerbal that needs Mun landing experience, and send it to the Mun. After landing near the stranded Kerbal (close to the Mun south pole), I realize that I don\u0027t have enough delta-v left to even get into Mun orbit. Thankfully, I have a docking port on the rescue craft, so I figure I\u0027ll do the Kerbal thing and send a rescue mission to rescue my rescue mission. Throw together another rescue craft, put in a 3 kerbal crew (need experience) and send it to the Mun. Get it into the appropriate orbit and then launch rescue1 from Mun surface into a high, suborbital trajectory. Timed it so rescue2 craft would intersect, and then I burn a ton of fuel getting them to rendezvous and dock (as they are both hurtling towards the Mun surface). Burn a ton more fuel boosting the now docked craft back into Mun orbit and realize that I now don\u0027t have enough fuel to get either craft back to Kerbin. What to do now? Yep....rescue mission for my rescue mission for my rescue mission.\n\nThis time, I just build a remote controlled fuel tanker. Slap a probe core on a fuel tank, add an engine, some RCS ports (and fuel) and a couple docking ports on opposite sides of the fuel can. Launch that into LKO, send it out to the Mun, get it into the right orbit, and rendezvous with the docked together rescue1 and rescue2 craft. Then I undock those two craft from each other and dock each one to a port on the fuel tanker. Hooray! I now have plenty of fuel to get both rescue craft home to Kerbin and can leave the fuel tanker floating around the Mun for future missions. I transfer enough fuel to rescue1 to get it back to Kerbin, undock it, and send it back. Re-entry is cool and mission successful. \n\nThen I get to thinking, why send rescue2 back? I got tons of fuel in it now; why not send it to Minmus and see if I can pick up a few contracts with that? But first, lets get rid of some clutter. All these launches have been terribly inefficient and I\u0027ve left a lot of junk in space. Lets go to the tracking station, sort by debris only, and terminate all the stuff labeled and classified as \u0022debris\u0022. So I do this, and then go looking for my rescue2 craft (which I left still docked to the fuel tanker). Hmmm....not there. Not listed as a ship, not listed as a probe, it\u0027s gone. Check the astronaut complex and, sure enough, 3 dead Kerbals; KIA. Really??? Apparently, the tracking station classified (and labeled it) as debris despite the fact there was a probe core on the tanker, and a manned ship docked to it.\n\nSigh. Pouring out one for my dead homies....\n\nTL;DR - A fuel tanker with a permanently attached probe core (and therefore a \u0027probe\u0027), and a manned ship docked to a docking port on the fuel tanker was labeled and classified as \u0027debris\u0027 and not as a \u0027probe\u0027 or as a \u0027craft\u0027 by the tracking station. Therefore, when I terminated all \u0027debris\u0027 via the tracking station, I killed an entire crew.

My understanding about the way KSP works is that when two ships dock together, you don\u0027t have two ships anymore, you have ONE ship, and a couple of lines of text in the ship\u0027s persistence file that remember things like the name and classification. Then when you undock, it splits them into two ships again without actually knowing anything about the ship that once existed as a whole vessel - it just snaps the Legos apart at the docking node, and rebuilds the ship from there, since what if you docked ANOTHER thing to the second ship, etc etc. My assumption is that it attempts to read the old name and classification from the previous root part / command part, but that\u0027s just me speculating. \n\nThe process seems to work mostly okay for the actual physical separation of the vessels, but the naming and vessel classifications are a crapshoot. It seems to me that KSP has a hard time dynamically figuring out what a vessel should be named and classified as, especially if you glom together a bunch of different ships together and then break them off asymmetrically. If you have a fuel tank or something as the root part of a vessel, that seems to exacerbate the issue."},{"CreatedByName":"keeper","CreatedById":124530,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T20:07:13Z","Content":"I always make a habit of re-naming the craft after seperation/undocking.

I must have just either clicked the wrong thing, or not checked what it was called, or expecting what I delete to be some other part... \n\nNow I jump to *every* object i\u0027m about to delete before i delete it. I cant \u0022just delete\u0022 some object without first being certain I know what it is. Infact now I delete things so rarely I make a thing over it because things don\u0027t normally just vanish.

The fuel tanker had a probe core on it and 2 docking ports. my rescue craft were manned and docked to the docking ports. I did not rename anything. I simply undocked rescue1, flew it home, recovered it and went to the tracking station. sorted out everything but debris (assuming that something with a probe core and a manned capsule would not be classified as debris) and started terminating.

I sorted everything out of the tracking station except debris and went through one by one terminating debris. I wasn\u0027t really paying attention to everything I was terminating because I assumed a manned craft with a probe core would not be classified as debris. Apparently it was and I terminated it along with the rest of the junk. I phrased it the way I did for the sake of brevity and did not mean to imply there is a way to blow away everything with one click.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nFor further clarification on this issue:\n\n1) I did not name or rename any of the vessels involved in this story. I\u0027m using the names \u0027rescue1\u0027 and \u0027rescue2\u0027 for the sake of the reader to keep track of what I was doing to what. All vessels were actually using the default name of \u0022Untitled Space Craft\u0022.\n\n2) When I went into the tracking station and sorted out everything but debris, the list of tracked objects on the left side contained everything labeled as \u0022Untitled Space Craft debris\u0022. I went through one by one and terminated these objects assuming my manned craft docked to another craft with a probe core would not be classified as debris and therefore show up in that list.\n\nWhat I think happened is what Wiseman and keeper were getting at: when I docked the two rescue craft to the fuel tanker (all three being named \u0022Untitled Space Craft\u0022), it kept that name for the resulting ship. When I undocked the first craft (what I\u0027m calling rescue1 in the story), it kept the \u0022Untitled Space Craft\u0022 name and the other ship (rescue2 docked to the fuel tanker) must have automatically renamed \u0022Untitled Space Craft debris\u0022 and classified as debris despite having a probe core and a manned capsule. So when I started terminating debris in the tracking station, I blew away that ship.\n\nIn the end, it does come down to me not thoroughly checking everything I was terminating and making assumptions (you know what they say about that...). Lesson learned. But still, I\u0027m confused how a manned ship can be classified as debris."},{"CreatedByName":"richfiles","CreatedById":129946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T05:44:52Z","Content":"When i want to terminate stuff, I manually switch my vessel to debris, undock the dead item, and then reset my original vessel to whatever it was (probe, station, base, crewed vessel, etc).
