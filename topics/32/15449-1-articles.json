My first story is one of my ambition for landing a base on the surface of the Mun, which turned out to be a challenge. My first experiences with building the craft were frustrating. Launching the craft was not going to work, my stages were too tall and my base was buckling under the stress of flight. I didn\\\u0027t know about the whole \u0027throttle control\u0027 (who knew full throttle wasn\\\u0027t ideal? ???) aspect of flying, so my base simply broke apart at about 70km above Kerbin. I made some changes that included downsizing and adding more fuel. Off to launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img215.imageshack.us/img215/554/screenshot56c.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot56c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the way to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img593.imageshack.us/img593/4880/screenshot57td.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot57td.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy intercept of the mun, Star Trek anyone?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlight was normal, escaped atmosphere, etc. when disaster happened. After intercepting the Mun, I got in position to separate from my lifter stage to land, and I forgot to throttle down before separating! My base was wounded, but I decided to land anyway. on landing, I decided to answer a text message while it fell to a close enough distance. I looked up to see a crater where my base was supposed to be. It wasn\\\u0027t my day, honestly :\\\u0027(\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img593.imageshack.us/img593/5708/screenshot62a.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot62a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComing around..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake 2 of Mun landing was much more successful. After adding landing lights and other doohickeys I was ready to start over. Separation was normal, etc. and I was on final descent for landing. I was on the light side of the moon and found a nice spot near a mountain range to explore later. Touched down about 3m/s, and took pictures. After days I managed to get a base on the moon!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img864.imageshack.us/img864/8327/screenshot64v.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot64v.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img576.imageshack.us/img576/9070/screenshot66s.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot66s.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanded!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img72.imageshack.us/img72/3227/screenshot72a.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot72a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crew pose for a \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Erelief\u003C/span\u003E celebration photo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI enjoyed this story of my first Mun base, I hope you all did too!
