At 223m altitude on Eve every stock engine I looked at had an ISP below 200 with the \u0022mammoth\u0022 engine topping the list at 198.3 ISP. Some engines were abysmal though like the \u0022swivel\u0022 at only 64.6 ISP and 40.4 kN thrust. The SRBs were the worst with ISP numbers in the 30s and 40s and thrust numbers that are only 25% as good as when at sea level on Kerbin. Even the \u0022aerospike\u0022 engine (189.5 ISP, 100.3 kN thrust) seems like a poor choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of this seems to point towards needing a really huge ascent vessel with a lot of \u0022mammoth\u0022 engines to get you up the first 20-30km. The downside is that landing something that big or even flying it there from Kerbin will be all that much harder, plus you need for all that size to be aerodynamic if you want to control it at all. We may only need 7500 m/s DV \u002B/- to get to orbit on Eve now, but getting that much DV seems to take a bigger rocket in 1.0.x than having a 12km/s rocket did in 0.90.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes this mesh with what you guys have found so far with Eve ascents in 1.0 or am I just doing something very wrong here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
