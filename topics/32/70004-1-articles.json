I did use the exact same ship and launch it again from kerbin to go and land on lathe and return. So my concept was right at least. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did find one oversight which turned into a major oops.. I put 4 tailwings and control surfaces on it. 1 of which partially blocked my ladders. I was able to get rosey down but not up. Luckily I quicksaved right before getting out. But I was able to stay on the ladder and get my surface sample. Etc. I just wasn\u0027t able to plant a flag. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Lathe trip netted 1900 science. Without any extra fly by of Jool or its other moons. Almost got the tree completely unlocked. So happy about that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone does similar.. Helpful hints would be to set control groups for rocket engines and jet engines. Would have made the take off a lot smoother. (eject Jets and manually right click and activate each of the Lv-909 while doing 1200 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B1 m/s in atmosphere was not fun.
