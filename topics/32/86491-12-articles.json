(which then would result in someone writing a mod to do a PU shift for the stage!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, DIFFERENT propellant combinations with realistic performance specs would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow about doing away with the red hot glowing engine bells? Most engines are regeneratively cooled and don\u0027t glow, and those that do glow brightest at the throat, not the end of the nozzle where the flow is coolest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI already edit the texture masks used for engine glow to remove it for engines that are cooled and to glow brightest at the throat for those that are uncooled or ablative (or is that \u0022abalative\u0022?) \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more thing I would really like is the ability to do internal vehicle-to-vehicle transfers (i.e. a real IVA). Needing to do an EVA and bouncing off the spacecraft, spinning into oblivion is not realistic (or fun) \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA tether for EVA would be nice too... although I don\u0027t know how a realistic looking tether would be done. A straight line that changes in length would look corny.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe use random arcs or beziers to dynamically generate the proper length of tether as the astronaut moves?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d even be happy with magnetic boots! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the mere existence of so many mods shows that at least some people really do want more realism and more features above and beyond stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as I said, everyone could have the option to use or not use any feature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, I noticed that your signline advertises RCS parts and improvements. Do those include RCS sound? I know there is already an RCS sound mod (that I use), but of course I hacked it for more realism. RCS outside the vehicle would not be heard. Inside all that\u0027s heard is a bang which is the sound of the solenoid valves opening and the onset of thrust. So I recorded the sound of rapping my knuckle on an empty paint can for the start transient, a low, quiet constant \u0022rushing\u0022 sound for propellant flow and combustion noise and a sharper \u0022click-bang\u0022 for RCS off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engine running sound I made by taking pure random data as a WAV file (which is white noise), then bandpass filtered it between 30 and 150 Hz. It sounds great!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh well, enough for now...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Krupski","CreatedById":80925,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-31T12:31:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CaptRobau\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CaptRobau\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERCS\u002B (1.1) - New RCS parts, easier to use thrusters and all sorts of RCS improvements\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a nice model to use:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(click image for full res)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.gunsnet.net/photopost/data/500/r4d.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.gunsnet.net/photopost/data/500/medium/r4d.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022r4d.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-31T12:49:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Krupski\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Krupski\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow does fixing a bug and adding a few visual effects make the game \u0022too hard for a lot of people to play\u0022?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngine throttling (and infinite start/stops) is not a bug, it\u0027s a design decision that I and almost every other player is happy is there.
