LethalDose already mentioned that the linux edition is apparently really good, never tried it. It is truly a case by case basis. I, for one, use the 64-bit version without any major issues. There is the occasional crash, but it is usually due to my own experimentation. Usually I just re-launch the game and all is well. I truly do not know why so many people are up in arms about the KSPx64 in Windows. The only annoyance I have is the right-click difficulty. I don\u0027t understand how that\u0027s not resolved yet, but it is far from game breaking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Troubletcat","CreatedById":130757,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T10:22:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I\u0027ve had absolutely no problems with x64 on Windows 8.1 aside from some mods I like disabling themselves in it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027m in the minority there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, you might as well give x64 a shot if you\u0027re not planning on using any/many mods.
