Recently it\u0027s the aerodynamics and re-entry heating that have been massive changes that alter how we fly our missions. For me, though, what has been the biggest improvement in terms of how I build and fly my rockets in 1.0, though, is the service bays.\n\nThere are so many situations where I want to have small size or surface-attach components in the middle of a 2.5 m size rocket. Perhaps it\u0027s science kit, perhaps it\u0027s a probe core for an unmanned launch vehicle to add a new module to a space station or construct-in-orbit long range mission, or maybe a bit of extra RCS fuel. It\u0027s so good to have a structurally rigid container that I can fill with all that sort of junk ... er I mean essential equipment. My rockets now don\u0027t look like they have had a warehouse full of junk stapled to the sides of them, and I can do heavy duty unmanned launch vehicles with mid tech tree kit that don\u0027t end up like limp spaghetti."},{"CreatedByName":"Frostiken","CreatedById":1837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T19:00:20Z","Content":"The biggest issue I have with the service bays is that they make struts and fuel lines a ...... They tend to be a little... uh... \u0027lippy\u0027 and trying to run a fuel line up from beneath almost ALWAYS gets snagged on the service bay.\n\nI do kind of wish fuel lines had a way to make them \u0027poke out\u0027 from the side of the rocket a bit to get around \u0027lippy\u0027 parts. Struggling to get them to properly wrap around a decoupler can be frustrating."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T20:53:25Z","Content":"\u002B1 to this. Service bays nicely solve a problem that\u0027s been annoying me in KSP since forever: the lack of a 1.25m probe core until you\u0027re waaay up the tech tree.\n\nPretty much every vessel I have needs to have a probe core, whether it\u0027s crewed or not, since I don\u0027t want to be at the mercy of pilot availability. However, being limited to 0.625m probe cores means that I have to play games with adapters/struts/etc. to build these ugly in-line contraptions (e.g. adapter from 1.25m down to .625, then probe core, then adapter back up to 1.25, then add struts to make it sturdy). With a service bay, I can just drop a probe core into the bay. Done.\n\nThe service bays are also nicely sturdy (14 m/s impact tolerance), which make them handy for interplanetary lander probes early in career, where mass is at a premium and not having to have engines on the lander comes in really handy."},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T03:22:59Z","Content":"^ This. It continues to boggle me why SQUAD insists on putting the 1.25m core way out at the end so we have to compromise using small cores and struts or service bays. Putting the CPU in a bigger case really isn\u0027t a technological miracle. Maybe the 2.5m core can be at the end, but the 1.25 should be much earlier, possibly right after the Stayputnik in place of the OKTO.\n\nAnd if people need the builtin SAS later, perhaps SQUAD can add a feature where it is \u0022disabled\u0022 but the part itself remains available a la Procedural Fairings."},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T03:34:58Z","Content":"Speaking of small parts...
