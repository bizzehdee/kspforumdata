Kuzzter has touched on this upstream. 5s and As are often used as test patterns, filler, etc. due to this property.\n\n You can expect to see less randomness if you look at it as a string of binary.\n\n    5566 AA55 66DB 4AA9 AA95 5955\n\nis\n\n    010101010110011010101010010101010110011011011011010010101010100110101010100101010101100101010101\n\nThis string of binary is \\*really\\* not random.

Without knowing whether this was a seeded encryption, a substitution cipher, or whatever there was no point in making random manipulations to find out--the string is so short that any or all of those could have been the path.\n\nWith the clues of (1) repeating 00 and (2) alternating bits are important, I can see that the string \u00271001\u0027 acts (mostly) as a separator between sections of alternating bits, and I can rearrange the binary to this pattern:\n\n0101010101\n\n1001\n\n10101010\n\n1001\n\n01010101\n\n1001\n\n**10 11 01 10 11 01 00**\n\n10101010 \n\n1001 \n\n10101010\n\n1001\n\n01010101\n\n1001\n\n01010101\n\nThe string in the middle \u002710 11 01 10 11 01 00\u0027 is the only one that is not either \u00271001\u0027 or alternating bits. (Yes, there is another \u00271001\u0027 string in there, but if I take that out as a separator it breaks the pattern of the repeating strings) Another interpretation is that the message includes the repeating bits in the following line up to the next 1001, making the complete message \u002710 11 01 10 11 01 00 10 10 10 10\u0027\n\nThat\u0027s all I\u0027ve got so far.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-23T12:45:12Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2015 12:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kuzzter**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tweety","CreatedById":115567,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T12:53:29Z","Content":"274?\n\nTweety"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T12:57:36Z","Content":"Kuzzter,\n\nWe\u0027re running short of time , so I\u0027ll help it along a bit more.\n\nLook at the occurrence of double zeroes in the string and how they relate to single zeroes.\n\n010101010110011010101010010101010110011011011011010010101010100110101010100101010101100101010101\n\nThe pairs occur every 5th single digit zero, which is way to regular to be coincidence.\n\nAlso note that because of this there are always 5 ones (or pairs of ones) between zero pairs.\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T13:02:15Z","Content":"Here I thought I was being ridiculous breaking it down to binary when I first looked at it.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"Trentendegreth","CreatedById":86953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T13:15:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Kuzzter,\n\u003E We\u0027re running short of time , so I\u0027ll help it along a bit more.\n\u003E \n\u003E Look at the occurrence of double zeroes in the string and how they relate to single zeroes.\n\u003E \n\u003E 010101010110011010101010010101010110011011011011010010101010100110101010100101010101100101010101\n\u003E \n\u003E The pairs occur every 5th single digit zero, which is way to regular to be coincidence.\n\u003E \n\u003E Also note that because of this there are always 5 ones (or pairs of ones) between zero pairs.\n\u003E \n\u003E Best,\n\u003E \n\u003E -Slashy\n\nMy stupid is showing \\*grey matter leaks out of head..."},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T13:21:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 010101010110011010101010010101010110011011011011010010101010100110101010100101010101100101010101\n\nThe number of digits between the 00\u0027s varies from 9 to 13.
