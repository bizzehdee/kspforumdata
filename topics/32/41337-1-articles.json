I never got to even try capturing any debris. Three craft in a row, when switching to the vessel in orbit the landing legs broke off and floated off at ~10 m/s. (I then switched to using the electromagnet in the Kerbal Attachment System. That fourth cleaner craft worked, and most of the debris it had to clean were those !?#! landing legs!) I don\u0027t know where the bug lies (physics engine? loading routine? part model?) but there\u0027s definitely a bug; it\u0027s not just you!
