We didn\u0027t have any encounter warning system so when you burned you burned till you made it to almost above the mun\u0027s orbit. When I encountered I was always over eager with my landings, and since most of my Pe\u0027s where on the night side of the mun, I always came down at night. When I was coming down, it was impossible to tell how far you where from the surface, so I would often pancake jeb bob and bill into the surface thinking that I had made it more than a kilometer or much more up. It wasn\u0027t until I would look at my navball and see me gaining speed would not be able to slow it down in time. Soon I figured out how to enter orbit, and pick my landing sites. But it wasn\u0027t until I downloaded some of my first mods, those that gave me landing legs, was I able to land, and until .14 that I was able to build one that would return."},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T00:07:39Z","Content":"My first Mun landing in 0.12, was terrible. I knew nothing about orbital mechanic. I just went there with a straight line, using a huge rocket. Finally I landed on the bell of my engine and I was stuck there... Not enough fuel to come back.\n\nI was very lucky on that first attempt. I needed more and more try to successfully land again."},{"CreatedByName":"airelibre","CreatedById":107713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T01:33:00Z","Content":"Incredibly easy.

I did not know much about orbital mechanics, and thus was on a very eccentric collision course (I thought it would be more efficient at the time). I ended up doing a rather inefficient series of suicide burns. After \u0022lithobraking too fast\u0022, I quickloaded and landed on the Mun.\n\nThis was back when the standard landing legs were rather ugly, unstable, and tended to fall off frequently."},{"CreatedByName":"GDJ","CreatedById":58462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T04:55:18Z","Content":"Well, way back in 0.18, my first landing on the Mun was kinda rough. Broke off 2 landing struts (installed 6 so no biggie) and lost a fuel tank. Barely had enough fuel and engines to make Mun orbit, but was able to save that frickin moron Jeb.\n\nI hate Jeb. Every new plane or rocket I put him in the pilots seat hoping the piece of crap will blow up and kill him."},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T05:41:00Z","Content":"Mine was like ...

Back then I created an Apollo-style craft. Not only did I successfully land on the Mun (free return trajectory orbit nonetheless), I also managed to take off from it and return to Kerbin, using an MOR (Munar Orbit Rendezvous) method. First try. I thank my Orbiter experience (I have used Orbiter since 2001) for achieving this on the very first attempt. I was also part of an Orbiter addon team that developed addons and enhancements for NASSP (which eventually became Project Apollo)."}]}
