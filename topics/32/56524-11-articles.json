They don\u0027t have to worry about power, and capsules are easier to control because the have larger reaction wheels.

Early on, the only science you get from probe missions are from recovering a craft that went someplace. Again, because the focus is on manned missions and having access to science sensors and all the manned science at the same time would have players blowing through the early tech tree. Once you get another level or two into the tech tree, there are science sensor parts that will let you gain science through them. The thermometer is probably the first one you\u0027ll get.

If you look at the US space programs, manned missions came well before anything other than primitive tests. The first unmanned satellites didn\u0027t do much. They transmitted, but weren\u0027t controllable. Some had instruments to give them something meaningful to send back, but in terms of KSP that kind of mission wouldn\u0027t give you much to do except launch and maybe do some staging. At best it would be a single launch to get you a science point or two to start the manned program.

Others have responded already, but I\u0027d like to add another thought regarding your first two questions. There\u0027s another thread in this general discussion forum that has screenshots from the very first versions of the game. If you look at them, you\u0027ll see the parts the game originally had are very similar to the parts you start with in career mode (e.g. 1-Kerbal capsule, fuel tank, engine, solid rocket). Airplane parts were first developed by a modder member of the community and were only added to the stock game in a later version. Although airplane parts are widely used and appreciated by the community now, I think the developers still think of those basic rocket parts as the \u0027core\u0027 of the game, and my guess is that making them the starting parts in career mode was just the default option to them. The tech tree partially mirrors the development of the game, as well as a progression of more advanced parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding your questions about the usefulness of probes fairly early on in career mode (i.e. before solar panels, batteries, etc.) ... good questions! I don\u0027t think the tech tree was changed in this version except to add the new parts, so we\u0027re still looking at essentially the first publicly-released version. I expect (I hope) that it will get changed in future versions to iron out wrinkles like that. For now, as others have said, there are mods that change the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Duke-49th","CreatedById":200569,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T11:02:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Eric S\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Eric S\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDo you have any mods installed? some mods didn\u0027t cope with 0.23 very well, and emit a lot of errors, which have to get handled, which takes time.
