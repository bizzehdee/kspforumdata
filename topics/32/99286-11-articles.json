More people use twitter than the forums, same with reddit, and every other source. So more people are exposed and thus generate awareness. Is there any community less numerous than the forum? Plus the info hunt is kind of fun and a pleasant surprise when someone posts it here. We do get the dev notes, and Harv and the gang do respond to posts here like they do elsewhere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course we all think they dont respond enough because they dont spend every waking hour answering every question we ask but it still happens. A twitter feed window in the forums would be nice, that updates with dev posts in reddit would be awesome. But is there really any example of information that never made it to the forum in some way? Everything gets posted here eventually. Worst case scenario is that we get surprised when the update drops. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearning the features arnt what you wanted or whatever is going to happen no matter how you learn about it so not being told isnt really that big a deal. If Squad didnt care about the forums then we wouldnt be getting any posts from them. So my opinion is that, we always want more, but what we have isnt bad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
