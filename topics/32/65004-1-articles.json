Generally, 0.x.x is any version before a completed build of a program, 1.x.x is the first finished product, 2.x.x would be the next major overhaul, etc. The second number is usually a development build, and it doesn\u0027t have to go to 100. It could go from 0.56.0 to 1.0.0, or it could go all the way to 0.374.0 before being released as 1.0.0, it\u0027s really just how many major updates they\u0027ve had.
