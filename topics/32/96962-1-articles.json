To really do it right, there should be two classes of engines - small expansion ratio and large expansion ratio. Small expansion ratios are used at low altitude where the ambient pressure is high, and large expansion ratios are used at high-altitude or in space where the ambient pressure is at or near zero. A small expansion ratio engine might have a sea level/vacuum ISP balance of something like 260/300 s, while a large expansion ratio engine might be something like 100/350 s. These are basically real life values, in KSP specific impulses are a little higher than real life (assuming LOX/kerosene).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP engines are balanced in such a way that that we get the best of both worlds - both good sea level and good vacuum performance. Of course this is the theory behind aerospike engines. An aerospike performs like a variable expansion ratio engine, obtaining small expansion ratio like performance at low altitude and large expansion ratio like performance at high altitude. In this regard, all engines in KSP behave like aerospikes, except, of course, the toroidal aerospike rocket. The in-game aerospike gives a vacuum-like performance at all altitudes, which isn\u0027t analogous to any real life engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T22:36:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starhawk\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starhawk\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat is a thing of beauty!

Personally, I would be happy to see that, but I understand the reason for not overcomplicating it. The thrust/fuel flow issue is one that I\u0027ve seen many people complain about. It bothered me at first but I just learned to live with it. All these issues would probably bother me a lot more if I were a FAR user and striving for maximum realism, but so far I\u0027ve only played stock while waiting to see what Squad does with the update. If Squad does decide to make changes to ISP, I hope they do it across the board and fix everything. If they fix one thing and not something else, then the thing they didn\u0027t fix will probably bug more than if they did nothing at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-18T02:34:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starhawk\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starhawk\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI understand the need for compromises in simulations, but I\u0027m for more realism, if it works. Interesting info, Bob. Thanks. Of course, as Scott Manley pointed out in one of his videos, if we want to model ISP realistically, thrust should change, rather than fuel consumption. But, again, I understand the need for tradeoffs. I would imagine there are mods that attempt to rebalance the engine ISP\u0027s to make them more realistic.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s absolutely zero need for any \u0027tradeoffs\u0027 for the thrust-varies-with-ISP system. The flow-varies-with-ISP calculations that stock uses are in fact slightly more expensive and slightly more complex than the correct code. There\u0027s at least a half dozen mods out there that incorporate that, plus many of them do the extend-to-zero thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real tradeoff here is that \u003Cem\u003Esomeone\u003C/em\u003E is trading off correct thrust calculations vs. the terrible, horrible, traumatizing ordeal of loading a file and changing between 1 and 5 lines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Also before anybody brings up it ruining gameplay, there\u0027s essentially two classes of people who would be affected by any change: the first group is the \u0027moar boosters\u0027 kind. If their TWRs on the launchpad fell a bit, they\u0027d simply go \u0027whoops\u0027 and slap on, you guessed it, moar boosters...assuming their launchpad TWR was like 1.15 to begin with, which is unlikely.

To really do it right, there should be two classes of engines - small expansion ratio and large expansion ratio. Small expansion ratios are used at low altitude where the ambient pressure is high, and large expansion ratios are used at high-altitude or in space where the ambient pressure is at or near zero. A small expansion ratio engine might have a sea level/vacuum ISP balance of something like 260/300 s, while a large expansion ratio engine might be something like 100/350 s. These are basically real life values, in KSP specific impulses are a little higher than real life (assuming LOX/kerosene)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt always bothered me that the LV-909 has a short nozzle and yet has a high vacuum Isp.

I try not to let stuff like this bother me. I\u0027m sure the artists had to make the engines look different enough that a player could easily distinguish between them. And as you say, there\u0027s a need to make some engines squat to fulfill certain roles.
