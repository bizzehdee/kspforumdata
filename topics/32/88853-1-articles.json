The separatrons have a unchanging Isp with pressure , that is good , and a crazy high TWR, that is also a good thing, but their Isp is 100, that is bad in general and worse for a SRB ( their dry mass/fully loaded mass is in par with other SRB , btw ), so, while the proposed solution has some plausibility, it would need staging and probably fine tuning to even have a chance of working ....\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-29T13:11:01Z\u0022 title=\u002210/29/2014 01:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by r_rolo1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Dwarf","CreatedById":67709,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T13:13:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat was my plan!
