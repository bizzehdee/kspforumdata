The vast majority of Kethane on Minmus is located on hilly regions, but I found a few hexes on the plain and set up my base there. It\u0027s not a resource-rich area, though, and I expect I\u0027ll be running it dry before terribly long. So, my question is this...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy current plan is to lift a set of larger fuel/kethane storage tanks to append to the base, but I\u0027m wondering if I need to design it to be easily-relocated later or not. Those of you who run long-term resource bases, how do you handle kethane exhaustion? Do you try to pack up the whole facility and move everything to a new hex? Or do you build remote mining vehicles that can mine decent quantities, then return to base for refining?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis question gets even messier if I want to install the remote launch facility mod and need \u0022parts\u0022 resource mining. The bigger the base gets, obviously, the harder it is to relocate, so I\u0027m curious how others handle this sort of logistics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-21T00:10:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is one of the reasons i\u0027ve never tried building permanent fuel bases off-world.
