This most frequent occurred while in the Tracking Station with very little time-warp in progress. Just as the ship approached the initial encounter point, I slowed warp to normal time, then clicked to fly the vessel... the screen went black and \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Esuper lag ensued\u003C/span\u003E. ESCaping out to KSC left me with another black screen. Exiting out of the game and examining the Persistent file shows no trace of the ship. Time wasted. This is really starting to .... me off. This is the kind of thing that lends my opinion that this game is not stable ... and needs to stay in Beta until such things are fixed. In the mean time, we\u0027ve got big fancy explosions and girl Kerbals. :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-31T22:41:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStarted stepping up on mods as we get closer to 1.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeen having a lot of trouble with EVE, though...

Launcher gets a 22t dummy payload into high suborbital(~200dV required for circularization) really easy, but getting my actual 21.x t lander/cm into orbit was a whole lot trickier, took about five tries until I got a high enough ap to be able to finish my docking maneuvers before circularization. Also the reason for the massive amount of tailfins, the payload test launcher did not have any.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really wanted to do something more exciting for a landing than just the usual bare bones simple single stage landers/return vehicles I usually do.
