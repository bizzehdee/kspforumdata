KIS/KAS, Planetary Base Systems, and Near Future (all of it) are the only major parts packs; the latter will be very important for reaching the Outer Planets mod-planets and the even more distant \u0022Trans-Keptunian\u0022 ones. Also USI Life Support, because it\u0026#39;s way too easy to send Kerbals on long missions in the stock game (why even bother with unmanned probes?). TAC looked overly complex and \u0022Snacks\u0022 has no real penalty for starving your Kerbals.

One kerbal tried to land in a dark area of the Mun with no lights (because I forgot to add them again) and tipped over; she was pulverized on takeoff, but the lander somehow survived, so I sent it back to the mothership to save the science and cut the mission short.
