Also, apparently, if you\u0027re going 2km/s when you hit 19km altitude on Kerbin your craft will break up, which is really cool. A few launches last night confirm that it plays and launches much like 0.90 \u002B oldFAR \u002B DRE, which is also great.

Apart from the heatplosion that you get at low altitude \u002B high speed. Not sure why it was felt there was a need for that.

For example, the large reaction wheel produces many times more drag than it should given its small exposed surface area. Heat shields also produce excessive drag during launch despite the fact they are occluded and enclosed in a fairing. There are likely other examples that I haven\u0027t noticed. As of 1.04, these issues still haven\u0027t been fixed. From what I\u0027ve seen, this is possibly the biggest bug that still needs to be addressed. The bug makes launch vehicles using these parts excessively draggy, far more than is certainly intended."},{"CreatedByName":"Sidereus","CreatedById":135263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T21:46:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I think it still needs a lot of tweaks, but the game became increasingly complex with the last few patches.

I didn\u0027t realize just how easy it had become until I built a simple craft to do a Mun flyby yesterday. What would have taken a fairly massive vehicle in .90 and before became just a couple Thumper boosters and two fairly small liquid stages made up of a half dozen or so FL-T400 tanks, a LV-T45 and a LV-909. \n\nGetting back definitely is harder, though. I think the parachutes might be bugged....they seem to be opening at ASL instead of the altitude over the terrain like they used to. Going to have to investigate that a bit further. ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif)\n\nn/m.
