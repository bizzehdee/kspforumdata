I play entirely stock, while I appreciate the modding community I generally have wanted to stay on top of what direction Squad is taking KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my opinion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOne of the central factors (if not THE MOST central factor) that makes simulation and management games fun is increasingly complicated logistics.\u003C/strong\u003E For example, as a new player, there\u0027s a special feeling that arises when you look at the potential theoretical logistics and strategy in a game, and see such complexity that you think to yourself \u0022That\u0027s ridiculous!\u0022 I\u0027m sure we\u0027ve all been there before, only a few months later to completely understand the system and be juggling more than you thought you ever could. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe all got that feeling when we opened up the orbital map and saw Jool and Eeloo for the first time. But, unfortunately, once you get there and do what you want, you\u0027re done. I don\u0027t do well at making my own content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis totally sounds corny, but it\u0027s true; when I was a little kid, like 8 or 9 years old playing Star Fox 64, I always thought to myself that one of the best games that could ever exist would be a game where you can build a spaceship and fly out to new planets and stars and colonize them. And look; I\u0027ve got that game installed on my computer right here in 2013 with 210 hours logged on it. But alas, I\u0027ve run out of things to do in it, and I know that the key to increasing that 210 hours to 1000 or more over several years would be... a resource system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, of course, I\u0027m a little disappointed. I\u0027m sure KSP will be even more fun and I\u0027m sure Squad will do great things with it.

It doesn\u0027t take a lot of intuition to see that expanded resources is not something most of the player base is going to enjoy for KSP: many have problems just getting into orbit consistently, let alone getting out to another planet or moon, landing, gathering resources, getting back into orbit, and returning to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I know it\u0027s kind of sad, but we simply must face up to the facts: what we want is not what most players are even at the skill level necessary to appreciate, let alone also want.

Solution? Launch couple of separate ships, and dock them together in orbit - creating a mothership that can get the job done. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuch ship requires a lot of fuel to push its mass around. Solution? Either launch a series of orbital tankers that will slowly fill mothership\u0027s tanks, or build a refuelling station in parking orbit to do it in one go. Second option requires more investment at first, but allows for more elasticity with planning refuelling trips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESaid refuelling trips require a lot of time. Doing six consecutive cargo launches stops being fun fast. And sooner or later you realise that you are burning a lot of fuel climbing up Kerbin\u0027s deep gravity well. Fuel that could be used for better purposes - i.e. launching a ship to Jool. Solution? Get fuel cheaper. Fuel from Kerbin costs 4500 m\\s dV. From the Mun its 3420 m\\s (if my calculations based on KSP dV map available on the forum are correct). No, even less because fuel shuttle goes to the Mun almost empty, and can do whole trip using only nukes. Getting fuel from Minmus is even cheaper, though more time consuming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this stage of development it doesn\u0027t mean much. Everything is free. As long as you are willing to put hours of playtime into it, you can do everything without the need to use external resources. But in full career mode, when you are on budget those small savings will start look enticing.

Why cut this option entirely from a game that strives to semi-realistically follow real life space exploration? It\u0027s illogical, counterproductive and hard to justify. Because it would be too hard for new players? Please...I was a newbie once: scared of docking, sweating during Mun landing, nervous about aerobraking. Feeling overwhelmed and inferior and plain dumb sometimes. But i got it now - i can get everywhere in game and return my kerbonauts home alive. And i feel pretty good about it.
