I was having fun with launch clamps by trying to launch space planes from like, 100 meters in the air. One of them actually flew! Then all the wings on the right half of the plane came off. Total wings, 3 large wings on the left side. It still had one canard on the right side. Also a solid fuel rocket on the left side, not right side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI landed it successfully. Well, the crew is alive. If it hadn\\\u0027t tilted on the ground, it would have landed completely successfully. It was actually the most stable flying craft I have ever built/flown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen your most stable plane is one with wings on only one side, somethings up!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas EPIC fun btw.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-22T05:57:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, the lift model is very strange -- it\\\u0027s very linear, and there\\\u0027s no such thing as a stalling angle. As such, even the most unusual of planes can sometimes seem quite stable... of course, there are a multitude of other small issues which contribute to this, so yeah...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
