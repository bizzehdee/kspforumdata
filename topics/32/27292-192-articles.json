The rear engine is permanent, the nose cone has just a standard docking port for just the mule I plan on building (Of course, developed in the standard \u0022no pen-to-paper\u0022 ideology) as well as a single RTG just so I never lose power or control, then I built and attached the two orange tanks on the front. In hindsight, I should have built in the ability to remove the engines from the tanks since they\u0027re kind of a permanent fixture, and I didn\u0027t need to move them around. I could upgrade, but meh... This was all yesterday...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://content.screencast.com/users/Pontiac76/folders/Snagit/media/9e1f291a-e09f-40a2-a146-9732f90f4c00/01.26.2014-13.43.png\u0022 alt=\u002201.26.2014-13.43.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen came the Kethane refineries. With some testing on a mobile platform, which consisted of the final Kethane tank you see and an extra tank and drill, and a lot of mucking with the Kethane Debugger to get Kethane under the launch pad, verified that with the use of the TAC Fuel Balancer I could transfer from the smallish tank on the refinery to additional separate tank. I just had to set the tank on the refinery to OUT, and the rest would take care of itself. No fuel lines, and no KAS. I\u0027m somewhat intending this to be a \u0022Kerballess\u0022 mission. No photos of the mock up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe refinery consists of 6 Kethane tanks, 3 Kethane electrical generators, RCS, the large Kethane converter, MJ, and Sr Docking ports at both ends. There are two sets of these. You\u0027ll notice that all my parts have the large RCS tanks. Why the extra weight? My Kethane Mule is probably going to run off of RCS, and I suck(ed) at docking, so confidence wasn\u0027t all that high, on top of that, I wanted to keep the large theme going and there are no smaller variants of RCS tanks that\u0027d fit the theme and fit within the confines of the small amount of room between the tank pedals(?). My main lifter brought everything up with ease, so why not?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter I got the refineries and tanks connected, time for testing. I slammed on the gas and started to push this thing, I found out about this cool thing called Physics.... The K1 truss just pushed right through. The two tanks and two refineries bent back like pedals on a flower and proceeded to blow up. Eventually figured out MJ is going to be useful. I first limited the throttle to 10% thrust, then I tried throttling to 2m/s acceleration, but, that was just not going to do. Just too slow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo then came building the reinforcements. I wanted something light, easy to lug around on the initial launch, and be useful instead of just having simple trusses with laser struts. Up came the idea of throwing more Kethane tanks. So now there are 8 additional tanks. After first launch, my delivery vehicle still had 3/4 of fuel left, so, I topped off the tanks on this station, then let the last 1/8th bring the remaining delivery tank to its final descent back to Kerbin. But, knowing I needed THREE MORE and knowing how much fuel I had left after this burn, I decided to put all three together on one trip up. So came up with this bad boy....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://content.screencast.com/users/Pontiac76/folders/Snagit/media/064220b4-5ed2-42c9-8e55-1136aaf8d52f/01.26.2014-13.55.png\u0022 alt=\u002201.26.2014-13.55.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*facepalm* No flacid jokes, OK?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://content.screencast.com/users/Pontiac76/folders/Snagit/media/71dbf75c-7cbd-4fd7-b02c-8b268dc815c3/01.26.2014-13.59.png\u0022 alt=\u002201.26.2014-13.59.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo rebuilt...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://content.screencast.com/users/Pontiac76/folders/Snagit/media/49e40b66-c85b-4f8a-9f4e-07f977ba6142/01.26.2014-14.00.png\u0022 alt=\u002201.26.2014-14.00.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerfectly successful launch. Two of them I manually docked, the third, just let MJ handle it for the most part, and had about 1/4 tank of fuel left in my final stage of the lifter. However, I was having so much fun with the docking, I had to destroy the lifter as I didn\u0027t have any electrical power. ... lots of gas though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo with the fuel tanks full, electrical charge at max, Kethane tanks hungry, I started my tests again to see how much better this thing is. The strength doubled, on initial launch I was able to get to 4m/s acceleration, but once the orange tanks were empty, I could get to 5m/s. Everything BARELY held together, but I could see the Sr Docking ports wanting to leave the K1 truss AND the attached component (Tanks/Refineries).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://content.screencast.com/users/Pontiac76/folders/Snagit/media/ce53c17d-8b92-4d81-b942-4707ef1f665a/01.26.2014-14.14.png\u0022 alt=\u002201.26.2014-14.14.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of the push, this is what I had left\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://content.screencast.com/users/Pontiac76/folders/Snagit/media/39b650c4-0448-499d-b4a3-bcbe146aba18/01.26.2014-13.33.png\u0022 alt=\u002201.26.2014-13.33.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo.. This thread is about what I did TODAY? Well, first, I saw this thread then synced my KSP from my home machine to my work machine, then, launched KSP, and started to work on my land based Kethane mining crawler. On the launch pad, I was hitting a very generous less than 1 frame per second while sitting on the launch pad testing. Toned down all the graphical settings to absolute minimum and tried again. Around 10fps. Gonna have to do. I came up with this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://content.screencast.com/users/Pontiac76/folders/Snagit/media/5ac30e90-9b8d-4ac6-8d8f-d8447f9d7926/01.26.2014-14.18.png\u0022 alt=\u002201.26.2014-14.18.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still need to figure out how this thing is going to fly, or, if I should scrub it and start over again and go with something more traditional (If there is such thing in KSP). I put this to the test on the launch pad and the two generators, plus 20 RTGs underneath this beast, put the generators at about 80% consumption while working away. One problem I found (And I blame this particular PC) is that it seems to be overweight and easily breaks the wheels when just coming off the launch pad. So who knows. I might posts what I did today tomorrow! .. if I remember....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeolusRoc","CreatedById":81489,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T21:52:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECreated my first shuttle, too bad I landed it in the ocean \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/tWp9NZq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tWp9NZq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tWp9NZq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Smidge204","CreatedById":89677,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T00:04:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got Bill\u0027s head caught in the wheel gear of my science rover!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.smidgeindustriesltd.com/ksp/screenshot350.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot350.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.smidgeindustriesltd.com/ksp/screenshot351.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot351.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=Smidge=\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Liowen","CreatedById":94498,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T00:30:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI finally start to design my concept \u0022Science Exploration Buggy\u0022 for my career mode videos.
