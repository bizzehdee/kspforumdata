This is a given, you can say Squad doesn\u0027t need to make ANY videos but thats bogus(Hi media team!). You can say people can just search and read about it, or they could watch an entertaining 30 second video of Jeb flying to space by his boot straps. If you have the game its still amusing and relatable, if you don\u0027t you can see the humor and might look more into the game itself. ESPECIALLY if the trailer is new, and it portrays how \u0022new\u0022 and fresh this game is. (in otherwords it was just updated so its kinda new?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally the trailers are enjoyable, and i welcome them and watch them as quickly as possible when i know they come out. Simply put they DO add to the game, they add what the game doesn\u0027t have. A well defined story, in the same way a player can make up his own story in the game. So in a way the videos do reflect gameplay, only in a trailer form. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless Squad needs to keep doing videos regardless. It makes no sense at all to stop making them, I\u0027m not the only person who would enjoy them. You might not appreciate them putting manpower into the trailers, but it is pretty economical. Making a trailer is not a negative thing, it can only be enjoyed. The impact it brings to people getting the game is fairly direct, its a proven tactic for really anything big or small. From Halo trailers (Hype!) new games that ultimatly suck (Watch Dogs) to movies (Horror films in general), to even other things like food. (McRib at Mcdonalds LIVES off the hype)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if this means we lose out on say some parts in this update or FX.
