Probably something a real space agency wouldn\u0027t do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example earlier today in my new career, I decided I wanted to get as much science as I could at up to low Kerbin orbit. That requires a scientist to go on EVA and take the data and restore the experiments, so all normal there, but today I decided that orbiting is a waste of time and resources. So I built this simple pod with the MK1 pod on top, a Science JR under it and a 1.25m heat shield under it. The launch vehicle for the entire thing? A single Rockomax BACC. What could go wrong right? But that actually worked out fine and I managed to get a lot done with plenty of time to spare with that Apoapsis of 100 km, and re-entry took much less time and was far more intense too. Kinda expected when you have an AoA of 80-ish degrees but yeah. What other things would you expect Kerbals to do?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Archgeek","CreatedById":116048,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T20:01:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAttempt to land a probe on the sun, then send a team just above where the probe exploded to investigate what happened.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-07T00:54:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaking a giant \u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/pU1poQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Erocket chainsaw\u003C/a\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingPete","CreatedById":127384,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-07T11:51:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERun a bare-bones Mun mission where the Kerbal pilot forms the upper stage of the Mun lander to compensate for lack of delta-V (bail out and complete the orbit insertion by EVA)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cubeking2311","CreatedById":153013,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T03:33:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERealise that they only have enough fuel for Minmus orbit and return half way through a Minmus mission, then have the kerbal fly down there and back anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
