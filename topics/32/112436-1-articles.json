Since they \u0022never found the body,\u0022 so to speak, they can salvage it - we all know how durable jetpack-EVA kerbals are, and there\u0027s already evidence in the \u0022First Contract\u0022 video of a Kerbonaut surviving some unspecified disaster with only blackened face. An angry debrief session with the three of them looking like that in the next video is therefore not without precedent.\n\nOne might even make the argument that the \u0022First Contract\u0022 video and the release video are anachronistic, and the Jeb\u0027s Junkyard scene *is* the aftermath of the Launch disaster, but that leaves open the question of where the other two Kerbonauts are.
