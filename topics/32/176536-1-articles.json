I know using 8 would make it faster and get a higher altitude, but why do I not see people who are part of guides on going into orbit (or any guide i have seen) do that? Is it unneeded or negitivley affecting the control?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would disagree somewhat with MR L A and DeltaDizzy, but to be clear I also agree with some of what they say.\u00A0 Let me elaborate.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2014Solid rocket boosters are usually the cheapest \u0022kilonewtons of thrust per credit\u0022 you can get on your launchpad stage in a multistage rocket.\u00A0 So it\u0027s cost effective to use them.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2014Adding \u0022moar booster\u0022 as the saying goes does make your takeoff faster and faster (unless your rocket already has more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E than the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E, e.g. above 2.5 for the largest \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E and even higher for smaller ones).\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2014However, SRBs are also quite heavy, so it\u0027s not without drawbacks:\u00A0 if your launchpad stage also has a liquid fuel and oxidizer rocket, it\u0027s doing less and less of the work pushing the rocket.\u00A0 SRBs can\u0027t steer like almost all \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E rockets can, so it\u0027s harder to control your rocket.\u00A0 You can still use aerodynamic fins and control wheels (and even \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E), but it\u0027s not as easy as if you were using mostly \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E rockets.\u00A0 MR L A is correct that if you are trying to make orbit you should be aiming for a launch profile close to the fabled \u0022gravity turn\u0022 and this can be harder when packing SRBs.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2014Also, you can\u0027t throttle SRBs in flight.\u00A0 You can build the rocket to fire them at less than 100% thrust, but once you hit the launchpad you can\u0027t change it from 50% back to 100% or whatever.\u00A0 It\u0027s set.\u00A0 This can occasionally be an issue since the thrust of an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E that\u0027s almost dry will accelerate the rocket a lot more than one that is full on the launchpad.\u00A0 You can have too much acceleration!\u00A0 But you can throttle your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E engine down to compensate.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2014\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E rockets that are designed for your launchpad stage are going to be lighter and more powerful than SRBs, even counting the fuel they have to carry (lighter compared to their power).\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2014DeltaDizzy is right that the rocket equation would mean SRBs are just never good ... if you had to carry the empty ones all the way to the destination.\u00A0 But if you ditch them as soon as they run dry, adding \u0022moar booster\u0022 won\u0027t hurt the wet/dry ratio.\u00A0 So be sure to plan your staging when using SRBs!\u00A0 (I mean technically if your rocket had better than 4.3:1 ratio AND ran dry as fast as the SRBs did, but ... no.\u00A0 I am not convinced such a rocket is even possible in KSP.)\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo to sum up, SRBs are less powerful, more heavy, less controllable, and all around just not as nice as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E engines, and require more planning to boot ... but they\u0027re way cheaper.\u00A0 And that makes sense!\u00A0 I would guess that the reason you don\u0027t see them on guides is that adding SRBs is an extra complication to the rocket.\u00A0 They are trying to teach someone the basics of getting a rocket to orbit or whatever, and messing around with extra stages might just be an unnecessary possible point of confusion.\u00A0 Personally, I think that most people tend to use SRBs either in the very early part of the game as the sole launchpad engine (with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E as the second stage on the rocket), or if they want to launch heavy stuff into orbit, but not so heavy that you\u0027d need a stupidly huge amount of SRBs to lift off.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf cost is no object, avoid SRBs.\u00A0 If you care about a rocket\u0027s cost, go ahead and use them on the launchpad as much as you and your designs can tolerate.\u00A0 (Unless it\u0027s an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E rocket, in which case the only part of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E rocket you lose is the

a basic usable way, use just enough SRBs to boost the initial \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of the rocket to the desired amount.
