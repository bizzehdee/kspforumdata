Steam won\u0027t even notice the release, unlike that multiplay.co.uk thing that hosts the store that melts down if more than one person downloads at once (modern broadband connections are a bit much for their dual bonded E1 line it seems).\n\nIt\u0027s not like KSP isn\u0027t worth the money... Seriously, most AAA games these days are between 4 and 16 hours and cost like seventy bucks, vs hundreds to thousands to tens of thousands of hours in KSP for thirty bucks. Sure, it might have warts, Squad might screw the pooch on every other opportunity, but it\u0027s still highly playable.\n\nAnyhow, with the Steam edition, you can board the download hypetrain!"},{"CreatedByName":"Daze","CreatedById":57997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T18:47:54Z","Content":"How many hours do you think guys?"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T18:52:34Z","Content":"Das is screwing around with the new aerodynamic GUI, which looks pretty awesome actually."},{"CreatedByName":"kenbobo","CreatedById":70629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T18:53:12Z","Content":"I just ran my patcher... i saw 1.0 someplace in it...\n\ni think i\u0027m somehow downloading 1.0 right now\n\nProof:\n\n![6Mr5.png](http://i.picresize.com/images/2015/04/26/6Mr5.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-26T18:55:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2015 06:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by kenbobo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T18:53:50Z","Content":"WOO!
