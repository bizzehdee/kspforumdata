I haven\u0027t seen such an outpouring of negativity from this community in a very long time. Not since 0.19 was released, I believe!\u003Cp\u003E I admit that I\u0027m playing the devil\u0027s advocate here, but from what I can tell, SQUAD does listen to their audience. They also pay attention to what their audience does, which is more important. A handful of us raising a huge stink about the direction the game is going in tells them that their most vocal fans are upset, and they know this is not a good thing. But at the same time, they can\u0027t make split-second decisions that fundamentally alter the direction of the product just based upon that. That\u0027s how games get stuck into ever-tighter niches, and it\u0027s a trap that they very nearly fell into when resources were being implemented to begin with. Resources are absolutely something which a chunk of the fanbase wants, and those of us in that chunk aren\u0027t quiet about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E But here\u0027s the thing: we aren\u0027t the majority. We only were the majority for a fairly brief time. Those of us who really are great at the game, and who make up the most dedicated part of the fanbase, represent perhaps 10% of the people playing the game at most. SQUAD knows this. But they also know that we are some of their most important community members too. I could see how much it hurt Felipe to tell us during the ending of KerbalKon that resources had been sidetracked. He knew we weren\u0027t going to take that well. He knew we weren\u0027t going to agree with his message. But he also counted on us being mature about it, and taking things to the next obvious step: to accept the new course that the game is taking, and to take matters into our own hands by making a mod to implement the functionality we want on our own. The tools for doing so in the stock game have been only increasing with each new iteration since 0.19, and with 0.23, most of the biggest hurdles to that goal have been removed for us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Let us prove that we are the great community we\u0027re often lauded to be, and take this new development maturely. The community, to SQUAD, is everyone who plays KSP, not just the most vocal players. And we, the most vocal players, must respect that by showing SQUAD that we are willing to accept their choices and strive onward to get what we want by our own hands with the tools they have given us to do so. We owe it to them to not become the sort of unpleasant monsters that usually show up and divide a community due to a controversial decision by the developers. We\u0027re better than that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are right about everything you said, good sir. Squad does all this stuff because they care about us the game-players and our opinions of the game. As far as i know, notch never had a weekly newsletter, or a yearly livestream where the devs got together and discussed their magnificent game. That worked out fine, for a while. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the gaming industry has proved that a game can only go so far on its own. Take pretty much every game and every sequel of every game EA ever made. Eventually it runs out of steam without the support of its community. Squad realizes this, and that\u0027s why they mad the game an open-source beta in the first place. SQUAD cares about us because we are what will make them, KSP, and any other games they make great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, they need some reasoning of their own, or else the trolls and crazy people will get the upper hand, and the game will become mundane and limited in enjoyment and potential. This is why i think squad is doing the right thing in terms of their community involvement.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kurtvw","CreatedById":83214,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T04:07:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022EdCase\u0022 data-cite=\u0022EdCase\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYour second paragraph is not relevant.

There was a lot of excitement, and many of us got very hyped. But 0.19 came out without this system, and we were told that it was on the back burner. There was some grumbling for a while (and an outcry not unlike this latest one, but somewhat tamer overall), and we settled down and accepted the promise that resources were coming \u0022eventually\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbalKon 2013 ended with the dual announcements that resources were not going to be developed as had been promised back during 0.19 and that multiplayer would be a major focus once the game was scope-complete. To a lot of those of us who were around back when 0.19 was in development, this felt like a betrayal. And so, this has led to this sudden burst of discussion, debate, argument, and assumption concerning what this means for Kerbal Space Program\u0027s future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T04:07:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is a horrible mentality to have \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003ETo repeat, it is no more and no less than the terms you agreed to when you bought the game. \u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUnless they\u0027re flat out... directly insulting people \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EThey were.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stargate525","CreatedById":53585,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T04:08:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Whackjob\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Whackjob\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk, pardon me here, but I\u0027ve read this thread, and I still have no idea what the heck is going on.
