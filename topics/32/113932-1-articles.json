Pilots are useless once you unlock 1st probe core that can do SAS. Scientists are useless once you\u0027ve unlocked the tech tree. Engineers never become useless and in fact increase in value with experience. They can repack chutes, they can fix broken stuff, they can build stuff with KAS/KIS, they increase mining/refining efficiency. Probably a few more things. Any long-term mission or permanent colony always needs engineers, whether for routine maintenance, major repairs or redesigns, or self-sufficiency.\n\nNow, if you consider the game to be over once you\u0027ve unlocked the tech tree, maybe you don\u0027t see things this way. But what\u0027s the point of having all those nice parts to go conquer the whole solar system if you stop there? OTOH, if you think that life begins when the tech tree ends, then 2/3 of all Kerbals are useless, redundant, obsolete junk by that point. Which just points out the need to junk the craft-line, trade union mentality of the class system and replace it with a roll-your-own, pick-the-skill-you-want, RPG-esque system.

Instead of sending a rocket with tons upon tons of fuel to get there, land, get back up and return, you send one with just enough fuel to land on the lightest nearby moon, an ISRU unit and enough electricity to power it up. ISRU may \\*look\\* very heavy but it\u0027s only 4.25 tons, the Rockomax tank of the same dimensions is 18 tons full. You can get the whole mining operation with ore tanks, solar panels, drills and orbital scanner, in size of an orange tank and roughly a third of its weight - and that means unlimited fuel, but not FREE unlimited fuel - not paid in money or resources, but in your sweat of brow, to construct it, test, find deposits, land and so on. And the engineer of high qualifications is absolutely essential, especially if you power it up with fuel cells (three stars is a break-even point for ISRU running on fuel cells with a decent deposit).\n\nAnd suddenly your mission of \u0022get there, land, gather science, launch, return\u0022 (with managing extreme amounts of fuel between the stages) becomes something much, much more complicated if it involves delivering a fuel miner lander/delivery craft to the nearby moon alongside with your happy planetary lander.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-24T11:57:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2015 11:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Kerman","CreatedById":166398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T11:57:04Z","Content":"I\u0027ve rescued 4 female engineers... :|"},{"CreatedByName":"tutike2000","CreatedById":134359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T12:29:47Z","Content":"I only ever got female pilots.
