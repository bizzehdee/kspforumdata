My first attempt at a Kerbin orbital station, I made the station hub way too massive and ran out of fuel before I could slow it down to a speed that anything launching from the surface could reasonably intercept.

ELC2 also needed to be completely refueled in orbit, and my heavy fuel tender based on the boost stage mentioned above and an S3-14400 tank going to orbit, will cost about 450,000 to refuel it under optimal recovery operations. Also a nuclear interplanetary stage will be added with an effective price tag after booster recovery of approximately 200,000 and the expedition featuring this ship will likely feature two of the landers plus 2 rovers, a Gilly craft (though I might just use a rover), and fuel tender based on the interplanetary stage for the landers. I expect the expedition to come in around 2,000,000 in cost. Since I have one rover, one interplanetary stage, one lander 2/3rds refuelled already in orbit and 5,000,000 in funds I am sure I can easily afford the full out version of this and building an extensive Joolian expedition while this one is underway. I will keep nibbling at contracts too.
