OTOH, even on Easy it would probably be frustratingly difficult for a beginner. (Background: I started with what is now Science, before the current Career existed. I still recommend that option for beginners, as the limited parts and limited capabilities p-by-step progression through the game\u0027s steep learning curve without throwing a lot of unnecessary additional constraints on the newbie.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I do agree that (especially on Hard) a career game can get awfully grindy while farming contracts for Funds for the all-important first tier of building upgrades. But I don\u0027t think the stuff most people have been complaining about are the same as the parts which actually make it grindy (at least to me). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, you have to do a lot of contracts other than \u0022explore a new world\u0022. Sure, some of the parts testing conditions are difficult-to-impossible to achieve. But they are most certainly not \u0022unrealistic\u0022. My job puts me in the world of flight testing now and again, and seemingly-nonsensical flight conditions with lots of ugly instrumentation bolted onto your beautiful airplane is EXACTLY what flight testing is like. And I ABSOLUTELY don\u0027t understand the complaints (also voiced when the contract system was first unveiled in V0.24) about testing airplane landing gear in orbit/escape trajectory. Those parts are in this game not for \u0022airplanes\u0022 per se, but for SPACEPLANES. The landing gear vital for that big-deal Laythe mission had bloody well better work right the FIRST time they get used for real--and that means knowing for sure that they won\u0027t burst from internal pressure while in vacuum; that the rubber in the tires won\u0027t go brittle from passing through the Van Kerman Radiation Belt or from months in the baking heat/frigid cold of the space environment, etc etc etc. And contracts are far less monotonous than they were a week ago, when all we had in stock was Explore Planet/Moon, Test Part, and Rescue Kerbal. The addition of Fine Print is lovely boon to gameplay while grinding out contracts for building upgrades. (Though the frequency of survey missions is really frustrating in the pre-airplane early game, as they\u0027re nigh unto impossible without wings, jets, and landing gear.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also don\u0027t understand why the minimum acceptable payout for a part testing mission has to be greater than the cost of the part (other than separators and radial decouplers, which are by definition expended when tested). This is why we have recovery costs, after all. You can turn a profit with small payouts. (Though I do agree that 30 Funds for a \u0022test while landed\u0022 isn\u0027t worth your time when trying to accumulate a million-plus to upgrade R\u0026amp;D.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, my primary beef with the grindiness of contracts is the enormous amount of time I spend looking at the new offerings and rejecting \u0022test \u0022Part FOO\u0022 at high speed, low altitude\u0022, over and over, just to have it replaced by testing the exact same Part FOO under equally difficult conditions. The contract offers seem to get \u0022stuck\u0022 and insist on a particular contract subtype far too much of the time. I have LITERALLY spent 20 minutes at a stretch just rejecting contract after contract after contract for in-flight testing of the same three parts, over and over and over, with the monotony broken only by the occasional foray into an even less attractive ground test of the same stinkin\u0027 part. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeck, I\u0027m THRILLED when I get a \u0022Test Small Gear Bay on escape trajectory\u0022. The payout in the early game is pretty respectable (especially after 20 consecutive repetitions of \u0022test parachute in flight\u0022 and \u0022test radial decoupler in flight\u0022 offers) and the contract is reasonably easy to pull off before getting jets, wings, and the gear itself. If I can manage two or three \u0022escape trajectory\u0022 contracts at once, I can pull off a 6-figure payout for a single mission (a single mission that takes far less time than it took me to keep rejecting those \u0022test parachute at 5000 meters at supersonic speed\u0022 offers!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seriously spend more time rejecting essentially identical variations of the exact same in-flight or on-ground test of the SAME PART (over and over and over and...) than the time I spend executing the missions.
