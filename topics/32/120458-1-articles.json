I\u0027ve got a few ideas for new games I might start, but thinking about 1.1 has me wondering how much I want to invest in any 1.0.4 games for now. On the other hand, a lot of mods may not be updated for 1.1 for a while yet, so there may be some merit in keeping a 1.0.4 version of the KSP install around... BUT if I go wild with mods, it will probably include KSP Interstellar Extended and I will be wanting to build gigantic spaceships... which would be far more fun if I had a 1.1 performance boost. Upgrading to 1.1 in the middle of a playthrough, though...can break things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m curious what other people are doing until that day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT: \u003C/strong\u003EWhat are youd doing \u003Cem\u003EIn KSP\u003C/em\u003E?
