There is a lot of free or easily-freed dihydrogen everywhere in space. There\u0027s lots of it in the regolith in some places on the Moon, for one. Simpler ferrous oxides, too can be thermolyzed in the presence of dihydrogen to make pure iron and water. And the [Sabatier reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabatier_reaction) is exothermic. In a good enough vacuum you might even start the reaction with as little as some focused solar rays (although microwaves are much more practical).\n\nSee, not everything in the Universe is in its absolute lowest entropic state. Much much much of it is actually in kinda-lowish but intermediate states, or even in metastable states.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-12T11:40:26Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2015 11:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jesrad**"},{"CreatedByName":"TrooperCooper","CreatedById":110599,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T11:35:00Z","Content":"Problem solved. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n![GLTEouU.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/GLTEouU.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T11:55:03Z","Content":"I\u0027ve found that the asteroids around Dres provide me with an optimal spot for refueling ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Miravlix","CreatedById":142351,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T12:08:25Z","Content":"Just build bigger rockets, so you don\u0027t need refueling."},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T12:17:05Z","Content":"Good thing I gave you guys fuel cells ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nSide note - EC usage while warping uses a lot of interpolation because of how solar arrays and batteries work.

A Gigantor in space in the Jool system, with 100% exposure, produces about 0.9 EC/s. You\u0027re only rarely going to get 100% exposure if you put the panel on the ground, especially if you\u0027re not directly on the equator, and due to Jool\u0027s moons all being tide-locked, you\u0027d best land on the far side of the moon or Jool itself will eclipse a big chunk of your daylight.
