You can make re-attachable small rovers which hang under your lander. When you are ready to land, decouple them from wherever you mounted them on your rocket (I put mine on the top) and then dock them under the rocket. when you land, the wheels will be just touching the ground. just un-dock and go exploring. when you are ready to go, just drive the rover under the rocket and press dock. And watch it hop up and connect. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You can bring re-configurable engines with you! Mount on the side of your rocket, a single atomic engine, and a single powerful landing engine, each with small fuel and rcs tanks, and rcs thrusters and mechjeb for control. detach and dock them in orbit. When you want efficiency, put the atomic engine on the bottom of the rocket, and when you want to land, dock the powerful engine on the rocket and leave the atomic engine in orbit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. You can rescue a weak lander by landing a powerful booster stage nearby with a docking node on top. assuming your lander has a docking node on the bottom, which the previous two suggestions also require, just carefully balance the lander on top of the booster stage, dock it, and use the assembled rocket to get to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pebble_garden","CreatedById":30150,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-04T16:16:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is really brilliant stuff.
