To start a base on the Mun. I sent Jeb, Bob, and Rocas out in a lander to scout out a nice area. The mission however had different ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst launch the rocket suddenly decided to explode at 30,000 feet. Fortunately the command capsule, in fact the entire final stage managed to survive the explosion and splashed down harmlessly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond launch went better and they got into Munar orbit. However here things went wrong again. First they were off their planned landing site, only 2km though so no big deal right? Except there was a hill there which they landed on, lander tipped over detaching the capsule and started sliding down the hill. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now a rescue operation had to be mounted. Named Operation Come Home (yeah, were not creative over here) A remotely piloted lander with enough fuel to return to Kerbin and designed specifically to land on an incline safely was made. A new rocket was made to launch the massive thing. Everything seemed to go perfectly fine. Then however I realized the lander had no chutes, even with the extra structural mass jettisoned (on takeoff from Mun) the Nuclear Engines didn\u0027t have enough thrust to land it safely on Kerbal.They also forgot to put the radial decouplers needed to jettison said structural parts. Command decided to use it as the beginning of the station, even if it was landed on a hill. It got to the Mun, it landed shut everything but the lights down (it was dark) and switch to the command capsule from the old mission to start walking my kerbals over and suddenly the rescue ship decides to flip over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now we have two broken ships, and three stranded kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was here that Command had the brilliant idea of repurposing an older rocket design that had been used to send support modules (lander with hitchhiker can \u002B solar array, comunications ect..) to other planets. They figured with the Mun being so close it had enough fuel to land, and take back off and bring the kerbalnautes home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the new, new, rescue lander in orbit over Mun, Rocas went on EVA to plant a flag on a nice flat plain for it to land on. The lander set down almost dead on the flag, finally everything is going right! All my little kerbals did their eva (about 1km) to the lander, climbed in the can and prepared for takeoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took off, established an orbit, and went to map view to plot my course back to Kerbal. As I was setting up the next maneuver I heard something of an explosion. Switched back to staging view to see the rocket that had brought the lander to the Mun was floating away, along with 2 of my 3 engines! By sheer dumb luck I managed to be in the path of my rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had enough fuel to stabilize my orbit and move out of the path of the floating fuel tank of doom. After this was done Command sent up yet another rocket (we send these modules everywhere, Duna, Laythe, Eve so we have a few laying around) to come get the kerbals. Ship went up without a hitch, got in orbit around Mun, started to plan its rendezvous with the previous pod. Got to within 150m and Rocas went Eva to transfer to the ship (no docking ports on these). Rocas moved over, had a little trouble getting around to the side with the hatch but managed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the ships are 500m apart. I tapped on the thrusters to close the gap slightly. When got within 100m Bill went Eva, swung over to the other ship and boarded. Problem here is my ship had passed the rescue ship while Bill was floating over and is now again 800m away. By the time Jeb was out of the ship and headed in the right direction he was 2.1km away from the rescue ship. Jeb being Jeb, did this in style. Not only did he manage to close the gap in less time than it took Rocas to get in, he had targeted the hatch so perfectly that he didn\u0027t have to grab the ladder just hopped in the new ship! (I swear I could repeat that 1,000,000 times and not be able to do it again)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally things started to go right. All the Kerbals inside they managed to return to Kerbal splashing down just outside of KSC and the mission from hell was finally over.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T10:38:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoho.
