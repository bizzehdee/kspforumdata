And since i\u0027ve never done something so extreme i\u0027m at a loss. I\u0027m trying to do it without tutorials to see if i can do it on my own, and i have interstellar and B9 installed. So maybe i should have figured this out first but will this thing survive an aerobraking maneuver in Duna\u0027s Atmosphere? I didn\u0027t realize how fragile it was until i tried to turn it. i do have a fail safe that will dump the bottom lander if i think it\u0027s going to fail but i would rather not cut the mission in half. thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i57.tinypic.com/6hnuk2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226hnuk2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mike9606","CreatedById":90275,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-08T23:47:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t have Deadly Re-entry or any mod that makes reentry dangerous you should be fine if you retract the heat radiators and the solar panels if you do the aerobraking maneuver right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"timsfitz","CreatedById":104387,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-09T00:34:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks pretty flimsy.

If it can\u0027t make the full aerobrake, then do a small one higher up, just enough to keep you in the SoI. Then come back for a second pass. And maybe a third or fourth too.
