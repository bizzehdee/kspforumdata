For the first time ever, the interplanetary phase angles worked for me, but I still spent 60 minutes turning the craft manually for maneuvers because my node system had a glitch. Eventually I got into Eve SOI. I realized the lander and probe couldn\u0027t aerobrake at the same time, so I came up with an idea to burn a little bit for my lander and then go back in and aerobrake. It was ingenious, and I made it into Eve orbit. My little probe landed on an awesome island.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor some holy reason, Gilly was in the perfect position to land on on my 1st orbit, despite the insane dimensions and eccentricity of my orbit. I touched down and planted a little flag 244 days after lifting off. When I came back, I messed around with the maneuver nodes a bit and found an easy way to jump into Eve SOI with minimal fuel use, which I was gracious for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was desperately messing around with a Hohmann transfer back to Kerbin with like 78 units of fuel left on board. All of my olex.biz angles weren\u0027t working or were just giving me 40 second burns, and I just said \u0022screw it\u0022 and moved my ejection angle to 90 prograde rather than the recommended 158. Magically I had a perfect 20 second burn to Kerbin encounter. By this point I had 17 units of fuel left because I was using two LV-909s which happened to be a very good choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way there I performed a couple 3/4 m/s burns to lower my Kerbin orbit, and I had 3.20 fuel left. However as soon as I got to Kerbin SoI, I lost my low periapsis, but I managed to do a miracle burn down into the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI splashed down off \u0022Kerbal New Zealand\u0022 (some of you will get that) with 1.78 fuel left and my entire 512 science and life stage intact! I just can\u0027t believe I managed to do this. I had previously made it to Duna but had to hack in some more fuel, but this time I had made it all on my own. If any of the ideas or burns I had didn\u0027t work, I wouldn\u0027t have succeeded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just really happy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you especially that guy who made the launch window calculator!
