So I set out with a goal of landing on tylo laythe and Val in a mission, after completing bop Pol contracts already. Designed a single aerospike lander that I felt up to the task. Complete with interplanetary nerva refueling lab thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst stop tylo, as the lander has a unreusable drop tank to help on tylo descent. Messed it up, vertical velocity too high, had to drop the tank way early for twr so at least not to smash into the surface. But he lands successfully. Just without enough fuel to reach orbit again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGah, send out a probe lander with Kas fuel pipes to land next to it and refuel. End up crashing the thing about 500 meters away. But the probe and most of the fuel is intact, so I\u0027ll just use what\u0027s left in kirbys lander to hover over and fuel up. Eh, get next to it, but fall over on landing. About 5 minutes of rocking rolling and extending\\retracting landing legs I get the thing upright and fuel it up and make it back to the mothership.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne down, two to go.
