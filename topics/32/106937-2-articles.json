That is how it is supposed to be! Drag chutes on shuttles made sense, aswell!\n\nPeople claiming that SSTOs are broken are just wrong. Build different designs. Old SSTOs usually exploited the heavily overpowered TurboJets. That was basicly cheating. If those designs were sensible, there would be lots of SSTOs in real life. Ther aren\u0027t. I just built a quick Skylon type thingy yesterday that got into high kerbin orbit with payload and fuel to spare.\n\nMy criticism is that they did this massive change to the values that were well tweaked and balanced by the QA and Experimentals.

A lot of people have looked at that gif and concluded that whatever the underlying reasons, that behavior looks silly and floaty.\n\nI absolutely agree that everyone needs to take a second and chill out - all this bitterness and salt are happening not in bad faith, but because we all love this game and don\u0027t want to feel like it\u0027s going in the wrong direction. The fact that there are some weird quirks with the 1.0.2 aero model means that it\u0027s very tempting to glom on to the \u00221.0.2 is STUPID and we HATE it\u0022 train if you\u0027re early on in the learning curve for the new model and haven\u0027t yet re-learned how to build stuff.\n\nBUT, we should not be dismissing the potentially legitimate concerns that people have about the soupy, unnatural feel of flying in the new atmosphere, as well as the seemingly excessive reduction to re-entry heating that came with this latest update. Simply waving away these concerns with a \u0027git gud scrub\u0027 does very little good. The adjusted model in the hotfix has made flying feel less realistic than the 1.0 model for a lot of people, and I think that the drag buff was just overdone in reaction to a community backlash. Personally, I felt that 1.0 was fine, so I would push for veering back towards that, but I understand the desire for a little more atmosoup to avoid putting off newer players with catastrophic reentry heating. As has already been remarked on this thread, I feel sure that Squad will look over this on Monday and try to find a middle ground that more elegantly achieves what they wanted to accomplish with the hotfix.\n\nUntil then, yes, chill your chickadees, pacify your *Paridae, and tranquilize your tits.*"},{"CreatedByName":"Aerindel","CreatedById":109952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T13:02:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Whats the point of reentry heat if you can\u0027t die?\n\nThat WAS the problem with 1.0 as long as you had a parachute you couldn\u0027t die in reentry no matter what you did, heat shields or no.
