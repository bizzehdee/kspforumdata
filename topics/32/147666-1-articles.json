I love that I can name them, I love that I can make them veterans, I love that it\u0027s in the debug menu. However, I do wish it could supersede the current active limit set by the Astronaut Complex. I\u0027ve always wanted more crew in my career games, but I also love the ability to earn funds and collect science from around the Kerbin system in career mode. Lately I\u0027ve been playing science mode to blend those two aspects, allowing me to build large bases and stations with lots of crew while still giving me the option to view my science reports which I view as sort of in-game achievements. I hope they consider removing the max limit for the full 1.2 release. Thoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a side note, I wish career was also a little more Kerbin-atmosphere-friendly. I love building planes, but there are only a couple of contracts that let you do things like \u0022investigate location \u0027x\u0027 \u003Cstrong\u003Ebelow\u003C/strong\u003E altitude \u0027y\u0027. I tried a fresh career mode game last night and you have to get a good few nodes into the tech tree and do some upgrading to the facilities to get your x-plane program off the ground. Maybe I just wasn\u0027t getting the lightning bolts to the snack box, but trying to get something in the air with just that first wing set on that terribly bumpy runway was pretty tough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like to play with no reverting for extra challenge, but after I lost four Kerbals I started just turning off the runway and taking off from the ground behind \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E as it\u0027s flatter than the tier 0 airstrip. Not easy getting a small plane in the air with the wing parts in that node either. I know I should probably just do more space stuff and unlock some more tech nodes (the one below the main first \u0027flight\u0027 node has some better small craft wings with actuators) and get some extra funds, but for career mode I enjoy getting my flight program running before my space program. Again the \u0022Create Kerbal\u0022 button really helped me here, as getting the crew for this and upgrading the complex and runway would be a cool half million in funds, which is a bit steep if you haven\u0027t yet even orbited Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. - Loving the com network.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-14T19:04:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNVM\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-14T19:37:41Z\u0022 title=\u002209/14/2016 07:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rdwulfe","CreatedById":107690,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-15T00:58:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCreate them how Riisos?
