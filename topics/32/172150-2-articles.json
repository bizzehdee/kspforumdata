I have a serious set of mixed feelings here. Part of this stems from a lack of information on things like:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. System Specs? Same or higher need? lack of information available at this time causes this concern. Time will address this one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Compatability for any future expansions? The concern here is this: Will this expansion be a locked in requirement for OTHER expansions in the future? Personally, this one is hit-miss with me. Dont care for the mission editor thing as I dont do career mode, so thats just wasted memory on my machine, personal opinion ofc. I honestly dont recall seeing if porkjets beauty pass on rocket parts is in the expac \u0026lt;personal opinion here is, that when \u0026lt;they DID say some day they would arrive when time permits\u0026gt; they show up, they should be stock, again, personal opinion\u0026gt; but new parts sounds nice, but, I have limited resources on my machine and honestly, dont like having to be tied to an expac that may or may not be useful to me just to make an expac that would \u0026lt;say as an example make \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E/SPACE Y/Planetary Base become stock which for me, be totally useful\u0026gt; force a less than useful expac on me. Bottom line concern: is this expac paid or not, a mandatory thing for future ones, or is it say like buying map packs on battlefield or call of duty--you can play with out it, and mix and match down the road?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe road of expansion packs can be a tricky one for sure. If its a small memory consumer \u0026lt;like adding say Space Y and its expanded follow up to my machine\u0026gt; and is at least half useful, I may get it, price point depending ofc, but, my hope is that, its like a 2x4 LEGO brick, nice to have, but, you can get away with say 4 1x2 bricks or 2 2x2 bricks to fill the same gap. Am I just wandering off on random hyperbole? Am I making sense? Suffice it to say, I hope this expac isnt a keystone to make others work, and if it is, its like say 5-10 bucks and is a small consumer of limited space ya know? Ok, time to wander off, I hope I made sense lol.
