Kaboom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo arrange a \u0022Good\u0022 Laythe encounter you want to set up a course correction. I usually do one around the orbit of Dres, then another just after entering Jool\u0027s SOI if needed. Then the secret is to trade off pro/retrograde and radial/antiradial components. By doing that you can change your arrival time at Jool periapsis while keeping the height of that periapsis the same. (Around 27,000 km, the radius of Laythe\u0027s orbit round Jool). Reach your periapsis when Laythe reaches the same spot and there\u0027s your encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same general geometry applies for encountering \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E planet or moon if you desire either an efficient powered capture or a gentle aerocapture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor a gravitational capture into the Joolian system\u003C/strong\u003E you want to use either Laythe or Tylo for the gravity assist. Vall is a maybe, I\u0027ve never really tried, Bop and Pol are definitely too small and too slowly orbiting. I find the exact trajectory hard to visualise myself and often end up trying stuff until I see a promising capture. The same technique as above is needed to set up your gravity assist though - a course correction using pro/retrograde and radial/antiradial components to tune the trajectory through the Joolian system and the timing of that trajectory independently from each other. You may also need to add normal/antinormal components to avoid being kicked into a highly inclined orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever your gravity assist works out, you still want to finally encounter Laythe in a similar fashion to above, with your orbit round Jool just touching Laythe\u0027s orbit or close to that, not sharply cutting across Laythe\u0027s orbit and definitely not meeting it when it\u0027s going the other way to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor a gravity assist out to Jool itself\u003C/strong\u003E you want to use Eve first of all. If you need more than one assist then Kerbin itself is good too. Duna is usable with repeated flybys but not really worthwhile. Then there\u0027s a crucial trick. You cannot use a gravity assist at peri to raise apo, or at apo to lower peri for that matter. So what you need to do is get on a trajectory with a Sun periapsis \u003Cem\u003Elower\u003C/em\u003E than Eve\u0027s orbit. This takes a little more delta-V than the most efficient Eve transfer, but that small extra delta-V gets repaid many times over by the gravity assist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether you encounter Eve before or after your solar periapsis doesn\u0027t matter, and yet again the same course correction techniques will come in handy, but now with the additional variable of your Kerbin departure time. Once on course to the Joolian system you\u0027re then looking at either an aerocapture or a gravitational capture as covered in the two sections above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a final note, for any sort of gravity assist work I \u003Cem\u003Estrongly\u003C/em\u003E recommend the mod \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47863\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPrecise Node\u003C/a\u003E.

The trick is that 3 Kerbin-Jool synodic periods =350 (Earth)days, and 5 Eve-Jool synodic periods = 346 days, so any path involving Kerbin, Eve, and Jool will often repeat (roughly) in about 350 days. For example, the best way I\u0027ve ever found to get to Jool is that K146-E195.65-K296.2-K509.25-J821 method I used for the 1011m/s mission (and a few others). It costs 1068m/s (or 990 if you use Mun). There is another one 352 days later: K498-E546.9-K639-K852.05-J1062 (but the cost is 1163m/s). This path is very finicky so there are only a few repeats before it fades away, though I\u0027m sure it reappears someday. A much better path for repeatability is K-E-K-J. I have found there is always one of these at least every 350 (Earth) days. A given \u0027cycle\u0027 of paths will run for a while and then fade out, but another cycle will arise before it does.
