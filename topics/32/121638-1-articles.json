I then learned about how rover wheels in low gravity with the brakes off can provide unwanted help speeding up spins and watched a surprisingly graceful pirouette on one wheel with the brakes applied. Against all odds the craft actually managed to land upright with Jebediah slumped over the controls, and who could blame him - bouncing your head off the surface of any astronomical body is painful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027d bounced him off things at much, much higher speeds before and I had complete confidence in his recovery. I tapped forward tentatively - more worried about sending the rover into another spin than Jebediah\u0027s concussion - when suddenly Jebediah snapped upright and launched out of the command seat! His ejection unsettled the rover but it stayed upright and he landed a short distance away, all was still well. Satisfied that the rover was secure I went to switch over to Jebediah and squash his understandable desire to escape from the death-trap I\u0027d constructed for him.
