I logged in this evening (after being away for some months), and what do I find? Not only have career mode and a tech tree been implemented, but the basic command pod now includes SAS... that doesn\u0027t resist control inputs!

The new SAS is a vast improvement compared to .21 but if the last time you played was prior to .21 then you might find it lacking in certain key areas. It\u0027s still quite soft when trying to hold a heading and won\u0027t use the full control authority available.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"samstarman5","CreatedById":12469,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T08:27:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find SAS works quite well when you employ the corresponding sas modules in most effective locations, such as close to each stage\u0027s center of gravity in relation to when it is a part of the larger craft. I have experimented with this and noticed a marked difference to just having one reaction wheel in the same stage as your command pod, and then supplementing that with an ASAS further down the rocket as well as some extra wheels near the center of gravity of the entire rocket. It is the same principle as when you use RCS. You wouldn\u0027t put RCS ports on one end of a stage without supplemental ports to balance it out at the other end, would you? So why would you expect one reaction wheel to have a strong effect when it is at the top end of a tall rocket without others at the opposing end or around the COG of the rocket?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luis","CreatedById":55075,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T08:31:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome back. The new SAS is much better than any of the previous versions but if you trained yourself to cope with the way it used to be you might find yourself affected by nostalgia and/or Stockholm syndrome for the old system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
