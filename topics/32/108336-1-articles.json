The thing is, KSP has already changed quite a few other things for the sake of gameplay, primarily due to one single factor: only the active vessel can apply thrust, and only when it\u0027s not in time warp. While it sounds simple, in practice this has a couple significant effects:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1\u0026gt; Maneuvers are done at nodes. In reality a manned trip to somewhere like Mars could apply a low amount of thrust for the entire transfer, but in KSP the thrust is all done at once and then the vessel coasts until it enters the SOI and has to do an insertion burn. For a renewable resource like electricity, that means your vessel needs enough generation and/or battery capacity to handle the entire burn in a short period.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand more importantly for this discussion,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; In the real world an ion drive has a ridiculously low thrust (several orders of magnitude below KSP\u0027s version), which also means they don\u0027t have to use huge amounts of electricity for a burn in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to make something like an ion-propelled probe that can visit the outer planets using the real world\u0027s engineering efficiencies, it wouldn\u0027t need to stack a dozen RTGs and/or dozens of solar arrays just to power a single small engine. Primarily thanks to the 0.23 thrust increase (a factor of 4 difference), though, one KSP ion engine now uses about 8.5e/s, while one RTG only produces 0.75 and we\u0027ve already discussed how ineffective the solar panels are. So, you end up stacking a ton of RTGs (at a ridiculous cost) for each ion engine, or use an appalling number of solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point is, it all depends on what the developers\u0027 concept of an ideal unmanned probe is. If it\u0027s supposed to be something with an ion engine, one RTG, four small solar arrays, and a few batteries, then you\u0027d get something that\u0027d look approximately like a real-world probe. But, that sort of design can\u0027t even produce one quarter of the electricity needed to offset an ion\u0027s thrust. Sure, if we could set the probe to 10% throttle and timewarp (or switch to something else) then it\u0027d be different, but we can\u0027t, and the developers already made it clear with the new resource scanning system that they\u0027re not fans of the \u0022go make a sandwich\u0022 type of gameplay. So, for gameplay reasons the current electrical generators need to be boosted substantially just to keep ions viable as a propulsion system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thahat","CreatedById":100130,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T09:32:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RuBisCO\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RuBisCO\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EQuestion: can fuel cells power a miner, extracting and converting ore too fuel faster then it burns it?\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll test that and find out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYES, even on kerbin, right on the launchpad. at least if you use the large array-style fuel cells.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei think i had 6 drills, one large converter, and 3?4? large fule cells (experiment with how many need to be on)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand it came out positive. though you do need some initial fuel to work with and preferably a large battery so if you mess up you dont instantly drain all your power.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brdavis","CreatedById":88788,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T10:56:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spatzimaus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spatzimaus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m perfectly aware of the physics involved, as I\u0027m an astronomer by profession.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s seems ironic that I was really happy to hear that solar power was dropping as an inverse square law\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 because I\u0027m a physics and astronomy professor and was always really annoyed that solar cells behaved the way they previously did in the game.

In reality a manned trip to somewhere like Mars could apply a low amount of thrust for the entire transfer, but in KSP the thrust is all done at once and then the vessel coasts until it enters the SOI and has to do an insertion burn. For a renewable resource like electricity, that means your vessel needs enough generation and/or battery capacity to handle the entire burn in a short period.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand more importantly for this discussion,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; In the real world an ion drive has a ridiculously low thrust (several orders of magnitude below KSP\u0027s version), which also means they don\u0027t have to use huge amounts of electricity for a burn in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the message I was responding to was about powering scanners and such, and that probably should be hard to do with solar.

Given that batteries are cheap and pretty light, that batteries *do* recharge during timewarp so long as the craft is loaded, and given that ion engines have drastically higher thrust and electricity consumption than is realistic, it seems to me that the intended approximation to real ion missions is the one we have right now: load up on batteries, run them to empty with the ion thrusters, then recharge on timewarp. Rinse and repeat until desired delta-V is achieved, or do it periodically during cruise.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T12:47:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Maolagin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Maolagin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m willing to assume there\u0027s good technical reasons why \u0022thrust in the background during timewarp\u0022 is hard to implement.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d expect it\u0027s not the thrust but all the other interactions that happen when under load that makes it hard to implement.
