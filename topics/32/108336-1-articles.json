Jool-area missions is what they were introduced for.\n\nThe problem with this is, what about orbital probes? Without a way to replace the LFO, a fuel cell isn\u0027t really an option for something like a ScanSat mapping satellite that stays in orbit for a long time but has an ongoing energy cost. I\u0027ve got a 4-ton ion probe I designed for these missions, but look at its power problem: ~2.5 energy/sec for the scanners isn\u0027t a huge amount. A small 1x6 solar panel produces 1.6e/s at Kerbin, but at Jool you divide that by 25, giving 0.064 at best. Even with 16 of them I\u0027d only produce about 1.0e/s assuming perfect exposure (not going to happen with that many), so I have no choice but to load on several RTGs (0.75e/s apiece) instead for anything heading out to Jool or beyond. Sure, each RTG has as much mass as five of the 1x6 arrays, but it\u0027s still negligible compared to the size of a vehicle as a whole.\n\nI\u0027m not saying that they should go back to the old equation, but it does mean that solar panels seem almost useless now for anything that isn\u0027t explicitly designed only to go to the inner planets.

In the real world, solar power really is almost useless out past Mars.\n\nI\u0027m perfectly aware of the physics involved, as I\u0027m an astronomer by profession. The thing is, KSP has already changed quite a few other things for the sake of gameplay, primarily due to one single factor: only the active vessel can apply thrust, and only when it\u0027s not in time warp. While it sounds simple, in practice this has a couple significant effects:\n\n1\u003E Maneuvers are done at nodes. In reality a manned trip to somewhere like Mars could apply a low amount of thrust for the entire transfer, but in KSP the thrust is all done at once and then the vessel coasts until it enters the SOI and has to do an insertion burn. For a renewable resource like electricity, that means your vessel needs enough generation and/or battery capacity to handle the entire burn in a short period.\n\nand more importantly for this discussion,\n\n2\u003E In the real world an ion drive has a ridiculously low thrust (several orders of magnitude below KSP\u0027s version), which also means they don\u0027t have to use huge amounts of electricity for a burn in the first place.\n\nIf you want to make something like an ion-propelled probe that can visit the outer planets using the real world\u0027s engineering efficiencies, it wouldn\u0027t need to stack a dozen RTGs and/or dozens of solar arrays just to power a single small engine. Primarily thanks to the 0.23 thrust increase (a factor of 4 difference), though, one KSP ion engine now uses about 8.5e/s, while one RTG only produces 0.75 and we\u0027ve already discussed how ineffective the solar panels are. So, you end up stacking a ton of RTGs (at a ridiculous cost) for each ion engine, or use an appalling number of solar panels.\n\nThe point is, it all depends on what the developers\u0027 concept of an ideal unmanned probe is. If it\u0027s supposed to be something with an ion engine, one RTG, four small solar arrays, and a few batteries, then you\u0027d get something that\u0027d look approximately like a real-world probe. But, that sort of design can\u0027t even produce one quarter of the electricity needed to offset an ion\u0027s thrust. Sure, if we could set the probe to 10% throttle and timewarp (or switch to something else) then it\u0027d be different, but we can\u0027t, and the developers already made it clear with the new resource scanning system that they\u0027re not fans of the \u0022go make a sandwich\u0022 type of gameplay. So, for gameplay reasons the current electrical generators need to be boosted substantially just to keep ions viable as a propulsion system."},{"CreatedByName":"Thahat","CreatedById":100130,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T09:32:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Question: can fuel cells power a miner, extracting and converting ore too fuel faster then it burns it?\n\u003E I\u0027ll test that and find out.\n\nYES, even on kerbin, right on the launchpad. at least if you use the large array-style fuel cells.\n\ni think i had 6 drills, one large converter, and 3?4? large fule cells (experiment with how many need to be on)\n\nand it came out positive. though you do need some initial fuel to work with and preferably a large battery so if you mess up you dont instantly drain all your power."},{"CreatedByName":"brdavis","CreatedById":88788,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T10:56:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m perfectly aware of the physics involved, as I\u0027m an astronomer by profession.\n\nIt\u0027s seems ironic that I was really happy to hear that solar power was dropping as an inverse square law\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 because I\u0027m a physics and astronomy professor and was always really annoyed that solar cells behaved the way they previously did in the game.
