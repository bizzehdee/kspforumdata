It was the larger fuel only tanks which has 400 fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I check the fuel usage rates of the engines (R7000) and it uses 1.6 per second. So I compare that to the Wheesley which is on 0.23. What the hell?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI check the R121 Turboshaft and it\u0027s 0.4?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy are the propeller and rotary wing engines so fuel hungry?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey are all gas turbines. I\u0027d argue the Wheesley is more powerful than either of these engines.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt means that I need a large tank for each R7000 for every 5mins (roughly) of flying. The Wheesley is what 6 or 7x more efficient? That makes no sense at all. The Wheesley states it has 10x the air intake of the R7000 which suggests it\u0027s fuel burn should be much higher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe R7000 certainly isn\u0027t overly powerful as I need to run 2 of them at full power and speed to have any chance of getting my basic craft off the ground without counter rotating, which is nothing more than the 2 engines, the 2 fuel tanks, a seat, and some girders connecting it all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust for context I used to be an Avionics Technician working on Gas Turbine Rotary Wing Aircraft. So I have experience and knowledge in the real world on this topic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat gives here? Is it just bad balancing? Or am I missing something?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"uglyduckling81","CreatedById":129740,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-24T00:54:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso the control system for Helicopters is just horrible.
