Everyone I turn on turn on to the game love it. The biggest turn offs are usually lack of planets to visit and steep learning curve (both of which will likely be fixed in .17). However most people (I know) understand the concept of WIP development and instead see the games immence potental. Hopeflly enough Kerbanaughts spread the word and KSP will become a smash mainstream sucsess! (which it totally has the potental for) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso KSP can really inspire people about space and can be used as a learning tool! Most the most ive learned about orbital mechanics and menuvers i learned playing KSP!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
