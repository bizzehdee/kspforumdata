It is perfectly situated right on the edge of a crater, its completely level for kilometers around, and provides a constant view of the planet. Also, the surrounding landscape is rather beautiful. But what else is special about this location? It is the exact location for the Apollo 11 landing. I am dubbing this exact location and surrounding area as \u0022Neil\u0027s Landing\u0022 for future purposes, so please keep this thread alive.
