My GPU always pegs to 99% usage when I go to spend that sweet sweet science."},{"CreatedByName":"Xaver","CreatedById":46640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T16:30:33Z","Content":"I had that issue there and at the contract display. My screen goes black for a second."},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T17:41:33Z","Content":"I also see inordinate amounts of GPU overheat when viewing what should be basically a 2D background image - there\u0027s got to be something else going on behind the scene. But, since the time clock is stopped when viewing those screens, I don\u0027t sense any gameplay operations which should be ongoing during those scenes which need big GPU attention.\n\nMaybe its a Unity engine issue - or KSP keeps all the other scenes active and live-rendering in the background."},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T21:48:56Z","Content":"I too have noticed this kind of issue. The R\u0026D center always seems to have a lot more \u0022lag\u0022 and input delay than it seems it should given what\u0027s being rendered. :shrug:"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T21:54:47Z","Content":"Huh? I\u0027m seeing about 36% usage on the R\u0026D screen, or 37% usage on the archives. Mind you, that\u0027s compared to like 25-50% in flight (depending on the presence of the atmospheric effects or not)."},{"CreatedByName":"Nemrav","CreatedById":91029,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T21:57:20Z","Content":"I found the gui s to be a bit wierd with their lag, the lag is for all the space center guis (contracts, strategies, science, launch directly) but no lag for the vab or tracking station gui....\n\nI suspect what happened is they did their own ui for the vab and tracking station, flight scene because they were still only making the core game. Then they bought one of those fancy asset store ui systems to make their ui easier.... I know they used an asset store ui thing for the rep bar at the very least, and indeed it did sound like some large, fancy thing.... I bet its the large fancy part that causes all the lag...\n\nWhile I could be wrong about that, if I\u0027m not, I\u0027d suggest Squad start converting as much of their ui to the new unity 4.6 stock ui system for the laggy bits of ui....\n\nedit: oh yes, it was WAYYYYYY worse when they first implemented career, its very much improved as it is...."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T02:39:31Z","Content":"It\u0027s because those GUIs are...just GUIs.

The only ideal choice would be to save that screen, and load the R\u0026D screen separately, which would take time. Which is rather silly when it doesn\u0027t even add much more burden to the GPU to just add the GUI overlay. If your GPU is going to hyperventilate having to draw the R\u0026D screen over everything else, it is time to upgrade or at least trim down your video settings.\n\nThere is bound to be more optimization of the game yet to come, so whatever burden is occurring now with your system is definitely going to be reduced. I really wouldn\u0027t worry about it.\n\nMake sure your drivers are updated and keep your system well maintained and dust free, and you will be just fine."}]}
