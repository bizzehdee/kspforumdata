I looked and looked, even went through game files and stuff, it literally just disappeared...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother time, I was just building a space station... when... well, I separated the final stage, when the decoupler got stuck on the ship.

I risked it, and the engine blew up (obviously) and spun my ship out of control... it then collapsed on itself and turned to a heap of debris. I test each stage of my ship, during construction, so, what I don\u0027t get is what happened with my decoupler.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell that\u0027s all I remember for now.
