I\u0027m GUESSING that the exit from the SoI should probably remove the same amount of energy (e\u003Csub\u003Ep\u003C/sub\u003E) from the vessel regardless of it\u0027s speed at exit, but that does not mean the dV that is lost is the same during the exit. Indeed, if you understand the Oberth effect, then you should see that a vessel going fast can lose the same amount of energy with a smaller change in velocity than a slower vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHuh, okay maybe the Oberth effect is applicable there too, but it only supports that the faster you eject from LKO, the more dV you get to save. Hence it supports the original point I made in the first response that the difference in the dV costs between LKO ejection and Kerbolar transfer becomes \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E pronounced when traveling to more distant targets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is for leaving Kerbin. It\u0027s easy to refuel anything in Kerbin\u0027s SoI, its difficult to refuel anything outside Kerbin\u0027s SoI. Hence, you want to refuel at Minmus since it\u0027s the \u0022last stop\u0022 on the way out of the system. It\u0027s like refueling right before you get to Death Valley. From a pure dV standpoint, it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E more efficient than a direct exit since you have to get captured and then escape from Minmus plus haul the fuel up there, BUT you can leave Kerbin\u0027s SoI with more dV which is what is more important IMO. When you\u0027re coming back into Kerbin, refuel wherever you want. It\u0027s probably more \u003Cem\u003Eefficient \u003C/em\u003Eto refuel the vessel at Minmus, because your capture velocity in LKO will be about 3 km/s (highly eliptical with AP near Minmus), but it\u0027d be a headache to hit and Mun will screw with your orbit \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m only answering this because the OP asked the question, it\u0027s getting pretty far off topic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd its \u0022Minmus\u0022, not \u0022Min\u003Cstrong\u003Ei\u003C/strong\u003Emus\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELethalDose,\u003Cp\u003EIt is actually more efficient to begin your mission from Minmus, setting aside the cost of hauling fuel up there, it\u0027s just harder to make the timing work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming a fueled ship were to spring into existence orbiting Minmus, it would take very little kinetic energy to fall to a 70KM periapsis over Kerbin, and you\u0027ll be doing about 3100M/sec when you arrive for your transfer burn. This saves you a big chunk of DV for the Jool transfer due to the Oberth effect. This would be worth trying in-game for an exact savings in DV, but I\u0027d expect roughly 700M/sec under an LKO departure. According to my back-of-the-envelope calculation it\u0027s 160M/sec to set up the 70KM periapsis and a 1,055m/sec burn to get to Jool.

Don\u0027t get me wrong, there are tons of ways to do them \u003Cem\u003Ewrong\u003C/em\u003E, but a stock indicator that gave a single solution would send the message that there is a single right way to do it. I also worry that a stock system that allowed other methods (e.g. bi-elliptic or opposition transfers) or would be too cumbersome or complex to present to many novice players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHohmann transfers are the \u0022right\u0022 transfer to use to many common destinations, e.g. Eve, Duna, and Jool but, frankly, they suck for transfers to Eeloo, Dres, and especially Moho due to those destinations\u0027 orbital eccentricities and inclinations (seriously, people who try to Hohmann xfer to Moho make me sad). This totally fine for mods, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s appropriate in stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also an opportunity for\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/rlQrTHrwyxQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E.
