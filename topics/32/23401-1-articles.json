Literally! Unlike the name suggests, this is not simply to land on every planet, but to land on every possibly celestial body in the Kerbol System (Excluding Kerbin, cheeky \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E ). So far, myself and my fellow kerbonaut, JustnoFreakingWay, have almost finished landing on everything, with only Bop and Eeloo to go. This has been a tremendous experience, and I wish to share it with the KSP community. Not only does this serve as entertainment, it also acts as a tutorial. Each video contains interplanetary burns, landing procedures, and sometimes, the common comedy, just to keep the boredom at bay. As I said beforehand, we only have 2 more celestial bodies to land on, but remember, KSP is not finished, and there are still many planets to come! So what do you say, care to check it out?
