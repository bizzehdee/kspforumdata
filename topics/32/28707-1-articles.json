It doesnt have an interplanetary stage... It (in theory) gets the lander into orbit, and the lander should be able to get off eve, but, getting to eve is not quite possible yet. oops. but thats what the docking ports on top are for. refueling, and a drive unit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enote: the sepratrons on the emergency almost-anywhere-back-to-kerbin-abort-button-has-a-purpose system messes up the isp, and thus the delta V on that last stage is not quite right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy favorite part of this rocket is that on the eve ascent, there are 7 mainsails, and when 2 are dropped, three aerospikes above them are turend on, until there is 18 aerospikes, and 1 mainsails firing, then the final mainsail is dropped and replaced with a nuke, before the aerospikes start asparagusing. in theory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo. of course.
