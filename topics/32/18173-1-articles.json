So if you want to go to Mun, you can either plan a direct launch trajectory. That is wait until Mun is in a position where direct straight up liftoff will bring you there, or you can manually get what you think is an approximate speed. Do a standard horizon de-orbit burn to reach the approximate orbit. In terms of challenge, it really is more about looking up charts or slowly burning your way out to an approximate orbit path, then orbiting kerbin counter orbit to what you are aiming for then just some fine tune flying until you get gravitational capture.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tsakali","CreatedById":44351,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-30T10:16:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, thanx for all the replies.
