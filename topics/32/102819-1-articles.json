I try and clarify what is an actual quote from Max (if it\u0027s wrapped in \u0022quotation marks\u0022, it\u0027s the best transcript of an official Squad member you\u0027ll find on the web), and what is a summary from myself as I\u0027m aware I switch between the two with 0 notice. When I say \u0027Squad\u0027, I mean \u0027the relevant people who are currently developing the game\u0027. \n\nAlso apologies for the lack of activity on my end - RL has taken a turn for the worse here. I\u0027d rather not explain, but I\u0027ll try still bash these summaries out ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAs always, this is just a transcript of an off the cuff vlog of a non-native english speaker - **some details may change or be entirely incorrect**.\n\n**Squadcast Summary for 2015-03-28** - [**Watch it here!**](http://www.twitch.tv/ksptv/v/3956695)\n\nToday, we\u0027re going to talk a little bit about development, at the end, we can see Valentina in game ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nNot much info about fairings, maybe something next week. The way you build them with your mouse is incredible, RoverDude is in love with it.\n\nSoI changes right now are annoying - high timewarp transitions cause massive disruption. The ship goes through the transition faster than the physics can keep track of. The game will now compensate for that and it\u0027ll be a lot more seamless. The end result is something that a lot of people in QA are happy with.\n\nHaving a toggle for the AP/PE numbers, rather than having to re-enable them every time you re-enter map view - \u0022having a toggle for those might be a good thing for the game.\u0022\n\nBetter DX11 support - not 100% sure, but some changes to how the game works, Mu\u0027s DDS loader is working great, it brought \u0022some graphics enhancements you should all enjoy\u0022.\n\nA bunch of memory leaks have been fixed in 1.0, Squad are crazy happy with how fast the game loads and how efficient it uses its assets. PJ and frizzank have been incredibly awesome with their IVA implementation, it really doesn\u0027t eat up as much RAM as you\u0027d expect.\n\nMax isn\u0027t a fan of MechJeb - he likes his \u0022incapable hammy hands to get all over everything and mess it up\u0022, he finds that enjoyable. There again, he is \u0022easily amused\u0022..\n\nIs there a plan to make Gilly and Bop (the \u0027asteroid\u0027 moons) actually look like asteroids? \u0022Well yeah, that\u0027s the thing... [gets distracted by current playing]\u0027\n\nCurrent playing, you say? Takes up a solid 30 minutes of time, just fine tuning the asteroid intercept, not a lot else.\n\nYou know how some options aren\u0027t available in the flight scene and can only be changed from the main menu? Yeah, that\u0027s to do with changing dll files and that can\u0027t be done in flight, it just can\u0027t. Sorry.\n\nAnyway, Valentina! Here she is in-game:\n\n![DT0hsEK.png](http://i.imgur.com/DT0hsEK.png)\n\nAlso look at her here! Yeah, she\u0027s a confirmed badS ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n![FgxKKof.png](http://i.imgur.com/FgxKKof.png)\n\nOh, you noticed the resource scanner? Yeah, it\u0027s called Ore for definite now. Once you\u0027ve gotten a rough idea of where it is, this narrow band scanner will give you an 8 degree band high def scan of the ground below so you can easily fine tune your landing using the onboard camera in it.\n\nAnyway, that\u0027s it for a wonderful return of Squadcast, I\u0027m OWK and you\u0027re welcome.\n\n**P.S.** I\u0027ve been feeling a little overwhelmed by all the people who rep this simple transcript so if you do rep this post, I\u0027d like to ask you to go find your favourite modder, be it ferram4, sarbian, NathanKell, taniwha, nightingale, whoever.. go find them and rep them as well.

I don\u0027t know though, obviously. I\u0027m guessing at no EPL type of stuff (at least not just yet) but yeah, kinda disappointed at the name.
