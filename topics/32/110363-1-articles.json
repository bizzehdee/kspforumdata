Rather than disintegrating as one might expect, they almost instantly slow down to around 500 m/s at 20-25,000 meters, after which it\u0027s pretty easy to transfer fuel forward and recover. \n\nI don\u0027t think it would be a problem if it was a little less pronounced, or if the spaceplane was more likely to break up when this happens (larger ones do, but smaller ones usually don\u0027t). Of course, real spacecraft (Shuttle, X-15) did reenter at 20-40 degrees angle-of-attack, but they didn\u0027t hit quite the brick wall that a spaceplane in KSP does when reentering underside-first. \n\nAnother questionable effect I\u0027ve noticed is that airbrakes become effective before serious heating starts to build up, making it possible to avoid heating entirely on some designs by adding lots of them. I\u0027ve especially noticed this on reusable rockets that need lots of airbrakes to stay stable in a tail-first reentry. They frequently make it all the way through reentry with no visible flames. (The same is true, incidentally, of reentering Kerbals.)\n\nTo be fair I don\u0027t think anybody\u0027s saying the new aero is perfect or unexploitable or anything, just that it\u0027s a huge improvement over the old souposphere.

I pushed the nose down, and came in really steep.... my air intakes nearly overheated, and I relented and pitched up breifly.... but it was pretty much as aggressive of a reentry as possible... and nothing overheated...\n\nI think its going to be pretty hard to balance OHing in a way that SSTOs don\u0027t burn up on ascent, but you still need to worry about descent.\n\nLower drag may help get into lower atmosphere with more speed to cook you... it won\u0027t help SSTOs much because top speed is limited by the engine curve anyway...\n\nI somewhat agree with some who thought 1.0 aero simply needed a higher drag co-efficient for rentering pods, and not a universal drag increase."},{"CreatedByName":"zarakon","CreatedById":5160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T14:02:59Z","Content":"Yeah, I\u0027ve found that the best way to re-enter without blowing anything up is to create as much drag as possible and spread it over as many parts as possible while high in the atmosphere.

The night of the 1.0 release I took an Aeris...4? The one with the the LV-T45 on it upstairs, ran out of gas and electric charge, which is beside the point, and got it back down using just its RCS, which I also used to take a nearly 90 degree angle of attack very very high up, easing up a bit once the atmosphere showed up noticabably to try and deflect upward some to stay higher longer, since I was downright terrified of trying to get down an unshielded space plane.

[Rockoons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockoon) are suborbital rockets with a balloon as the first stage, which gives them a pretty big performance boost because when you\u0027re just going suborbital the extra height actually translates to significant dV reductions, and sounding rockets are small vehicles with high TWRs, so they suffer major drag losses. [Ballutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballute) are balloons used for drag instead of buoyancy, and are sometimes used when supersonic deployment is necessary. The wiki says ballutes have been considered for extremely small (Cubesat-size) reentry vehicles, but something larger would probably need a real heat shield.\n\nSomeone [has actually proposed a vehicle like you\u0027re thinking of,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_airship) but honestly it seems completely unworkable. First of all, ANY air-launch-to-orbit proposal has the problem that no matter how high your starting altitude is, you can only save about 1 km/s out of 9 km/s. To get a reasonable payload capacity, you also need an ENORMOUS carrier aircraft. I doubt any practical air-launch system could handle more than 20 tons of payload.\n\nThis proposal is even worse. They\u0027re accelerating the entire balloon to orbit, which means their system is basically an SSTO with a high-altitude launch pad. To make matters worse, balloon envelopes are extremely heavy compared to their contents. Even if you filled the balloon with hydrogen and used that as propellant, good luck getting a mass ratio anywhere near what you\u0027d need for orbit. And remember all that drag the balloon is supposed to generate on reentry? It\u0027s generating that same amount of drag on the way up, but is supposed to spend several DAYS at mesopheric altitude. 50-100 km is where relatively compact metal capsules do a lot of their deceleration. Columbia broke up in that altitude range, and expendable spacecraft probably break up even higher. Even if the balloon survived, the drag losses would be astronomical. Finally, assuming the balloon makes it into orbit, it\u0027s envelope is extremely thin, on the order of a few microns. It is also an extremely large (tens of thousands of square meters) target for micrometeoroids and orbital debris. The thing will be turned into swiss cheese."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T23:10:40Z","Content":"I tried this \u0022cobra braking\u0022 maneuver with my small cargo spaceplane tonight, and I have to say I\u0027m impressed.

The plane still gained heat, but the high heat gain period was much shorter due to the greater deceleration. \n\nWhether realistic or not, this is a handy technique for plane reentry in stock aero.

This is why a spaceplane taking off from Eve at sea level in FAR is generally a suicide mission.
