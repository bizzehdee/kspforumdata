The feeling of accomplishment when you finally did it was quickly overshadowed by accidentally pressing space and separating the capsule from the tank and engines, right before you lift back off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crusher8000","CreatedById":25151,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T00:51:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYesterday I wanted to see the new features of 0.21 so I send 3 rockets to the mun. One with the hitchhiker crew thing, one with a pod containing 3 crew members and another one that drops a rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I launch my first hitchhiker rocket and while trying to leave kerbin\u0027s atmosphere my liftoff stage explodes sending my rocket tumbling around. Not a particularly good start but I managed to stabilize it in flight and continue with the second stage which was enough to reach the mun. While trying to land the mun i realized it\u0027s hard to find a flat surface and manage to land on a slope. My rocket that contains the crew launches with no major problems however. So then I launch my rover ( \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fHrYXMI.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/fHrYXMI.jpg\u003C/a\u003E ) which flies somewhat unbalanced, with the weaker SAS I have to constantly adjust it but it\u0027s not a huge deal. However since my base is on a slope I have no idea how I\u0027m supposed to land the totally unbalanced crane. So with quite some quicksave/load I manage to drop the rover while the crane is crashing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a while I\u0027m having fun with the base on the mun, roving around, planting a flag, etc. And then I remember you can send your kerbals back to kerbin and use them again so I build a new rocket that should have enough fuel to get them back home. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oJMdGps.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/oJMdGps.jpg\u003C/a\u003E It all works fine, I manage to go the mun, get them in my seats and take off again however I had to use all my fuel and most of my mono-propellant to have a trajectory towards kerbin. I still had the second to last stage connected but it was empty so I pressed space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor some reason disconnecting it made the entire thing explode sending debris everywhere. Fortunately my kerbals were still alived but 2 of them were still on a crash course towards kerbin, one of them managed to get into orbit. I really didn\u0027t want to lose Bob, Bill and Jebediah on their first mission so I had to make a quick choice, I build a rocket with a pod, put one kerbal in it and try to intercept the 2 who are about to crash in kerbin. Jebediah was in an orbit so I could pick him up whenever I wanted to. So I send a rocket and manage to intercept Bill but I realized Bob was ahead of him and he was going to crash first so I quickly send another rocket. It took me several tries using quicksave/load to pick him up, he was going at 3km/s towards kerbin, in the end I just had enough time to intercept him before I reached the atmosphere. Both pods managed to land safely on kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah was also saved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever had a mission with so many fails and still managed to keep the kerbals alive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FleetAdmiralJ","CreatedById":73364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T02:07:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMine was my first attempt to land on the Mun. In a way, a was a victim of a rocket that was too good. I had plenty of fuel left in my middle stage that I used it to help my descent. Except I forgot to ever drop it off, so I landed engine first on my middle stage (which had no struts, of course) and landed on my side.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
