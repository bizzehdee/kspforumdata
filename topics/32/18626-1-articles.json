So I have the satellite ready but every time I make the engines to take off they always spin wildly even with struts. Never mind about the construction it is sorted now. So I got into space but before I got into a full orbit I ran out of fuel, The apoapsis was about 470,000m. So I knew it will fall so I got my Kerbanauts to get onto the ladders of the satellite for the last time (They won\u0027t die but the satellite won\u0027t survive the impact even with parachutes, it won\u0027t destroy the whole thing but to get to the ladders you need EVA which is useless on Kerbin). The Pilot that was left alone had a crazy idea to spin the rocket. Sounds like Jeb to me but Jeb is on Kerbin doing research. So he was spinning and the Kerbanauts enjoyed it but he spun so fast one of them fell off! I saw him fly off but I didn\u0027t see him in space! So I used the \u0022[ ]\u0022 keys to switch to him and EVA the way back to the satellite. (They were already near the apoapsis so I thought this isn\u0027t a joke anymore) When the Kerbal got back the other one fell of faster than this one, so again I used the \u0022[ ]\u0022 keys to switch to him and EVA\u0027d to the satellite. They luckily got back home safely with some parts broken but never mind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAltogether the moral of this story is: NEVER SPIN A SHIP WHEN YOU ARE IN ORBIT AND KERBALS ARE HANGING OFF THE LADDERS!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some pictures I took, hope you enjoyed this little story!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i49.tinypic.com/rk3mgy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rk3mgy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i49.tinypic.com/2d9v6ur.png\u0022 alt=\u00222d9v6ur.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i49.tinypic.com/rqzzg6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rqzzg6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i45.tinypic.com/30sf5ls.png\u0022 alt=\u002230sf5ls.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i49.tinypic.com/34rynw6.png\u0022 alt=\u002234rynw6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i45.tinypic.com/1hb23c.png\u0022 alt=\u00221hb23c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i47.tinypic.com/k0o9bc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022k0o9bc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i48.tinypic.com/2aikozs.png\u0022 alt=\u00222aikozs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for watching this story, I will make a video in my series when I actually get this beast into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Martonaut","CreatedById":26366,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T17:42:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eits a kerbal sport, something like riding the bull\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zpox357","CreatedById":14682,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T18:19:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Martonaut\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Martonaut\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eits a kerbal sport, something like riding the bull\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, ride the bull, fall off and struggle to get back on and activate the chutes before the \u0022bull\u0022 smashes at 2000 m/s into the ground... fun\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
