It generates crazy amounts of lift and whatnot, and it\u0027s all stock parts, but what I noticed is that if you kill the engines, or in my case run out of fuel, and just do loops, you continually gain momentum. You can then go and gain altitude to begin this process again but with the ability to gain more velocity. I also noticed that since this craft has such a stupid amount of lift, if I leave it at about a 5 degree inclination while still gliding, it will actually slowly accelerate while still gaining altitude! It\u0027s a cool bug I found, and I strongly encourage all of you to try it. It would also be awesome if anybody could provide an explanation for why this happens, like how is the code written that generating so much lift would overcome all drag and accelerate you upwards, while gravity pulls you downwards.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Aramchek_","CreatedById":12588,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-21T20:59:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that is the \u0022infinite glide\u0022 bug.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bluejayek","CreatedById":18471,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-21T21:02:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIts called the infiniglide glitch, and there have been numerous threads about it. I\u0027m not sure if anybody has come up with an explanation for exactly what is going on though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy favorite experience with it was with a craft for the sub 1000m air speed challenge. It was basically a long with with SRB\u0027s interspersed throughout, with no strut support. This made the wing very flexible... and I found that after the SRB\u0027s ran out, I could glide forever. However, much more itnerestingly, once I landed I could flex one with up off the ground, and it would accelerate me along the ground. I had a lot of fun with this until I got going too fast (~100m/s) on the ground, hit a bump, and exploded. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w8oJy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022w8oJy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xQQ1a.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xQQ1a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP forums \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sp_blazer","CreatedById":38958,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-21T21:26:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s really intresting is that I am able to get it to go from gliding at 100m/s at 50m, to gliding at 200m/s at 13000m!
