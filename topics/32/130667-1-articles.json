Yes, you could build a fighter armed with a 120mm cannon turret in real life, but no, nobody would spend the millions or billions of dollars in research and development on such a useless combat system because there are so many impractical things about it. Same goes with, say, wing configurations or number of boosters. Yeah, most things will work, as in they will fly, but there are obvious design improvements that any self-respecting engineer would make, and that\u0027s where fantasy designs usually lose to more practical, realistic designs. Case-in-point, people have made rc-planes designed to look like the Enterprise-D from Star\u00A0Trek. Real life physics allows ridiculous designs to work, to some extent. It just makes them far less practical than, well, practical designs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-25T00:52:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"swjr-swis","CreatedById":152460,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-25T02:20:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222377807\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130667\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221453680570\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002270014\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pds314\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n55 minutes ago, Pds314 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve seen a lot of people express incredulity at the fact that certain impractical\u00A0designs work in KSP, even with realism mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love testing the limits of impractical designs in KSP. To me, it\u0027s one of the things I enjoy, almost every time I play. If it was down to just making what is practical, efficient and economical IRL, it\u0027d be a very boring simulation that I would\u0027ve stop using a long time ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way I see it, KSP gives me a set of laws and constraints that are valid for that one environment only. Period. Any extrapolation of it to any real or imaginary other environment, whether it be Real Life, or some other simulator annex game, or even another KSP install but with a different version or mod set, I consider pretty pointless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure, I love that it teaches me basic things that I could encounter in other places, like Real Life. But I try to never make the mistake of expecting things to work the same way. 1) because there\u0027s a limitation to the accuracy of the simulation, both due to complexity and to explicit choice of the devs. 2) because I don\u0027t have unlimited access to funds, materials, technology or timewarp that would allow me to do the same things IRL. Reversely, what would be the point of spending time in a simulation where I can\u0027t do anything more or different than what I can already do? I want to test the impractical, improbable, and impossible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCoincidentally, I\u0027m having great difficulty with my attempt at getting a stock Enterprise to fly controllably in KSP. In this case, KSP limits me more than what Real Life would allow. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-25T15:03:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve always considered practical usually implies plausible, but not always.
