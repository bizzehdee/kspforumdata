Everything was going smooth, but I touched down almost 400m away from the main base. To save my Kerbals the long walk, I decided to move the lander a bit closer to the base. Alas, I had lost my RCS-Tanks to a freak accident while getting into orbit, so I had to rely on the main Engine. Not something I am excessively good at. As was to be expected, I fudged it up and the Lander ended up lying on the methane upside down. But this is when it got interesting. The command pod got knocked off while the engine was still running, with lots of fuel left.
