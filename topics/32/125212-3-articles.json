It\u0027s a new challenge. Can I get to it? Can I land on it? Can I get back? But once you\u0027ve done initial meet \u0026amp; greet, you know there\u0027s nothing to come back to, really. It\u0027s a big, dead ball, just like all the rest. So we just sit on Kerbin and fart around with new ship designs.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this is the biggest problem with the game right now; It would be great if planets had a bit more \u0022life\u0022 (not literally speaking of course), like the hot atmosphere Moho used to have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile some of the planets do have some distinctive terrain features (Pol comes to mind right away), only Dres has any features that have an effect on gameplay. (it\u0027s asteroid belt) I think this is why planet packs are so popular, many of them explore extremes of location, and even shape and terrain, and I could see planet packs adding things like Moho\u0027s hot atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbol system doesn\u0027t have to be a (relatively) boring analogue of the Sol system, \u0022challenge\u0022 planets and moons would be very interesting from a gameplay perspective, with planets that have mountains rising past the atmosphere, or a large planet whipping across the sun at incredible speeds (think Moho, but \u003Cem\u003Eway closer\u003C/em\u003E). Duna is boring, the Mun is boring, Minmus looks striking (but terrain is very boring), Eeloo is boring, Ike is boring, etc. Really, almost all small atmosphereless rock moons/planets are boring, aside from Moho and Gilly, and that\u0027s just because of Moho\u0027s location and Gilly\u0027s severe lack of mass. I don\u0027t consider \u0022Red\u0022 to be a distinctive feature of a planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main problem is that Kerbin is, when you get right to it, like almost any other planet fundamentally, and it\u0027s also the most interesting by some standards, it has oxygen for planes, it has ocean, it has a strong gravity, etc. If other planets were as interesting and varied as Kerbin is, that would be very interesting, heck, take the \u0022varied\u0022 thing and run with it; make a planet that has 4 distinct quadrants with different types of terrain! Or a moon with a lava ocean. It\u0027d be like trying to land on Laythe, but with the added fact that if you miss the islands, you die. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is, those planets will also grow boring, and having a game with a fixed system of 100\u0027s of planets isn\u0027t a very good idea, so I see a few options:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EGenerate a random system, every game. This would be a hard option, and has the disadvantage of shared challenges, like the Jool-5, unless you kept the current \u0022Vanilla\u0022 system as an option. Still, a random system WOULD make for hundreds of new systems to explore, and it could either procedurally generate planets, or choose from a roster of already-made ones and place them in semi-random positions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdd (a select few) new planets, and completely shift terrain on existing ones to add more distinct features to them. Basically, the \u0022planet revamp\u0022 update. This has the severe disadvantage of completely breaking any saves prior to the update that changes the terrain, but you only need to do it once.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EJust add new planets, and make THOSE planets super distinctive. That\u0027s possible, but it doesn\u0027t fix the current problem, the planets we have now would be considered boring and only the new planets would look like attractive targets to explore.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no easy answer, but there\u0027s always \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114649\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKopernicus \u003C/a\u003Eand planet packs.

On the whole it looks like a great update with a lot of bug fixes and some very cool new content, and although my career save is pretty much permanently stuck in 1.0.2, I\u0027m looking forward to playing it on my sandbox installs once a few more mods are updated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hannu","CreatedById":60596,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T06:14:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022passinglurker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022passinglurker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMean while the community is throwing a misinformed childish fit because instead of reading what the devs have been saying they just skip to the ingur albums and see pictures of sea planes and assume that is all that is happening or will happen in the near future. It\u0027s crazy!\u003Cp\u003EIt is realism. Words are free and devs have said so many things during years. Only few percent of them have came true. Of course I understand that that this kind of large project changes during production, but it is a good reason to criticize development. KSP have clearly developed towards flying simulator years, from about 0.20. Focus have been in aerodynamics, plane parts, visual enhancements of KSC. Development in space have been very simple (ISRU and not very well working contracts (based on 1.0.2)) after craters on Mun. Most of the bodies are exactly same as in 0.18.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFocus of space flights have also changed from traditional staged rockets, capsules and landers to SSTOs and atmospheric flight on bodies with atmosphere. At least I want to play rocket game, not a atmospheric space flight simulator. I want to plan and execute stagings, make rendezvouses, land and ascend with rocket powered landers and get feeling of what human space projects could be, if governments of the richest countries would like to put money on them (let\u0027s say 25 % of their military expenses).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may also be realism that this kind of compiling is futile, but it is only way to tell SQUAD what I want.

There may be many good reasons to change focus of the game. Interests of developers can change during years, when they develop project and see how new things work. Many people in dev team have changed, maybe skills and interests of current crew are more plane focused. Flight sim may sell better than space sim which needs some interest in mathematics and science. And so on. Therefore I think that it is acceptable to remind them what customers want.
