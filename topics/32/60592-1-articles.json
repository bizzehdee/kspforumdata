ANYWAY, that first one up there, well, it got kicked out of the Kerbin system into an odd orbital path that matches partly with Kerbins orbit and then swings out. That is fine, it HAD enough fuel to coast into the new AP and circularize there. So, before going to corral the stupid thing into a safer orbit, I decide to purge the others debris. Then I decide to deal with the first ones orbit. BUT, when I went to go do this, the game went all freaky and black screened with only a small portion of the UI showing. Sadly, no picture. Anyway, I close down the game and reboot it because this seems to fix this when it happens \u0026lt;third time since July, so, not real concerned over seeing it go all freaky\u0026gt;. SO, I reload the game, all seems fine. i go to my tracking station in my career mode, and the stupid thing is gone. Now, again, I may have accidentally purged it in the debris clearing, so I can accept that. My question is, am I just crazy and did not notice myself killing a satellite or is this a kraken strike?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T07:44:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat was a bit of both, actually.

The whip is only good to Geostationary. Beyond that, you need bigger.
