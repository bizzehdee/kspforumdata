Total guess work. lol.\n\nNo explosions, no bits falling off. Very unlike my program so far.\n\nStage 1: Establish Orbit around Kerbal.\n\n![ksp_7a_zpsv6vnjki9.jpg](http://i1292.photobucket.com/albums/b580/fragglea/ksp_7a_zpsv6vnjki9.jpg)\n\nStage 2: Pre for Ap burn @ 5k to establish target orbit (and admire the view).\n\n![ksp_7b_zpsyg5kelcy.jpg](http://i1292.photobucket.com/albums/b580/fragglea/ksp_7b_zpsyg5kelcy.jpg)\n\nStage 3: Confirm orbit trajectory. Detach final stage rocket and apply some RCS thrust to stabilize orbit and escape debris.\n\n(also turn the lights on in the Lab and make a cuppa tea)\n\n![ksp_7c_zps9niqvjj1.jpg](http://i1292.photobucket.com/albums/b580/fragglea/ksp_7c_zps9niqvjj1.jpg)\n\nBob is not looking too thrilled with his new home.\n\nI dont think anyone told him it was going to be an extended stay."},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T06:10:55Z","Content":"Poor Bob!
