So I have been considering which ones to choose from and the three that immediately jump to mind are\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Mechjeb - like it or loathe it, the info screens look extremely useful from the youtube videos I\u0027ve seen, and the decision to actually use it on your rockets \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E rests with you the designer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Kethane - not sure of the actual name of this mod, but resources are coming, so it would be useful to have a look at the logistics of such an operation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Kerbal engineering (?) - again not sure of actual name, but being able to see rocket weight, TWR, and DV in the VAB is going to be very useful when I get \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E around to designing more efficient rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo aside from these 3 are there any other mods that are likely to be included, in some form or other, in the full release? I\u0027m not going for parts packs as it looks like we\u0027ll be getting new parts with each update so I\u0027ll wait for them \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZingidyZongxxx","CreatedById":58363,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T00:47:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProbably some sort of variation of the Haystack mod, Sub-assembly Loader, Crew Manifest, and a lot of other utility/useful type mods.

Those mods you listed are just stopgaps till the features are properly implemented by the devs. When the devs implement a feature, they do it all from scratch.
