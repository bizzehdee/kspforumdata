I\u0027d like to think there\u0027s a well thought through reason for having it like this, but given some of the other odd things in the tree (Rockomax brand decoupler available before any parts that fit it, round8 all the way at the end with the Xenon tanks, etc) I\u0027m not so sure. \n\nI also think we could really do with a half size liquid fuel tank, rather than having to re-purpose the FL-T200 (mostly for aesthetic reasons)."},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T11:33:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E it does seem a little odd\n\nNot if you keep in mind we\u0027re talking about KSP, where repurposing is a very vaild gameplay-concept. Getting actual fuel tanks is a small upgrade, as are lots of parts in the new tech tree."}]}
