Maintain a 90 degree angle of attack. Open all your intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondarily, manage your lift vector. The lift vector is perpendicular to your flight path, in the \u0027up\u0027 direction to your plane. When you\u0027re before periapsis, falling, fly inverted so that the parasitic drag points retrograde, otherwise the lifting surfaces are speeding you up, raising apoapsis (perversely). When you\u0027re rising after periapsis, flip around to be right-side-up so that parasitic drag is, again, retrograde -- do this by a 180-degree roll when you reach periapsis; nose still down. The up/down component of lift that we usually care about isn\u0027t as significant: that part is basically just doing a radial burn, not a retrograde/prograde burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThirdly, you might be able to light one of your jets while pointing straight down, with all intakes open, if you have a stupid number of intakes.

First of all, having escaped Kerbin\u0027s SOI, it was cruising along nicely towards its manouvre node three weeks hence to insert it into its transfer orbit. About a week later, I went to check on it, only to discover it was in a highly elliptical orbit about Kerbin again, what the heck?! So I set up a burn to kick it back into circum-kerbol orbit when it hit perigee, and that went fine. Then sort out a new manouvre node to get it to Jool, once it was out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI for the second time. Oooh... delta-V situation looking very marginal.

The decouplers went spinning off into the void,leaving the probes in place. Darn, they must\u0027ve just been clipping something. Sooo.. I decided to burn nearly all the monoprop, which both helped push the apogee up a bit and reduced the mass, meaning I got a few hundred more m/s dV from the nuclear main drive.

My lander/science lab/rover landed, dropped the rover onto the surface, lowered the landing gear, blew the radial decouplers to get rid of the engines/tanks, and settle the science lab directly onto the surface, with the lander module on top ready to take off when done, and a docking port on the side of the science lab so the rover could dock and get its science experiments processed and cleaned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was perfect. Except for one fatal flaw. My rover sucks. I tested it quite a bit on Kerbin, driving around collecting science from the biomes near the space center. But the differences in gravity and terrain on the Mun kicked my rover\u0027s butt. My final resting place was in a smaller crater near the Far East crater and the Canyons. I had landed in the Far East, got science, landed in the Canyon, got science, and then moved into another small crater which had some Highland Crater science. So then I drop the rover and get going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is then that I realize having torque enabled causes really bad things. Any time I tried an significant turn, my rover would topple over. And I couldn\u0027t access the probe body to change it because it wasn\u0027t exposed. Eventually I figured out the trick of moving the view \u003Cem\u003Einside \u003C/em\u003Ethe vehicle and clicking on the probe to shut off torque. That helped out quite a bit with stability. But my rover still was not powerful enough, or stable enough, to even get out of the crater I was landed in. It couldn\u0027t get over the sides.
