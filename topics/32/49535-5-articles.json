Unlocking parts will teach them how to play 100 times better than any slideshow tutorial ever will.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat we cannot and MUST NOT do is be negative and complain and start posts like this accusing Squad of abusing you or ignoring you. Don\u0027t attack other types of players as \u0022ruining the game.\u0022 Be postiive, or at the very least CONSTRUCTIVE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve not been here as long as you certainly, but I\u0027ve been here a while and maintained a few mods, seen a lot of versions and changes in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow let me first start off by saying this - I like 0.22, as a user who\u0027s been around for a while. The research system is fun in my opinion, and I\u0027m enjoying the challenge it adds into the game as things are slowly unlocked (I know you can do the same experiment repeatedly and grind in one mission to research a whole load, but thats up to the user if they want to do that)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe important point I wanted to address was tutorials and introduction for NEW USERS. Which has ended up strangely waysided at Squad, who have had two separate Tutorial systems, both valid, end up cast aside. There was the original 0.13 rocket building and rocket flying tutorials, and there\u0027s also the newer few short ones available - but don\u0027t really hear much of these anymore and don\u0027t think there was a rocket building one. The other thing is that the testers and developers are all people who know how the game works and how to play it, which leads to a problem of \u0022implied knowledge\u0022 - this has been mentioned in a few previous posts in this thread. For instance you\u0027re expected to know right clicking on parts does something, that ALT , . control physical timewarp, that mousing over the altimeter gives more options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose talking about game versions and how its not \u0022Version 1.0\u0022 yet, or \u0022Wait for future versions!\u0022 Please no. That isn\u0027t how this type of game works, it never has been. Minecraft 1.0 was never \u0022final release\u0022 and nor would a KSP 1.0 if that ever happens. Infact Minecraft development still hasn\u0027t stopped, and its still packed with underdeveloped features like powered minecarts which have been left relatively useless not only by newer features, but older bugs that aren\u0027t resolved. Something KSP desperately needs is a real shakedown of the bugs in the engine, and a re-evaluation of how some of the features work. Far as I\u0027m aware seats still aren\u0027t a crewable part in KSP 0.22 for instance. Kerbals still fall through Kerbin ever since the terrain update but now do even more damage when this occurs. Quickload sometimes makes a horrible mess and acts like you\u0027ve just re-entered the atmosphere. Chunks of kerbin occasionally drops to minimum Level of Detail when in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo clarify though, I do like this update. The recover vessel button helps with one of the games core issues, which was it being horribly long winded to end a flight after a mission in Tracking Center (now don\u0027t need to go there) the tech tree adds something new and fun to do, (even if it is exploitable and argue-able in its layout) and the KSC changes add some new area for quick messing about. The new Landing Legs are pretty snazzy, and I don\u0027t mind having quirky science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do hope bug and feature fixes gets some priority in the next update though, and if there are going to be Tutorials, make sure like another user said, its pretty slap in face unless turned off in the settings. That way you can appeal to new users significantly better then giving them a smaller playground but still leaving them to click and mash at random till something good happens.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"madbadger2742","CreatedById":82240,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T01:15:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Play the game, and be happy that you\u0027ve gotten so many good hours of game play out of your ~$20,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Give them reasonable suggestions for improving the game, and a reasonable amount of time to implement them, or\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Stop playing and tell them why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConstructive criticism is good, and Squad are relying on it to develop the game.
