The point of a reuseable tug is to reuse it. Unless its ment for a dedicated ferry mission to a single location with identical payload mass each time your probably going to want a slightly overengineerd tug. This lets you send variable payloads to variable locations with the same spaceframe. you can still send it with the tank half empty if your only going to duna instead of to jool if you desire. you could play games with modular fuel pods as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy preferred space tugs consist of a rocomax 200x8 core with LVN\u0027s on outriger girders with fuel lines from the core (number depends on how much thrust I want usualy 2-4). A probe core, reaction wheel,power system, and enough RCS for docking rounds out the tug. Payload gets attached to the underside between the engiens so the tug pulls it through space instead of pushing. If required an additional fuelpod of apropreate size is inserted between the tug and the payload. in the 2 engien config its 7tons dry (4.5 of that the engiens) bit over 11 fueled and has about 3.4k dv with no payload/tanks and can easily sling even the new 3.75m tanks underneth if required to haul a payload to the target. Several tugs can be stacked with careful alignment of engiens if more thrust is desired for a mission. Modular, versital and efficent for any misson with a payload greater than a couple tons. for 1-2 tons or less I just stick it on a small thrust pod to get it wherever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WKyqMC8l.png?2\u0022 alt=\u0022WKyqMC8l.png?2\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Duxwing","CreatedById":42282,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-14T14:10:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@merendel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETugging and aerobraking the ship from LMiO to LKO would simplify my transfers while giving me almost the benefit of what you describe.
