If you do anything that game didn\u0027t originally intend, it\u0027s cheating. Using glitches is cheating. Using mechjeb is cheating. Using certain mods is cheating. Using hyperedit is cheating. However, People should be able to play the game however they like. Some people don\u0027t consider it cheating because it suits their needs and they don\u0027t want to think that is what they are doing. Some need to just learn and admit, \u0022Yes, I cheated.\u0022 It\u0027s not a big deal. It\u0027s single player, so cheating effects no one but yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose who use justifications for cheating are also wrong. \u0022I know how to fly it already so I use mechjeb because I already know I can do it.\u0022 Convenient isn\u0027t it. It\u0027s still cheating though. Remember, the game was not intended to be able to auto pilot.

Arguing realism at this point is kinda silly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like to think of cheating on a sort of scale. Convenient cheating is when you cheat for convenience. You already know how to do this particular task but don\u0027t want to do it over and over again so you cheat to skip it. Rule cheats are those who don\u0027t like how the current game works so they change the mechanics of the game a bit to suit their needs on how they want to play. Mechjeb would fall into that category when using it all the time. Then there are CHEATS, these are the type of cheats where you are able to skip all game mechanics (aka god mode). Hyperedit falls under that category.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo I cheat? Yes, I do. Why? Because I can. I think that is the only reason I need. Do I do it all the time? No. I fall under convenient cheating in KSP. Though in other games I have used god mode and many other cheats in the past. It really all depends on what I am in the mood for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo one has any right to tell me what I can and can\u0027t do in the video games I play.

Now, when in this state, the autoland system merely follows the glidepath all the way to touchdown as indicated in the ILS/glidescope. It is however, possible for the pilot to intervene in the process at any time during the approach by flicking a switch. If he opted to intervene, certain \u0022automated\u0022 items are still on, mainly, the autothrottle, to make sure that the pilot doesn\u0027t put the aircraft\u0027s descent in jeopardy by manipulating the throttle to the point that the descending aircraft goes out of its current flight envelope. The original argument here was if the astronauts were piloting the LM on landing or not, and based on the airliner example, they are indeed piloting the LM at that point, even though there were merely \u0022deviating\u0022 from the original course (which is parallel to when a pilot flicks off a switch to turn off autoland, yet the ILS \u0022path\u0022 is still active and autothrottles are still active). But instead of their \u0022joystick\u0022 directly hooked up to the RCS, it was merely hooked up to a digital-fly-by-wire system (which eventually got adapted by airliners, and Neil Armstrong had a hand in this, read the story here \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-024-DFRC.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-024-DFRC.html\u003C/a\u003E) that in turn, was hooked up to the PGNS which had the navigation/landing data or \u0022ILS\u0022 for the moon landing.
