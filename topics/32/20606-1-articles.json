And there are actually some disadvantages to doing so, since a long, slow burn is less efficient at putting you on any given orbit than a fast, high power burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, a lower throttle does give you more fine control over your acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-27T20:12:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA longer but less powerful burn with an engine of much higher vacIsp will be more efficient though. The only note about that is it\u0027s more important to start your burns at appropriate times; that is, start them early. A 30s burn starting 15s before periapsis will have a similar effect to an instantaneous delta-v change at periapsis, or at least, it spreads-out the unwanted effects. NERVA engines can be annoying like this, and I\u0027d suggest against using MechJeb for large orbital corrections for that reason (MechJeb always starts a correction burn on the assumption that the total delta-v required can be delivered instantaneously; to do otherwise requires more calculations based on TWR, the burn\u0027s vector, Isp of the engine, etc...it\u0027s...quite a bit more math).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"draeath","CreatedById":25709,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-27T20:13:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK - so for initial launch - at the start, as long as you are gaining altitude it\u0027s OK to leave the throttle low? While still near the ground like that I assume the slowest you can ascend the better, because of drag loss. Or is it best to try and ride terminal velocity? Seems to me the closer to terminal velocity you are the more drag loss you would experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking of, for example, the super-slow Delta-V ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John Bedlam","CreatedById":36337,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-27T20:45:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a sweet spot between drag and gravity. If you throttle too low (or the TWR of your ship is too low), you\u0027re just throwing most of your fuel against the ground to stay as high as you are.

IE: Logically, the slowest ascent rate we could have would be 0m/s. In which case, you are effectively 0% efficient since you\u0027re just burning fuel to hover, not gaining any ground. On the other extreme (high velocity), thrust that would normally accelerate you, is being thrown away (into the wind, as it were). So clearly there is some optimum place, between the two extremes, and that will vary by ship design, atmosphere, etc. I guess you could make a pretty good guess of this optimum rate with some fancy spreadsheet antics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"karolus10","CreatedById":17876,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-27T22:09:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn general, rocket engines in 100% throttle are their optimal and most efficient working parameters, you can throttle down when you need lower thrust (in lower atmosphere too much acceleration aren\u0027t good because of higher drag loss), but throttling down aren\u0027t more efficient than full thrust. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn some engines, MAX throttle settings are much higher than most efficient working parameters, so you can get insane amount of thrust in exchange of lower efficiency - like in escape engines of planned dragon capsule, where you can burn all capsule fuel in just few seconds (or less), during abort sequence.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-27T22:13:01Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2012 10:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by karolus10\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"souza","CreatedById":44429,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-27T22:17:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022John Bedlam\u0022 data-cite=\u0022John Bedlam\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere\u0027s a sweet spot between drag and gravity.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI never thought of it that way \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E I usualy thrust 100%.
