The game its self doesnt need to be realistic, E.g, Minmus: Not realistic because it\u0027s not in our solar system and how can it be frozen when it\u0027s closer to the sun than kerbin is at times. So the green gas giant can be anything HarvesterR or all the other devs want. Talking of realism, we havent got humans in the game have we?

Ice on minmus could be made of a different substance with a much higher melting point. And humans?!? How on Kerbin are we going to get humans to a different solar system, maybe spiral arm, maybe galaxy, maybe even UNIVERSE!
