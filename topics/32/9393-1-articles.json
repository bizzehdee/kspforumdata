Perhaps somebody smarter than I could just hack together an editor that opens the persistence file and parses out the debris, leaving all other craft alone?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDebris is such a problem for my system, which graphically runs the game fine at 1920x1080 with everything turned up. Autosaves can take 20 seconds. Switching craft can take 45. Any help out there?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-09T19:46:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\\\u0027s an option in the settings for maximum amount of debris; just set it to something really low, and restart the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"E.
