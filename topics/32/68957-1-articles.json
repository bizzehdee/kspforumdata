Some players have seen the altitude represented with a letter \u0022G\u0022 less have seen \u0022T\u0022 and very few (if any) have seen \u0022P\u0022. That being said Petameter is farther out then \u0022T\u0022 (trillion I think) one Petameter is 10^15 or 1,000,000,000,000,000 or a quadrillion meters. So as you can tell thats a little ways out there. For this voyage I am only going to use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43839-0-23-5-KSP-Interstellar-%28Toolbar-Integration-New-Models-New-Tech%29-Version-0-11\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Einterstellar\u003C/a\u003E mod and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24786-0-23-5-Kerbal-Alarm-Clock-v2-7-3-0-(April-9)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal alarm clock\u003C/a\u003E (running in the back ground) and lastly hyperedit, however I am ONLY using hyper edit to get me to 150 kilometers above Kerbin, after that it is no longer used. I will update this whenever I hit a big mile stone, also because they keep getting farther and farther away this causes me to build a larger ship each time, for example I am going to have to build maybe twice as big as this ship to get the next letter, I have no idea what it is by the way. So wish me luck and I hope you enjoy!! \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/ysZZE#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eto the petameter\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hans Dorn","CreatedById":105419,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-11T02:08:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve reached 1000 petameters, fyi.
