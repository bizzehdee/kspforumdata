I am tired of updating KSP and all my mods every time there\u0027s a change from 1.0.x to 1.0.y. Alternately, I suppose I can just bite the bullet, be happy with the stable version I have now and try to ignore any new minor updates.\n\nI do worry about newer mods being incompatable with older versions though. I\u0027m currently on 1.0.2. Are 1.0.4 version mods still compatable? Or will I get an incompatibility warning every time I start the game?"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T02:52:18Z","Content":"Some are compatible, some aren\u0027t; pretty much any mod that works with the heating system in some barely-connected way will need updating for sure, others might not.\n\nYou\u0027ll need to update any of the ones giving compatibility warnings though, those won\u0027t automatically go away.\n\nFor auto-updating mods, there is that CKAN thing that people talk about, but in my experience, it\u0027s screwed up a surprising number of mod installs, so if you want to risk it, you can try that.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T02:54:23Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 02:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ferram4**"},{"CreatedByName":"AstroRick","CreatedById":78064,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T02:58:47Z","Content":"Very unfortunate this.

If the Game is officially out of Beta,\n\nOh come on, that ship has sailed so long ago. And SQUAD \\*does\\* show a certain commitment by providing hotfixes to the worse issues. With the cargo bay pressure cooker, I\u0027m afraid that there may soon be a 105. All things considered, I\u0027d rather have too frequent updates than none at all.\n\nI wonder if they will provide us with a public beta of the unity5 build. Why fix things in U4 that are to be entirely rewritten in U5? Also, this would effectively put us into beta where this game (sadly) belongs. That would be a daring move and I can already hear the moaning... but I feel sorry for squad having to provide a lot of fixes to a codebase that is nearly obsolete already."},{"CreatedByName":"Varsi","CreatedById":120571,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T03:52:06Z","Content":"You can always copy the game folder out of Steam folders and run it without Steam.

CKAN can export the mods you are using to a file. In a couple of weeks when all mods are updated to 1.0.4 I make another copy and let CKAN do ist magic.
