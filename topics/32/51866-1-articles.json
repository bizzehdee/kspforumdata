So there is some skill involved here, it\u0027s not just like hooking up a joystick will magically make you a great pilot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe good news is if you practice in KSP and get good you can fly RC heli\u0027s and quadcopters in real life (keep SAS off though). If you could set up a fixed camera position it would be a great RC practice simulator, assuming you set up your joystick correct. For example, it would be a disaster if you got good in KSP with your yaw and roll reversed and then tried to fly a model in real life, where the controls are different. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t have to have a RC controller though. I have flown great in other flight simulators with a joystick that has a twist rudder. There is a lot of subtle rudder input required to keep a craft balanced. Almost impossible with the keyboard without SAS enabled. Anyway the controls translate well between the two controllers, so it\u0027s easy to go from one to the other.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dweller_Benthos","CreatedById":15418,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T15:10:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery impressive.

It makes flying planes a lot more fun... I wasn\u0027t fond of using it for rockets or landers however. Anyways, being some 10 years old one of the axis (roll in my config) is going bad so I can\u0027t really use it to fly anymore. However, the throttle stick on the joystick as well as its buttons and inputs work just fine still. I keep the joy connected just for the throttle alone. And I have some 20 buttons on it that I have tied to various functions in the game thanks to the ability to bind an input to more then one key.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI couldn\u0027t go back to playing without it. Throttling with shift and ctrl is to much of a fuss for me now. I don\u0027t even need the engine shutoff button.... I just flick my throttle stick down and it does the same thing. And allows for such a higher level of throttle precision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn spite of all this, SQUAD does need to better support joysticks. Linearity and other things should be added for finer tuning of joystick axis\u0027 and such. Perhaps a way to load different joystick settings for each aircraft as well. This would be a huge help, perhaps a way to save different joy settings and load them in the VAB or tie them to individual craft. This is very important because different crafts call for different levels of deadzone, sensitivity, linearity, etc. Or you will simply crash out right. As it is, the fact that I cannot even access my input settings from anywhere in game other then the main menu is a huge annoyance. I\u0027ve been hoping for the ability to change inputs from in-game since I started playing in .18\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
