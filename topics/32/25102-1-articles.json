I have a rocket design on which I have solid fuel rocket boosters attached to the rockomax fuel tanks. Whenever I throttle the rockets on the rockomax two much up the solid fuel boosters just turn a bit too much in, eventually crashing into my command module. Try reducing the speed to two thirds throttle during the first stage.
