In most games I feel like i\u0027m \u0022wasting time\u0022 when going interplanetary, like i should be getting science from the moons or working on mining or station operations. Sometimes this results in a situation where you have a craft en route and you end up doing other things while you wait. Problem being that when you get back to your ship to come in for orbit, you have a bunch of new tech and your interplanetary craft is either not optimized or its missing something. From what i understand the game time can be exceptionally long now so i\u0027m trying to work past this hang up by simply running the complete missions as they arise. Something about the window planners being 10yrs in advance that makes you feel like you\u0027re missing stuff if you don\u0027t do it all right away.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nlack of dv indications with regards to craft or target.

Yes, it is psychological, but I think it\u0027s a saloon door (it swings both ways) whether the game does or doesn\u0027t encourage you to use timewarp. If the game is entertaining enough without using timewarp to excess, you could view that as inbuilt discouragement - even if part of that entertainment arises from my own sense of satisfaction from not exceeding unrealistic lifespans or mission durations, it\u0027s still entertainment derived from the game itself without using what you\u0027ve just said the game encourages us to use.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think there\u0027s still something noteworthy in what I was saying about time as a resource, though (if arguably not quite on-topic). Basically, the instant or period when something happens (an eclipse, a transfer window, a conjunction etc) is fixed. Once it\u0027s happened, those exact circumstances won\u0027t happen again in that savegame, at least not for a really, really long time. Up until it happens, time is a resource you have to spend on testing your crafts, training your kerbals and unlocking your science nodes. IRL, this is when careers are made or broken, because if an interplanetary opportunity is missed it probably won\u0027t come around again within a person\u0027s lifetime. Even if you do look on Kerbals as lifeless/immortal, the time up until this point is still a resource, it\u0027s just a resource that counts down until it reaches 0 and then resets to some humungous long interval. But there isn\u0027t just one event that will happen in the game, there are thousands and thousands of alignments of various kinds that you can witness or \u0027study\u0027 from various places as unique experiences to be had in the game. If you\u0027re only focused on one particular goal, you\u0027ll blow right past all of these by pouring the resource of time down the drain of timewarp.

If you set a big bundle of nuclear asparagus spears on top of a gigantic booster stack, you can easily make a ship with\u00A010 or more km/s left when it gets to LKO.

I always did orbital rendezvous landing missions as well, which meant that for the price of learning how to dock in orbit getting everybody home was never that near of a thing.

In 0.95, I did the whole Jool5 mission, succeeding with the first ship I launched, without exactly calculating the dV of anything involved, including the Tylo lander. I only actually got interested in exactly how much dV my craft had left when that itself became\u00A0 a matter of interest, like when I got involved in challenges about long-range SSTOs and low dV routes to different places. \u00A0Since we now have tweakable tanks and the Engineer\u0027s Report, getting that info did not require KER, but simply that I learn how to enter the formula \u0022=LN(A1/B1)*C1*9.8\u0022 into an Excel spreadsheet, then put the wet weight, dry weight, and engine ISP values into cells A1, B1, and C1.
