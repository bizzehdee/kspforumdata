I think I\u0027m ready to articulate my opinion about realism in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThere should be a realism game mode in terms of size and scaling. If N-Body physics is not too difficult to implement the, sure, why not. The default should be what it is now, tiny celestial bodies with the current \u0027lite\u0027 physics implementation(if N-body is going to hog CPU cycles even with Unity 5). Life support, deadly re-entry, etc should be game options.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, that\u0027s my own opinion. I personally prefer the smaller size Kerbol system because if it was too big then I wouldn\u0027t get any enjoyment out of the exploration component of the game. The other day I spotted my first easter egg and it felt great. There\u0027s no way you would find easter eggs on a larger scale. Also, I\u0027m a big believer there should be more easter eggs and a reason to be on the surface exploring each \u0027planetoid\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the exploration part of the game is fun in the current scale. The other way I enjoy the game is building stuff and testing, testing, testing. Most of the game for me is spent in the VAB/SPH building machines because I\u0027m a tinkerer personality. Then, I test ascents and mission performance over and over. If it took 6x as long to get into orbit that\u0027s 6x less testing I can do which is a big reduction in gameplay. Not to mention, when I want to build a space station or ground base it will take that much longer to achieve my goals. This game already takes a huge amount of time for me complete my personal projects in it. The last big station I built was 30hr\u002B of gaming and was built with and SSTO lifter to LKO to undock payload to tug which lifts it to KSO then, passes the football to my station builder which finally places it onto the station. The station was only about 25 parts, but still, that\u0027s a fair amount of gaming. I don\u0027t know if I could be bothered with it all if getting to orbit took 6x as long.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hannu","CreatedById":60596,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-05T05:36:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022O-Doc\u0022 data-cite=\u0022O-Doc\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo, that\u0027s my own opinion.

Larger solar system does not give anything but increased waiting time, if performance of parts is well balanced and physical laws are correct. You have to take same physics into account on every maneuver. Even larger planets would not give anything before procedural detail generators are developed by astronomical factor (which is unrealistic in game). My opinion is, that better physics should be the most important thing now. Aerodynamic model (including re-entry effects), resource management should be technical (living support, maintenance) instead of financial etc. This should be a space flight game and not a bureaucracy game with beautiful buildings in KSP which breaks nicely when you hit them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, I know that I mentioned some illegal words.

Well, once Krakensbane kicks in, there are only two sources of changes to velocity if the engine is shut off: any errors due to failure of conservation of momentum due to rotation, and errors in the simulation itself. With Krakensbane active, the latter are a constant size, which means that higher velocities will reduce floating point errors due to that. Errors due to rotation are also relatively constant, since higher orbital velocities don\u0027t magically make rockets spin faster in space. So then that would result in lower floating point errors as well. Note that all those statements are relative to the absolute magnitude of the exact velocity magnitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship-breaks-apart bug was \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E the original bug to be fixed by Krakensbane. It was floating point errors due to loss of precision in velocity, which would cause phantom forces on the vehicle, whihc always cause you to lose control long before the rocket could be destroyed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, all of that said, in time warp the only significant numerical errors are in crossing SOIs, simply because the numerics required to solve true anomaly of the orbit (angular position relative to periapsis) as a function of time are relatively simple-ish and can be clamped every half-period. Interestingly, since a larger universe would increases the size of SOIs (especially if the distances were increased to much more realistic sizes, since they\u0027re a little too close for proper scale), the SOIs would have a larger area of lower gravity gradient, reducing errors due to jumping a little too deep into the SOI, since gravity doesn\u0027t change as significantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm... I wasn\u0027t for scaling up the planets more than absolutely necessary to deal with aerodynamic effects, but considering those effects (unless I\u0027m horribly wrong), it would be better to make it even larger...
