Many games are discounted during this time. It has various short events where a small selection of games are discounted further, so many can be bought at low prices. The majority of games are discounted by 60-75% of their original price. How is it that Kerbal Space Program is NEVER discounted beyond 40% ANYWHERE? I\u0027ve seen it discounted on the Humble Store, for examaple. 40% off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game is currently (as of 25/06/2014 18:54) on a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://store.steampowered.com/app/220200\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDaily Deal\u003C/a\u003E.

Yet KSP lingers at this neither-here-nor-there 40%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is very weird, but the weirdest thing is that it never goes below this 40% mark. Has the game been turned into an exclusively moneymaking scheme?
