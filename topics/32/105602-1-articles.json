Its a shame they haven\u0027t got the heating just right yet. The reason parts heat up is because of the radiated heat from the shocked air. So a high emissivity value should lead to them heating up (exploding) faster!\n\nSimpler code to put in a magic heat dissapator and call it emissivity though.

It\u0027s not heating up from *convection* because it\u0027s so blunt, and therefore gives you a detached shockwave rather than an attached (oblique) shock. Same thing happens if you try flying a plane nose first, vs. a capsule butt-first."},{"CreatedByName":"TokiTech","CreatedById":131500,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T01:31:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That is thePrecooler isnt it?

For a plane usually get every \u0027front\u0027 parts blown off either from drag or heat. This felt cheaty and exploitable.
