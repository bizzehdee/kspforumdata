It has a t6400, 4 gb of ram (800 mhz) and an intel gma 450 MHD. I get roughly 12-20 fps on kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe upgrades I am considering are the upper end motherboard (comes with the HD 3650 chipset) and a processor upgrade (t9900). The entire upgrade would be roughly $200, and i\u0027m curious your guys\u0027s opinion on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe good, the 3650 is a DX10 card, so I should be able to run OBS. It also won\u0027t draw from the processor like the gma does, giving me more performance. The t9900 has at least a 15% performance gap over the t6400, which would help greatly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bad...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eprice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-27T12:00:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/78059-Debating-on-a-motherboard-upgrade\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYou did post a thread\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E Syre, but such threads are really supposed to be in the Space Lounge rather than in General Discussion, so I had to move it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI better close this one, don\u0027t need two \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
