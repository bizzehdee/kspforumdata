The only problem I see with them is that the mass is in the coupler and not the fairings. So when you pop the fairings you keep the same amount of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t use fins. They are generally not a good idea. Start your Gravity turn before or around 100 M/s (speed) and keep your target recticle in the little yellow circle that is droping (called the prograde marker).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it falls to fast (IE can\u0027t get space) you started the gravity turn to soon. If it falls to slow and you end up spinning out or entering orbit with a massive -400 PE..
