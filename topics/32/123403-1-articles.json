The SRBs were not thrust limited, and had the Advanced Nose Cones attached at the top of them depending on the test. The rocket was held by launch clamps to avoid any tipping before launch. SAS was activated, throttle was set to max (not that it should have made any difference if it was or not), and the rocket was launched. No manual control input was used, and the SRBs lifted the rocket until burnout. The maximum height and speed was recorded through the F3 screen. This process was repeated 3 times for each nose Cone type. No mods aside from KER were used, and these experiments were performed in stock 1.0.4 Aerodynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExperiment A:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SRBs were attached to the central tank with a radial decoupler and struts, simulating a typical rocket that is flown with detachable radial boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/cCaEJ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
