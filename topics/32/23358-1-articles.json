But I also assume around 1000m/s is required to get back into a stable orbit around Kerbin that isnt shown on the map (unless you aerobrake in which case returning to Kerbins ground is free). Also adding a 1000m/s like this gives me my margin for error because just going by the numbers on this map I was running out of fuel on the Mun and not able to take off again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to return from anywhere, as well as get there, you add all the numbers to get there plus all the numbers again to get back (except the 4500m/s launch from Kerbin) and add an extra 1000m/s for safety. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as examples: it will take 7800m/s for a round trip to Minmus, 8300m/s for the Mun and 9800m/s for Duna. These arent quite right because any planet with a decent atmosphere is practically free for landing on it if using parachutes and also aerobraking can greatly slow down you for an orbiting maneuver, but it gets it roughly right.
