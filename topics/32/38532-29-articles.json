Exactly like Mechjeb\u0027s Killrot would do. Everything I\u0027ve seen and heard indicates this is the intended behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s it\u0027s ACTUALLY doing is not locking onto a heading until quite a bit after you let go, and then holding that. It causes 2 things: It uses less force to damp the rotation than it\u0027s actually programmed to, because the incorrect \u0027target\u0027 is closer to its current position than it would be if the targeting were correct. The second is that it keeps sliding for a ways after you let go before locking onto a heading, making it much harder to get it on the precise heading you want. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 0.21.1 changes make it lock down MUCH faster, so the deviation is lessened and more noticable, making it easier to correct. And once you do get it aligned, the extra force it applies makes it hold that attitude much more strongly than it did in 0.21.0. It\u0027s better, it\u0027s still a bit tricky to use. I\u0027ll be making another vid to illustrate what I\u0027m talking about, with an extra bit to make sure there can be no doubt at all it\u0027s not a deadzone issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
