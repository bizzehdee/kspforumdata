KAS and related \u0022function\u0022 mods (Damned Robotics, Lazor Romfarer, that sort of ilk) are all excellent additions. I find the best way to reduce bloat is to simply err on the side of mods with less parts, but allow yourself to only splurge on one or two part packs at most. Also, if you\u0027re tired of Hyperediting, just don\u0027t install it: perhaps try out a non-automated save (no MechJeb, but perhaps instead Flight Engineer Redux).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you\u0027ve not left the Kerbin System yet, all you really need is the stock parts (overwhelmingly sufficient for visiting other planets), though Kerbal Alarm Clock is convenient for interplanetary transfers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T22:21:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also suggest Improved Maneuver Nodes, on top of several others that have been mentioned.
