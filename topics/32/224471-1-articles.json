This method leverages the reduction of output resolution to boost frame rates, as theoretically, lower output resolutions can result in higher frame rates per unit time. The author tested this on a laptop equipped with a 13700H processor, RTX 4060 graphics card, and 48GB of RAM, with a native screen resolution of 2560*1600. Under these conditions, with the full resolution enabled, highest texture quality, medium lighting, and 4 levels of shadows, the aerodynamic effects quality set to minimum, reflection refresh mode set to medium, and reflection texture resolution set to 512, the frame rate in a racing scene was only 32 frames per second.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;border:0px;color:#333333;font-size:15px;padding:0px;text-align:left;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\nTo improve the frame rate, the author lowered the output resolution to 1920*1200 while keeping other settings unchanged. Although the frame rate did increase after reducing the resolution, it also introduced noise and graininess to the image. To address this issue, the author employed the Lossless Scaling software, which utilizes a unique scaling algorithm to effectively enhance frame rates while maintaining image quality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;border:0px;color:#333333;font-size:15px;padding:0px;text-align:left;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\nSpecifically, the author used the automatic and full-screen scaling modes of Lossless Scaling, set the scaling type to Bicubic CAS with a sharpness level of 2, selected the frame generation mode to LSFG, and the capture API to WGC. With these settings, the frame rate was successfully increased to over 80 frames per second, while the image clarity was preserved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;border:0px;color:#333333;font-size:15px;padding:0px;text-align:left;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\nIn summary, Lossless Scaling software offers an effective way to improve game frame rates without upgrading hardware, which is highly recommended for gamers. However, compatibility may vary across different games, so players should test and adjust accordingly. It is hoped that this article can be helpful in enhancing the gaming experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow is the Demo screenshot to the bed link:\uFF1A\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/h3AoIKx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/h3AoIKx\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPostscript: This article has been embellished by AI.
