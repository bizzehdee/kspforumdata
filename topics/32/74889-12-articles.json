A \u0022pretty\u0022 trophy is too obvious and not very imaginative... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I thought to myself, what about a trophy made of orbiting trophies? Trophies launching trophies launching trophies, head off to Jool, then set up a whole bunch of orbits for the little trophies around Jool and the moons which, when looked at in map view from the north pole of Jool, form the basic outline of a trophy. Thinking about it I can picture how it could be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this is pretty clearly the kind of entry that would be differentiated from the simple and obvious \u0022nice looking ship\u0022 entries that are likely to be submitted. And it would probably require rather a large amount of skill and patience to pull off. But it wouldn\u0027t match the request that \u0022the pic looks as good as possible from in-game\u0022. So, I thought, why would \u0022prettiness\u0022 be an official requirement of the challenge? The challenge is to get a trophy to orbit. A \u0022nice looking trophy\u0022 might be the obvious choice, but why is a pretty screenshot the official \u0022most important aspect\u0022 for winning the first challenge? Why not skill, or imaginative thinking, etc? And why a single screenshot? Why not a movie? Or an album?
