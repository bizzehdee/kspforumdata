Great! Let\u0027s make even greater by using the GREATEST SHIP MY MACHINE CAN WITHHOLD! =P\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I spent weeks, more than a month, trying to make something that would fly without spaghetification, while also avoiding the easy way out of auto-strutting everything. Because I\u0027m not only megalomaniac, I\u0027m also perfectionist. Yeah, I already reserved a room on the loony bin near home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI managed to make a blimp. A slightly big blimp. 380 Meters long.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I launched that lady. And she flies. And she flies pretty well. Damn, she flies fast - 55m/s!!! No bad !\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then... Geesh, I\u0027m somewhat low. Only 170 meters high, it\u0027s better to gain some altitude. But at 55m/s, a mere \u0026lt;5\u00B0 inclination made\u00A0the\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ehuge\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0body start\u00A0to get lift. 380 meters of lifting body to be more precise. Enough to make me loose control of her ~3.000 Tons. Lots of control to loose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut hey, I\u0027m at 170 meters high, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell... Did I commented that she has 380 meters long? So, half 380 is 190 meters. And since I\u0027m a good engineer-wanna-be, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E is at the (almost) exact center of the vessel. So she was 20 meters too longer. Or lower... #facePalm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI cut the thrust and shoved the Joystick to front. No joy, her nose didn\u0027t stop climbing (and her butt, dropping).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI set the\u00A0buoyancy to zero (she\u0027s a blimp!). Again, no joy. Her nose still raise - slower, but still raise. And her butt... #sigh\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know you know what happened.

Build a shuttle and rover to get to the Mun. Release the rover in low Mun orbit and land it, then land the shuttle. Refuel shuttle from rover on the mun and return.

Check the staging, looks good but man is there a lot of engines good thing I kept checking the staging when I was building everything. Ok, lets try launching it like a rocket. Looking good and nope still nose diving once the boosters are released. Lets try this then, and launch. Wait a minute why is there 6 little hotspots on the cargo bay door, doh the rovers twitch thrusters some how made it into my mess of staging and are firing. That is why it keeps nose diving. Ok staging is now fixed,\u00A0 and the launch is good. Kerbin orbit achieved, off to the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr maybe not, I used too much fuel on that ascent to burn for the Mun. Well at least this completes the kerbin station contract and I can drop off the recovery vessels into orbit to later do those contracts. I can also launch the polar scanner/relay satellite for the Mun. Maybe I should leave the rover, nah I would never be able to get it back in this bay without breaking something. Hey, I forgot I had those tourists with me,\u00A0 I guess they won\u0027t get a close up of the Mun for free this time. Besides their fare just paid for the recovery vessels and satellite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTime for kerbin deorbit. Time for my first time coming back in atmosphere with a shuttle, I feel like something is wrong. Oh man, thats right I wanted the should oriented the other direction on\u00A0reentry not retrograde. Man this thing doesn\u0027t want to reorient, oh well I will come in like a normal rocket. Splash down, hmm came down a little harder than I thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, new launch. Hey this thing is going easier without the extra recovery vehicles and satellite. Kerbin orbit achieved again, cool got enough fuel for the Mun still.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlright the Mun is coming up, fire thrusters for orbit insertion. A highly eliptical orbit is achieved, dang almost out of fuel. Well look at that I can just lower my periapsis and land right there. Sweet, wait ummm I am coming into the surface a little to hot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, I can do this. Wasn\u0027t I supposed to do something before I landed the shuttle, oh well. Slowing down and here comes the Munar surface. Bounce, hop, bounce, back flip, roll, lose a wing but hey thats why the shuttle has emergency parachutes for the return, bounce, hop, is it ever going to stop. Oh look its stopping finally. Sweet I landed the\u00A0shuttle on the Mun, sorta \u00A0and used up all\u00A0of the fuel. Wasn\u0027t a graceful landing for sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI undocked the rover went great and didn\u0027t explode. Switch to the rover and activate \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E to get it out and it doesn\u0027t move.

I mean I swear I saw them firing earlier when using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E to change the shuttles orientation, yep I see one peeking out right there. Oh, the probe core doesn\u0027t have a signal for control, hmm well I guess I will transfer a pilot over. Still nothing, oh ya the cupola module isn\u0027t a control module. Alright I can extend the antennas, but then they will get ripped off coming out of the bay lets try raising the relay antennas on the shuttle, and we are now in business I got control signal for the probe. Ok, activate \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters, I see them firing but the rover isn\u0027t moving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I had installed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters along with monoprop tanks I hadn\u0027t installed enough thrusters to lift its weight.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, maybe I can get it out using the twitch thrusters I installed, hmmm nope they are oriented to drive the rover further into the bay. Oh, I know I planned on refueling the shuttle using the mining rig on the rover but ummm, I forgot a klaw and the other docking ports on the shuttle are either the wrong type or positioned in a blocked location with the shuttle in this\u00A0orientation. Guess I will need to do a rescue mission, but I am not giving up on this rover yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell I am already here lets try and reorient the shuttle onto the landing legs so that I can tilt the rover out. Dang it, why did I have to build such a heavy shuttle, I can\u0027t stand it up on its legs with just \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E. Maybe I might have just enough liquid fuel to, nope would need enough to take off and then reorient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow about some landing gear fun, lets retract the side landing gear and try to rock the rover out with the shuttle only using its central landing gear. Grrr, thats not working either. I did manage to get it a wheel length out of the bay before what the rover was rocking on broke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell shoot. Hey I landed the shuttle on a hill I will just disengage the breaks and let it build enough speed and hopefully I hit a bump that sends the rover out of the bay. And I am rolling down the hill,\u00A0 speed is picking up there is a bump coming up. Hit the bump and the rover pops up mostly out of the cargo bay, hit the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters and proceed to curse as I just thrusted it back into the bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShuttle is still rolling maybe I can hit another bump, uh oh. The shuttle is starting to tilt over and I am moving 30 m/s. Hey maybe this will work to my advantage. Yep the shuttle is rolling over, the rover is out of the bay and now the shuttle is continuing to roll over. Got the rover oriented onto its wheels in time but that shuttle is still coming at the rover time to move. Nope, slam.\u00A0The shuttle pile drives\u00A0the rover into the ground killing the rover and starts an explosion chain reaction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce all the explosions end all that is left of the shuttle and rover is a cupola, a drill and a set of landing gear. No sign of the 13 brave kerbonaut souls that were aboard to 2 vessels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll because I didn\u0027t put enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters on the rover. The rover which I had taken so much care into designing so that once it was undocked would not snag any bits on the cargo bay, the rover I had taken 6 hours to build and adjust parts. The rover which then made me spend another 10 hours redesigning the shuttle to lift it to the Mun. I even remembered ladders for the rover and shuttle just in case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure how many face palm moments there were in that mission. It took a week of trial and error to even get that far. Sorry for the long windedness.
