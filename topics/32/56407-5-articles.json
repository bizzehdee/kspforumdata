Becouse they were promised resources last kerbalkon, being scraped spring 2013. If I remeber corectly thats what costed Damion his position as a comunity manager. If I remeber corectly it was something about building bases and complex mining was considered being added as a expansion. And outrage was quie suvire. So people are waiting a year for this feature, which could again revolutunaze the way we play a game. (Unlike science, which is curently just play a game with less parts) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Multyplayer is wierd, and will be wierd. How anybody ever said hey man lets play flight simulator on this lan party. (Well nobody ever) Becouse map is fricking huge and you can both be on other side of the universe literaly. With KSP added time warp it boils down to actualy one person is playing and rest is either waiting or building in VAB. Only momens which could be fun is shared building of space stations and bases. But i dont think its a good move. Veteran players are alredy getting kinda bored, and teaching your friends orbital mechanics is fun. But not in a long run or if you are playing alone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for ongoing debate. I completly agree that mining resources and fuel, makes things super easy. It is true. I instaled kethane and it is easy to just strap bunch of parts and do a grand tour with OP self suficient lander. My imaginary idea off one day implemantaion of resources will be some sot of colony mechanics combined with curency. In the end we will be able to put VAB on Duna or Gilly.

For example, what if the goal of resource mining was to collect any of the primary consumable resources: Dirt/Regolith/Topsoil (can be used in building), Water (for use in life support), Oxygen (also for use in life support), Oxidizer (compressed oxygen), Liquid Fuel, Monopropellent (compressed liquid fuel), or EVA Propellent (even further compressed Monopropellent).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou pretty much start with Dirt/Regolith/Topsoil which you get directly from the drill. You have a second unit which breaks it down into constituent parts - Water, Liquid Fuel, and more Dirt/Regolith/Topsoil, in differing ratios depending on where you\u0027re mining it from. For example, if you\u0027re mining on an ice cap you get a higher ratio of Water to other stuff. If you\u0027re mining on Eve, you get a higher ratio of Liquid Fuel. If you\u0027re mining on the Munar Equator, you get a higher ratio of Dirt/Regolith/Topsoil. And hey, you know what? We don\u0027t really even need two separate units for this do we? So let\u0027s just get rid of the separator as its own unit and couple it with the drill, so instead of getting out soil from the ground it automatically splits it into these three things that you get in different ratios no matter where you are in the solar system!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so after that you then have a second unit which can use electricity to compress/convert the base resource into other more useful resources. So for this example, you could put in Water, and for a certain amount of electricity get out Oxygen. Put in twice that amount of electricity and you get out Oxidizer. You use that *same unit* and pump in Liquid Fuel and you can similarly get out Monoprop or EVA prop, again depending on how much precious electricity you want to part with. What about Dirt? Well, it could be used as ballast, brought home for science, or simply dumped overboard because it\u0027s not as useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo units: Drill/Separator, and Converter. Each one takes a certain amount of electricity. Besides the two units needed for the actual mining, you\u0027d only really need to add a third part for storage, and let\u0027s say it\u0027s just one unit that can contain certain amounts of all three mineable resources. Also, notice that the \u0022resource map\u0022 I described only has three branches: Water -\u0026gt; Oxygen -\u0026gt; Oxidizer, Liquid Fuel -\u0026gt; Monopropellent -\u0026gt; EVA Propellent, and Dirt, which doesn\u0027t really do much of anything except possibly net you science points and allow you to fulfill contracts back home possibly. That hardly seems like a \u0022terrible spaghetti mess of resources\u0022 to me.
