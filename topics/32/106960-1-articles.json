Came into 1.0 with a lot of re-learning and un-learning to do. Just as i was getting into it, the 1.0.1/2 patches came out and shocked me again. I hated it at first, and still find the aero model artificial and magickal, but i can\u0027t go back to 1.0 anymore. They are vastly different but both are imperfect. 1.0.2 currently only annoys me because basic jets are slow and unfun compared to 1.0 and because heat shielding is buggy. There are improvements in the patch though and 1.0 is actually pretty terrible to go back to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T17:52:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still in 0.9.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWaiting, until all the mods updated, and hopefully, SQUAD fixes all the mess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027m looking for methods to import all my old crew into new game, as I heard, that 0.9 saves are totally incompatible with 1.0, not even mentioning the mods, which, some of them, already declared \u0022save-breaking\u0022 in their new versions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T17:56:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI downloaded it and loved it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketKen","CreatedById":97776,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T18:01:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was up all night playing 1.0.2, and like it just fine.
