Or just an unexpected and funny -- but irreversible -- crew accident of less than heroic nature that you feel like posting here? Then do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1. Skydive Classic\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ...As the Eve lander opened its chutes, I collect a set of atmospheric flight data from all the sciencey gadgets and switch to IVA to make a pretty screenshot with the sun rising over Eve horizon from 10 km altitude, but click on the EVA instead. Farewell, Lanwin Kerman, we\u0027ll name a weather satellite after you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Martian Fail\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Deslo Kerman lands on Duna succesfully and goes on mandatory EVA to collect rocks, plant a flag and whatnot. His mass-produced lander was tested kazillion times under all conditions possible and made countless trips to Mun, Minmus and Ike; what could possibly go wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Instead of spawning on the crew hatch, the pilot somehow gets ejected, falls down like a rock, awkwardly faceplants, goes poof.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E That death looks pretty realistic though: kerbonaut slipped on the dust-covered steel ladder and broke the helmet. Derp happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Moving Parts\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I finish constructing a grand space station of some 300 parts in low Kerbin orbit. The only crew on board is a scientist manning the lab. As a shuttle approaches the station at 2.4 km to dock, the whole giant structure begins to fiercely shake and wobble. Bits and pieces fly off. Finally, a chunk with a docking port, large probe core and a battery is torn off and disappears into the dark, wildly spinning. Ouch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The Kraken backs off and I survey the damage. Most of the station is intact with labs and plenty of other ports, i\u0027ll just dock to them the replacement of what was destroyed. Time to clean up the rubble. I go to the tracking station and begin to terminate all the \u0022Station Debris\u0022 until there\u0027s only a \u0022Station Ship\u0022 left...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ...Yes, as you might have guessed, the piece with the probe core was the \u0022ship\u0022; the 120-ton main body of the station with the three-star scientist and like 600 data in the lab from all of Kerbin was, technically, a piece of debris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4. Gravity Syndrome\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E After a successfull landing on Gilly, I plant a flag, collect samples and switch to other things while the lander still rests on the surface. Of course, I\u0027ve noticed that the gravity on Gilly is so low that the movement of the rotating asteroid sometimes raises the lander\u0027s legs a few centimeters above ground and then, after a while, it comes to rest again. Fool me thought that the state of \u0022Landed\u0022 is enough...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ...Five minutes and one \u003Cem\u003Etiny\u003C/em\u003E timewarp later, the lander, with its inhabitant and all the science in it, is nowhere to be found. The game decided that it has crashed into Gilly. All that\u0027s left from the folly of Tomner Kerman is a proudly standing -- and absolutely useless -- flag.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T10:50:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo scientist went on a long long career Duna mission. They had the first science lab we ever built. They landed on Gilly and Duna. They gathered all science data from the planet\u0027s SoI and the interplanetary space. They couldn\u0027t really process it there, as all the space-program had at that point were the most basic solar panels.
