The ripples go around the planet before merging at the opposite side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the shockwave from the impact sent magma from Moho\u0027s innards to emerge from the opposite side, causing something like a volcano to occur. Forming lava flows on the highland on the near side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat impact may have also given Moho a thin atmosphere of volcanic fumes. (That\u0027s why landing on Moho is a challenge) As Moho, is actually massive enough to contain an atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"simplemunrockets","CreatedById":22495,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-08T22:35:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe something like this actually happened on Mercury, so it is realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-09T00:20:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou may be thinking about Mars.
