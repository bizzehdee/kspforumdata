They were designed to be folded in with other missions as a fairly casual early game source of funds. Each tourist does not need to go on the same vessel, and more than one pod can fit on a vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tourism contracts are one of the highest paying contracts, but this comes with a few caveats. The funds of tourism contracts scales dramatically with what the tourist is requesting and how many tourists there are in the tour. You get partial credit at each destination, but indeed, this is not meant to be a large amount. The bulk of the reward is given when you complete the tourist\u0027s itinerary by recovering him back on Kerbin. The tours are intentionally designed this way to heavily encourage keeping the tourists safe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T20:43:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the tourism contracts aren\u0027t really worth enough to do the missions just for tourism.
