On landing and going EVA I notice that kerbals walk differently. They kinda slide over the surface a bit (especially when walking sideways) and you can\u0027t make them walk towards you anymore. S makes them walk backwards rather than turn and face you, so unless you make a point of it, you don\u0027t really ever see their darling little faces, and you can never see their faces while actually walking (kills some of the cinematic potential). Also I get really bad lag when walking, fps goes back up when I stop or jet pack off the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Caelib","CreatedById":59329,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T02:19:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI played for a few hours and I think it\u0027s a great update.
