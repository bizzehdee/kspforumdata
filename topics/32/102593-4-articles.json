I had gotten the 9 boosters okay tho. The problem is that the small liquid fuel boosters where dumping into the main fuel tank from the get go, and I didn\u0027t want that. But if I didn\u0027t put a fuel line, I couldn\u0027t activate the transfer later.\n\nStill with the new aero, it might be worth a re-try.
