What happened to the Hype? has it died down? i feel like a lot of the forum fans dont respond anymore and this forum is starting to become like any other forum. its really sad. i remember i had like 20 notifications a day and i\u0027ve now only had 3 notifications in the last 4 months (one of them was a warning point). i really hope we can revamp this forum up. KSP is one of those rare games that keeps an imprint in our fingers when we play it (similar to among us). i sure hope this forum can keep up with it. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:/\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png\u0022 title=\u0022:/\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow71","CreatedById":210112,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-28T14:55:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s the holidays, and unlike last year, people are traveling and doing stuff outside their homes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-28T16:31:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen covid was (it still is but whatev) in full swing most people stayed at home.
