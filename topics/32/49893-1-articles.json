Now that it\u0027s all good, we\u0027re going to set it up so launching KSP through Steam takes you to the Launcher first (don\u0027t worry, you can set it up to bypass the launcher if you want to). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KSP Launcher shows you a news feed so you\u0027ve now got a place to quickly check out the latest news and dev blogs, and it also lets you tweak game settings before opening the game, which means you now have a way to undo any settings that might prevent the game from working properly, plus new settings which are only available from outside the game, like frameless windowed mode. Check out the Advanced Tab on the launcher settings to see the new options. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launchings! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZenViolence","CreatedById":74429,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T16:50:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Got Ninja\u0027d \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"madrobby","CreatedById":89617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T17:04:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022you can set it up to bypass the launcher if you want to\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know how?
