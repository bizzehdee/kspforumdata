Up until then anything had to be a mission all its own and I was perfectly happy with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I decided I need to learn this. I have to be able to dock or my game will become a needless mess of challenges. So I put a Apollo style CSM up there with tons of everything needed, orbiting at 150KM. Then took my laptop out and loaded up a Scott Manley tutorial, rolled up my sleeves, and got to work. About two hours later (after learning how to fiddle with the nodes correctly), I was within 500 meters of the ship.

Nowadays I can dock practically without thinking about it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The thing about docking is, it\u0027s not meaningfully different from trying to intercept a moon or planet. You want to first get it so that your two vessels will be close to one another at some point in their orbits, and then you want to adjust for the difference so they can maneuver towards one another at safe speeds once you get close enough. Maneuver nodes are great for this, and targeting is essential. Even if you don\u0027t use maneuver nodes, the six-point navigation technique can help immensely. This technique is simple enough: fire in one of the six key directions (north, east, south, west, up, or down) and see how it changes your intercept. If you get a better intercept, keep firing. If you get a worse one, fire the opposite way until it stops being very effective. Once you\u0027ve checked all 6 directions this way, you generally get a pretty good intercept... assuming you\u0027ve got a point where the two orbits will realistically intercept, of course.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kirbypowered","CreatedById":51383,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-08T01:36:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDocking was one of my first real attempts since getting back into KSP, so I wasn\u0027t (and still am not) especially efficient at or knowledgeable about Kerbal rocket science.

I got the first two pieces up fine and had little problem aligning their trajectories, but RCS was set up terribly for docking. Using docking controls, the module would just start spinning at the slightest correction burn. Extremely frustrating stuff, that was. Eventually (about an hour or two later), I\u0027d pretty much given up careful precision and was just about out of monopropellant fuel, so as I drifted around at an angle with the ports facing, I just launched at it desperately. Unexpectedly, the two parts pulled towards each other fairly quickly (as I said, next to no knowledge here) and started rolling around dangerously close to flying off from each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just stared, wide eyed (quite a feat considering I was half asleep and it was about 2 AM) and scared to do anything in fear that I\u0027d ruin it, and watched. Slowly, the scene calmed before me and suddenly the view rotated and zoomed out a bit, informing me that there was a successful connection. So what if it was horribly lined up? So what if it turned out to be horribly unstable and hard to maneuver? I was so full of accomplishment at the time that I could barely care the least for that stuff. That sort of feeling is not something I think I\u0027ve gotten from another game before, at least that I remember, and it\u0027s definitely something that makes Kerbal Space Program special to me now.

I finally got the hang of it, and now happily assemble ships in orbit and dock fuel tankers around other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a step by step tutorial I typed up earlier:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow. Here comes the start of the tricky bits. Once you\u0027ve made it into orbit, take note of whether you wound up in front of or behind your target. We\u0027re now going to use what I call the HIGH ROAD / LOW ROAD system to get closer. As in \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CYou take the high road, I\u0027ll take the low road and I\u0027ll be in Scotland before ye!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Your speed is inextricably linked to your orbital height. Higher = slower, lower = faster. So if your target is orbiting at 125Km and is ahead of you then you need to go faster and should make your orbit at 121Km. If you are in front of your target you need to go slower and should set your orbit at 128Km or so. Yes, this does mean that if you need to catch up with a target in front of you you do a series of burns away from them. Yes, every science fiction movie is ruined now. You\u0027re welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the difference in your orbital heights should be about 3-5KM unless you\u0027ve totally fluffed your launch window and your target is on the other side of the planet in which case you can go higher or lower to fix that problem more quickly. Once you get closer (1/8th the planet radius or so) you should get within the 3-5KM range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027ve gotten into the correct orbit we need to planarize \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 planify? Plantificate? Nope, spell check doesn\u0027t like any of those. Co-plaginate? Nope. Anyway, we need to make our orbits co-planar. To do this, select the orbit target. This may be tricky. Especially if you haven\u0027t been keeping LKO clean. The selector algorithm loves selecting debris, followed by ships orbiting the Mun, followed by any other ship in Kerbin orbit. Only if there is no reasonable way it could possibly select one of those will it allow you to select the ship that is right under your pointer. However, if you click it too many times in frustration it will transfer you TO that ship, so be careful and keep your orbits clean. If you can\u0027t select the ship from the orbital view you can select it from the main view once you get close enough. Simply wait and then go to the main view. Set your camera to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CFree View\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 so that it remains pointed in the right direction and aim it forwards or backwards depending on who is chasing whom. Remember that the Backbone of Night lies along Kerbin\u0027s orbit, so your target should appear along there. Unless you didn\u0027t follow my advice above about using an equatorial orbit, in which case GOOD LUCK. You then wait until a purple bracket box appears and double click on that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, once you\u0027ve managed to select your docking target you will now have a second green orbit marked on your map display and somewhere between two and six new markers. The important ones are the ones marked AN and DN for ascending node and descending node \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 the places where your current orbit crosses the orbit of your target. Set a maneuver node on one and adjust it until your difference is 0.0* If you\u0027ve done this properly the other four markers should now have merged into two. These show you your closest approach \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 one marker is for you, the other is for your target. Focus on Kerbin center those markers and turn on turbo time. And wait. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWAIT \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Time for a song!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, at some point that target position is going to switch from one side of the your position marker to the other. Now is the TIME FOR GLORY.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESwitch to your main view, Free Camera. Find your target. If you are in a lower orbit it will appear to pass over you. If you\u0027re in a higher orbit it will appear to pass under. If you forgot to make your orbits co-planar it will swing from left to right and you should have FIXED THAT EARLIER. Also, look at your navball. It should now read \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CTARGET\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 instead of \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CORBIT\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. There are also two new markings on it. So, your prograde and retrograde vectors are now RELATIVE TO YOUR TARGET and the new purple marks are TOWARDS TARGET and AWAY FROM TARGET. It will also show you your speed relative to the target. This is an absolute value, so if you are heading towards the target at 5ms it will show \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C5ms\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. If you\u0027re heading away at 5ms it will ALSO show 5ms. This isn\u0027t normally a problem, but keep it in mind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, we need to start moving towards our target. Switch to Chase View and rotate the camera away from the side on view (seriously, has anyone ever used the chase camera in any position other than behind and slightly above? I\u0027ve wanted it off to the side like that approximately NEVER times, but I HAVE lost half a dozen planes while trying to fight it around to a useful position). Find the TOWARDS TARGET icon and if you can see your FORWARD marker then set your heading so that it is on the opposite side of the TOWARD TARGET icon from your FORWARD marker and thrust. Use your main engine if you can \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 the first rule of orbital rendezvous is that you never can have enough RCS gas, so you should spare it if you can. Anyway, thrust until your forward vector is now heading toward the target. I generally try and keep my speed equal to roughly my distance / 100. So if I\u0027m 3.5km away, then I should be going about 35ms. You may need to change this if the ship your trying to dock is exceptionally sluggish. Now as you get closer you need to slow down and keep your vector pointed at the target. If you boost towards your target your forward vector moves TOWARDS your heading. If you cut it moves AWAY. So if you\u0027ve drifted off to the left and want to correct that AND slow down, then you point your ship in a heading that is on the far side of your vector from the target icon and decelerate which will both bleed off a bit of forward velocity and \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cpush\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 your heading back towards where you want it to be. Now, once you get within 2.2Km KSP will load the other ship. This will cause a momentary spike of lag that can range from \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cnoticeable\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ctime to go get a sandwich\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 depending on how large your target is and how beefy your computer is. Try not to be doing any violent maneuvering as you pass that threshold. Once you get to about 1.2Km it will switch from KM to M and you will usually immediately panic as that number seems to suddenly be getting smaller faster than it was a minute ago. Just stick to the 1/100 rule and you\u0027ll be fine. The first time you try a rendezvous you\u0027ll usually be going way too fast. 20M/s is pathetic by interplanetary travel standards, but when you\u0027re trying to dock with another vessel that is only tens of meters away you suddenly remember that 20m/s is about 55 mph. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you get to about 100m away from your target, quicksave, kill your forward velocity, turn on your SAS, turn on your headlight if necessary and find your docking port. If you need to switch over to the other ship for a second you can do so now, just try to leave your other ship gently floating away so that if you take too long you don\u0027t suddenly get rammed. Once you\u0027ve found your docking port, GENTLY RCS over to it. You may want to hit \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cfine controls\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 at this point as well. Keep in mind that it may be easier to switch over to the target vessel and rotate it around than try and fly in a circle around to a docking port on the far side of a craft. Now, get perpendicular to your target docking port. Now use your translate controls (remember those?) to get lined up with your docking port. Now gently thrust towards it. Once you get with 50M you can right click and select the port and target it. This makes one important change. All the markers on your navball are now relative to the docking port. Make sure you\u0027re still lined up and correct as necessary. Once you get with a meter or two the ports will pull towards each other. If the ships are bouncing too wildly you can try and correct with your RCS jets, but you generally just leave them alone and let your SAS dampen the bouncing enough that you actually dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re docked you can transfer fuel by selecting a fuel tank and then alt-selecting a second fuel tank (or RCS tank) and using the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cout\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 buttons to transfer fuel and oxidizer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should be good to go at this point.
