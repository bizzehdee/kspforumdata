reach orbit.\u00A0 Some had to discover this meant going sideways, not just up.\u00A0 The navball and velocity indicators were the only tools we had, and everyone who wanted to orbit quickly learned

Most students immediately forget that fact because it is boring. However, I read the lamentations of a KSP player. He had managed to get a Kerbal in a rocket into a polar orbit, then ran out of propellant. When it came to mounting a rescue mission, he suddenly found out the hard way that it was very very difficult designing a rocket capable of rescuing the Kerbal. Rockets launch into equitorial orbits, you need a change-of-plane to move into a polar orbit. The student has forgotten about the expense of change-of-plane maneuvers, because they never need that fact.

I had to learn that those were a thing, which I picked up mostly from YouTube videos.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough KSP hasn\u0027t taught me all that much about orbital mechanics and rocketry that I didn\u0027t already know, I have benefitted from playing it.\u00A0 KSP forced me to thing about solutions to problems I had previously considered.\u00A0 It\u0027s given me some practical hands on experience that I couldn\u0027t get just from book learning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022
