It had the ancient pod, no map mode, or SPH or Mun.I don\u0027t really remember playing, but I sort of remember thinking \u0022Man, this is hard\u0022 after I played it a few times. I think someone from another game (Battle Pirates) got me into it originally, or I found it on accident some how. Then about a year or so later they mentioned it again, and by that point it had been updated, and it had the map mode, you could get into orbit, \u00A0and the Mun was there, but that was about it, in the demo anyway. I think at that point it was 0.18. A few months later it was my birthday so I bought it, and at that point it was 0.19, if I remember correctly, or it updated a few weeks later. Can\u0027t remember now. lol\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs far as the direction its gone, I think it\u0027s pretty awesome. Some of the mods I liked the most, (remoteTech, Scansat, kethane, just to name a few) have basically been integrated into the stock game, although each is a little different in the stock game compared to the mod).\u00A0The ONLY thing that would really make it better is better graphics, and....well if it was easier to do VR with it. Of course, the only VR device I have right now is google cardboard, which, so far as I know doesn\u0027t have anything that allows it to translate phone motion into PC motion, then of course there is the issue of sending VR data from the PC to the phone, in such a way that it would work with google cardboard, which admittedly, the resolution isn\u0027t that great, even on my Note 4.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI guess I might eventually get an Oculus, or some other VR PC device.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt anyrate, so far I\u0027ve been pleased with the direction the game has gone, and can\u0027t wait to see where it goes from here. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve even got the latest version, with the new ability to dive under water. Steam on my linux desktop (yes....i got it on steam \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0I originally bought the halflife box set with counterstrike, team fortress, etc, it had a thing for signing up for steam to download blueshift for free I think so i did that)....anyway, steam on my desktop won\u0027t update for some reason due to \u0022space\u0022 issues. *Technical computer stuff ahead* For whatever reason my boot sector is only about 200mb (my fault for not checking that when I installed the OS) and for some reason updates use that space, I guess for temp files, and well...there isn\u0027t space there to do that, so updates fail. I\u0027ve been meaning to do a backup wipe it and install a new linux version, but just haven\u0027t gotten around to it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have steam on my laptop, but until recently I was waiting to get the windows 10 update. Then when I could I didn\u0027t have enough space to download it. Fixed that, 2 or 3 times (it kept saying not enough space, and the required space kept going up, go figure). Did get it updated eventually, and all is good. My laptop is pretty ancient though so we\u0027ll see how 1.1 fairs on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-10T16:13:43Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2016 04:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Sma\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded joined date\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T16:22:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222449535\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022128935\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221457549406\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002212468\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Willbl3pic\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 hours ago, Willbl3pic said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone remember SundayPunch?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, Wobbly Rockets. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aladran","CreatedById":2055,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T17:37:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYep, still around this game has so much evolved since I\u0027ve starded with 0.8.5.
