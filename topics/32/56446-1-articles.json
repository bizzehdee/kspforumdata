I wholeheartedly agree on the notion that a game is something you should be enjoying as you play, not suffering through for the promise of some indeterminate reward further ahead. \u003Cp\u003EThat said, there seems to be a balance to strike here (as with all things), because following this argument to its logical conclusion would lead to the idea that games should not be persistent at all, and we\u0027re back to how coin-operated arcade gaming worked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is merit in working towards a higher goal in a near future, most definitely. But games, like many other things, are about the journey, not the destination. With KSP, that\u0027s actually quite literal an analogy. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMusings aside though, there\u0027s nothing in 0.23 that has caused compatibility issues with previous saves. My test saves here are all from 0.22 or even earlier, and they are all working normally. A key thing to understand about compatibility in KSP is that when something makes a save incompatible, that doesn\u0027t mean the game will outright treat old files as unloadable. To make that happen, we here have to manually set a new \u0022last-compatible\u0022 version number for the file formats that broke, so the game throws error messages and disables the incompatible ones. Unless we do that, the game will allow you to load the save and treat it as a fully compatible file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote though, I can\u0027t say the same for modded installs. If a plugin breaks because of changes to the game code, then there\u0027s no telling what it could do... In that case, you\u0027ll have to wait until the plugin is updated to work on 0.23, but unless your game was corrupted as a result of the plugin failure, once the mod is updated you should be good to go again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short, we haven\u0027t had to up the last-compatible version on any of the file formats here so far, so compatibility is preserved as far as we can tell. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe gist: Saves will probably not break.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bigdad84","CreatedById":49379,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T03:57:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESee once again...
