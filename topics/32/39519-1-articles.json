The first modules to go up are the fuel tanks/engines. Essentially each module is two large orange tanks with an engine at the bottom, 2 sets of 4 connector ports in a \u002B shape and some solar panels, batteries, SAS. First one inserted into orbit perfectly. I launched the second and when attempting to rendezvous I realized I\u0027d forgotten a critical element. RCS! These modules have no RCS to help with docking. I contemplated holding off and sending up another module with RCS to help dock them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut Kerbals wouldn\u0027t do that. Kerbals would foolishly try to dock them anyways. So I did. And I slammed the top of the second module into the side of the first which caused the second module to explode, destroying the robotic control center and sending pieces flying. Crap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first module survived unscathed, so I decided I\u0027d fix the design (add some dang RCS!) and dock that module to continue building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, one almost full orange tank of fuel, the solar panels on the lower section, and the main engine survived the the explosion and are in stable orbit. 4 docking ports also survived. The tank is fortunately not spinning, though SAS is offline of course. So while it\u0027s currently uncontrollable, something could dock and control it. I can\u0027t use it as part of the station, but I hate to let all that fuel go to waste. My question is: What fun things can you think of to do with it? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T22:24:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESundive? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t have enough fuel to do that, try crashing into a celestial body or attempting to hit the VAB from orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe possibilities are endless! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Coneshot","CreatedById":69785,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T22:29:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPractice your high speed (30 m/s and above) docking techniques....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sardonyx","CreatedById":74982,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T23:22:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERescue mission successful\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/PVBNy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
