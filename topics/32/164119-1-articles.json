It has never been communicated that way, but we all know that there have been some contractual adjustments... I assume this port didn\u0027t generate as much money as planned. We then had 1.2 (with quite some new content) and finally the subsequent language support. I haven\u0027t seen many new users around since 1.3 was made available - probably some users changed from English to Russian or Japanese but I doubt tons of Chinese users purchased the game... In the end we had the take over by taketwo and the DLC. The DLC features new parts and a mission builder - part packs are available for free and mission design is done on the forums as well. Not the best business case in my eyes. So yes, development isn\u0027t coming up with new exciting ideas to keep us following the news. Development has slowed, yes, definitely.
