Instead, Kolony segments will be shuttled into space and docked together. Once the station is complete, the landers, scansats, shuttles, and krew will be sent up and Ambitious will launch. Also on the table is the potential to deploy Kolony modules on a planet ahead of Kolonists, who will arrive 1-2y later from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a pretty ambitious project for me. Originally I wanted to put a Kolony on Minmus, but I\u0027m having some trouble with that (using USI). I\u0027ve had space stations before so I figured this would be the same thing, but bigger and more self-sufficient.

So far this Kolony is getting pretty big!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe Kolony of course needs to have an array of landers capable of shuttle krew and rovers to the moon\u0027s - and back.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI also want to do 1 planetary landing.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI have no which method of propulsion would be best.

I haven\u0027t even left the Kerbin SOI yet, or even made my first Kolony, yet here I am 1 month into the game wanting to do this crazy thing.
