Pretty damn resource intensive and B. Incredibly time consuming for a team that would have to model each individual city. Imagine modeling every city on the surface of the Earth; that would take oodles of time! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPackaged in this week\u0027s Humble Bundle\u0027s Weekly Sale, introversion software has a tech demo that made me rethink the whole thing. It\u0027s a city generator that essentially takes a plain of whatever size, factors in water sources, selects city locations, builds roads, starting with major roads and working down to minor ones, then builds buildings based on the size of their city blocks, and position in the city. Once the software is done, the city is actually pretty damn impressive. If you wanted to check it out, you could bascially head over and pay one penny to download it for free (\u0027course it\u0027s for charity, so...you might want to pay more?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I got to thinking about the new Mun craters, and how they essentially use a similar process. You know, a random seed that\u0027s always the same; we all read the blog post. Suddenly, cities on the surface of Kerbal don\u0027t seem that far out of reach. Although it might be a long shot, is there any way two great devs might want to have a little phone conversation to use this tech demo as a springboard for Kerbal cities in .22? No matter what, though, it\u0027s a pretty cool tech demo and makes me giddy with excitement for what could possibly be a fully populated Kerbal. So, I just wanted to share.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apollo1391","CreatedById":73845,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T19:10:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyeah that would be awesome orbiting over the dark side of kerbin and seeing all the lights from the cities below\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JakeGrey","CreatedById":61242,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T19:12:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a demo video I found on YouTube:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/FR9xI0GgrBY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks pretty impressive, and definitely something to think about licensing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adamz5k","CreatedById":23052,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T19:16:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the Youtube vid.
