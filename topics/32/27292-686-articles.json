I have to do that with my main re-fueling supply plane if I want it to remain stable. Maybe (and this is just a thought) replace the Mk2 cockpit with a Mk2 inline, stick a Mk2 to 1.25 adapter in front of that (empty out the oxidizer, of course), stick an NCS Adapter on the end of that, and then put a SAS cone on up front. That may play a bit much with the craft\u0027s aesthetics, but it\u0027ll give you some place to stick all your fuel up close to the nose and move the CoM forward. If you use FAR, you might even consider putting a Communotron 16 on the tip of the SAS cone and extending it while you\u0027re still in the SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice looking spaceplane, BTW.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-24T18:41:08Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2015 06:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"percyPrune","CreatedById":130676,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T19:25:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBoring stuff to you who are boldly going beyond Kerbin\u0027s SOI but I\u0027m still mucking about between Kerbal and Minmus.
