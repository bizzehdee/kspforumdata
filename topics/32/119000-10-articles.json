In my mind, the smaller parts were \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E needed than the larger parts, simply because you can at least lump smaller parts together to create something larger, as impractical as it is. As it currently stands, making tiny planes is effectively impossible without mods, with the smallest jet engine being really heavy and powerful for a 0.625m craft. That said, the addition of larger parts is most definitely welcome. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFair enough.

The only size where we really have anything like a \u0022complete\u0022 set of parts is the original 1.25-meter size, all the others could do with expansion. 1.25-meter now has two jets, the Rapier, a bunch of LFO rockets, three solids, and one nuke, the other sizes only have a couple of rocket options each (plus the 0.625-meter ion), no jets, no nukes, no solids, no nothing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I\u0027m optimistic at this point.

It doesn\u0027t require oxygen since all it does is heat air to produce thrust, which would work well on Eve and Jool since they have plenty of air (Duna would be tenuous). Their downside was that they were heavy (requiring an entire reactor to be housed in the fuselage, didn\u0027t produce a lot of thrust, and the direct cycle engine spewed radioactive gas and the indirect cycle was complicated to make. I\u0027ve seen Porkjet design this engine, and I\u0027m sorely tempted to try it out, but I\u0027m worried downloading too many mods will make the game unplayable on every patch day, so I\u0027m trying to stay away from parts mods.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd who is to say duna eve and jool don\u0027t have oxygen this isn\u0027t a perfect model of our system after all. The way I see it for all the ram they take jets only work in two places with out dynamic loading this is a frankly unacceptable waste of resources and 64 bit is no panacea as many users run older machines (6 gigs here). Any way back on topic the only thing in the way of this I see is the imaginary assumption that planet\u0027s in the kerbin system have analogs in the real solar system and that they must mimic them.
