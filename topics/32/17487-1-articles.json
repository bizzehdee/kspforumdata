A single manned one for landing, and a 3 man one (with only 2 pilots at liftoff) which will be the main orbiter...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, you launch for the rockets into an orbit around a planet, land the single manned one, and then take off and rendezvous, then EVA the kerbal and blast back to Kerbin with the orbiter.. This way the orbit saves fuel from the landing, and the lander saves fuel from the going home...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIve already been practicing this procedure (with lower powered rockets) on Minmus, and it worked beautifully \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Of course, my lander will not be a pod with 2 RCS tanks and legs \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E It will need to have power to return to a stable orbit, and rendezvous with the orbiter...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMind you, I still haven\u0027t been able to rendezvous around Kerbin, only minmus due to its low gravity, and a 5km space walk \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
