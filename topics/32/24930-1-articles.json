I don\u0027t know if Forumocalypse wiped out the dev journals as well, but all we have is information on some flags and mention of a scene loader (which... whatever that is). I don\u0027t know if I missed a lot, but I do sort of miss the more detailed, consolidated older way of relaying information (and the devs were more active on the forum too). I\u0027ve heard rumors of a new memory management part loader so I can stop crashing every hour... any truth to this rumor? Might it be in 0.20?

While at GDC I spoke to the engineers over at Unity, and described the issues we\u0027ve been having with memory crashes. Apparently during the loading of a scene, the new scene, and the old scene can be together in memory for a split second. We use some fairly large and memory intensive scenes, such as the flight scene and the tracking station. In those cases, even a partial load of another scene on top of the existing one can push your memory usage past the 32 bit \u0022Wall\u0022. If that happens, the game will crash to desktop. It\u0027s unfortunately fairly common for computers with 2gb of ram, or ones that are running 32 bit operating systems. The new scene transition system will look ahead to the level being loaded. If the incoming level is the same as the old, the loader will keep the re-used textures and models in memory instead of wiping them. In the case of a scene to scene transition, like when going from flight to the tracking station, the loader will instead flush the memory completely and load the new level. This will clean up any memory and allows the garbage collector to do its job efficiently. On top of that, the new loader runs asynchronously in a co-routine, instead of attempting to do the level load in one frame. The benefit of this, is that Unity can continue to run its normal operations while the game loads. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entry.php/244-Map-Filtering%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWe will also have some filtering options for Tracking Station as well\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
