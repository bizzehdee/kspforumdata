So far we\u0027ve just got hitchhiker cans and the various command pods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Inflatable habitats. Of course, these are always good, light and compact, good for stations and bases. I\u0027m not sure but maybe they would not be so great when inflated under thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ring segments. Obviously you don\u0027t have to worry about it right now, but even if you just want to pretend, there could be 1/6 circle segments which can be docked in orbit. Maybe even smaller, but so far you can only lock things to 1/6 circle intervals unless you do precise manual movement which isn\u0027t always compatible with other parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Shuttle passenger segments and plane passenger fuselages. For large groups of passengers to go around Kerbin, into LKO or maybe to a station on the mun or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Passages between modules. No longer do Kerbals need to EVA to move from place to place. They can float all about your station, base or ship by passageway. If ring habitats are too extravagent, these could be used instead, if only to assist movement around actual artificial G habitations. If so they should come in a variety of circle sizes, ie. have one for 10m radius, one for 20, one for 30 and one for 60.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Longer hitchhiker containers for more crew, multi-level interiors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it would be neat if in the future interiors could be edited so that you could fit, say, one piece of science equipment in a hitchhiker container sized habitat. This could tie in well with research, Kerbals could take samples to the habitat to have them tested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust some thoughts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mushroomman","CreatedById":236,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T05:08:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would like some smaller crewtanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frostiken","CreatedById":1837,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T05:09:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like some \u0027basic\u0027 modules for bases, but I wouldn\u0027t mind a more fleshed-out pack for DLC.
