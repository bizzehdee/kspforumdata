It seems that 90% of the time, pressing SPACE absolutely does not orient my kerbal to the camera view. On the rare occasion where I can seem to get my kerbal oriented towards my ship, I\u0027ll thrust forward, and he incomprehensibly will rotate back to his previous direction before thrusting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has been very frustrating. My Kerbal is stuck on EVA, and I can\u0027t seem to get him closer than about 150m to the ship before my inability to orient and thrust the direction I want causes him to miss the ship entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I missing some trick? I\u0027m gentle as as I can be, and I\u0027ve been trying for hours.

For example in orbital mode he naturaly orients with his head pointing at the normal vector of the orbit makeing him appear standing up in relation to the prograde/retrograde vector. You can forcably rotate him but any movement input will just cause him to realign to where he wants to be. You can cycle through camera modes (V) and try to get a more favorable view but its not always possible to get exactly what you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll need to get used to useing the up/down controls (shift/ctl) to help you reach your target in additon to the standard forward/back/left/right as in most sitiations you cant get a good angle to just thrust strait at your target and get there. just go slow and accept that your controls are in relation to a fixed plane. Is the spacecraft above where your kerbal is looking? thrust up a bit so it drifts parralel to his direction of travle. Dont go too fast because you\u0027ll have to thrust down later to counter the movement and you\u0027ll overshoot if you go too fast.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JScott","CreatedById":125664,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T00:44:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022parameciumkid\u0022 data-cite=\u0022parameciumkid\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt seems you have a bug which is making the Kerbal get confused about the direction of the camera.
