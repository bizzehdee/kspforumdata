Despite the bugs, I was enjoying my career mode in 1.02 and was FINALLY getting my act together to get a mining/refueling operation set up on Minmus. With random things exploding for no good reason--and radiators that don\u0027t seem intuitive or, from my observations, functional--it\u0027s rather taken the wind out of my sails. I\u0027m too far along in my current career mode game to willingly scrap it in favour of starting anew, but it seems that that\u0027s precisely what I might have to do given that it seems nothing I\u0027ve sent into space before 1.04 will come back safely now and, indeed, may self-destruct due to no fault of my own apart from my inability to predict the future when it comes to somewhat drastic changes made to Kerbal physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also read that aerobreaking/aerocapturing is, if not dead, then severely crippled, which is a shame. I really liked that aspect of interplanetary travel. I understand that some people want this game to be perfectly realistic, but you know, I think there are probably other games for that. Kerbin is not Earth. The solar system in KSP is not the same as our own. Why should we assume Kerbin is in the same type of universe we inhabit? I don\u0027t think the physics in the game have to EXACTLY copy our own--and yes, I know they don\u0027t, yet, but the calls for \u0022realism\u0022 I see plastered across these forum pages seems rather extreme in a game where the entire race shares the same last name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat it all boils down to for me is that what kept me playing this game from early on in the alphas up until now has always been learning from my own mistakes to create something better and to set challenges that I work towards completing. The way aerodynamics in particular keeps changing with, seemingly, every patch, however, makes this nearly impossible for me to accomplish. I rather wish I hadn\u0027t had auto-update enabled so I could have kept my 1.02 KSP intact to at least finish out my career before having to learn the basics all over again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T03:05:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEr, it\u0027s supposed to do that... well kina....\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
