The added height just below the RCS tank and pod at the top gives them enough extra force when swaying in the wind that it\u0027s enough to start snapping the struts on your tanks at the bottom because the rocket isn\u0027t rigid enough. The combination of the extra height and extra mass from the taller adapter, no matter how insignificant they may seem, are in fact perfectly matched to hit a destructive resonance on your rocket. It\u0027s purely down to your design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t physics fun?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I did a second test to confirm, I had the same setup as in my previous test but added a couple small batteries to get the mass up to 0.1 instead of 0.08. I got the exact same result as with just swapping adapters, a single hardpoint failed dropping a tank\u002Bengine stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there you go, mystery solved. The extra height and mass, even if seemingly insignificant, breaks your rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-08T23:21:05Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2013 11:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Johnno\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"strongest_2hu","CreatedById":67784,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-08T23:42:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe short adapter is terrible and always clips into the stuff around it and you should never use it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ASnogarD","CreatedById":70903,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-09T11:19:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst up Johnno , thanks for taking so much time to try help out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree the adaptor issue is due to height, but not because its is swaying in the wind (I dont believe wind is even in the game), I believe its more a force that cascades from the top of your craft downwards adding more force to the connections in a unrealistic simulation of taller rockets exert more downward pressure on its components.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnrealistic because it seems to have \u0027tiers\u0027 of height, and doesnt seem to take weight into consideration.... basically if you cross into a new height \u0027tier\u0027 you will get more pressure no matter what structure or how heavy the structure was that got you to that height.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would explain why the connections were \u0027fine\u0027 when I added 13.5 tonnes extra to the craft in a manner that did not raise the overall height of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did strut the small grey tanks to the orange tanks before but while that stopped the engines from doing the samba on the launch pad, it also caused the stack to fall off on the pad, so I removed those struts... I spent a few hours trying to fix the design without resorting to massive strutting of everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelieve me I wasnt like 10 min design and toss my hands up and come rant, I spent hours... add struts here, launch, observe the effect, remove strut if ineffective, repeat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think Squad will either have to strengthen the connections the decouplers / structural pylon (engine mount part) to unrealistic proportions to offset the 1 connection limitation, or work out how to allow for multiple connections (docking ports dont count)... and Squad definitely has to fix the connections between components. A Rocket doesnt typically act like a tower of plates a waiter/waitress is hauling off to get washed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould be nice if Squad could also add a method to watch replays of launches, and visually show stresses on the craft as it flies so the player could look at the replay and study why the craft fails... getting told a link failed between a orange tank and some other tank on a rocket with something like 18 orange tanks doesnt help that much. Think of a colour overlay over the craft in flight that shows green for structurally intact going through yellow, orange , red colours showing the crafts stress points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENote: This isnt a rant at Squad, the physics are a mess due to PhysX which is just meant to simulate debris in explosions, not calculate Newtonian laws in real time. The part connection issue is also understandable as I dont think Squad intended us to make such large unusual designs... the connections would be mostly fine (except the wobbly rocket syndrome) if we stuck to standard rocket design doctrines.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
