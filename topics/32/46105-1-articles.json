Sure, in the end it all comes down to building rockets, launching them, flying them to other planets/moons and landing. And with time all of that gets relatively routine (or so I\u0027m told \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ) But - and it\u0027s a big but - there are so many ways of doing that and so much else you can do along the way. Some of it will be functional but a lot of it will be \u0027just because it looks cool\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA couple of personal examples. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding on the Mun is a fairly early milestone for a lot of KSP players and there a numerous guides out there for building a single rocket that will get you to the Mun and back, Apollo style. What you definitely don\u0027t need is to build a space station in Kerbin orbit, another one in Munar orbit, a nuclear powered shuttle to ferry crew between the two, a 5 kerbal lander for transporting crew from the Munar orbit station to the surface and finally, a simple transporter ship to get the crew up to Kerbin orbit. Likewise, you don\u0027t need (not yet anyway), communication satellites in orbit around the Mun and Kerbin to make sure the whole system hangs together. You don\u0027t need to send out your kerbals on a low orbit Munar reconnaisance flight to scout for interesting landing sites, or to have a cluster of navigation beacons waiting to be dropped in from orbit to mark those landing sites. (Actually that bit was before you could plant flags so its genuinely not required any more \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you can build all of those if you like for no other reason than \u0027I think it looks cool to have this complete Munar transport chain in place, so I\u0027m going to build it. And then do the same for Minmus \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this is small beer compared to some projects on these forums.
