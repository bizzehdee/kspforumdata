I don\u0027t want 1.0 KSP\u0027s system to be made larger. It\u0027s too late for that. People are already used to the toy scale and changing that would be immensely disruptive. All game balance is based upon the toy solar system and thus the entire game would have to be rebalanced.\n\nThat said, for KSP 2.0, I would love a full scale solar system (but still with the Kerbal planets! Even keep some of the unique-to-kerbol quirks of the system!). RealSolarSystem and RO have demonstrated that it is practical, gameplay wise. It would make the educational use of KSP extended, and present a more accurate depiction of real spaceflight.\n\nThis would also entail a few more major changes. For one, the entire game\u0027s parts would basically be made and designed from scratch. They should still be Kerbal parts of their own design instead of exact duplicates of real world rocket engines. The fact that you don\u0027t have much margin for error in many things compared to the toy solar system means that a bit of fuel diversity may be acceptable. I don\u0027t want full-blown realism stuff, that would be insane for the Kerbal Space Program. We\u0027re still dealing with little green men!\n\nRobotics should definitely be a major part of a KSP 2.0.\n\nScience should be its own distinct and unique branch of the game, much as building and flying are. Say you were to take a biological sample to Duna, and expose it. Instead of a readout, there would be a window popup with a view into the container showing exactly what is happening. And what happens would be determined not be a preset science defininitions config, but by a set of physical paramaters for the, say, Mystery Goo, and the actual environment. Taking into account nearby rocks or vegetation, the unique atmospheric composition of each planet, its exposure to light, the gravity, and soil composition if it is surface based. Material samples would be a simulation of what the various materials would actually do in the situation. Recording the results (which would be numbers on a sheet, with an optional box for you to write a description of what is happening) would give science.\n\nLife: both in animal, plant, and microscopic forms, should be a part of the game. On Kerbin you would see strange kerbal cows and deer and bunnies and the birds that are always chirping at the space center. Trees and shrubs and all that jazz. Pickable flowers. Flowers may be picked for science, as well as tree leaves and grass samples. On Kerbin this wouldn\u0027t be too groundbreaking, though if you brought the samples with you to Duna and exposed them there, then you\u0027d get science. If you also brought a Kerbal Bunny with you, you would get science and loose reputation, along with some of your own personal happiness.\n\nLife on other planets is necessarily limited. Duna may have a few very very rare areas where microbial life can be found. Finding this stuff would be breaking news for your space program. Next up is Laythe. Laythe is right in the radiation fields of Jool (which I will mention later), so not much life can exist. In the oceans there are, however, small fish, and certainly plenty of microbial species all around in a diverse ecosystem. But all of that pales in comparison to the hidden treasure-trove: Vall. Vall\u0027s treasure is hidden underground in an ocean. An explorable one. Whilst microbes can be found living in the ice, an entire underwater ecosystem to rival Kerbin\u0027s is underwater in an underground ocean. There would be alien sea creatures of varying designs. I\u0027m sure the artist in charge would have plenty of fun designing the various species on Laythe, Kerbin, and Vall. The door could also be left open to planet modders, who may want gigantic dinosaurs built to terrorize your kerbals and spacecrafts on modded planets. Certainly something that would be great for an interstellar expansion. Indeed, some life on Vall and Kerbin may be hazardous to your spaceships. Kerbal tiger-like things may try to attack roaming Kerbals. If you\u0027ve PO\u0027d a KerBull, he might want to ram into your spacecraft. Fighting back will invariably involve a humane form of stun-gun.\n\nYou could also abduct creatures. Say you had a big cargo bay that could be pressurized whenever needed. You could lure a Rhinoceros into the cargo bay, shut it, and then take it to Laythe to see if Rhinos can survive there. When it dies, you lose reputation and smile at a job well done.\n\nKerbals may have some kind of health system, tied to hunger and environmental effects. Walking around, overheated and trying to run on the high gravity of Eve may lower the max health of a Kerbal. Colliding with things lowers health, which slowly replenishes itself back to the maximum. Medicine can be taken both to raise the maximum and to heal faster. When colliding with things too much to the point of zero health, the Kerbal poofs into dust. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) If however is is not eating food, his or her health drops as well. A starving Kerbal does not die, it just hibernates. Closes its eyes and dreams of a time when it can have snacks again.\n\nAnother problem to deal with is radiation. Radiation lowers both the maximum health and the health of a Kerbal. Kerbals can die of radiation sickness, but this is rare unless you\u0027ve had them hanging on the side of a nuclear reactor for the past two months. Nuclear engines can emit radiation, as does the sun. The Sun itself however may be quite calm and never release solar flares or CMEs. Just the constant solar wind. Planets have magnetic fields that deal with radiation. One of the scientific instruments may be a geiger counter as well as a magnetometer. The geiger counter can be turned on to click based on the amount of radiation. Crashing nuclear rockets into planets also causes sites of radiation until it can be cleaned up (which can only happen on Kerbin). THis brings us to the next and final major feature:\n\nCivilization. Kerbals, now that they are on a full scale solar system, surely musn\u0027t be living underground for their entire lives. In fact, they get procedurally generated cities, perhaps with a few landmarks custom made. Crashing into a building will destroy it. Luckily no one will die as a result because everyone will have evacuated (an in-game text assures us this). Crashing into a building will severely lose reputation and funds. Cars also drive around cities. As it happens they are all airtight. This means you can grab a car with The Claw, then take it with you to space. Launching from the intersection of a road in a major city? What\u0027s the big deal! Urban Space Program, right? As long as you don\u0027t crash into anything on your way up.\n\nThe space center will be near a city, but not too close to it because that would be dangerous. Roads and train lines go between the cities. There\u0027s also a train station at KSC. You could grab a train into space if you wanted to. And a parking lot with cars. Cars are affected by explosions, and can also be stolen and driven by your astronauts. Kerbals wander around the space center when nothing is on the launchpad, and they are physically identical to astronauts except for their clothing and the fact that they walk around with their own A.I. They talk to other Kerbals. They may even try to talk to astronauts, who may or may not respond based upon courage and stupidity.\n\nKerbals also chatter a lot. They speak backwards spanish phrases to mission control, but you can only hear them if you mouse over their IVA portrait. They have a few idle animations. Every thing a Kerbal can do is also animated. Wheels don\u0027t just pop back, a Kerbal has to take a wheel out of hammerspace and fit it to the rover. Kerbals take out a little jar and scoop it through the ground when collecting surface samples. They look around when doing EVA reports."},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-16T13:12:24Z","Content":"So for me the zeroth thing is a new engine. Unity\u0027s done pretty well but a game engine designed for games on a planetary scale could be so much better.\n\nThen the first thing I want is much richer and more detailed celestial bodies. Now I don\u0027t realistically expect KSP 2\u0027s planets to have the same kind of detail as smaller worlds in \u0022AAA\u0022 games, but it would be nice to be able to wander around for a bit and actually feel there\u0027s interesting detail to look at, and it to actually look like a real surface not a textured polygon. This is the main thing that I feel demands a new game engine.\n\nThe familiar planets and moons. Maybe joined by new ones, maybe changed quite a bit, but still recognisable.\n\nA reconsideration of the system scale. Now I don\u0027t think real scale is good for gameplay, the chief problem is launches to orbit take a long time. But I think Kerbin and the system could stand to be enlarged somewhat.\n\nReal Science, combining a much broader range of real scientific instruments with methods of science collection that are more than just click-to-get. For example a seismometer could require sitting on a stationary platform for a few months, while a barometer should be run as the craft ascends or descends through the atmosphere. And instead of just run experiment, get points, perhaps a system that models the use of experimental data to learn about the planet and allows the player to gain by having results from different experiments combined.\n\nA more procedural approach to craft building, allowing a rocket stage to be a single tank of a player-chosen size. (Though probably with coarse, \u0022chunky\u0022 increments compared to Procedural Parts).\n\nA logical and modest extension in terms of complexity and to an extent realism. I don\u0027t like Realism Overhaul, it\u0027s over-complicated for the gameplay benefits, but some of its ideas could have a place in the stock game. For example KSP 2 might have a few more types of rocket fuel, but not the hundred-odd fuels and tiny variations in fuel:ox ratio that RO gives.\n\nSingle-player and multiplayer game modes.\n\nAnd finally, and perhaps above all else, **a purchase price**. \u0022Free to play\u0022 needs to go die in a fire."},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-16T13:34:08Z","Content":"There are a few things I would like to see:\n\n- More planets in the Kerbol system, to include a binary planetary system, ringed planets, etc.\n- Two neighboring star systems - doesn\u0027t have to be anything fancy.  \n\n    - I\u0027d like to see a binary star system.

Possibly a little bigger kerbal system, but a few nearby star systems would not be out of place, especially if we can move into the future technology wise. \n\n3.

Better graphics, not necessarily more realistic. I still love the cartoonish looks of the worlds and the kerbals, but just better. \n\n5. Good performance offcourse... Whole new engine / something ... \n\n6. A fully scalable and tuneable difficulty seemlessly adding more and more features/complications. Like antennarange, coverage and link requirement, autopiloting, Lifesupport, costs and requirements and what not. \n\n7. Less micromanagement in regards to eg. collecting science from every instrument. Or have trained kerbals do it automatically (possible with class requirement). Let me designate a primary research station/base and whether they transmit only transmittable stuff or everything or keep everything til they get home to it. Dependent on the craft being well designed offcourse. But some missions should be entirely manageable from the base and with good planning. You should still be able to micromanage everything, if you want to... but you should also be able to concentrate on what you think is fun instead. \n\n8. Better management of multiple concurrent missions. Either through some sort of timeshenanigans, that you can do each mission sequentially even though there happening at the same time (for manual control) or just the game quickly determining whether you\u0027ve designed the craft appropriately and mission planned well enough for it to succeed and end up at where you expect it to be (no physics messing it up) with expected ressource usage/loss (like on rails). \n\n9. Better management for large spaceprograms. \n\n10. Ai competitors? Replaceable by human competitors? \n\n11. A little story mode wouldn\u0027t hurt?\n\n12. More karbal esque/scaled realism, but still scalable for the player. \n\n13. Fully moddable offcourse, since people have different tastes and would like to tweak all sorts of things. Play with real looking planets and ships and what not... But the base game should have the best of all the mods in it from the get go and in the game\u0027s particular style. \n\n14. Better audio or in the sense of Kerbals could talk a little more ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) Preferably not just random chatter...
