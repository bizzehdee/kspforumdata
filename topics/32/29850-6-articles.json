That isn\u0027t a \u0022Lousy excuse\u0022 as you so eloquently put it. It\u0027s 100% the unanimous truth. I\u0027m sorry that someone might expect an alpha game to be bug free. That makes that person the fallible party here. That said, the people who will make useful bug reports already know this. They don\u0027t need to be told and they are also not the ones getting threads locked.\u003Cp\u003EIf your only report is this is broken/doesn\u0027t work right Etc. Then that is information that, for all intents and purposes, is useless. Furthermore, if you have any MODs installed, any report you might make about the game other than the functionality of the MOD system it self, is void.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you ever heard any dev using the alpha excuse? Also, I don\u0027t expect the game to be bug free, but some users will expect the game to at least run, which is not the case as seeing from some bug reports. Those people are left stranded (specially Steam ones) since KSP doesn\u0027t keep old \u0022stable\u0022 versions just in case for those users. Also, how can you measure the usefulness of a bug report in an alpha game that can have all sort of issues, even ones that have no relation with the core game at all? What makes user A\u0027s reports better than user B\u0027s simple because A knows that game is alpha? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for MODS, a major criticism. The game should be able to be mutually exclusive from mods. The fact that mods that have absolutely nothing to do with a specific bug are the cause of said bug is left to wonder why nothing of that sort was implemented yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T01:34:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022hoojiwana\u0022 data-cite=\u0022hoojiwana\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat are your thoughts on the topic Kasper?

It\u0027s kind of hard for me to judge since I never got on board the whole Minecraft train. On the subject of the bugs being labelled as \u0027kerbal\u0027 I think that\u0027s just an expression of acceptance that not all bugs will get fixed immediatly, and this is a very true fact. Remember the game is in alpha and that that is not a lame excuse of some sorts. During the alpha stage features get added, once a game goes into beta no more features are added and the process of eliminating bugs begins. Once the beta is complete the game will be released.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was also a big discussion about entitlement etcetera. There is (in my humble opinion) a big difference between a suggestion or a bug report and someone being entitled and those should not be confused. Entitlement comes into play when someone thinks they have some power that they really haven\u0027t. A suggestion for example is exactly that: a suggestion, no strings attached. Some people forget this and demand that something be implemented or fixed, just because they bought the game. This is ofcourse not only not right but also impossible since a lot of people have a lot of opinions on for example a feature. Entitlement is a display of egocentric behaviour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll just leave it at that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shrike42","CreatedById":61104,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T01:35:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI originally sent this to Sputnik-1 as the thread went on a tangent, and he (or she) encouraged me to post it here.

Growing pains, basically. I can see you\u0027re worried about the community tanking and ruining your enjoyment of the game, but take heart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see KSP becoming anywhere near as bad as the minecraft forums, the critical mass that MC achieved is almost impossible to replicate, and it\u0027s a self-reinforcing feedback loop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it\u0027s a cult of personality. Notch and Jeb can do no wrong, death to the heretic! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad\u0027s unintentionally headed off that part, since they didn\u0027t start it as a one-man operation and keep a relatively low profile. No one is specifically defending Nova or harvester, but they are defending the group. Distributed out, things are less intense. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other barrier is the learning curve in KSP. Even with the tutorials and wiki and Youtube videos, there\u0027s so much that can be done in KSP that it\u0027s hard for people to defend specific behaviors in construction that they may have never seen. That\u0027s a bit of a filter to help make growth more reasonable, and to get players to trust each other (with good advice and help) even more than the mods and devs, who can\u0027t possibly keep up with every request themselves. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, build that community. KSP is in a prime position to hold on to the spark you love, and as long as we set good examples, we can keep things positive for everyone and not end up like the MC forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KinkyFerrets","CreatedById":33390,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T01:38:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MR4Y\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MR4Y\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Also, how can you measure the usefulness of a bug report in an alpha game that can have all sort of issues, even ones that have no relation with the core game at all?

Furthermore, the simplicity of the game did not give much cause for huge divisions. The forums were, as a result, more peaceful and could be better in tune with the issues at hand. This made developer-community interaction easier, too, and moderation wasn\u0027t too hard. But things have changed, now that KSP has grown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the forums are not as close knit since the community so so large. The concentration of the experts is much lower as well. This has made communication between devs and users much harder, and the differences have driven a wedge into the KSP community. New bugs in ambitious updates, plugins like mechjeb, and the difficulty of moderating a large, diverse community have all amplified this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo fix this, first the users can help by doing things like ensuring they don\u0027t repeat an old topic by searching, listening to arguments and understanding them before jumping in, and detaching themselves emotionally from their gripes. This will make things much smoother and easier for moderators and other users. Also, it might also be a good idea to try and research gameplay concepts yourself to help you along your way. It\u0027s rewarding!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, the moderators can play a big role too. By avoiding curt and unprofessional responses and kneejerk reactions, the stigma of an oppressive moderation team will evaporate. Since I also would consider the stream under the jurisdiction of the community team as well, I think that needs some work as well to make sure it makes users as informed as possible. After the departure of Damion, it had fell on some hard times. Sure, transitions are never easy, but regardless, I personally think Skunky is not the best choice for the streamer, with all due respect. He has been with the community for a long time and has played a huge role in it, but I don\u0027t think he is the best fit for that post. I do like the idea of having prominent independent streamers getting slots, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the developers. Really, my only advice would be to make tutorials one of the top priorities. If a robust tutorial system is implemented, then it is possible that we can regain the understanding we all once had with each other. Knowledge of the subject matter makes communication with other players and devs easier and even reduces the necessary frequency of these encounters because less is more when things are understood. There are certainly other important features, but tutorials should be up there with them too so that players can learn and create a friendly, helpful and intelligent community here on the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEveryone has to do their part though , or else it\u0027ll all crumble anyway.
