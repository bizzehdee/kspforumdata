challenge, to make things go up the hard way) and so my station, naturally, was in a retrograde orbit.\u00A0 I think it was a 200x150km elliptical orbit (I didn\u0027t care too much about making my orbits neat, so I just got them close to nice numbers), and had plenty of things attached.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I stopped playing that save for a month or two while I focused on other things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo when I came back, I looked at my map view, saw I had a space station already, and so I planned to build a new one (having forgotten the first was retrograde.\u00A0 If I\u0027d have remembered that, I would\u0027ve put the new one up backwards as well), with an orbit of 200x150km with two intersect points, so that they\u0027d always be on opposite sides from one another, and at no risk of collision.\u00A0 I built my station in the best of ways known to 0.90: I built it all on the launchpad and yanked it up to space on a massive donut of fire, so I wouldn\u0027t have to waste my time with docking maneuvers.\u00A0 It went up fully crewed, had provisions for docking, and ended up in space without much fuss.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, I get to the point of finalizing my orbit, checking my map to see that both stations were on opposite sides of Kerbin, and decided to sit back and relax.\u00A0 Figured I\u0027d sit there and watch the random space junk whizz by.\u00A0 Which is when I started remembering what save I was on, as most of the stuff I saw was really moving quite quickly as I saw it, and was hurtling in my direction against the planet\u0027s rotation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd after enjoying a near-miss from a mainsail-double-orange booster that had been discarded, I saw something large approaching quite... well, rather fast.\u00A0 I suppose the only reason I got an impact out of it was that the two stations are very large parts, and thereby when physics sputtered its way through \u0022There\u0027s about 2200 parts that just loaded in, along with 1700 parts we were already watching, and they\u0027re going to crash\u0022 a couple frames must have had bits of station colliding.\u00A0 Got a big explosion and a lot more space junk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I figured I\u0027d go try to rescue at least some of the Kerbals.\u00A0 Sent up a rescue shuttle, got fragged near rendezvous by retrograde space trash.\u00A0 Sent up a second rescue shuttle, got fragged near rendezvous by prograde space trash.\u00A0 Stopped playing that one because there was no way to clean up that mess other than deleting way more debris than I wanted to do just to make a rescue mission possible, and for significantly less Kerbals returned safely, because there were a lot of Kerbals in labs and hitchhiker capsules.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, I learned from that one:\u00A0 Learn the orbital rules
