If you want an orbital mechanics sandbox that\u0027s simplified enough to be quite an entertaining game, but still requires you to learn a lot about classical mechanics (assuming you don\u0027t know all that stuff by heart already), then KSP is really great.

Halfway through my vacation, I decided to pick up KSP on Christmas Day, and started playing. A week later, I was kicking myself for not buying KSP at the START of my 2-week vacation so I could have had another week to play before going back to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I have over 1000 hours in the game, and still play for hours every night.

Here\u0027s what I did, which I would suggest:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. Start with Training. Do everything from \u0022getting started\u0022 to \u0022science basics\u0022. Just to prepare you, that\u0027s an evening\u0027s play right there, maybe 2. The game is pretty complicated but the training scenarios are great at taking you through it. But it will take some time. That\u0027s a good thing because you\u0027ll be ready to go afterwards.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Start a Career game. It will gate the parts you have to work with and the things you do. There will be missions for you to perform and you will unlock more rocket parts as you proceed. This will guide you through learning more about the game. Do NOT start with sandbox; in sandbox you have all the parts to work with at the start and it will overwhelm you.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. Once you\u0027ve puttered around on your home planet for a few days, go back to the Training missions and do To the Mun! through From the Mun. This will teach you how to, well, go to the moon. You\u0027ll then be able to play with your home planet\u0027s 2 moons for a while before you need to learn more.\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. At this point you might be ready to start getting some basic mods. (For me, this was 3 weeks after picking up the game.) Mods run the full spectrum from adding additional useful info (like putting stuff on the pilot screen you normally have to flip to map mode to get), to making purely cosmetic changes (like \u0022mission control\u0022 radio background noise while you play), to adding new features (like resources to mine and ways to build moonbases and space stations).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m 48 years old and have been gaming since the dawn of digital games. In fact, I\u0027ve been in game design for 20 years professionally. KSP is a unique masterpiece.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-29T23:36:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223367083\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022174407\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221525021074\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022188493\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Soapstone\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Soapstone said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have seen a ton of mixed reviews about this game online, some say it is great, others saying it is terrible.
