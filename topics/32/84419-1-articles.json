A rescue party set out in a 3 seat capsule with one seat empty. But, my rocket-building and piloting of the time being rather poor, after a successful rendezvous and Jeb\u0027s EVA transfer the rescue ship didn\u0027t have enough delta-v and could only get to a little closer orbit to Kerbin. So a third party, with a hitchhiker\u0027s container and a mighty ship, finally brought all three back, only to find that they didn\u0027t have enough parachutes and crash-landed on Kerbin.
