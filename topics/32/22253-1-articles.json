It starts climbing, but then I notice that one of the main engines heat is rising as fast as the rocket. As I frantically lower thrust to lower the heat, the engine hits max heat and \u0027splodes starting a spectacular chain reaction. I immediately start SPAS (SPacebar Abort Sequence) and when the debris clears, the capsule and 3 of the 8 lander engines are still attached as it spins wildly. I continue the SPAS and the capsule separates with the parachute deployed. Just as the song reaches its triumphant conclusion, the parts that were still left started to hit the ground in a crescendo of \u0027splosions like a berserk storm giant on the kettle drums and the parachute opened saving the crew.
