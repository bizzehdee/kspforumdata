Basically looking at the current feature list we need to look at our work in general and consider working on polish, bugfixing and balance in certain areas of the game instead of some of the new features we\u0027re working in. Going specific instead of going wide. We don\u0027t plan on stopping work at 1.0 at all, so we\u0027re maybe better off leaving some stuff for 1.1 and getting to work on the specifics of what can make the existing stuff in the game truly shine.\n\nWe\u0027ve decided that the next release will be 1.0 because it accomplishes the goals we\u0027ve set up with the development of KSP from the very beginning, my question to you is whether you\u0027d prefer we try and add more features, or focus more on things like the aero overhaul, bugfixing and balance?"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Tiddles","CreatedById":124560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T04:16:00Z","Content":"I\u0027d probably like a bit of 60%-40%\n\nAdd the stuff you want to add first, and then fix it up.

There are going to be plenty of out-there scenarios and situations that won\u0027t get covered in testing, inevitably, so there very well could still be balance issues after 1.0. The same goes for bugs too, but it\u0027s best to squash as many of those as possible at every opportunity. \n\nAs for the feature set...I dunno, of course it is your call but you will get bugs introduced with these new features no matter what. You will need to fix bugs after 1.0, and if you hold back features until 1.1, you will need to fix bugs after 1.1 as well. Plus, again with the balancing, once you introduce new features you will need to re-evaluate the balance of parts again. \n\nTo me, it seems like pulling off a Band-Aid. Do it all at once and get the pain out of the way, or do it slowly and feel the pain the whole time. I would tear it off quickly, if it were up to me. (I also guarantee I\u0027m the only one of this opinion, so you should probably go with what everyone else says.)"},{"CreatedByName":"AbhChallenger","CreatedById":106911,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T04:42:12Z","Content":"Remember that 1.0 will be the version reviewers get their hands on.

If this could extend to water landings not being extremely dangerous for multi-part objects that would be awesome.\n\nAll known bugs need to be squershed... as well as those memory leaks. An optimization pass would be excellent.\n\nPromised new features should be polished up and done. Personally what\u0027s already been announced is more than enough. Though...

I\u0027m personally tired of restarting saves, to experience the new features.\n\n2. This is the version that will be judged/reviewed. If the game is released without all your planned features, or you introduce new features later that break a save game, it wont be nice for players (who are not into early access). When I say \u0022break save\u0022, I mean new features that would require you to start a new career mode to experience them. If for example re-entry heat comes in in 1.1, this would break saves, because people planning a re-entry without the appropriate heat shielding would not be able to continue. Even adding new parts, to some extent breaks things, because you don\u0027t get get to structure your career to take this node in the tree into account.\n\nHaving said all that, if you are going to persist with the idea of adding features later, then definitely do optimizations and bug fixes for 1.0. My son was not able to play KSP .90 simply because his computer didn\u0027t have enough RAM (4GB) on 32 bit architecture. I\u0027ve since got him a new computer, but that was a good computer (with an old OS), and should have run the game."},{"CreatedByName":"sherkaner","CreatedById":130303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T04:48:57Z","Content":"I\u0027d rather see you focus on getting both the features and refinement, even if it meant significantly pushing off the release timeframe for 1.0. As wonderful as KSP is, I keep looking forward to it really being a \u0022finished\u0022 game that has both the breadth and depth to invest time in in career mode and not have it feel somewhat less than totally satisfying because it\u0027s \u0022not all there\u0022 yet.\n\n**That said**, since you guys clearly have a nearer-term 1.0 release goal that\u0027s forcing some compromises, I\u0027d absolutely be more excited about getting the features you have really worked out than adding a lot of new features. I think for a general audience coming into the game for the first time at 1.0 that would be the better choice as well. Better to have the the game feel very worked out for the features there currently and then add more breadth later. Particularly if you\u0027re talking about things like bug fixing, aero, tech tree/parts balancing, and well thought-out career contracts, I think those are exactly the things that you need to take KSP from a game that\u0027s \u0022very good for a pre-release\u0022 to something that could, in some sense, be considered \u0022done\u0022. Honestly, I\u0027d even extend that into getting the graphics looking generally less prototype-ish looking.\n\nIt will probably make more work for later, as I imagine some of the \u0022feature additions\u0022 may drive another big round of game balancing and refinement, but I still think you\u0027d be better served going that way.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-17T04:51:28Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2015 04:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sherkaner**"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T04:49:52Z","Content":"Bug fixes are important, but I think even moreso is getting the entire experience to gel better than it does. Currently KSP exists as a bunch of disparate features with little to no connective tissue between them (Asteroids and Science being some of the best examples). Pilots still feel extraneous, unmanned probes should be encouraged more (starting off the tech tree with unmanned pods would help this a bit). Kerbal experience seems tacked on. Et cetera, et cetera.\n\nUltimately I think more features should be added, but the real priority should be in making the existing features fit together better than they currently do. Of course, squashing bugs is also important. However, in my mind, the experience should come first. You can squash bugs as the opportunities to do so arise.\n\nP.S.
