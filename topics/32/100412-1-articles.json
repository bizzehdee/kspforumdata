Add an extra 500 m/s to the ship, and you can afford hovering in place for a minute.\n\nStart from a 30 km orbit and make a short deorbiting burn 1/3 to 1/2 orbits before the landing site. Wait until you\u0027re around 1/5 orbits from the landing site, and reduce the speed to 1000 m/s. After that, you have three goals: kill as much horizontal speed as possible, keep the descent rate at 100 m/s, and keep the landing site roughly the same. The final 1-2 km can be mostly vertical, using short high-thrust burns to keep the time to impact at 10-15 seconds. Once you\u0027re below 50-100 m, you\u0027ll probably want to switch to constant thrust and get the descent rate to 5-6 m/s.
