Hey - there\u0027s a growing number of us out there ;0)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyhow, that being the case or not, I\u0027ve run into a *real* issue now (beyond the earlier reported graphics issue of flickering/corrupt pixels while inside the hangars, and the general great difficulty in click-selecting objects). I\u0027m on my third restart in career mode. I\u0027ve just taken on a contract to\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTest Heat Shield (0.625m)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand the game won\u0027t recognise when I achieve the necessary requirements. In this challenge, I have to make between 1550.0m/s to 2,000m/s. Twice now I\u0027ve managed to re-enter from a high orbit, and all checks except speed are green. As the craft speeds up on re-entry, I\u0027m traveling at over 1600m/s and STILL the green tick won\u0027t appear. So I\u0027m stuck on two contracts, unable to clear this one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could re-start again :0/ but would like to know if there\u0027s a way I could help by maybe submitting stats or data, just in case these are things that can be ironed out? As I say, happy to accept it\u0027s under active development, but this game ain\u0027t free... ;0)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-23T13:55:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/171820-finglebob/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022171820\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/171820-finglebob/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@finglebob\u003C/a\u003E, and welcome!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreat to know you want to contribute with a bug report.

(palm smacks forehead): I completed the contract in the \u0027opposite order\u0027 i.e. instead of waiting to fall via re-entry, I just boosted up massively and hit the checkpoints on the upward trajectory. Contract completed!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, this does raise a slightly different and wider issue. This is a wonderful game. But it strikes me as unhelpful to word a contract and allow its execution open to wider interpretation, (obviously experimenting is a part of the fun ;0)) and yet fail in some way without it being clear why. To explain: if a contract MUST have such a narrow scope, then surely I shouldn\u0027t be getting green ticks for \u0027altitude\u0027 and \u0027in flight\u0027 IF the only way to meet the contract MUST be on the upward flight path.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot suggesting we want hand holding everywhere, just perhaps had I failed to meet terms like \u0027in flight\u0027 once I\u0027d passed AP, perhaps I\u0027d have arrived at the solution easier, and without assuming it was the game\u0027s fault (which in a way it kinda is).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI noted this the other day in an abandoned career. I had a contract to test a drone chute. So I just attached one to my command capsule. Despite having altitude and pressure set correctly, EVERY TIME I lifted off, the chute opened immediately. It was only once I attached it to the side of the craft i.e. a fuel tank, that I could complete that contract.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPromise not to go on at length every time ;0) Good to know how to report should I need.
