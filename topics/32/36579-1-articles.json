Presumably at least a few of them were installed in the right direction, however, meaning someone basically ignored the markings and/or orientation of the other sensors and just plugged them in without looking. This is, of course, why you should always double-check everything before ignition, be it a real-world rocket or a KSP one. Because sometimes someone somewhere on staff doesn\u0027t pay attention and puts a critical component into place wrong...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaiier","CreatedById":22833,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-10T18:44:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappens to me all the time, just escape, \u0022Restart Flight\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AnalogAddict","CreatedById":59758,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-10T18:46:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xaiier\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Xaiier\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHappens to me all the time, just escape, \u0022Restart Flight\u0022\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf only it were that easy IRL.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DChurchill","CreatedById":60282,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-10T18:48:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood thing for someone the Gulags are closed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Giggleplex777","CreatedById":29829,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-10T18:51:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESensors intalled upside down happens too often these days.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"joppiesaus","CreatedById":57698,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-10T18:51:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Every kerbal crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there is no escape button in real life, neither CTRL ALT DELETE.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-10T18:54:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow I don\u0027t feel so bad about getting the occasional decoupler installed wrong. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wayfare","CreatedById":52072,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-10T19:09:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeen there, done that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-10T19:16:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is already a thread for this in the proper place - The Junkyard.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
