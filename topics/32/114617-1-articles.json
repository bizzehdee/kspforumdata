Slowed to less than 250 m/s at 10 km or so, and opened the chutes without issue.

The drogue chutes say \u0022safe\u0022 earlier than that.

I just managed to get the chute to deploy. I had to keep my second to last stage connected, to keep things from getting too hot, apparently. The chute would be destroyed and it actually told me \u0027chute destroyed due to heat/too much airspeed\u0027. Wish it would specify which, especially considering these are \\*new\\* conditions we\u0027re dealing with. I LIKE how the chutes aren\u0027t all-powerful now....

What I did was have a more shallow (?) re-entry. Um. That is, I reduced my Pe. by a very small amount (to 68 some KM from a low Kerbin orbit of 70-ish), instead of a larger amount. Granted, that was because of a design flaw (very shallow margin for error) that left me with only a handfull of delta-v once I got into orbit.\n\nThis has worked twice, but I am not sure that it will be effective on other craft."},{"CreatedByName":"Dangerous_Beans","CreatedById":78059,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T01:03:46Z","Content":"what periapse are you using on re-entry?\n\nyou want to be aero-braking by going horizontally through the atmosphere, if you have the periapse too low you will have too steep a re-entry trajectory and end up going too fast too low."},{"CreatedByName":"rdwulfe","CreatedById":107690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T01:27:19Z","Content":"Periapsis around 30km"},{"CreatedByName":"Dangerous_Beans","CreatedById":78059,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T01:51:47Z","Content":"weird, 30km should be ok. try Lupus Irae\u0027s suggestion, and just graze the atmosphere a few times.\n\nanother suggestion, since it\u0027s a part from a mod, try updating the mod. the version you are using might have weird settings that don\u0027t work with the current aerodynamics."},{"CreatedByName":"rdwulfe","CreatedById":107690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T02:01:12Z","Content":"IT\u0027s the most updated version of the mod.

Leave it at 48km.\n\n2. Try not to be too aerodynamic about the entry. Definitely not the sharp end of the capsule first.If your reentry vehicle is a long tube, try entering sideways; if you can\u0027t, wobble around not to dart like an arrow straight ahead.\n\n3. The chute temperature has nothing to do with safety to open. The speed does. Sure if you burn your chute away, it\u0027s lost but anything short of filling up the heat bar has no impact on its performance and safety to open. 250m/s and you can deploy them.\n\n4. You have to try pretty hard to get a single capsule not to reach the safe 250m/s. But if you have other things attached - fuel tanks, engines etc, this may be much harder, especially if it forms aerodynamic shape.\n\n5. Also, don\u0027t aim for the mountains. The capsule usually slows down to the safe speed only around 3000-4000m, sometimes even lower. Even 300m is enough for the chutes to slow you down to the single-digit speeds from their 250m/s, but if you\u0027re aiming at a mountain of 3000m, you may not reach the 250m/s in time.\n\n6. Get Airbrakes. They work fine at all altitudes, 60km is the right altitude to deploy them."}]}
