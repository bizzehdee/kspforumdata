It is an obsolete calculating device about the same vintage as a slide rule. You do not see them much anymore because I wasn\u0027t kidding about them being obsolete. But educators on a budget might find this useful. Or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is printed piece of paper optimized to do one single mathematical calculation. It is a series of printed scale that you place a ruler or other straightedge over to solve the equation. Download this and print it out. And if you spot any mistakes, let me know so I can fix them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://ubuntuone.com/1kD39BCoV38WP1QeG6MtO6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ubuntuone.com/1kD39BCoV38WP1QeG6MtO6\u003C/a\u003E version 1.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis particular nomogram solves the delta-V equation: \u003Cstrong\u003Edv = Ve ln\u00AE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is, there are three variables: delta-V, Isp (or exhaust velocity), and mass ratio (or fuel percentage). Given any two variable, the nomogram will tell you the value of the third.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EExample:\u003C/em\u003E Say your spacecraft has engines with a specific impulse (Isp) of 320 seconds. You want to do an orbital transfer from Kerbin to Dres (1,300 meters per second). Place the nomogram on the table. Lay a ruler over it so that on the Specific Impulse scale (the one on the left) it crosses the 320 second mark. Pivot the ruler so that it simultaneously crosses the Delta V scale (the one in the middle) at the 1,300 mark (labeled \u0022Kerbin-Dres xfer 1,300 m/s). Look at where the ruler crosses the Mass Ratio scale (the one on the right), and you will see it does so at Mass Ratio 1.51 (a tad less than 34% fuel).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, there is one application where a nomogram has an advantage over a calculator. It allows you to visualize a range of solution. If the mission is an orbital transfer from Kerbin to Dres, you can place the ruler on the 1,300 m/s mark on the Delta V scale, and \u003Cem\u003Epivot \u003C/em\u003Eit there. This allows you to see how changing the specific impulse of the engine affects the propellant fraction, and vice versa.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember that exhaust velocity equals specific impulse times 9.81, and propellant fraction = 1 - (1 / massRatio)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-07T01:34:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2013 01:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by nyrath\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shrike42","CreatedById":61104,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T19:07:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if there are any mistakes, but I really like what you\u0027re going for here.

You can use this chart for a \u0022grand tour\u0022 mission, where you would add up the required delta V for each segment of the mission, and see if the spacecraft had enough delta V to do the entire mission. Right now the delta V chart is chopped of roughly at the point where the Ion drive isp is connected to a mass ratio of 10.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor that matter, what is the logical place to chop off the mass ratio scale?
