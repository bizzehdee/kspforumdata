With such a butthurt/post ratio on your forum page, I cant take you seriously anymore. Seems like the conversation between the two of us is over.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECopied it word for word apart from the butthurt thing. If you want to wave you \u0022special internet powers\u0022 around than by all mean do so, but don\u0027t throw a tantrum because I disagree with your oh so special Squad. I take someone calling me butthurt very personal and consider it a grave attack on my person, I hope you act accordingly and follow the community rules. KSP isn\u0027t a big enough game to get notice by video game media for stealing other people\u0027s work. No other main stream company would release a game for this long and not fix ANY major bugs that have been reported, kind of the reason Squad tries to hide the bug list and king of the reason why the bug list seems to grow daily without ever getting fixed.Just over 700 bugs report, yet only 20 have been fixed. Major bugs that were reported 2 years ago seem to be ignored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also posted proof in my last post, but for some reason you deemed fit to delete it. Any reason for that? Or do Squad tell you to delete anything that harms their reputation on this forum? Wouldn\u0027t want billies knowing that Squad actively steal mods to pass off as new features, don\u0027t care about fixing updates and are only interested in making more money off a broken game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/290\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/290\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/projects/ksp/issues?set_filter=1\u0026amp;tracker_id=1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/projects/ksp/issues?set_filter=1\u0026amp;tracker_id=1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skyfire322","CreatedById":132033,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-07T17:48:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MacroNova\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MacroNova\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGot a new pet peeve after playing some last night: Kerbals not holding onto the ladder when you EVA them.
