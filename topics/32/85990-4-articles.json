First you get a balanced setting where the median ( not the average \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ) of the players feels comfortable, then you add easier settings and harder settings ... you don\u0027t start of a low ( or high ) benchmark and then add levels up ( or down ), because you will most likely have a bad scaling on the difficulty settings ... more, unlike other games, where the testers have little experience, KSP has a wide array of testers with varied skills ( us ). The devs have something that other game developers can only dream: a real feedback of exactly how easy or dificult the game is. And in this point even regex agrees that, if you do not limit yourself ( either by ignorance or via roleplay ) , the current ( science gathering ) game is probably too easy ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, my point is: first we balance the game difficulty in a way that , as it comes out of the box, 50% of the players find it easy and the other 50% find it hard. \u003Cstrong\u003EThen\u003C/strong\u003E you add options to make it easier or harder to the players taste if you fancy.

A player that has done 90% of the tech tree is \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E a greenhorn, even if it is his first game. He might not be able to do Tylo landings or Eve returns, but he is surely able to launch a ship to out of Kerbin SoI and even back. If he isn\u0027t a greenhorn, why treat him as such? We are talking of career mode, for heavens sake: it is supposed to imply a progression of goals and skills and it implies that the player atleast already gave a eye to the tutorials ( yeah, right , I can hear you say \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E ) ... otherwise the devs would give you 20k science for putting a capsule in the VAB. While I can see the appeal of playing a career game while in LKO loitering around and building whatever ( I also would like to be able to play contracts without science, but \u003Cem\u003Ealas\u003C/em\u003E ), the main mode of the game will only lose if you make catering to that point the sole determinator of your game balance ... in the same way it would lose if you made the game to cater to Scott Manley and him alone \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E : in the same way people can be put off by a too hard game, they can also be put off by a too easy game :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis we agree on, for the most part. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I just don\u0027t think there\u0027s an issue with the balance in science.
