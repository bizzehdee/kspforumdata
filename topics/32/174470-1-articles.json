I do work with CAD and physics modelling, and my thousand-dollar-a-year software is even riddled with bugs. You really can\u0027t escape them! As a fun experiment, try naming 10 groundbreaking games from the last 20 years, and let\u0027s see how buggy they were at release. We can actually do this experiment, it\u0027s kinda fun.

There are exceptions to the rule though, I had been finding that v1.3.1 was really quite stable relatively speaking. Sure it doesn\u0027t have the latest and greatest, but if stability is a must, I\u0027d go with that over the v1.4 stuff for now.
