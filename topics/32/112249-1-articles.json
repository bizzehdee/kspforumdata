I tried to re-enter once, and actually managed to keep most of the craft intact (at least the lifting and surviving parts). Then, since I had forgotten to turn off overheat indicators, the game crashed.\n\nOn my next attempt, I decided to try something. Rather than just point prograde the whole way down, I turned on SAS and angled up about 10 degrees above prograde. The effect was, frankly, shocking. I managed to fully re-enter the atmosphere and enter flight mode with no damage, and the reduction in heat buildup was immediately obvious.\n\n![9VJh1yXh.png](http://i.imgur.com/9VJh1yXh.png)\n\nFirst, this is what it looks like while just flying prograde until the craft slows down enough. Notice how much of the heat effects there are. What you can\u0027t see in this image is parts of my craft exploding and filling me with angst.\n\n![yhMTor6h.png](http://i.imgur.com/yhMTor6h.png)\n\nAh, here are the explosions... 20,000 altitude and 1500 m/s.\n\nNow, this series shows the various altitudes on the second pass, when I angled up 10 degrees on re-entry. You can see what altitude I am at.\n\n![pH6XGBZh.png](http://i.imgur.com/pH6XGBZh.png)\n\n35,000 altitude, re-entry heat begins. 2086 m/s.\n\n![PbiZbCgh.png](http://i.imgur.com/PbiZbCgh.png)\n\n33,500, angled up at about 10 degrees. 1950 m/s.\n\n![UDO28CWh.png](http://i.imgur.com/UDO28CWh.png)\n\nI\u0027ve come up about 1,000 feet, and heat effects stop altogether. 1730 m/s.\n\nWhen you start to pick up heat, you angle up a little. If you\u0027ve gotten rid of the heat, angle back down. \n\nThis actually works a lot better than airbrakes. Of course, this assumes your craft is moderately controllable at high speeds and can manage that kind of angle of attack, but if it\u0027s not, it\u0027s got other issues. \n\nAnyway, I hadn\u0027t seen this mentioned. Hope it helps. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) The first time I forgot airbrakes, before I did this, I just jumped out of the remains of my spaceplane and jetpacked to the ground, since that plane was impossible to re-enter without destroying itself."},{"CreatedByName":"viktor19","CreatedById":111560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T11:45:05Z","Content":"I think this is a way any spaceplane should reenter atmosphere.

I managed to build a few spaceplanes in 1.0.2 that can bring about 10 kerbins to orbit and refuel my space shuttles or stations around Kerbin.\n\nBefore re entering, i burn retrograde like any other ships, actually, i try to brake a lot using space engines (got no RAPIER atm) between 70km and 40km. Just before 40km, i turn the ship prograde and then i can adjust pitch.\n\nThe best way to brake is, as you said, a pitch a bit higher than prograde, i would say about 10-15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 (big planes need a bit more pitch, aound 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 i found), you\u0027ll also move the landing spot a bit further. But i also could use some negative pitch ! You lose altitude and speed faster, generating more heat, but if you have braked enough before 40km, the plane can still survive re entry.\n\nSo, using this 70-40km retro burn, i can adjust my pitch to land exactly where i want, if i see that i will land before the KSC, i raise my pitch until \u002B10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, if i am missing it and fall into the sea, then i lower my pitch to -10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 (only if my speed is low enough, or i will burn the ship before ground).\n\nIn 1.0.2 career, i now only use SSTO to resupply because i don\u0027t lose much money as they can land at KSC in one piece."},{"CreatedByName":"Mic_n","CreatedById":27054,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T12:07:25Z","Content":"Yup.\n\nThink of it this way. Airbrakes work by creating drag - putting an aerodynamic surface against the oncoming flow of air. Your entire craft is an aerodynamic surface. You can create that same drag by just turning it a bit. Heck, in the upper atmosphere, point the damn thing straight up.\n\nActually, depending on how much control authority you have, that\u0027s a strategy you can run with the whole way through re-entry. Point it prograde, pull straight up, turn on SAS and just let it try to hold. As the atmosphere thickens up and the drag gets heavier, the craft will try to come nose first (assuming you\u0027ve built it right, otherwise the tail end may try to come around.. still not necessarily a bad thing since you\u0027ve generally got engines there and they can deal with that heat really nicely anyway).. But you\u0027re slowing down as much as possible as high as possible, which spreads that heat load out over a longer time rather than just having a giant burst it needs to dissipate all in a hurry.\n\nThat, and don\u0027t put your Pe down too low. Keep it up nice and high and just let it drop as you aerobrake in the upper atmosphere. If you\u0027re coming in from a high AP, it might take a couple of passes, but that gives you a chance to cool off in between. \n\nI find around 40km is a nice height for a Pe.. good amount of braking and not too much heat buildup.. Once you\u0027ve done it a few times you start to get the hang of predicting where you\u0027re going to land based on your craft, your starting AP, all that sort of thing.\n\nRe the previous post: I don\u0027t mean to sound like an ass, but burning from 70-40km is astoundingly wasteful when you can just use all that atmosphere to aerobrake. Burning at that point means you\u0027re carrying fuel for it that you don\u0027t need, which means you\u0027re lugging that around the entire rest of your mission, which means you\u0027re increasing your fuel needs exponentially. Your craft should be basically dry when you come back in.. maybe a little there for emergencies, but that\u0027s about it. Instead of pointing your engines forward from 70-40km, try pointing your belly there, and use all those lifting surfaces as a whopping great airbrake in themselves. You might not notice it much, but there\u0027s still plenty of air up there to slow you down.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-07T12:30:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2015 12:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mic\\_n**"},{"CreatedByName":"rudi1291","CreatedById":138990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T12:12:53Z","Content":"I have no airbrakes in career yet, so this is the only way to do it.

While 10deg sounds exceptionally reasonable to me (a little conservative, even), the OPness of 15G\u002B \u0027pancake\u0027 re-entries (entering at stall AoA, where you can drop from orbital speeds to maneuvering speed in 10 seconds) is a bit much. The reason that I call it OP is because it completely subverts any \u0027challenge\u0027 introduced by re-entry. Humans don\u0027t handle such stresses very well, airframes don\u0027t, and I can\u0027t imagine it\u0027s great for kerbals either.\n\nUsually I play FAR which sorts this out (though I\u0027m waiting to play stock 1.0.3 aerodynamics before I make the switch). It puts aerodynamic limits on wings (they\u0027ll shear off in this sort of re-entry) and implements hypersonic lift reduction and CoL changes that make holding a large AoA very difficult even if you wanted to. And DRE adds G-tolerances for kerbals.\n\nThat said, I\u0027m not sure what I would want Squad to do about it. The hypersonic aerodynamic changes are difficult to understand as a beginner and greatly complicate design, so I don\u0027t much like that idea. Aerodynamic stresses are an option but are possibly sidestepped with moar struts, not to mention they could be annoying in other contexts. So it may just be that pancake re-entries are here to stay and for people to use if they so desire."},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T15:18:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Here I am!

So you slow down faster than your ship could blow up.\n\nOnce, I did a reentry from Minmus (well just outside SOI, truthfully). I had a streamlined MK3 (non plane) return vehicle with heatshield and air brakes. I feared the heat effect. So I tried to skim the atmo to reduce speed before diving.
