Most of the time, when I see no metascore or a score under 50, I give up before even trying. Imagine this with new KSP-interested people! Maybe they miss the game of their lives!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will set a good example. At about 20:00 CET today I will also write a long and good-mooded review. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo!
