Seven motherships, making up a combined total of half of Earth\u0027s metallic mass and a quarter of its core leave the Earth to flee the dying sun. After considering their options, one mothership was designated a scout... It was sent to the Andromeda galaxy; known by the Kerbals as the Kerbomeda galaxy. However, with a tenth of the trip left, the mothership\u0027s ion engines could not recharge due to the absence of stars outside of galaxies. They drifted through space for hundreds of years. Fortunately, the advanced-technology closed ecosystem provided improvised life support for everyone on board. The ship floated to a red dwarf star near the center of the Andromeda galaxy. The humans orbited the star to recharge, until a scientist in the on board observatory discovered a habitable planet near the star. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe waste produced during the hundreds of years that the humans have been drifting through space was jetissoned near the outer edge of Kerbol\u0027s SOI. Unknown to the humans, the planet already had a humanoid species dominating a planet, but the waste pooled into a planetoid and when they intercepted, the ship was destroyed, exploding in all directions. The radioactive isotopes were released into space, which clumped with the planetoid and the crashed ship. The gases released by the decomposing waste (Which was mixed with an oxidizer so it could decompose in space) created a vaguely green atmosphere, and the radioactive isotopes gave the planet a heated core and made the atmosphere greener. The heat caused the planet to swell up into a gas giant. Space debris drifted into Jool\u0027s SOI and became captured, becoming its moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe radiation released by Jool has given Kerbals unusual properties, making them intelligent enough for basic space travel and green almost overnight, hence the only structures on Kerbin being the space center. In an unrelated incident, Kerbals instantly became asexual and all females died out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katyjsst","CreatedById":41511,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-28T05:44:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot scientifically explainable, but nice storyline.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sherlock21st","CreatedById":42362,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-28T22:47:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022katyjsst\u0022 data-cite=\u0022katyjsst\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENot scientifically explainable, but nice storyline.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s what I was going for \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thesandbar","CreatedById":41697,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-29T17:40:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s a closed ecosystem, there can\u0027t be any waste.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust sayan.
