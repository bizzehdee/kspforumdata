Usually I see nvidia\u0027s 3d vision driver as a gimmick, but not any more! I was teaching a friend to dock, cursing about how frustrating it is to lack any sense of depth. It looks like you have the ports all lined up, until you change camera angles and realize it was an optical illusion. That gave me the idea to turn on 3D and give it a whirl.
