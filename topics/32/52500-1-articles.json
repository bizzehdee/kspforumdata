It adds revenue for science, refuel cost, range dependant recovery cost and reusability,which obliged me to work within a very tight budget and balance cost with reward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis for example was a shoreline mission. The science gain was fairly limited but it could make a profit by keeping refuel and recovery costs down and the vehicle was launched as it landed, completely reusable and due to the limits of build costs and fuel economy, it was built as the smallest Kerballed craft which could complete the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SP4FYtVh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SP4FYtVh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
