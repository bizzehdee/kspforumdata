I started out with some extra science to unlock the early nodes and only take contracts that fit with what I want to do. And then I only take contracts to be able to fund my side missions. I had an Eeloo transfer window coming up but didn\u0027t have the funds to upgrade the R\u0026D center to the level where I could get an antenna that could reach Eeloo. Nor was there a contract for it. But I sent a probe anyway and once it leaves comms range it\u0027ll be controlled by a kOS script. That was funded by some random contracts. My multimillion funds Duna Station paid for itself and then some, despite not having a single contract for a Duna station (just the Explore Duna and Explore Ike contracts). I managed to complete contracts for a Kerbin station, Minmus base, and Solar station all with the Duna Station (yes, I landed a massive OKS station on Minmus). I enjoy the freedom to do whatever I want, but like the artificial limitations that make me have to get a bit more creative than I otherwise would be.\n\nI\u0027d definitely still have fun in Sandbox mode (it was the only thing in existence when I started playing and it was plenty of fun\u002Bchallenge back then). I\u0027d just set my own limitations (with the aid of mods) rather than what the Stock game says I should be limited to. The two modes are really not much different to me.

The last few times I\u0027ve tried I give myself the maximum starting cash and like, 90 science (I think 88 will get you the first four nodes), so I can have a modicum of functionality for my rockets and unlock some of the building upgrades to reduce the grind. Unfortunately, that still leaves a massive grind if you play with mods and parts unlocks, plus the literal cash wall when it comes to unlocking the R\u0026D facility. Be prepared to launch plenty of worthless satellites into equally worthless, sometimes baffling orbits (or whatever you consider the least grindy of the contracts).
