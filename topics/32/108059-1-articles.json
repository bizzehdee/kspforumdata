No matter how well they do the multiplayer, it is still a niche game. That doesn\u0027t mean it can\u0027t be popular, but it isn\u0027t going to take over the world like Minecraft did. R.I.P.

I used to play Minecraft a lot but now I play KSP. However I don\u0027t thin KSP will ever rival Minecraft in popularity, its just too hard for one thing.

KSP is totally different from Minecraft as it is a simulation for space travel. You can do amazing stuff while building rockets, planes, rovers, stations and so on. And you can fly them. But thats it. (And I love it for what it is.) You need a certain level of nerdism to enjoy this game.\n\nMinecraft is not a simulation, you can\u0027t fly anything you build. But it is much easier as you just need to place blocks and then you can build whole cities or explore caves and terraform the world or just run around tame animals. It\u0027s user base is more widespread then KSP."},{"CreatedByName":"CDRW","CreatedById":124541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T15:18:40Z","Content":"Absolutely not.

A large portion of the KSP community is made up of minecraft veterans (myself included) who quit minecraft once the modding community kind of fell apart and mod support dried up. Both KSP and Minecraft have also both been heavily boosted by mods (in both cases the stock game is a great sandbox for building random stuff, but the survival/career mode is lackluster at best IMHO).\n\nSo yes, in a lot of ways KSP appears to be filling much the same role in the gaming world as Minecraft (except for multiplayer for now)."},{"CreatedByName":"godarklight","CreatedById":92588,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T15:20:11Z","Content":"In general? I highly doubt that - although KSP is quite successful, it has more of niche player market.\n\nAfaik, multiplayer is confirmed (they announced it when I was still working on KMP - december not last year, but the year before that - and they\u0027ve also mentioned it on twitter/the dev notes a few times, so it doesn\u0027t appear to be swept under the rug).\n\nI\u0027d like to see multiplayer too - it feels like the only thing that\u0027s missing from KSP for me, and to say DMP is \u0022buggy\u0022 is a bit of an understatement hehe."},{"CreatedByName":"Wiseman","CreatedById":116239,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T15:20:16Z","Content":"I doubt it will overtake Minecraft, in the sense that it would replace it or whatever, but I see them occupying very similar spaces. They both have great potential to be used educationally, have broad appeal, and are foundations for their respective genres. When multiplayer is added, I could see another spike in popularity happening for sure, since there\u0027s a lot of room for collaboration and persistence. \n\nI\u0027m hopeful that KSP becomes an institution like Minecraft.

Even if KSP gets multiplayer and great server support, it will not approach Minecraft\u0027s numbers. It just doesn\u0027t have the wide appeal. \n\nMy wife loves Minecraft. She once remarked on KSP, \u0022That game looks so boring. I just don\u0027t see how it is any fun\u0022. Although she loves the kerbals and my spectacular launch failures, she would never play KSP. I\u0027ve tried to sell her on it. KSP just appeals to a narrower audience, and that is fine. \n\nThat being said, Squad has done an amazing job making the game appeal to those who would otherwise ignore it... and still somehow manage to keep a focus on math and physics. I hope KSP becomes a common feature in schools... like Oregon Trail was when I was in elementary school. KSP is no doubt the best educational game in the history of games... both from the perspective of education AND fun. \n\nHINT HINT: Squad... you want more sales? Give the game away free to schools. Once kids get a taste of the game in schools, they\u0027ll force their parents to buy the game for home.\n\nEDIT: Nevermind, Squad is already on top of that.
