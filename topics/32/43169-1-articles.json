Personally business matters should stay in house as it is not anyone\u0027s business but those employed by SQUAD, until there is need for it to be made public. The game should always be thought of first, and personnel dealings second. It is seemingly people are thinking they are entitled to know everything in a business, but in reality they are getting third and fourth hand hear say.

But just how far does this line of reasoning extend? Should Harvester no longer make his usual blog entries? Should the developers and SQUAD staff avoid the forums at all costs? And how about those developer videos/interviews? That\u0027s got to be a huge waste of time right there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, the fact of the matter is, part of the reason KSP has such a dedicated following isn\u0027t just because it\u0027s an incredible game. It\u0027s because the developer isn\u0027t some faceless EA clone. They\u0027ve historically not been afraid to communicate with their customers and fans, to reveal future features, to answer community questions (within reason), etc. They\u0027ve even hired modders from the community to be part of the development staff. That\u0027s special right there. That\u0027s not something any ordinary developer is going to do. Unfortunately, you seem to want them to retreat into an impenetrable shell. To become a cloistered order, a faceless developer slamming out code from the confines of a small windowless box. But to have that happen would be a huge loss not just to the community, but arguably to SQUAD itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Liowen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Liowen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAll this does is create false information and post going off track, much like this one has, over information that is not needed in the post to begin with.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s why it\u0027s not a bad idea to have a brief blog post like the one I linked to, just having the developers say hello and introducing new members of the team to the community. So they can generate even more positive PR while shutting down any rumors and/or false information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease realize, I\u0027m not talking about personal, or even necessarily employment details here. I don\u0027t think anyone cares when Harvester showers, or what the pressure in his car\u0027s front passenger tire is. Just a very brief meet and greet like in the previous blog post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, this isn\u0027t a \u0022demand\u0022 on my part, and I have no authority to \u0022demand\u0022 anything of SQUAD anyway, even if I wanted to. People seem to be getting that confused. It\u0027s a \u0022would be nice\u0022. Especially since they\u0027ve shown a willingness to communicate with us on that level in the past.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
