It allows to set circular orbit altitude, number of satellites and orbital resonance for transfer orbit (ratio of circular orbit period). The result is a graphical simulation of the satellite orbits and other useful statistics that help to tweak the orbit during the simulation. Currently it uses Kerbin as the target celestial body.\n\nThe tool is really handy to use with RemoteTech, for example, if you need to have 2.5Mm omni antenna on satellites and you intend to use the satellite network with planes on Kerbin that have 500km omni antennas, then you can make sure that the green line does not exceed 2500km and yellow line is below 500km as in the screenshot. Then set up the transfer orbit, in this example 5/6 of the circular orbit period, and check that the periapsis is above 70km ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n[http://imgur.com/hGm7sxX](http://imgur.com/hGm7sxX)"},{"CreatedByName":"Daze","CreatedById":57997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T17:22:30Z","Content":"Nice job! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"anachronicus","CreatedById":139237,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T18:13:13Z","Content":"Thank you d4rksh4de!
