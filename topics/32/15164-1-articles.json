However, It seems I can\\\u0027t even build something that can get off the ground. have tried very small (2 jet fuel tanks = fuselage) with the wings connected to the engines which are connected to the fuselage. None of the stock wings can get this thing off the ground (eg delta and swept wings) so I tried making my own (wing connectors then delta at the end.) I can fly, but once I\\\u0027m over the water it will start to pitch down and eventually nosedive (within 1 min of takeoff) the wings themselves flop all over the space though I have reinforced them with struts on the top and bottom. Landing gear is always retracted. Engines are constructed with nacelle, intake and engine. I know this is cheating, but can anyone give me some plane designs that will work? Heads up I usually take off at about 100 m/s and maintain 160 once in the air. This is using the more powerful thrust vector version and the better intake. 2 engines. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dizzle","CreatedById":31588,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-25T07:58:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry placing standard canards at the nose, and control surfaces on the backs of the wings (drag them over to the back and press A, then attach them).

Use the standard winglet at the back of the plane, or the standard canard if the plane wants to go nose up, because it generates more lift. Put control surfaces on the back of the main wings. Use a tailfin with small control surface to give yaw control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeltawings are the easiest to fly, but they require a canard at the front, and I find you need to angle either that canard and/or the control surfaces on the back of the big wing. Angled surfaces mean that the plane pitches up depending on speed and atmospheric pressure, so lift balance is not the same at all velocities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy biplanes take the opposite approach - low-speed planes just use lots of wings to generate lift.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nerdyastronaut","CreatedById":30287,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-26T12:38:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, I think I can answer 2 posts here as well as my own question.
