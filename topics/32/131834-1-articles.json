Then, after some time, mostly spent in real life, while shopping for office supplies at a Office Max, saw a rack of discount CD-ROM games. I decided to buy 2, an old flight sim from 2002, and a vietnam game... which, in retrospect, I hate myself for. No for buying them, but not understanding jack **** about filesystems. The vietnam game need you to direct the save location, under C://, but I had no clue what that meant. I put it in a box and several years later lost the box. The only game I could play was the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002, which was great! I loved being able to kareen 747\u0027s into the ground from 45,000 feet. There was a complimentary game included (I didn\u0027t know this till later, I thought someone else had kept it on the disk) called Fighter Ace 2. This is where I got most of my video-game flight sim knowledge. After several years in la la land with RC planes and such, I got into the flash game scene. I attempted to make my own, which didn\u0027t work so well, but I did find one, which was a redirect to a download site... called Microsoft Flight (again, different version, free, online) and this is where my knowledge of wasting time on computers comes from. I like this so much, I wanted to get the full version, but alas, it was unavailable on that site. (It was hard to navigate) so I went a-googling to find some good online games. Several forums and wikipedia comparisons later, I found myself at Orbiter, 2010. (in August, 2010). I played this, and within 2 months\u00A0could easily head Moon-ward, dock with stations, land, etc. You know, basic KSP stuff. But after several months I was too good. I looked out from orbiter, and figured a more indie (I thought that was a term for updating more often because, you know, indie-people with the feathers in their fedoras and tattered vests and iPhones, they\u0027re so impulsive, they do everything fast, they update games fast). I wanted something where you could build your OWN rockets,\u00A0and looked around on some very small, hidden lists of things. And there it was: Kerbal Space Program. I gave most the ol\u0027 college try, and they didn\u0027t work out. I wasn\u0027t going to pay for anything too pricey, but it wasn\u0027t even $10! I figured, \u0022Eh, what the heck, I\u0027ll tell you my credit card info,sure!\u0022 and met Jeb, Bill and Bob Kerman. (.13.3)\u00A0The shaky rockets were just that, cheap. I even managed to land on the Mun with this hap-hazard rocket hodgepodges. This was all I really wanted. Even if I needed struts, I wouldn\u0027t let this deter me. Realistic shmealistic, I wanted what I could call my own. And that\u0027s how I met\u00A0\u003Cs\u003Eyour mother\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0Kerbal Space Program.
