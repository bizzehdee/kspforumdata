Since this isn\u0027t always the case you want to change the time of Jool encounter by increasing or decreasing that time. Make a maneuver node halfway out to Jool then switch to Jool in map mode and play with the maneuver node. You want to make sure the expected orbit is close to Tylo\u0027s altitude around Jool while increasing/decreasing the encounter to Jool until it matches with a Tylo encounter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that you want to make sure that you slingshot around Tylo in a retrograde direction relative to jool so make sure that encounter allows a retrograde slingshot, or at least radially out to kill your velocity.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnce there fine tune the encounter with Tylo so that you kill most of the energy possible.

This is just like doing a normal capture burn at Jool periapsis to take the most advantage of the Oberth effect. This will mean adjusting your arrival time at Jool to match when Tylo would be in the right spot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t take screen shots right now, but I believe, assuming you\u0027re on the same orbital plane as Jool\u0027s orbit with the sun, you can use prograde / retrograde on your manoeuvre node to adjust your arrival time, and then radial in / out to adjust your arrival position. It helps to pick Tylo as your target rather than Jool, once you have your orbit plane lined up with Jool itself. Then you want to pass in \u0027front\u0027 of or \u0027inside\u0027 of Tylo to slow down, as close to Tylo\u0027s surface as you dare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you can\u0027t quite get the timing right, try getting an encounter with Laythe instead. You won\u0027t be able to get as close to Laythe because of its atmosphere, but it moves faster than Tylo does which can make up the difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd sometimes, if you timed it well, you can pass in front of Vall right after your pass in front of Tylo and get an additional assist to slow down further.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atkara","CreatedById":169458,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-19T19:47:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll try to explain, although chances are I\u0027ll confuse you more than help you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith your initial ejection burn you ensured a Jool encounter.

You get a prograde Jool flyby, while crossing Tylo\u0027s orbit.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0That\u0027s the easiest part, as it\u0027s a matter of pro/retrograde and in most cases normal/antinormal input.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Tylo is where you cross it\u0027s orbit at.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A050% of the time, Tylo is anywhere but where you want it to be. So you make it be there.

Your encounter with Tylo results in a Jool capture.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0You need to get behind it so that it\u0027s gravity reduces your velocity, instead of increasing it.
