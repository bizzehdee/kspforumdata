Speaking of which, I\u0027d also like to get a discussion going here about rovers vs. stationary modules. With the modified rule about parts we can definitely have a bunch of rovers and small modules, but everything needs to be able to dock together. A bunch of separate modules does not make a base. So whoever launches the first part of the base will need to have at least one docking port close to ground level, which will then be used as the standard. It should be set up so that it\u0027s fairly easy to recreate, but thankfully Minmus\u0027 gravity will provide us with some leeway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that\u0027s all the stuff I wanted to cover, but if I remember anything else I\u0027ll let ya guys know.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dharak1","CreatedById":61137,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T06:22:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhenever I make anything on Minmus I put engines facing down so I can get traction and use the suspension to my advantage to dock.
