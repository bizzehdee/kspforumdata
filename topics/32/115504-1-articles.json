Crusader Kings 2 for example - the game should be long dead, but as project leader said - as long as people keep buying expansions for it, they will keep making them. Even if people don\u0027t buy them, they still get bugfixes and some new features in free patches that are realeased along those expansions. This way game that is 3 years old (counting since 1.0 release) still has very active development. \n\nI suspect the same will happen to KSP - as long as people are buying the game, we will get new versions.
