With 1.0 live and the deletion of my 0.90 folder with all it\u0027s nearly 2500 screenshots imminent, I wanted to highlight to the forum how badly I never made it back to space from Eve.\n\nI\u0027m pretty sure there are many out there that lithobraked, surface RUD\u0027d in it\u0027s many forms, and nearly but faceplanted at the last minute in their pursuit of the coveted \u0022I made it back\u0022 badge.\n\nLet\u0027s see some nearly-no\u0027s and remember the worst of the never made it in all it\u0027s glory! I\u0027ll kick start with a core selection of my (many many) beautiful failures:\n\n**Boosters always seem to have a serene sense of self control on unplanned separation from the vessel. Here\u0027s one example:**\n\n![VAEfuFtl.png](http://i.imgur.com/VAEfuFtl.png)\n\n**Another example of how I never made it back, with again quite beautiful effects:**\n\n![yxVfccZl.png](http://i.imgur.com/yxVfccZl.png)\n\n**A forlorn Kerman I\u0027m sure you will agree. This even despite the aspirationally titled ship \u0022The Eve Miracle\u0022**\n\n![mOra2Gnl.png](http://i.imgur.com/mOra2Gnl.png)\n\n**I call this one \u0022Rapid Unplanned Dis-assembly at 100 feet\u0022:**\n\n![V4iCtRkl.png](http://i.imgur.com/V4iCtRkl.png)\n\n**I was going to blow everyone away by lifting 16 Kerbals up and away, but no.

As long as you can get a ship with enough TWR to the surface, you can get back to orbit for far less dV. I just finished up testing an Eve ascent vehicle with ~8450dV, and it got to orbit with ~660dV to spare. It wasn\u0027t even the most efficient possible ascent profile, either. Quite an improvement over the old atmospheric model\u0027s ~10,000 to 12,000dV requirement!"},{"CreatedByName":"Speeding Mullet","CreatedById":62635,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T08:30:40Z","Content":"Thanks everyone!\n\nSkyRender - small condolence, but it was great fun trying non the less.
