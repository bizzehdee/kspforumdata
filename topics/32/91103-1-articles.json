Most Home editions have a 4Gb cap @ 32bit and 8Gb @ 64bit and you can only get above 4/8Gb caps if you upgrade or clean ISO install the OS of a professional or higher edition.. Its a gimmick Microsoft uses to make you buy their \u0022better versions\u0022 or suffer poor quality. There is a trick around all this as each windows DVD is by default the same disc only a different label printed and key attached to match what the label says. So you can if you know what to do, \u0022hack\u0022 the DVD and change a bit flag to give you an install or upgrade option for ALL versions and editions, basically unlocking the disc. This is NOT something ZI will explain how to do but you can look it up online and such if you just have to try it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
