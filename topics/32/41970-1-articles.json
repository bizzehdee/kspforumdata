Or maybe thrust vectoring) there was no need to panic. We would simply ditch the liquid fuel boosters who were equipped with seperatrons for that reason. And even when the remaining rocket exploded in a most spectacular (and I have to admit, satisfying as well) way there was still no reason to panic. We managed to get the command pod unattached. But coming back from 25km altitude takes a long time, so mission control could not resist physical time acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Do not accelerate through chute deployment, they will be ripped off,\u0022 Scott Manley warned. But we boldly time accelerated where no Kerbal had time accelerated before, and all was fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Do not accelerate through chute opening, they will be ripped off,\u0022 Scott Manley warned.
