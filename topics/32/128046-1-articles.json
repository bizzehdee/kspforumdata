Well... it\u0027s mid-December and there\u0027s still no NKS thread. What gives?! The reason for the delay is difficultly on getting the new internet connection. There is currently some complex monetary problems in my family, and so we haven\u0027t been able to get ATI Internet yet. There is no ETA for the NKS relaunch.
