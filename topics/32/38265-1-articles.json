Interestingly enough, the command module was still in orbit, but it\u0027s PE was inside the atmosphere. Using the mod that lets you launch rockets from other planets, I sent a rescue craft into orbit, rendezvoused with the capsule, but could only get 2 of the 3 Kerbals on the ship before I had to abandon the capsule and the remaining Kerbal.

I got up to go greet some more family that just came over, and when I got back to told me he was practicing with the game and told me he did not hit the shift key or space bar. I checked my resources and noticed that my mono propellent was lower, until the crash I just thought that he played with WASD with RCS on. Thinking nothing was wrong I started to time warp down to periapsis, when suddenly, Gilly. Remember when I said I though he was playing with WASD?
