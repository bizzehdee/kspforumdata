Once i had escaped Kerbin\u0027s SOI, I was deploying the the solar panels and i just took some time to really listen and appreciate the sound track. After 500 hours of KSP, this was perhaps the first time after the first 10 hours that i really appreciated the music. It hit me that the soundtracks really fit with the views you can see and all the stars in the background and do add to the mood and atmosphere (no pun intended) of the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe the music of this game is really well chosen however I never really appreciated it because I had already listened to the same four tracks again and again so much that they even began to be annoying. I think this is a missed opportunity as the sound track of a game is key to making an enjoyable and immersive experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I think this could be improved if more sound tracks were implemented. You may say that even if more were added then even those would eventually get boring however games such as Space Engineer have many short sound tracks and I am yet to get bored of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I think SQUAD should include something similar by implementing more sound tracks that are shorter but a larger variety of them. This way it would require maybe 1000\u002B hours in order to get to the stage where the sound tracks go as far as being annoying, which has happened to me currently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are your thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T23:43:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m fine with anything as long as I still have the option to turn it off.
