Actually, it\u0027s mentioned just to say why it\u0027s useless to go there or to remember that exists...\n\nHey i like dres, the main AKS base is situated on dres for 2 reasons, dres isnt a major target for most enemies, and dres has those super easy to work with potatoroids that spawn in perfect orbits around it (om id love to see at least some eliptical orbits or varying inclinations, right now dres is free roid farming. Those roids are so easy to work with that ive actually started dragging them into dres LKO to act as a minefield and or dogfighting arena (ok so many sci-fy series/movies had space fighters within asteroids shooting each other apart, i think its neat to run around dodging roids while trying to hit targets). Then im also working on a MASSIVE space dock composed of asteroids clawed together in such a way that you can dock ships inside a hangar made of roids crammed together.\n\nBut yeah, aside from the new asteroids that spawn there, dres has little interesting stuff around it, although i like the low gravity where even my crappy minmus intended ion fighter will work on."},{"CreatedByName":"Dspan_000","CreatedById":144320,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T02:39:27Z","Content":"In my opinion its Minmus.

Annoying place with minimal gravity. Every move takes minutes because time acceleration is forbidden near surface. There have also been strange bugs. I have collided several times to invisible surface hundreds of meters above the visible surface. It was couple of versions ago and I do not know if errors are fixed. Typically I just visit there once per save to put a flag and to watch those nice surface scatter things. Gilly is even more boring but it gives easy science points in career mode.\n\nIke was another place I did not like. It was dark and there was nothing interesting. But ISRU changed that. Now Ike is perfect place to land with mining and refining unit and supply fuel for manned Duna research. It also gives much science. Last expedition to Ike gave me more than 8000 points.\n\nUnlike so many others, I like Dres. It have interesting eccentric and inclined orbit which gives nice and varying maneuvering challenges. However, Dres have exactly one interesting place to land, the large canyon. Dres is easy to underestimate. I have needed more rescue operations to Dres than totally anywhere else."},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T10:42:43Z","Content":"Using Google:\n\nMoho ksp: About 43,600 results\n\nEve ksp: About 369,000 results (can conflict with Environment Visual Enhancements)\n\nGilly ksp: About 29,500 results\n\nKerbin ksp: About 253,000 results\n\nMun ksp: 419,000 results\n\nMinmus ksp: About 133,000 results\n\nDuna ksp: About 204,000 results\n\nIke ksp: About 124,000 results\n\nDres ksp: About 49,000 results\n\nJool ksp: About 93,400 results\n\nLaythe ksp: About 81,200 results \n\nTylo ksp: About 34,500 results\n\nVall ksp: About 28,000 results\n\nBop ksp: About 98,400 results\n\nPol ksp: About 286,000 results (not sure why, probably conflict with something else).\n\nEeloo ksp: About 35,300 results \n\nSooo, Google thinks it\u0027s like this: (from the least popular to the most popular)\n\nVall\n\nGilly\n\nTylo\n\nEelloo\n\nMoho\n\nDres\n\nLaythe\n\nJool\n\nBop\n\nIke\n\nMinmus\n\nDuna\n\nKerbin\n\nPol\n\nEve\n\nMun\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T10:47:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 10:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cicatrix**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jesrad","CreatedById":49762,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T11:06:41Z","Content":"Vall it is.\n\nDres at least has its unpopularity going for it.
