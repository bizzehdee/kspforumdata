Those roids are so easy to work with that ive actually started dragging them into dres LKO to act as a minefield and or dogfighting arena (ok so many sci-fy series/movies had space fighters within asteroids shooting each other apart, i think its neat to run around dodging roids while trying to hit targets).

Annoying place with minimal gravity. Every move takes minutes because time acceleration is forbidden near surface. There have also been strange bugs. I have collided several times to invisible surface hundreds of meters above the visible surface. It was couple of versions ago and I do not know if errors are fixed.
