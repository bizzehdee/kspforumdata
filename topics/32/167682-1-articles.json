I am planning on making a video about a mission to Duna. I am having problems, however, because I don\u0027t know the best types of realistic techniques. I decided on a multi-launch strategy where I will launch 3 or 4 modules into orbit, dock them, and head to Duna. A spaceplane will be docked there to get in and out with science. Do you like the plan? What else do you suggest?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-19T08:47:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRealism and vanilla KSP don\u0027t go so well together. You can squeak out a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E to duna and back, doing 3-4 launches and orbital assembly is pretty overkill.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIgnoring a very optimized \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E spaceplane... why carry a spaceplane to duna? For just landing on duna and returning to orbit, a spaceplane is not what you want. The air is thin, the gravity is low, a standard gravity turn ascent is what you want, and its much easier to land on chutes and retrorockets than to land a spaceplane. Realistically, assuming duna = mars, no one would consider using a spaceplane to ferry stuff between low mars orbit and the mars surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow... I do sometimes use spaceplanes on Duna, but that is when I have a surface base and I want to be able to actively steer during my descent to ensure that I land very close to the surface base. In some cases, I just have a pretty standard vertical lander, with some fins attached.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs long as you have a \u0022mothership\u0022 that stays in orbit and use a separate lander, I\u0027d say that its realistic enough for vanilla KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-19T10:49:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few points off the top of my head... for \u0022realistic\u0022 you may want to:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\ncarry extra mass for life support\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nhave dedicated habitats for in space and on the surface\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\ngenerally, bring surface stuff to unpack and use\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nplan for redundancy and abort modes\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nlike, lander can hover / move about for a bit (think apollo 11 and the debris field)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nlanding may be aborted even at the last moment\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nsurface equipment is pre-deployed on a previous launch window\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nbring two lifters, crew can fit into one if the other doesn\u0027t check out\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n...\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s probably easiest to pick one of the existing mars proposals and try to follow it as good as you can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-19T11:31:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry the \u0027Mars direct\u0027 mission plan.
