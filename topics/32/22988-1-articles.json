I believe initially, they meant that all *patches* to KSP would be free. Meaning as they added features and content to the core game, people who had purchased KSP would get said updates free of charge until the core game was completely finished. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally didn\u0027t expect this statement to cover expansion content created *AFTER* KSP was finished, but a lot of people did apparently, plus people misinterpreted Harvester\u0027s thinking out loud to mean future patches to the core KSP would be paid DLC as well.. which didn\u0027t help matters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to smooth things over, the devs have stated that everyone who has bought KSP before the end of april, will get all future expansions for free as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
