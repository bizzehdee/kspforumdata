The x64 issue with windows vs linux is something completely outside of SQUAD ability to solve due to politics of two decades ago.

It\u0027s also a question of if we\u0027re using animated sprites or particle effects; and how the end result gets constructed.\n\nIt\u0027s akin to saying that since you wrote something in portable code, it should work on any platform flawlessly.
