But I did have some notable close calls. Now a bunch of rocks in mid/high equatorial orbits you\u0027re not likely to ever hit during an escape burn unless probability decides to play a joke on you, but in a low orbit (70-80km) even a single one can pose a serious hazard to rockets during ascent. At one point I had roughly half a dozen spent rocket bodies flying around this orbit, all within small fractions of a degree of 0 inclination. During one later launch I nearly had a heart attack while preparing for circularisation, as one of them belted past me in the blink of an eye, showing as a HUD element that briefly became a flash of metal streaking by before disappearing back into the distance. I couldn\u0027t tell you the exact closest approach,\u00A0I was on ascent into the same orbit as the debris so\u00A0the relative velocity was on the order of hundreds rather than thousands of m/s (still way too fast to track when you\u0027re not expecting it), but it was definitely less than 2km, I can tell you that much, probably closer.

My question was about what happens to them after they disappear from the tracking station. Are they still there and a potential navigation hazzard or does the game truly delete them?
