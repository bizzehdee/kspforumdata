I was having trouble using repacked parachutes on a ship that needed to do multiple hops. After repacking the chutes, they would often cause weird explosions when I tried to later deploy then with action group keys. They would NOT explode under the same circumstances if deployed with a right-click (although that was impractical because the unbalanced deployment caused my ship to tumble violently), and they never exploded when deployed the first time (non-repacked) even when deployed using action groups. Along with this was the annoyance that the repacked chutes could not be deployed from the staging sequence (even if moved around into new stages).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, after a bunch of experimenting, I found out the following things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe parachute icons change color, indicating something about their status (which may have been more obvious to you non-colorblind people than it was to me):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hZPxQ63.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hZPxQ63.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The first color (white) shows that the parachute is ready to be deployed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The second color (green, I guess\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6I can tell from the RGB of the pixels, and from having seen a few greens in my day) shows that the parachute is out and operating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The third color (red, I\u0027ll bet) shows that the parachute has been disconnected (this shows after landing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) The fourth color is the odd one\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 a darker green\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 and its what you see after repacking your chutes. Chutes displaying this color will not deploy in the staging sequence, and these are the chutes that have been causing weird explosions when I deploy them with action group keys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT, HERE IS THE FUN PART (and the reason I had some difficulty in getting the exploding effect to repeat): \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6IF you do a quicksave and then reload the save, these darker green chutes turn white again! AND they work in the staging sequence. So apparently I just have to remember to quick save/reload after packing chutes before I attempt to use them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure what the darker green color is supposed to represent (I presume it wasn\u0027t meant to indicate \u0022amusing exploding mode active!\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DisarmingBaton5","CreatedById":68576,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T23:19:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting...
