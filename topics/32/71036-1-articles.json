First, I would like to thank Kerbal Attachment System for the strut end points. Without them, this ship wouldn\u0027t be feasible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027m finding new uses for the claw every week and I love it. It makes so many things much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor one, I can just attach the claw to one of my standard orbital vehicles (it looks like an apollo module) and use it to deorbit debris. Beforehand, I would\u0027ve had to use a complicated and relatively dangerous set of electromagnets and winches in KAS to do the same job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, using the same craft, I can assemble pieces in orbit without having probe cores and RCS on every structural piece. I\u0027ve used the probe core \u002B RCS to assemble things before, but the number of pieces was only two. This ship is going to have dozens on structural pieces, and eliminating probe and RCS will cut down on the part count. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for using pieces is because I\u0027m using Ferram and I want to keep my fairings reasonably sized. Thus, I\u0027m not going to send up each piece unfolded. I could use IR, which would make the process even simpler, but I\u0027m glad I didn\u0027t due to the 23.5 compatibility issues. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really want to post pictures of my ship because it\u0027s GONNA BE AWESOME.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xrayfishx","CreatedById":76147,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-30T15:34:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFunny, I\u0027ve never even used the claw.
