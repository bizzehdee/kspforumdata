I have my flyby set up and a node at Minmus Pe to bring me back to a Kerbin reentry trajectory. The node wasn\u0027t for a couple of days so I set an alarm and go do stuff with my other ships. Then, thanks to the \u0022Warp Here\u0022 feature, which totally ignored my alarm and immediately went back to full time warp as soon as the alarm fired, I overshoot my Minmus maneuver on the tourist ship by a couple hours. When I finally cancel the warp and switch over to the ship with Val and the tourists, to my horror IT WAS EMPTY! The Astronaut Complex listed her as MIA and there was no trace of the tourists. Needless to say, apart from losing a top pilot, my contract was botched. Fortunately, I had a quicksave from right before I had clicked Warp Here and Val and the tourists were safe, but it was a close call.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFear The Kraken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-04T04:06:42Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2016 04:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by A_name\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlamoVampire","CreatedById":78020,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-04T05:42:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYikes!
