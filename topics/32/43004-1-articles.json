Aerobraking is not calculated for inactive vessels. A 100x24km orbit will never decay. A 100x22km orbit will disappear the craft as it descends below 23km.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arq","CreatedById":71084,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T15:17:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIIRC, an inactive ship \u0027crashes\u0027 if it gets too close to a body with an atmosphere. For Kerbin, I think this is something like 37km. Otherwise, no aerobraking takes place on inactive vessels. Though I am surprised by SRV Ron\u0027s comment above. SOI changes (and thus gravity assists) should still be treated properly. I suspect that was more an issue with time-warp. SOI changes and near-body passes should be done at relatively low time warp (10-50x or less) or else floating point issues can cause orbits to shift.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"purestevil","CreatedById":96183,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T14:43:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo discarded parts (stages, etc) get deleted if they are not part of an active flight if they\u0027ve be set on an orbit that should take them into aerobraking territory?
