Forget all the terms from the 0.20 (and before version), wipe the ASAS and SAS terms from memory. TUT!, no just forget them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2. Every control module contains the ability to do Automatic Attitude Control. What that means is this system can control the forces generated by the control surfaces (like flaps), rocket gimbals, engine vectoring, and the new reaction wheels, in order to maintain your crafts attitude (direction it is pointing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 3. The control modules may also include a reaction wheels of varying strengths. Reaction wheels are NOT attitude control, they are a device that CAN be used for attitude control. When in action (when force is being applied), they consume electricity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow to build your craft now:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1. Build your craft... done. When you add the control module (manned or remote) you get the Automatic Attitude Control system, and some version of a reaction wheel (sizes vary depending on the control module).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2. If your craft is still unstable, or difficult to control, you will need to add more forces that can be used for attitude control. These can be flaps, engines with vectoring, or additional reaction wheels. You can add some of each, or all of one type. Just remember: flaps only work inside the atmosphere, engine forces require fuel, and reaction wheels require electricity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThings to remember:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1. The old SAS/ASAS parts are gone, poof. Yes I know they have the same names as before, just ignore that. What they are now is just reaction wheels. They have no smarts, the are just big spinning discs that can be used by the pilot or the Automatic Attitude Control system to exert forces which can be used to point the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2. The old \u0027T\u0027 button, turns on and off the Automatic Attitude Control, it does not turn off the reaction wheels (on or off, the pilot\u0027s inputs still can control the reaction wheels).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGotchas:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The new reaction wheels are very cool, and a welcome addition to KSP. However some crafts do better without them, and some parts of missions do better without them (note: I am talking about the reaction wheels, NOT the Automatic Attitude Control). For example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1. Rovers in general should have them turn off, at least until they flop on their backs like a turtle and you need to try to right yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2. Vessels docked at space stations should have their reaction wheels turned off (the station should have them turned on), or they can oscillate on their docking nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 3. Vessels either being pushed/pulled by another Vessel, and the tug Vessel itself, should all have their reaction wheels turned off. This prevents oscillating on the docking node, and gives you more accurate burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETricks: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1. For every vessel you make, create an action group (I use \u00270\u0027), that turns off all reaction wheels. Do this for every vessel type, except for Space Stations. Remember turning off the reaction wheels does NOT turn off Automatic Attitude Control. The Automatic Attitude Control can still use the gimbals, flaps, etc to control the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2. Place extra reaction wheels on vessels you expect to use for docking. This will allow you to have a lot of command authority, which is useful for switching between your targets direction and your retrograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScott Manley, video on the subject:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/QlsGlz2e5qU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-28T10:56:16Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2013 10:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by dlmarti\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xclusiv8","CreatedById":20567,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T17:46:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI give you a cyber cookie sir.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dlmarti","CreatedById":70037,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T19:20:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022xclusiv8\u0022 data-cite=\u0022xclusiv8\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI give you a cyber cookie sir.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoh, thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T19:24:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you reconfirm the docked parts needing to have the reaction wheels turned off?
