I have a mission report in the works that I\u0027d like to post soon, however I have a slight problem.\n\nIt essentially is a writing, however it\u0027s not fiction, it is a writing about a mission report. To put it simpler, it\u0027s a mission report with writing characteristics, like dialouge and other things, usually not in a simple mission report. Should I post this in the writing or mission report forum?\n\nThankful for answers!\n\n-Brix"},{"CreatedByName":"Brainlord Mesomorph","CreatedById":110905,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T14:07:05Z","Content":"I plan on putting a few in-game passages of sci-fi prose in my mission reports.\n\n(and I plan on posting them in Mission Reports)\n\nI\u0027ve seen dialog in there before."},{"CreatedByName":"BriXman","CreatedById":89391,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T14:10:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I plan on putting a few in-game passages of sci-fi prose in my mission reports.\n\u003E (and I plan on posting them in Mission Reports)\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve seen dialog in there before.\n\nYes, I\u0027ve seen dialogue in mission reports before, but this report also contains several segments in which it is more like a writing."},{"CreatedByName":"Brainlord Mesomorph","CreatedById":110905,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T14:21:38Z","Content":"Well here\u0027s what I\u0027m doing:\n\n(And BTW, pls tell me, do you find this hilarious, disgusting, or do you not get it?)\n\n*When the first telemetry was transmitted from JoolBot/Science Dog II as it parachuted to the surface of Laythee to the flight control operators at the KSC, they were very glad they had installed that floor drain under their desks.* \n\n*KASA Administrator Bernard Kerman frowned at the widening stains on the fronts of his coworker\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s pants when they handed him the printout, but he understood their reaction as he read the results; oxygen, liquid water, potentially even resources.
