EA\u0027s problem isn\u0027t that people have complained about the games they publish and driven them to mediocrity, but rather that they have ignored their fans over the years. When there is good criticism to be made of EA, they simply ignore it and do what they want... and it results in so-so games and angry fan bases. That\u0027s more along the lines of what\u0027s happening here. A very desired feature among the true fanbase (not those that will play KSP for 20 minutes and forget about it) appears to be headed for the scrap heap so that another feature most had accepted as not even happening, but has more commercial appeal, can take center stage. SQUAD does appear to be heading in the direction of EA\u0027s developers, but not because of how the fans are reacting... the fan reaction is a result, not a cause. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf nothing else, SQUAD really screwed up with their lack of communication on the subject. This change didn\u0027t happen yesterday, and resources have been the main feature people have been looking for update after update since they were shown. We were led to believe that they were simply delayed to get other needed features in first... now it seems that was never the case. As soon as they were cut, or at least downsized from what we were shown, an announcement should have been made given how desired they were. Instead the community was left hanging for months assuming resources were still coming in the same form we were teased. That is SQUAD doing something very wrong, with their best EA impression.
