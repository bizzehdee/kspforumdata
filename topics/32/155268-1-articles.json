I had been repeatedly doing kerbin orbit tourist contracts and could continually complete them, first try, at least 5 times in a row. Today I attempted to do a kerbin orbit tourist contract with the exact same ship and could not achieve 70k ap-70k pap orbit. I tried multiple times and ran out of fuel every time BEFORE hitting orbit, not even enough fuel to de orbit. whats going on?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditional info: Was using reliant initial stage, terrier second stage. In an attempt to be extremely cost efficient I was using just enough fuel tanks to achieve orbit and de orbit. With consecutive failures today I tried switching over to thud x2 on initial stage for greater \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E at sea level to no avail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn all humility it may be my flying but I was pretty consistent at hitting orbit with this same ship.
