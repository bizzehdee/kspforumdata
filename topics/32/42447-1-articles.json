Why would you need a heat shield if you were only travelling at terminal velocity? The whole reason heat accumulates in re-entry is because a ship is going \u003Cem\u003Efaster\u003C/em\u003E than terminal velocity and atmosphere is accumulating under the craft. It\u0027s friction and oxidation. Anyone who needs a \u0022theoretical\u0022 answer doesn\u0027t understand terminal velocity in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, then, it\u0027s clear that the only problem worth considering \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E the \u003Cem\u003Epractical application\u003C/em\u003E.

If you want to come down no faster than terminal velocity, \u003Cem\u003Eyou will be fighting gravity\u003C/em\u003E all the way.

It\u0027s heating up into a plasma which is, in turn, heating up the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the discovery that electrical fields can be used to manipulate flame, there are projects looking into using electrical fields to push back the plasma so as to reduce heating to the craft. I wish i could remember the article. But, I digress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou wouldn\u0027t need to slow up to 0 before atmo to keep that from happening. Just slow down a good bit and you\u0027re good. I use FAR and DRE and i\u0027ve found that all I need to do to minimize heating is slow up to under 2000m\u0027s as I hit about 35km.

If you, for instance, were able to de-orbit a Progress spacecraft from the ISS by killing all its orbital velocity, and it dropped straight down from that ~350 km height, by the time it hit any significant atmosphere (at ~100 km), it would be going something like 7500 m/s straight down.
