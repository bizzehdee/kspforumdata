Of course, that\u0027s back when \u0022career mode\u0022 was just \u0022science mode\u0022 and I built 300\u002B part monstrocities with huge amount of overkill to go everywhere. My Munar and Dunar rockets these days are designed to be cost efficient for .25, and they\u0027re a fraction of the size of the rockets I used to build. My piloting has improved nearly as much since those days, too, so that the delta-v transfer plot actually nearly matches what I see in practice. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It just seems like everything is hard in KSP... the first time.
