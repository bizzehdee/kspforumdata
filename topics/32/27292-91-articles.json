We wondered if we could come up with a conclusion based on the ability of Laythe\u0027s ocean to remain liquid despite the relatively low temperatures.

Each lander weighed less than a ton, was fitted with every scientific instrument available, a parachute, and about 1000 delta-v worth of thrust and fuel. The plan was to launch from Kerbin, do a fly-by of Duna where I could drop off the first pair of probes and then slingshot my way on to Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://xomf.com/wxvwn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.xomf.com/wxvwn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wxvwn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI reached Duna easily and detached the first pair of probes. Using their rockets, one was aligned for a temperate intercept path, and another a polar intercept path. It took a number of save reloads to get them landed on Duna with the thin atmosphere and those spindly probe struts, but eventually I did get them both down safely, and returning data. As a bonus I flew by some sort of crazy Mt. Doom on Duna\u0027s north pole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow unfortunately my gravity slingshot was terrible, and I ran out of fuel trying to normalize my orbit around Jool.

It attempted to slingshot around Eve, and dropped a couple of probes off on the way, which landed easily in the thick atmosphere. The slingshot was mediocre, basically just getting back the delta-v I lost going to Eve, but with the extra fuel I made it to Laythe, established a ~45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 orbit, and began dropping off probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://xomf.com/knbcr\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.xomf.com/knbcr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022knbcr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe probe landings required some reloads again, but were all ultimately successful. Shifting Pandora III\u0027s orbit from 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 all the way to a polar orbit allowed me to establish landing sites at a variety of latitudes and altitudes around Laythe, both on the shoreline, and far inland (or as inland as you can get on Laythe). Also, I got one probe right on the little island in the middle of that huge impact crater.

Time of year, time of day, and latitude do not matter at all for determining temperature in Kerbal Space Program. This was born out by all nine of my probes on three different bodies. For the purposes of crunching numbers and doing fun science on KSP celestial bodies, we should probably assume that the temperature readings then are a general average of all times of day, seasons, and latitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Altitude and/or barometric pressure \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E matter for determining temperature in KSP. The higher and thinner the atmosphere, the lower the temperature. This was also confirmed by all nine probes. In fact, the correlation was strong enough across all three bodies that the formula \u0022\u003Cem\u003Et = 48p - 34\u003C/em\u003E\u0022, where \u0027t\u0027 is temperature, and \u0027p\u0027 is barometric pressure, will yield reasonably accurate answers on all bodies (within about %5).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. There is a small glitch with the in-game thermometer when switching focus to a ship. For whatever reason, when you switch the thermometer always starts at 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, and then begins to rise or fall to the actual temperature. The speed of the rise/fall is exponential, beginning fast, and slowing as it gets closer to the proper number. The time this takes seems to take about 60 seconds, regardless of whether the temp is 2\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 or 200\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. So, when reading temperature data, make sure you always wait at least minute after switching craft focus to record the number.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThings I Learned About Laythe:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. \u003Cem\u003EIt\u0027s warm there!\u003C/em\u003E Relatively at least. While the temperature does drop below freezing at higher altitudes, anything below about 600m is above freezing. In fact, my warmest reading (pictured below), taken from an altitude of just 10m and a barometric pressure of 0.7979, was a balmy \u003Cstrong\u003E4.59\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\u003C/strong\u003E.
