But if you only have an idea of what a type of career you\u0027d like to experience, you\u0027re kinda forced to try the settings you think would give you this experience and play it through. If you don\u0027t like it you have to do another try. So I thought let\u0027s make a Thread where everybody can share their experience with specific settings and tell their opinion of what it felt like and how they liked it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll try to include the most significant ones, and it\u0027s player experiences here in the OP, to create some kind of collection where undecided individuals with an idea of what they want can go to look up which settings might sweet their taste the most.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get started:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunds:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a little money watching at the beginning of the career, but if you use contracts, especially the \u0027Explore\u0027 ones, they\u0027ll still give you a huge amount of money compared to mission cost. So Money still becomes more of a no brainer, the further you progress in Career. The same for penalties: if you don\u0027t screw up every second accepted contract it is no issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecomes a little more grindy than stock, especially at the beginning you won\u0027t be able to use the parts you\u0027d like for a specific mission ( like first mun landing). But it isn\u0027t \u0027absurdly\u0027 hard to get the Science, if you squeeze out all the possible science from the mandatory contracts you\u0027re doing anyway, you\u0027ll gain all the science you need on the fly and don\u0027t have to bother with Extra-Science-Missions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReputation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo problem, as long as you try not to kill anyone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe special in this settings is the No Reverts and no Quicksave. You have to think twice if you\u0027d like to lauch a craft. But since money isn\u0027t that big of a problem it\u0027s not required to make everything reusable or land exactly at the KSC. You should take some error-fuel with you in case anything goes wrong, and every crewed Launch HAS to be equipped with a some sort of Lauch escape safety feature if you don\u0027t want to kill anyone. Special difficulties arise when there are One-Try-situations: like an Aerocapture or a Tylo-Landing, keep in mind you can\u0027t reload and have to be conservative at some points. But this also adds a new sense of immersion to the game: You know, this is it, if it doesn\u0027t work somebody gets killed. Or if something goes wrong you have to deal with the consequences, send rescue missions and such. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditional idea is, to test Craft ,planned to carry crew, with a probe first, to see if especially the launch goes well and the craft behaves as intended. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClosing thought: The money etc. settings don\u0027t even have such a great impact if you\u0027re already a little advanced in ksp. The most recognised change is the no Revert and No quickload. It can add to the immersive experience, but also keep in mind you might also encounter the Kraken. But a last tip for that: You are infact still able to quicksave, so hit f5 every now and then, and if something Bug related happens you can change the difficulty, load your last save, and turn quickload of again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo share your opinions about the settings you tried and tell us the expierence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. keep in mind people can also have different opinions about something, so don\u0027t rage at anybodys opinions just because you think different.

My general experience has been that some contracts are wildly better than others; landed part tests are free money, science from space is dead simple and reliably generate a 20:1 ROI, satellite missions (which I believe unlock after solar panels) have about the same ROI but give five to ten times as much in absolute terms, but are a little more finnicky, and testing parts from the 90 science (or higher) tiers in orbit is both very lucrative and gives great gobs of science. The early rescue missions are profitable, but tricky without solar panels (alternatively you could put two capsules on, I guess, but I always thought that a. looked silly and b. was too heavy anyway).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVisual survey is a pain before you can build proper planes, and not really worth it, particularly if it\u0027s one with a flight ceiling instead of a floor; low-science part testing is worthless unless you really need the science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPriority upgrades are the launchpad and contract building, I think.
