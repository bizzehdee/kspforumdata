Do you really think that is how it will be, can you cite any reference for that, or are are you just being contrarian? \n\u003E We\u0027ll see soon enough how much of a factor reentry heat will actually be.\n\nThe current heat is basically about right for the speeds involved. You are calling for heat that vastly exceeds realism for the speeds. Remember that it\u0027s m\\*v\\*v, so half the starting velocity is actually a quarter of the energy to dissipate, i.e. it\u0027s perfectly correct and appropriate for heat to be less of a problem.\n\nI don\u0027t need to cite a reference, but I can: The 1.0.2 release is a fairly clear statement of Squad\u0027s intent. I really do think that what we have today is very likely at least a close approximation to Squad\u0027s intended level of heat. Can you cite anything at all, anywhere, even the slightest hint, that they intend for re-entry heat to be a major problem for re-entry from Mun \u0026 Minimus? I don\u0027t believe that any such statement exists from them.\n\nThere are circumstances in today\u0027s 1.0.2 game which will cause you severe problems with heat, namely coming in from certain solar orbits. Also, re-entry in space planes without actively taking steps to increase drag dramatically and scrub speed off. Also, spaceplane ascent if your vertical rate is too slow once you\u0027ve got mach 3\u002B speeds going on. Also, losing attitude control of a capsule with other parts below it and ending up facing prograde.\n\nI think that we have got exactly what they intended to deliver, that it should not be changed significantly; and that it would be a huge game-breaking mistake to change it to be significantly harder, very likely causing significant harm to KSP\u0027s long term success. I do not believe that they ever intended the consequences to be a severe problem for re-entry from Kerbin orbit.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I also realized as deadly as new stock re-entry could be, I have found an easy way to \u0027pull the emergency brake\u0027 and decelerate very rapidly in the stratosphere by using SAS to pitch to ridiculous angles of attack and holding it there.
