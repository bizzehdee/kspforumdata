My Mod aims for a realistic experience without any big reconfig mods, but with the stock parts. It shall feel like a real Challenge but with all the stock parts, Kerbalistic experience as I call it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there is one thing that can be a benchmark for this: Something that should work is a classic Apollo mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow everybody has different building styles, so I thought I start a Thread on this. Build a Saturn V out of stock parts (5m tanks and adapters are allowed but stock engines only), and post here how it performs and what it is capable of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Erequired would be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA command module and a lander, they dock together, only command returns to Kerbin. (Lander can but doesn\u0027t have to be 2 stage) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA three stage Rocket. shall look roughly apollo like, try to get as much Delta-V out of it as you can while maintaining a Saturn V look. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhats interesting: TWR and DeltaV of the lander\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeltaV of the command Module (with lander attached)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeltaV of the Saturn V launch stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome experience so far: the Poodle got extremly weak in terms of thrust... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if general is right place, but did\u0027nt really fit anywhere else...
