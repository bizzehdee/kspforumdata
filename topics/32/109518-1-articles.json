No even \u0022ksp is not responding\u0022 or error report either! This happened on another occoasion last week. I was also doing the same thing then, albeit with a smaller ssto. Anyone else had this problem? It\u0027s really making me exasperated now, as I\u0027ve had to try landing this thing (which is big and difficult to land but more on that in a nother thread ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) ) 3 times. Argh"},{"CreatedByName":"Ignath","CreatedById":77210,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T15:37:16Z","Content":"Are any parts overheating and causing the new overheat gauges to pop up? Those are known to have a memory leak that will cause the game to crash after a time.\n\nTo fix, push F10 to disable the gauges."},{"CreatedByName":"Screeno","CreatedById":141893,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T15:51:29Z","Content":"Oh I forgot to add, I have the temperature gauge disabled, so it can\u0027t be them, that\u0027s why I was so suprised it crashed. I\u0027m gonna do the landing again now, hopefully it does not crash again\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nWoooo it didn\u0027t crash and now Jeb bill and bob are safe amd back home thank goodness."},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T16:41:35Z","Content":"It used to do this for me all the time back in 0.90.0, but with capsules. Land, hop out, game froze and had to wait for it to get back to desktop. I did a clean install for 1.0, so haven\u0027t experienced it since."}]}
