My understanding of the mechanics (which recently changed and the community is still discovering the specifics of so I might be off base) is that radiators should effectively increase the surface area that can radiate out built-up heat. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, try turning your plane around and flying it in aft-first.

That said, once I started to get re-entry effects, I pitched the plane up to use the underside as a giant airbrake. So maybe try that? It slows the plane MUCH quicker than going in nose first, so maybe the heat doesn\u0027t get too intense because by the time you reach thicker atmo, you\u0027re going slower?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T23:16:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDepends on how agressively you enter the atmosphere.
