The reentry effects occur at much higher speeds, and they are an indication of significant atmospheric heating. Few parts can survive sustained exposure at those speeds (especially the frontmost part), it is best to keep climbing and get to thinner air or slow down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-27T03:45:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOld thread is old.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
