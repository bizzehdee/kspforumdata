So I took a contract that seemed easy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically I had to get surface EVA reports from two spots close to each other to the north of KSC, and a crew report from above 18,200m just east of the mountains near KSC. Seemed simple, deceptively so, as it turned. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had no ladders, so my first design had the capsule at the very back of the craft, which was also a tailsitter that used chutes to land, because I not yet unlocked landing gear, It was a pain to balance, I basically had to add fuel tank as no more than ballast in order to shift COM forwards, because I also had to be careful that the wing parts didn\u0027t hit the ground. I also had to contend with the fact that I could only use 30 parts in total. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/V9JGtu2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022V9JGtu2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was a total failure. The ballast tanks meant that it was inefficient and had severe difficulties reaching the target 18,200m altitude. It was constantly trying to flip wrong-way forwards, possibly due to the way the rudders were in the front. Due to parts restrictions it had too few chutes per required landing (3) and so it often bounced, fell over or just broke on landing. In short: not very successful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was broken but not beaten, so I tried again. With the help of the magic that is our new building Gizmos I built a new plane, this time with a cockpit angled down. This way, my pilot could just stand on the craft, and it would count as doing EVA reports from the surface. I also shifted to only one engine, although the craft necessarily had to be a tailsitter that landed with cutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i0HjPuU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022i0HjPuU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResults were better this time around.

I tried to correct it with more landing legs on the wings to increase size of the base, but it didn\u0027t help. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was a this point that I realized that my problems were mass related and could be solved by simply removing half the fuel and re-positioning the other stuff.
