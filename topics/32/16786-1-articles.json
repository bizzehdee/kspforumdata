That is, as long as you\u0027re not on Kerbin. The EVA pack has proved vital for going any sort of distance on one of Kerbin\u0027s moons on foot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, on Kerbin itself, the EVA pack is utterly useless. With its much higher gravity, the new RCS pack makes little to no \u003Cstrong\u003Enoticible\u003C/strong\u003E difference on the velocity of the Kerman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is all well and good, because there is no real need to travel very far on Kerbin by foot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, with the lingering idea of extraterrestrial planets (possibly ones of even more mass than Kerbin) in the Kerbol System, having an RCS pack capable of lifting the Kermen off the ground in higher \u0022Gees\u0022 could prove necessary. My question is, in the 0.17 update, will there be more powerful EVA suits available to accommodate for the more intense gravity of other planets?
