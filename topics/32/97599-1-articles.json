Remember to check out the blog for the overall grand plan. Sorry for speeling mistakes, I\u0027m a terrible transcripter. I try and clarify what is an actual quote from Max (if it\u0027s wrapped in \u0022quotation marks\u0022, it\u0027s the best transcript of an official Squad member you\u0027ll find on the web), and what is a summary from myself as I\u0027m aware I switch between the two with 0 notice. When I say \u0027Squad\u0027, I mean \u0027the relevant people who are currently developing the game\u0027. As always, this is just a transcript of an off the cuff vlog of a non-native english speaker - some details may change or be entirely incorrect. ANYWAY!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquadcast was a little late due to technical difficulties, but \u0022hello everyone, 10 minutes late!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EValentina design is not 100% final yet, Max says they\u0027re not comfortable sharing it yet. However, they have beta plans to talk about! After SQ, a blog post will show a list of everything planned, kerbelles are among them. The basic idea is: no lipstick, same skin tone, rounder faces, slimmer bodies.. basically feminine versions of current kerbals. Kerbals were originally asexual, but they ended up masculine, so why why not keep things even, as space is for everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis release may take longer than previous ones due to the amount of content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of rebalancing and bugfixing, a lot of parts are going to be buffed and a lot of parts will be nerfed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerodynamics update: it\u0027ll be on the realistic side of things, an atmo that is realistic is more predictable, you know how things will behave. \u003Cstrong\u003EStock fairings are 100% confirmed\u003C/strong\u003E. Wide launch vehicles are bad, but will still work, given enough thrust and fuel (like real life)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeta isn\u0027t so much about adding features, it\u0027s more about refining current things, like rebalancing systems that are currently.. existing, like aerodynamics. The problem, it\u0027s not realistic, you can\u0027t predict what will and won\u0027t fly, but now, if you have a plane that looks like a plane, it\u0027ll be ok. First part is the drag model - instead of being based on mass (which is gone completely) it\u0027s based on shape on the ship (hello, fairings!). Part occlusion, like cargo bays and fairings, will help and it\u0027ll be based on part orientation as well (fuel tanks sideways create more drag), Mu will likely update with more news on how this drag model appears. \u003Cstrong\u003EFairings will likely be procedural out of necessity!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELift works currently, but not correctly, and in the update, it\u0027ll be generated on the square of velocity. Some wings may be more powerful \u0022which brings us to rebalancing everything and I mean everything\u0022. Every single data point in the game will need revising - because of the thinner atmosphere, in order to preserve a similar experience, Squad has to pick a point and rebalance around it. A different \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV to places may appear. Spaceplanes are currently hard, but they shouldn\u0027t be impossible in beta (still hard, though). Right now, Squad have an overlay tool - \u0022current mass etc, we want to add an overlay like a concave (\u003Cem\u003E[OWK note: what?]\u003C/em\u003E), in the current state, there\u0027s a stable AoA and an unstable AoA - the stability overlay will define the boundary. You can still fly unstable crafts, but do not attempt unless your surname is Manley\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETools for teaching newbies, adding upgrade to buildings - the craft stats app (mass, parts, weight) will be the engineers report. Such messages may be like \u0022Hey, this craft is manned and has no parachutes!\u0022 Or \u0022you have no way to store or generate power!\u0022. KerbalEDU helped with the ideas for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDifferent toggleable aero options - \u0022definitely maybe\u0022. No confirming or denying, just maybe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding TimewarpTo - a new feature, currently implemented in KAC, when you set up for example a manoeuvre node, you can timewarp to that node. If you click at a point in the future of your orbit, you can warp to that point, KSP will warp as fast as you can to that particular point. No teleporting, just allowing time to align yourself to whatever etc so you have time to do stuff when you get to that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer mode is almost complete, except for one thing - failure state. Now, you can lose the game - if you run out of funds/rep, you\u0027ll get fired as administrator because you\u0027re so damn awful. Oh well, gg, start a new save. At the moment, you can\u0027t lose, but that\u0027s because you physically cannot. This will change though (though with the cheaty power of savefile editing, you can do anything! But shame on you though!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding gears are terrible. The current plane landing gear are renamed the Mk1 landing gear, and \u003Cstrong\u003EPorkJet is adding new and bigger landing gear and wings.\u003C/strong\u003E So, Squad are adding larger wings - wings that will make it \u0022as easy to build an Mk3 plane as it is to build an Mk1 plane. Really really large wings. Huge is not an understatement\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal climber feature - \u003Cstrong\u003Ekerbals can now climb over edges and small ledges, like at the top of a ladder\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERebalance economic systems - currencies are out of whack, that will be curbed a little, again, thanks to Ted for the rebalancing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENew contract! Tourism contract\u003C/strong\u003E - you take kerbals that don\u0027t do anything to certain places.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESound overhaul! New sounds! A new sound when a contract is completed, for example. \u0022The game basically needs to be more responsive\u0022, in short.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDeep space refuelling aka resources! \u003C/strong\u003EAdding a new system and parts that collect matter from asteroids and bodies so you can process that to LF and O. How? A lot of existing assets, those ones made ages ago. \u003Cstrong\u003ECollaborator will be RoverDude! Basically, a version of Karbonite will be integrated into stock\u003C/strong\u003E or rather \u0022won\u0027t be dissimilar\u0022, is the phrase Max used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMassive amount of bugfixes, including long standing ones.

Put aside your love for the (rather mediocre,) models, and look at it from a design and realism standpoint. You have Mercury-era spacecraft being wheeled out of a barn, and being launched from what is little more than a grade-schooler\u0027s sandbox. That doesn\u0027t fit at all, from both a visual and a logical standpoint. As well, although realism is a taboo way of justifying things here (thanks in no small part to the way the concept of realism has been demonized by both the developers and much of the fanbase as \u0022unfun,\u0022) one doesn\u0027t really want to be handing highly toxic rocket fuels in a simple wooden barn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
