Usually I placed all my bases fairly close to their celectials. kerbin station at around 85km, Mun at around 35 and so on. With the version out now i am thinking that maybe i should replan and start planning further out. Kerbin at around 175 and Mun at 100. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. station design. if anyone has ever looked at my previous design... the word busy comes to mind. Lit up to high heaven and part counts starting at 250 and going up from there. i think I should cut back aiming for the 175 range to keep things more stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am hoping for opinions on point 1 and ideas for point 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealacrity\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
