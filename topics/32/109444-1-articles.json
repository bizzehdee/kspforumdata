It seems like an arbitrary limitation; limited just because they\u0027re something that can be limited, rather than there being a good reason for not having them until fully upgrading the construction buildings. It doesn\u0027t make the game harder it just makes it more clunky and time consuming (and leads you to re-purpose the named action groups for other things). Anyway, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121555-Make-Custom-Action-Groups-available-earlier-in-career\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI\u0027ve made a suggestion\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E to let us have at least a couple custom action group earlier on in career. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point of this thread is to point out a couple workarounds;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- if you\u0027ve fully upgraded either the SPH or the VAB but without upgrading the other one, you can move a craft into the fully upgraded one, set the custom action groups and save it. Then move it back to the lower tier building and although that building doesn\u0027t support custom action groups when you launch the craft from it they\u0027ll still work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You can also load a career craft in a sandbox save, set the custom action groups and save it. Then load it back in a lowly tier 1/2 building in career and when it\u0027s launched it\u0027s custom action groups will function. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eok so the 2nd one is clearly a dirty cheat, but as I really can\u0027t see the point in not having at least a few custom action groups available by the time I\u0027m doing mining operations I\u0027m not too ashamed to say I\u0027ve used that on a couple career craft. In both cases these have been mining and mining support craft with lots of things that could be switched on and off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, just thought I\u0027d share those. Does anyone already use these workarounds?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T02:52:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022katateochi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022katateochi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe point of this thread is to point out a couple workarounds\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone already use these workarounds?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will from now on!

I use stage and RCS groups on my SSTO\u0027s in early/mid career (stage to toggle jet engines, R for rocket engines). But on those that have RCS for docking I even end up using the abort group as a basic engine toggle (which is kinda odd). Using stage is a pain if there is anything else that actually stages (have to remember to add empty stages in before using it). Sometimes I use the brake group as a jet engine toggle, but that can be annoying as you need to make sure you fire things up in the right order so that when you release the brakes the engines start and then when you apply the brakes they cut off again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs career is partly about introducing new players to \u0022the ways of the Kerbal\u0022, I think that having at least 2 custom action groups in the first tier would be nice, going up to 6 in the 2nd tier and then finally the full 10 when fully upgraded.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T03:37:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 03:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by katateochi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T15:00:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022katateochi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022katateochi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs career is partly about introducing new players to \u0022the ways of the Kerbal\u0022, I think that having at least 2 custom action groups in the first tier would be nice, going up to 6 in the 2nd tier and then finally the full 10 when fully upgraded.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a good idea \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
