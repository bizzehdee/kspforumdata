I\\\u0027d also like to note that the Kerbin-Mun system appears to be Earth-Moon scaled down by a factor of 10. I have found a few matches, both for its scale size and real size. Charon, moon of Pluto, is 603.5 km wide, providing an almost perfect match for a scaled Minmus. A large amount of asteroids can be matches for Minmus, the closest one of note being Epimethus, a moon of Saturn, at 56km. All measurements are of the radius.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foamy","CreatedById":608,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T22:21:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s not quite so clear as a factor of 10 but it should be in the ballpark. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is the most Minmus like object as far as appearances and composition?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"simplemunrockets","CreatedById":22495,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-02T00:07:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Foamy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Foamy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s not quite so clear as a factor of 10 but it should be in the ballpark. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is the most Minmus like object as far as appearances and composition?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would think Epimetheus so far.
