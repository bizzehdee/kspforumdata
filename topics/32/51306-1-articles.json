Let\u0027s say you need 1 leg for 1.5 tons (on Kerbin) like my test showed, the let\u0027s call it 30 ton lander would need 20 legs on Kerbin. But on M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn it\u0027d need 1/6th, so 4 would be enough. So if you visualize that lander, landing on M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, with only 4 legs, and getting NO compression whatsoever, do you feel that it would be ridicilous?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo, is \u0022Suck it up and learn to live with it, kiddies,\u0022 the official Squad response to the situation?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m posting my personal views as any other player, I\u0027m not posting as a moderator in this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T17:44:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rulare\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rulare\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis line really stood out to me. \u003Cp\u003EThis argument is silly and infinitely expandable.
