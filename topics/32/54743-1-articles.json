The flags that you \u0022plant\u0022 on those surfaces you expedition on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd simply the flag that is displayed that you carry as on your username.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wish to download additional ones. In fact I am most willingly searching the Soviet (russian) space program flag.

How convenient that the devs have come up with just that: kerbalspaceprogram.com is the official mod hosting site. And as it happens, many, many of those mods are additional flags.
