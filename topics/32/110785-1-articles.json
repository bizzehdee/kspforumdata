To me it seems more like a game-balancing thing. Since the RAPIER has 2 modes and can work in space, why would you also make it faster than the turbojet? If it was, nobody would ever use the turbojet... Just like if the nuclear engine has the same thrust as a poodle, nobody would ever use a poodle...\n\nBut that\u0027s just my 0.02 m/s...."},{"CreatedByName":"Screeno","CreatedById":141893,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T15:04:49Z","Content":"Well the turbojet would still be better up to mach3 , the rapiers just push to mach 4 they would still be the same other than that I guess.

Power gets you off the ground, but you need streamlining for serious velocity. Once you really get moving, shaving a tiny percentage off your drag gets you as much benefit as doubling your engine thrust.\n\nIn thrust we trust, sure, but there are reasons why aircraft designers go to such extreme lengths to minimise drag."},{"CreatedByName":"Screeno","CreatedById":141893,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T15:33:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E **Wanderfound**, that\u0027s FAR.

I would like it if I could fly planes and rockets without them falling apart! Haha and yes, a larger rapier would be lovely! Maybe that\u0027s what we need. A 2.5 m rapier!
