A one man lander is sent to Duna, lands, then takes off and puts itself in orbit around the planet. Then another ship, equipped with the super efficient NERVA engines, is sent to Duna with an empty seat to rendezvous with the astronaut in orbit. The astronaut boards the rescue ship and returns home with his buddies, who at this point he hasn\u0027t seen for more than three years. Good thing Kerbal pods are equipped to receive TV signals. I could probably last three years in a spaceship if I had a computer, internet access and a TV signal. Also, I\u0027m pretty sure Kerbals live off of TV.

The plane then travels back up, docks with the interplanetary stage, and can refuel.

I suggest that you pre-calculate the orbit you\u0027ll need - it saves a lot of fuel. Add a few struts and parachutes to your design and you can land using very little fuel, just a bit to set you down, and a shot or two to keep the chutes from ripping off when they open. Use NERVA. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a shot of my lander, below. All stock parts, no tweaks. I have a 3-engine transfer stage that uses two of the large 3-meter tanks, a tri-coupler, and 3 NERVA engines. Getting it all into Kerbin orbit is the toughest part. I\u0027m almost certain that, if I was careful, I could get the lot to Jool, though I wouldn\u0027t be coming back, for sure, and I don\u0027t know that I would be landing anywhere there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"that1guy","CreatedById":14276,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T04:06:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can easily get to anywhere using the onion design (fuel feeding toward the center).
