Most of the cost of a rocket is in the hardware, not the fuel, so if you\u0027re throwing away the hardware that\u0027s a huge amount of Roots down the drain. Multi-stage rockets, obviously, lose at least one entire stage, so you should be trying for a single-stage design and figuring out how to keep from losing THAT as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo try this instead:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; Make a simple SSTO rocket. Mainsails are good for this, as they have a decent ISP and more than enough thrust, but any engine with an ISP of ~350ish should be enough. Stick enough fuel tanks on top to get an initial TWR of around 1.7-1.8. (As it loses fuel you\u0027ll quickly reach the optimum TWR of 2.2ish.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; Put parachutes on it. Small girders on the side make a good place to mount them, since you\u0027ll be using the top to carry your payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; Put a small probe core on it, along with a few batteries and a few of the smallest solar panels.

Four XL girders, pointed downwards, work just fine for flat terrain.

Since it\u0027s a circular orbit, you can deorbit whenever you want, which means you can aim to land at/near KSC (greatly increasing your recovery percentage). All you\u0027ll lose is the cost of the fuel, but that\u0027s negligible compared to the rocket itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis concept is very scaleable; I\u0027ve made giant rockets massing twenty or thirty thousand tons (21 linked 5m KW Rocketry stacks) capable of lifting payloads of several thousand tons.

Separatrons are rather afordable at 50 funds a pop. For the largest solid boosters you need 2 separatrons per booster cluster at or just above the centerpoint and it will ensure they never impact the core rocket they are attached too. I have sub assemblies setup for my solid booster needs. one is just a single booster premounted on a decoupler with a pair of separatrons prepositioned and the other is my quadpack arrangement. Quadpack is the same booster on decoupler but has 3 additional boosters straped too it, left right and directly oppisit the decoupler with the separatrons mounted on the outside pair. A pair of struts top and botom compleats the package to ensure things dont wobble in flight. I\u0027ve never had a booster impact the next stage in this arrangement that wasn\u0027t caused by an extreme control input at the moment of separation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the ship has alot of rotational control authority and I\u0027m in the middle of a hard turn as I drop the boosters I can slam the falling boosters with the rocket and break something. Any other time the boosters drop safely even if I\u0027m flying horizontal fairly low in the atmosphere with one booster directly above the core. The separatrons have enough kick to lift it up long enough for the main rocket to get out of the way before gravity pulls it back down. With proper positioning you can safely drop solids even without seperatrons as long as your still near vertical or in thin atmosphere when separation happens, the separatrons just make it a sure thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy own experience has been that its significantly cheeper to get any significant payload to orbit useing a disposable solid first stage with a recoverable core that gets the rest of the way to orbit and then returns. To make a pure liquid SSTO ends up with a significantly more massive vessle to return and a smaller mass fraction to orbit. While you technicly recover more of the craft with a SSTO its a much more expensive craft and more sensitive to landing errors. you need more engiens to lift the extra fuel and potentialy more parachutes (asumeing not useing a powered landing) adding cost that is subject to the % return loss. If you can nail the runway/launchpad every time then this does not apply but if you miss by 100-50km that extra cost can add up and you still have extra fuel costs. The solids on the other hand are dirt cheep, most of the cost is the fuel and actualy recovering them is a negligable return. The separator is normally more valuable than the depleted booster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd on the subject of ineffiency due to not being able to precisely follow terminal velocity and lower ISP rockets, I\u0027d argue that its not a huge deal. Yes most pure solid stages end up going faster than terminal velocity and loose some effiency to drag. However if you loose out on 10-15% effective DV due to drag you gain it back by the fact that the solid was significantly cheeper than the liquid alternitive for the same impulse. You come out ahead on ISP for the same reason, the cost per dV on the solids is just that much lower than for the equivelent in liquid fuel you just come out ahead even with drag losses added in.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T22:50:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022merendel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022merendel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...My own experience has been that its significantly cheeper to get any significant payload to orbit useing a disposable solid first stage with a recoverable core that gets the rest of the way to orbit and then returns....\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs with my question to Sivert, can you say what you mean by \u0027significant payload\u0027, as I\u0027m finding SRBs don\u0027t add significantly to payloads over about 10 or 20t.

I spent around 10 complete rockets assemblies, and a few launch pads trying to get the SRBs from colliding into the core. The most troubleling being the Sepratrons destroying the core fuel tank.

But the truth is that it has two sides in KSP, one tyrant and one lenient one.

And the size and costs increases exponentially.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lenient side (at least in KSP) is when you try to increase the payload of a rocket that can already reach orbit. Doubeling the payload is as simple as doubeling the fuel and engines in each stage. Which net aproximantly double the costs. But since the rocket is bigger, it\u0027s possible to take advantage of bigger engines with better efficiencies. Which makes the rocket slightly cheaper per tonne of payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also the demonic side of the equation. Namely when you try to increase the delta v of a single stage where you have a thrust to weight ratio that must be met. Which is the case for an SSTO rocket. When you increase the delta v of such a rocket you meet a brick wall where the amount of fuel and engines needed explode into infinity. This is the reason why a SSTO using only solid rockets isn\u0027t possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus depending on how you\u0027re trying to scale your rocket the size and costs will either scale proportionally, exponentially or be hyperbolic.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-04T12:19:46Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2014 12:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Sivert3\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slugy","CreatedById":76281,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T20:17:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a mostly solid fuel launch of a 40t fuel station to LKO I did a while ago for a challenge: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/87211-0-24-s-Cost-Effective-Lifters-Challenge?p=1315927#post1315927\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elink\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could be optimised some more, and has no recovery - but still has under 1000Kr/tonne launcher cost.

I don\u0027t bother recovering the SRBs, but it\u0027s fairly time and cost effective to recover the central core.

No mater how you slice it you\u0027d never be able to achieve orbit as you\u0027d burn out before you could get high enough so you\u0027d reenter atmo. The big booster with just a stayputnik technicly has the dV to reach orbit you just cant make it achieve a stable one. It might work with carrying a couple smaller SRB\u0027s for use at AP to try and achieve and orbit but even if it works it isnt what I\u0027d call a funtional payload.

Launch. 2. Achieve orbit. 3. Actual mission craft. Recovering the launch stage would be quite a challenge, as it is usually quite massive and ejected while still in atmo, where it\u0027s automatically eliminated once it gets more than 2.5kms from the active part of the ship, so I don\u0027t try. Since economics were added, I just make that 2nd stage capable of de-orbiting and soft-landing after delivering the mission to orbit, which recoups a portion of the original cost.
