There are also strict speed limits. The speed limit within Kerbin controlled space is 0.1% the speed of light. Even at this speed, you can still do some heavy damage.

Kerbinese passenger liners like the one shown here can comfortably accomodate 60 kerbals at a time. However colonial populations are reaching self sustaining numbers, and passenger transport isn\u0027t as lucrative as it once was. It was never as lucrative as H2/He3 mining, to begin with. Kerbin spends more in H2/He3 than it earns in passenger transport. A dramatic trade imbalance results - Kerbin owes a lot of money to the Laythans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbin must change its business model or suffer economic ruin. The policy makers of Kerbin set out to enter the H2/He3 market. That\u0027s petty ambitious - H2/He3 mining is a well established industry.

Laythan corporations may hold a monopoly on the H2/He3 industry, but their prospects are dwindling. Jool\u0027s gravity makes mining difficult, and it appears mining operations have maxed out. Joolean SSTOs can only lift 1000 tons of payload at a time. The engineers of Laythe try to scale \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E payload by an order of magnitude, but the resulting craft is... large.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s so large it pushes the boundaries of KSP-IE\u0027s vanilla tweakscale config.

Perhaps now it makes economic sense to mine them?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith little fanfare, Kerbin establishes a small mining base over Tal. Tal is the sub-satellite of Wal, which itself is a satellite of Urlum. The Kerbinese see Tal as a location of strategic importance.

That\u0027s 50 tons. Star Boom 2 won\u0027t need as much payload because it will decelerate at its destination, and thereby make heavy use of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E. Payload is mostly comprised of communication equipment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDecelerating also means the upper stage engines need to power back on after several decades of disuse. That requires a reliable power source. Star Boom 1 used fission reactors, but its fuel was nearly gone by the time it reached its destination. So the upper stages of Star Boom 2 use a combination of fission and fusion. A 500MW fission reactor can sustain minimal power for several decades, after which it has just enough juice to kickstart a larger fusion reaction. The fusion reaction can then reliably power the lasers that initiate the explosive fusion reaction that propels the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLast but not least, deceleration means double the \u0394v requirements. Two stages have been added since Star Boom 1, which serve to accelerate the craft. Their engines are also powered by fusion reactors, the largest being 50GW (enough to power all of Great Britain). The radiators on the lowermost stage are disproportionately large due to a simple scaling law: thrust scales with volume, but thermal dissipation scales with surface area.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s also worth noting this is the first craft I ever designed using a computer algorithm. I used a gradient descent algorithm to determine the size of tanks, engines, reactors, and radiators. This is the same sort of algorithm that\u0027s often used to train neural networks.

They produce objects from a number of materials with the help of a shared automatic tool changer system. With the right tool, they could extrude thermoplastic, lay ceramic paste, weave fabric, mill titanium, weld inconel, pick-and-place circuit components, and many other things. The machines also manufacture other tools as need arises. With the right tooling and ingredients, they could print you a coffee mug, bake the ceramic, pour the coffee, and add some creamer to taste. A miniaturized \u0022lights-out\u0022 fabrication plant produces integrated circuits from a collection of onboard system-on-a-chip photomask sets, ranging from a simple drone core to a neural network ASIC for the ship\u0027s own artificial intelligence.

Each individual component has existed since the start of the space program. But tying it together was still a major undertaking. Never before has such a system been attempted. To mitigate risk of failure, all components for the mission are designed from the ground up to simplify manufacture by the ship\u0027s automation. Even for such an advanced civilization, it is a multi-national, multi-corporate endeavor.

The supercapacitor is slowly charged by two giant solar panels. It holds just enough juice to fire a nuclear pulse engine for short periods of time.

The Interplanetary Explorer has some modest automation aboard it which allows it to assemble landing craft from component parts, *in situ*. It only makes sense that a civilization capable of producing Von Neumann probes would also make use of automated manufacturing elsewhere.

I\u0027m not sure whether its a bug or a feature, but the upper atmosphere is so thick that terminal velocity is no more than a few m/s. I wind up designing a probe specifically for this planet.

Gravity is 2.2 times that of Kerbin, and it influences all aspects of the planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe atmosphere transitions 2.2 times as sharply as Kerbin. The likelihood of mountains is probably reduced by a similar factor. This behavior is governed by the what\u0027s known as the Boltzmann distribution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLife, where present, is stocky. The majority of the surface is covered by rolling grasslands. Tree trunks are sqrt(2.2) = 1.5 times the width of their Kerbin equivalents, given well known allometric relationships. The same could be said for the legs of animals - they would either be 1.5 times as thick, or 1.5 times as numerous, all other things being equal. However, there are no animals, because Ilve lacks the oxygen atmosphere that\u0027s necessary for motility. It\u0027s not clear why Ilve lacks oxygen given it there is photosynthetic life, but it is possible that the more massive atmosphere takes longer to become oxidized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe balloon probe for Ilve is modified with an electric propeller that works in the anoxic atmosphere. Entry into the atmosphere is rough, but the landing craft requires no modification.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/QGfykKl.mp4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://i.imgur.com/QGfykKl.mp4\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCal, the fiery moon of Ilve. Tidal heating causes vast oceans of molten rock to form on the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s virtually certain such a world would have an atmosphere, but it\u0027s difficult for me to predict the constituents. We do know the molecules of the atmosphere would have to be massive enough not to escape the weak gravity at the temperatures present. We can again use the Boltzmann distribution to make guesses. Gravity is 1/5 that of Kerbin, and given a surface temperature 3 times that of Kerbin (in Kelvin), we might guess an atmospheric molecular mass 3*5 = 15 times that of Kerbin. So instead of something like nitrogen (14g/mol), think of something heavier (14*15 = 210g/mol).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe also know the compounds must be gaseous, chemically inert, and relatively abundant given constraints. Mercury vapor is probably present (200g/mol, boiling point 630K), but there may be other, more common compounds of lighter elements. I really don\u0027t know.

As hard as it was constructing a Von Neumann probe, it only took 400 years following the discovery of space flight. That might sound like a long time, but 400 years is inconsequential compared to the age of the galaxy. Surely some other intelligent species must have constructed their own Von Neumann probe by now. But if that\u0027s the case, where are they? Shouldn\u0027t they have visited Kerbin?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat does this mean for the Kerbals? Should they be afraid? Do species die off shortly after becoming technological? Do they escape into virtual worlds? Do they never leave their parent stars? Are Kerbals the only species to have done so?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd what do we make of Bob and his Von Neumann machines? In every technical sense, they are alive: they reproduce, they consume energy and material, they respond to their environment, and they collectively grow and change. But they are a new kind of life, one that can live for centuries, reproduce like rabbits, and assume any body shape needed by their environment. Such an organism easily outcompetes any other known form of life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo do Kerbals stand a chance against them? Does the future even need them?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill the machines continue to serve their masters? Will they rebel? Will they compete for resources? Will they even bother with interaction?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if all goes well, how will Kerbal society adapt to the post-scarcity conditions offered by self reproducing machines?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps these questions are best left to another mission: a manned mission to the stars.

However, it cannot be too small, since you need to build big enough to generate gravity comfortably. You cannot have a generational ship without gravity of some kind (in real life, it would be essential for healthy pregnancy), and considering the outright hazard involved with a temporary loss of gravity on this scale (imagine your farm\u0027s top soil floating off), you would likely need to provide it without interruption.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo we need the smallest radius we can get away with while still providing comfortable gravity. But what radius is that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn his 1977 book, \u0022The High Frontier\u0022 Gerard O\u0027Neill discusses the possibility of creating long term human settlements aboard giant rotating habitats, now called \u0022O\u0027Neill\u0022 cylinders. In it, he discusses this very issue. Based on studies from the 1960s, he determines a 2 rpm rotation rate is the minimum that could be allowed for long term habitation, but even the most sensitive individuals require no acclimation to a 1 rpm rotation rate. Since we are obliged to accommodate generations of people to come, we will have to pick the more conservative estimate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt 1 rpm, you\u0027d need a cylinder 1km in radius to generate 1 g of gravity. However, since we already assume that sustainable colonies exist on Duna, we might also assume we could get by with as little as 1/3 g of gravity, which requires only 1/3km radius at this rpm. Please note this assumption is not a strict requirement for this mission. We could build a 1g setup without adding significant mass, and the steel should still be able to handle the tensile stresses generated. We\u0027d just have to build a bigger ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022OqN70zV.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022144.95\u0022 height=\u0022474\u0022 width=\u0022327\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/OqN70zV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for length: we want to minimize the length of the cylinder as much as possible, since length adds mass. The length of the cylinder would be affected by the size of the population.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome research suggests a minimum population of ~500 to maintain genetic diversity, but this is a general estimate that\u0027s only meant as a safe bet for most species. A more recent study (published in the book shown above) was geared for this specific scenario. It suggests a population of 160 would be sufficient for a 200 year transit period. You could reduce the population needed if you took genetic stores along with you, and you would probably take genetic stores along anyways in case of emergencies (the mass to do so is inconsequential, so there\u0027s no sense not to). These stores could maybe last 50 years without degradation. However requiring the use genetic stores to minimize population gets into uncomfortable territory where we\u0027re telling people what to do, so we won\u0027t go there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can lower the land area needed across ships if there are more than 3 ships. Multiple ships would have to be created anyways for testing, and creating ships in larger batches would only stand to drive down production costs and increase chance of success through redundancy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s important to note here a principle that we haven\u0027t previously stated: we are no longer dealing with crew members, here. There can be no crew members aboard the ship, since you could never expect to meaningfully pay someone for a life time of labor several light years away where no one is present to sell you things. There is only a population, people who have in effect bought property aboard the ship. Of course, the passengers have every reason as property owners to keep their property in good condition, especially when they need it to keep them alive, but it\u0027s not certain whether the institutional knowledge needed to conduct one-time mission procedures could survive long enough to last the full length of the mission. While we can allow the passengers to make decisions concerning the mission if they want to, it would be unreasonable to expect them to perform any sort of specialized mission procedure manually unless they were confident in doing so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince we are only dealing with civilian populations, we have to design for it. Hundreds of people would live out a significant portion of their lives under your engineering decisions. The closest modern parallel would be designing a passenger liner, or a housing complex. Normal operations must allow for comfort, and emergency operations must allow for ample civility. You can\u0027t wind up with a situation like the Titanic where you only have life boats for a fraction of the passengers. You can\u0027t wind up with a situation like Pruitt-Igoe where your tenants fear going out into public spaces. You can\u0027t wind up with a situation where a population rebels due to strict mission parameters. Your minimums must center around accommodations that are generous by any standard. And as with any modern manned aerospace engineering, triple redundancy for safety critical components is mandatory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KyqUxQV.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002286.17\u0022 height=\u0022517\u0022 width=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/KyqUxQV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo we start with the following requirements:\u003Cbr\u003E\n* remaining ship(s) must be able to accommodate population of 2 ships\u003Cbr\u003E\n* minimum population after 200 years must be 160 people after 2 ships lost\u003Cbr\u003E\n* maximum transit time must be 200 years\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe find the situation reduces to the following relations:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(n-2) * p \u2265 160\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(n-2) * P = n * p\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhere n is the number of ships, p is the population per ship, and P is the maximum population each ship needs to allow for in terms of land area. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing 4 ships would more than halve the total land area needed across ships, and would require 80 people per ship with the ability to accommodate up to 160 in an emergency. In the worst scenario allotted for, where the population of two ships are lost, the surviving population could then continue for 200 years without suffering genetic decline.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing 5 ships would cut land area down by a third, but would require 50 people per ship.

As always, the major problem isn\u0027t building the ship, but fueling it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mission time we drafted earlier was limited to 200 years due to genetic constraints. To reach the nearest star system in this time requires a top speed of ~2%c. The ship is too large and too slow for an aerobrake to work, so half of your propellant would be needed to decelerate. So the delta-V budget is 4%c. This is roughly the exhaust velocity of the engines, so that means the mass ratio is ~1:3, and the ship weighs ~7 megatons. So let\u0027s say... 20 megatons of fuel. *sigh*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrying to build an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E that fuels the ship in reasonable time pushes against the limits of the default tweakscale.

This is enough to push this payload with a thrust-to-weight ratio of 0.03. Even subsonic aircraft have thrust to weight ratios on the order of 0.2, and we would need to build an aircraft capable of hypersonic flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022mqsHHxA.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022115.42\u0022 height=\u0022666\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/mqsHHxA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought instead I should go the orbital refinery route, but the resulting craft (shown here) is also... large.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s so large that it exploded as soon as I tried finalizing construction in orbit, and since then I\u0027ve somehow gotten it stuck up past where Hangar Extender won\u0027t let me reach it.

It turns out the amount of farmland that\u0027s actually needed to support a human is much less than what\u0027s allotted by traditional agriculture. Since crops are small during their first few months of growth, you can grow an older generation of crops above them while the new generation is just getting started.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPicture a process similar to what this man is doing: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adW3GCQGHug\u0026amp;t=330s.\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adW3GCQGHug\u0026amp;t=330s.\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile it may not be practical for industrial agriculture, it may be useful to a colony that needs to save on space. This technique can massively increase yield per unit of farmland. A single acre of farmland could provide enough food to feed 25 people on a varied diet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt 25 people per acre, you could support our target population of 160 people with just 6.4 acres. During regular operation, when not in an emergency, the same land belongs to only half this number. This provides everyone with about 1/3 acre of land, and they have all 6.4 acres to wander if they\u0027re comfortable sharing. Picture a set of luxury condominiums surrounded by dense automated communal gardens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022OsWMRr3.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002285.75\u0022 height=\u0022660\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/OsWMRr3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith this amount of living space you\u0027d only need a cylinder that\u0027s 13m in length. At this point, the bulk of the mass is wasted on the walls, so we reconfigure the walls to serve as the floor. The O\u0027Neill cylinder is now just a habitat dome in a centrifuge (shown above, with the space plane hanger shown for scale).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis needn\u0027t be the only configuration, mind you. For instance, instead of using a centrifuge, you could instead just kick the ship in and out of a spin every burn. As long as the engines have enough thrust to cause noticeable gravity, you can expect to have some amount of gravity aboard. This would vastly simplify ship design, since you now only have a single axis along which tension or compression could occur, but it severely complicates course correction and ship keeping. It\u0027s pretty wild to imagine a 1 kilometer star ship kicking itself into a 1 rpm spin, but ultimately I went with a more conservative design that I feel would be far more likely to see in reality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00229bQiTjH.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022115.42\u0022 height=\u0022666\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/9bQiTjH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSwitching to the smaller habitat saved me lots of mass. The combined habitat space now weighs only 4kT. The upper stage dry mass is 6kT, just small enough to allow for the largest available aerobrake and its surrounding hardware. The dry mass of the entire assembly is just 40kT. I can now build and fuel the entire starship without having to design any extra infrastructure, and still wind up with a top speed of 10%c. Mission time is just 40 years!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was also much more enjoyable designing the habitat dome than it was for the O\u0027Neill cylinder. The O\u0027Neill cylinder has to be represented with a bland grey fuel tank from the Procedural Parts mod (enterprising modders, take note!). The habitat dome on the other hand comes from the Civilian Populations mod. If I put two habitat domes at the largest Tweakscale setting on opposite ends of the centrifuge then I get just enough space to support 160 people. The result looks a lot nicer and I get a lot of nice screenshots of what people see when they\u0027re in the habitat. It also feels much like playing Sim City in Kerbal Space Program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022M9ubjLM.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002253.78\u0022 height=\u0022263\u0022 width=\u0022489\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/M9ubjLM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven though our craft needs only to last only 40 years, we still have to consider whether it can last that long with passengers aboard. We might take some precedence from oil tankers, here: they\u0027re mobile, they spend their entire service life floating in their operational environment, and most of the time, the repairs they need are small, affecting an area that\u0027s not on the same order of magnitude as the ship itself. The real life oil tanker, \u0022MS Berge Stahl\u0022 has a deadweight tonnage that\u0027s comparable to the mass of our generational starship, around 300 kilotons. It was built in 1986 and still sees operation to this day, 34 years later. So there is some precedence for structures of this scale to last for the duration we need. And arguably the problem becomes even easier in space, where we no longer have to worry about operating in a highly corrosive salt water environment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the major difference here is that oil tankers can fuel up when they get back to harbor. We still have to consider consumables like fuel or air. The issues with fuel storage have already been addressed by others (see the technical report for Project Daedalus, referenced in the first interstellar mission write up), but this is the first interstellar mission where we have to concern ourselves with air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s almost certain that air will leak in transit, but we have to define what amount is acceptable. We are interested in the size of a leak needed to drain a volume of space within 40 years to some unacceptable threshold. We will assume the volume begins at room temperature with 1 atm of pressure, and our threshold of interest is 15% (bringing us to about the air pressure of Denver). The pressure we end up with is close enough to our starting pressure that we will assume the air loss is linear. Since the leak will be most severe when the volume is fully pressurized, and since we are modeling for the worst case, we extrapolate from the loss rate at the start of the leak. (R code shown above, no apologies for lack of clarity)\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe find that if no resupply is ever sent to the ship, it would only take a hole 7.5mm in diameter to bring the atmosphere to intolerable levels by the end of the mission. We\u0027ll note that leakage is linear to the area of the leak in the model, so if two holes add up to the area of that 7.5mm hole, it will still lose air at the same rate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou would expect that shortening mission time would permit for larger holes, but if the likelihood of the hole scales with diameter then the effect is lackluster. A mission of 10 years could still be foiled by a 15mm hole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00225BENEXl.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002285.75\u0022 height=\u0022660\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/5BENEXl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the best solution might be to imitate submarines, which pump water out to allow long duration stays beneath the water. However, rather than pumping water out, we will pump the air back in. If the cylinder is double walled, the air between the walls can be evacuated. If there is a leak in one wall, it will take a while before the space between walls equilibrates. This can be modeled by the same equations shown earlier. Pressure in the space between can be monitored to check for leaks, and a pump can push air back into the cylinder when a leak is detected. If there is a leak in both walls, then as long as the pumps reduce pressure in the space between, the loss of air will be minimized. We could add any number of redundant walls as needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI depict this double wall visually within the domes of the ship (shown above).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPreparation, assembly, and the societal structure of a generation ship:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222ZUIVgi.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022117.67\u0022 height=\u0022661\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/2ZUIVgi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTime passes. A set of prototypes for the upper stage are created, which remain in the Kerbolar system. Property is bought and sold aboard the prototypes just as with any other space habitat. However these habitats are different. Their engines allow for interplanetary travel, with enough delta-V to last many years without refueling. Every once and a while, a prototype ship fires its engines, and it travels to another destination in the Kerbolar system, perhaps in a repeating cycle.

By-laws as part of that association place penalties on households exceeding a certain number of occupants, direct repair work within the habitat, and designate officials such as sheriff, communications officer, etc. A board of directors oversees changes to policies. Limits on the size of a household are designed to make sure the population remains stable. Most of the people here have shared years together living aboard prototype ships and they tend to be like-minded concerning the project, so even at the outset they form a fairly tight knit community. Certain things like the size of families might simply come down to a gentleman\u0027s agreement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSmall government has its share of problems, such as nepotism, incompetence, bike-shedding, short-term thinking, or deadlock. If left unchecked, these problems could prove catastrophic aboard a generational starship. To combat them, the responsibilities of the home owner\u0027s association are limited to the ship\u0027s habitats. A ship council is elected by the general population to oversee matters outside of habitation, concerning the maintenance of the ship and execution of its mission procedures. Members of the council are required to hold some degree of higher learning that pertains to their specialization, and much like the U.S. supreme court, they serve lifetime appointments to prevent politics from getting in the way of passenger safety. Virtually all responsibilities of the council could be subsumed by the ship A.I. should it need to, but having the council aboard allows the residents to exercise some sense of control over their lives. If the ship council is unable to come to a unanimous decision then the decision automatically defers to the ship A.I. The ship A.I. selects competing solutions from a number of subsystems, much like how Google runs their current search algorithm. Subsystems include an expert system designed by mission planners at the start of the mission, an A.I. that implements high level council directives to the best extent possible, and an A.G.I. that provides creative solutions in the event of unforeseen situations. Council members have the ability to view all competing solutions and pick from them as well, and if they their decision is unanimous, they override the master A.I.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCouncil business rarely intersects with those of the residents, but to promote transparency, a member of the ship council serves as outreach.

Since the ship in concept must always rotate to generate artificial gravity, it can never stop for you to dock with it. The front half of the vehicle is taken up by the aerobrake though, so you can\u0027t provide a central docking bay a la Space Odyssey.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFortunately, the ship only rotates at 1 rpm. The hub at the docking bay is only 20m in diameter (~63m in circumference) so it\u0027s only spinning a little over 1m/s, slow enough for a nimble ship to approach it. Bigger ships could likely dock as well but would require reducing gravity in the centrifuge. The solution I came up with is to use a rotating platform. Every once a minute, the craft that\u0027s docking has an opportunity to advance into the path of the oncoming platform, where it waits for the platform to sweep it up. A lip runs along the platform, preventing the craft from sliding off if it idles there for too long.\u00A0 Once the craft is on the platform, it can then dock at its leisure. Larger craft do the same thing, only they step directly into the path of an oncoming docking port, which is positioned along the side of a tower. The tower is only ~20m off from the axis, so it only travels at about ~1 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSide note: I discovered a bug in the game while trying to dock with the ship.

However this couldn\u0027t be done for this craft, since the fore of the ship was already occupied by the aerobrake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNevertheless, it would be essential to provide shielding to the habitats since an impact there could result in loss of life. But the habitats are a large and constantly rotating protrusion. The blast shield would need to be a radius equal to theirs, and this would be a considerable amount of mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever the blast shield need not be thick enough to block everything it comes into contact with. Whatever strikes the blast shield will likely be obliterated from relativistic impact, so your only concern then becomes secondary debris strike. If you move the blast shield several kilometers out in front of the ship, the dispersion renders secondary debris strike negligible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo blast shields can be wafer thin, just like radiators, and it just so happens the radiators were already about the same size needed to protect the habitats. Why not use radiators then?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can further save on shielding mass if the blast shield rotates in lockstep with the habitats, but this requires the blast shield to have good balance. Since I\u0027m re-purposing the radiators as the blast shield, this means the first stage also needs good balance. The radiators should offer protection perpendicular to one of the principle axes of the first stage, and the axis of protection should run along the center of mass. I usually align radiators to run parallel to the thrust axis, but the center of mass changes along the thrust axis of the first stage depending on things like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E propellant, violating the second condition.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could solve the problem using a ballast tank to store unused \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E propellant, but this would require constantly adjusting ballast throughout flight. To avoid over engineering the problem, I simply rotated the radiators by 90 degrees. The radiators are still the biggest thing on the first stage so the principle axis it rotates along shouldn\u0027t change. The radiators in this configuration would likely be in poor alignment with the sun most of the time, but this is okay since the vast majority of operation is spent in interstellar space where heat from the sun is negligible. The ship engines merely run on reduced power when in the inner system, then when the ship reaches the outer system the main radiators deploy, allowing long duration burns at higher thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo avoid the risk of secondary debris strike, the first stage has its own guidance and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E systems that allow it to travel several kilometers ahead of the vehicle and keep aligned.

Four generations exist on board the ships, in total. Each has their own perspectives of the mission based upon their upbringing and the circumstances that brought them here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe oldest generation are responsible for funding the mission through their purchase of real estate aboard the ship. The generation that purchases the real estate would be fabulously wealthy: eccentric noveau riche with little taste for luxury. They are fanatics who believe in the ideals of the mission so strongly that they are willing to spend their money and lives on it. As such, we will call them \u0022the financiers\u0022. It is their goal to live long enough to see their arrival at the new star systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s likely that anyone who\u0027s had enough time to gather such a fortune would already be past the typical age to have children. I\u0027m sure in the spirit of the free market the property would be available for purchase to anyone willing to pay for it, regardless whether they have children, but it would be antithetical to the project if all but a few families die off before reaching the destination, and the residents know it. Buying an estate here only makes sense when someone is around to inherit it. Someone among their next of kin should be willing enough to travel with them and inherit the estate. Obviously, this goes a little easier when the person doing so is making the choice for themselves. It makes the most sense for this younger generation to be in their twenties or thirties, old enough to make decisions for themselves but young enough to have children that will never miss Kerbin, maybe a few entrepreneurially minded sorts that take after their parents and have it in mind to inherit the family business of sorts. We\u0027ll call this generation \u0022the prot\u00E9g\u00E9s\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor those too young to decide for themselves whether to take the trip, either those born after embarkment or those who were too young to decide, they will have a much different narrative to tell. Let\u0027s call them the \u0022shipborn\u0022. Some of their story mirrors those of the U.S. immigrants of the 1800s, children sent overseas with their parents with little prospect of return and little say in the matter, and children born after the emigration who have no memory of the old country. So there is some precedence that the people of this generation could adapt and still live well adjusted lives. For the bulk of their adult lives, life would be much like that in an isolated rural community. All this generation ever knows is a small town of 80 people, and a few scarcely visited settlements on other ships in the fleet. The petabytes of Kerbin records aboard the ship are all available to them though, and one day they\u0027ll get to see things like mountains and oceans, just not right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAmong the shipborn, some are comfortable enough to stay where they are and foster a sense of community. The vast majority might be satisfied enough just to move to a new ship where they can get away from their relatives and establish their own identity. Lifeboats are available if a large enough fraction of them want to return to Kerbol, and even if only a few want to leave, it is within the capabilities of Kerbol to send out sleeper ships for a return. However, precision issues at these distances prohibit the game from simulating docking while in interstellar space, so we forgo demonstrating the capability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe generation that comes after the shipborn have few ties to the old star system. This generation better identifies as residents of the new star system, and so we will call them \u0022the Kirbani\u0022. To this generation, taking a ship back to Kerbin would make as much sense as an average American uprooting to live in Europe with some distant cousins from his great grand dad\u0027s line. The records of Kerbol are fun to pour over, but more for their retro charm than for any sense of nostalgia or longing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeceleration and arrival at Nova Kirbani:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Me7jnje.mp4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://i.imgur.com/Me7jnje.mp4\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ship council settles on a date for deceleration years in advance. Weeks ahead, the council outreach gives advice on what to expect in a newsletter. Most of the people who still remember the acceleration from the start of the mission are in their 60s now, so this will be new to the rest of the passengers. Even the old timers haven\u0027t seen the aerobrakes in action, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe event proceeds much like the viewing of an eclipse. People gather. Some watch from their roofs or the rims of the dome. A familiar voice calls out mission milestones over the loudspeaker. It\u0027s the council outreach speaking. Next callout is for unfurling, now at T-10. The crowd fills the rest of the countdown. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the aerobrake unfurls, filling a large fraction of their field of view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext callout is activation. An aurora slowly emerges, starting from the center of the aerobrake. Ions strike the magnetic field at relativistic speed. Oohs and aahs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe power to the aerobrakes is turned on slowly, over many days, so that the habitats don\u0027t experience any sudden shifts in gravity. The auroras eventually grow to encompass half of the viewing field, but the centrifuges slowly spiral noseward so gravity continues running tangent to the floor of the habitat. People notice their view from the dome is changing to face the engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/7FR8VsD.mp4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://i.imgur.com/7FR8VsD.mp4\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a while, deceleration slows. The aurora dies down, and the centrifuges return to their usual position. The craft has reached the end to what its aerobrakes can meaningfully accomplish, and the engines must now shed the remaining velocity. The aerobrake is jettisoned (a countdown party of its own), carrying with it a heavy power plant and its radiators. The remaining upper stage has a much smaller fusion reactor, and should an emergency call for it, a laser from the aerobrake assembly can beam power to a receiver aboard the remaining upper stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/un9JF2V.mp4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://i.imgur.com/un9JF2V.mp4\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFour ships must perform their deceleration maneuvers at roughly the same time.

She is the oldest ship in the fleet, first of the \u0022Amana\u0022 class starships - the most overbuilt, but also least refined. She completes her journey safely, but not without incident. She runs out of liquid helium shortly before entering her target star system. This liquid helium was used as propellant for her reaction control systems. The ship council nevertheless steers the ship into a stable orbit, using the gimbaled thrust of its engines to orient the ship at a glacial pace. This causes her to eventually exhaust the propellant in her main tanks, but fortunately by this point she is already safely in orbit around the star. A negligible amount of propellant is transferred from her life boats shortly before completing her journey.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe flies by the moon of \u0022Alar\u0022 before settling in orbit around \u0022Blalo\u0022, a habitable planet orbiting The analogue of Alpha Centauri B.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022XkHdNfK.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022114.67\u0022 height=\u0022663\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/XkHdNfK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe \u0022Wikieup\u0022 fares best among the ships in the fleet.

Things don\u0027t go so well for her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblems emerge as the craft tries to decelerate. The onboard fusion reactor is not able to supply the nominal 2 terawatts to the aerobrake. The reason behind this design flaw is never fully understood, but I think a change was made specific to this ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a result of the design flaw, the aerobrakes can only run at half power. Normally, this would not be a serious issue. The situation could be resolved simply by deploying the aerobrakes extra early. However, by the time the design flaw is discovered, it is already too late to deploy them early. No procedure was put into place to test the aerobrakes before its deceleration, since the effects of a design change like this were never considered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ship still has options though. The aerobrake slows the craft at a rate that\u0027s proportionate to the square of its velocity, so it becomes much less effective at low velocity. However the engines can decelerate at any speed up to a certain limit, and each ship comes equipped with a a little extra fuel for such occasions. So the ship council need only offset the time spent on the aerobrakes for time spent on the engines. The council decide they will run the aerobrake for as long as needed until the ship can kill its remaining speed with the current remaining fuel reserves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis string of events plays out over the course of several years, which is just enough time for the ship council to enter a dangerous state of complacency. Handling unforeseen circumstances such as this is a regular part of council membership at this stage in the mission. The ship has seen continuous habitation for over 40 years, during which many components have reached the end of their service lives and have needed replacement, while other components have experienced unforeseen wear due to regular interaction with the residents. Inexperience also starts to play a role at this point in the mission. Many of the original council members from the start of the mission have since retired or passed on, leaving a second generation of less experienced council members to take their place. The news about the aerobrakes comes off as no cause for concern. The ship council carries on making decisions. The ship A.I. is largely out of the situation, and the residents are either ill-informed or ill-attentive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022abNtEAo.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002285.75\u0022 height=\u0022661\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/abNtEAo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBanking on the surplus fuel for deceleration turns out to be the last mistake the council makes. The fuel reserves are either overestimated, or the ship council fails to account for losses due to course correction, but in either case, the miscalculation soon becomes apparent. The ship will run out of fuel before it fully decelerates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat was once thought to be a recoverable error now turns out to be much more serious. The residents cannot simply transfer to another ship, since those ships are also in the process of decelerating. Having them match speed with the Ahmeek would place their own residents in danger, since they would themselves likely run out of fuel. The only remaining course of action is to abandon ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ZJmb5kT.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002285.75\u0022 height=\u0022660\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ZJmb5kT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are 66 souls aboard the Ahmeek at this point. There are lifeboats available that seat up to 80. The Ahmeek is fortunate that its home owner\u0027s association was able to limit the size of its population in recent years. Many of the first generation Ahmeek residents have passed on from old age in recent years, and birth rates have temporarily slowed thanks to a political climate that has favored stiff taxes placed on large households and a vocal PR campaign.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe council outreach makes the difficult but dutiful announcement to the residents.

There are lifeboats for all, plenty of time to prepare, and a clear call to action. Nevertheless, a tense political battle emerges between the board of directors and ship council. The former tries to wrest control of the ship from the latter, seeing the council as inept. The latter fights the attempt, seeing it as irresponsible. The fight amounts to little. While the council is locked in battle with the board, the ship A.I. carries on its duties, managing the ship. Regardless of who wins, everyone agrees the ship must be abandoned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a year of deceleration, the engines exhaust their propellant.

If pressed, they could make the entire journey back to Kerbin on their own, the only downside being the decades of time spent in hibernation. These lifeboats however need not make the journey back. They\u0027re already inside their target star system, traveling at a leisurely 1%c.

Power to the aerobrake and engine is supplied by a 10GW thermovoltaic receiver, which receives beamed power either from beamed power stations around the target star or from the other ships in fleet. As of right now, the lifeboats are close enough to the target star system that they can rely solely on the beamed power stations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach lifeboat uses the same H2/He3 propellant that\u0027s used by the Ahmeek. A single lifeboat has a delta-V of 10%c.

In 54 years, it will pass out of the star system. Its environmental control systems were left fully operational, the evacuating residents paying little attention to the matter. The ship A.I. is now left alone, and with no one aboard to override its decisions, it takes up control over the habitats in addition to all the usual ship maintenance. In a way, it retires and takes up gardening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a time, the plants and insects aboard the ship carry out their lives as usual, now undisturbed by the residents.

Just as long as there is power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ship no longer has enough fuel to power its reactors. Virtually all of its fuel was spent during deceleration. It was expected the ship could rely on a modest supply of beamed power for its remaining mission, but that beamed power is soon also cut. The lifeboats need it much more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is still charge left in its supercapacitors. There is in fact a lot of charge in the supercapacitors, since they were overbuilt as an added safety feature. However, in time, this too will fail. The ship A.I. will have to increasingly cut power to nonessentials, until at last only two essentials remain. The first essential is the ship\u0027s environmental control systems, allowing primitive plant and insect life to continue in the habitats.

They are starting to present multiple points of failure. Ivy covers the inner domes, trying to gain purchase over trusses and gaskets, perhaps breaking through to colonize the space between walls. Plants produce an unforeseen surplus of oxygen, causing structures to corrode at a faster rate, and presenting the risk of fire. Insects chew through wires. It is now a race to see if the life within the habitat snuffs itself out before the power goes out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond this point the number of possibilities escapes our grasp, but we learn from studying entropy that the number of equiprobable possibilities that lead to an outcome dictates the outcome\u0027s probability. In this case, there are many possibilities, all presumed equiprobable, but virtually all lead to the same outcome:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe temperature inside the ship settles to the same temperature as cosmic background, 3 degrees above absolute zero.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/028pUXP.mp4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://i.imgur.com/028pUXP.mp4\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile unfortunate, the loss of a vehicle need not result in the loss of its passengers. One of the remaining ships, the Wikieup, redirects to Taythe in response to the disaster. This is done both to ease the burden on the lifeboats as well as to ensure the colonization of a higher priority destination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a year\u0027s time, the lifeboats intercept the Wikieup.

Docking ports exist on the lifeboat, but none are capable of docking with the specialized interface at the hub of the starship. Furthermore, both the starship and the lifeboats lack all but nuclear pulse engines for propulsion, so they can only match speed with each other if they are at a safe distance, lest they irradiate the residents. Finally, the majority of the residents would be young, inexperienced, or infirm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor all these reasons, shuttle craft would have to be sent out from the Wikieup to intercept the lifeboat while miles distant. However, the docking bug I noted at the start of the mission precludes redocking shuttles with the starship, so my in-game solution is simply to EVA each resident individually. It\u0027s tedious work, but it makes for a much more cinematic experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ifH6uC1.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022115.42\u0022 height=\u0022666\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ifH6uC1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe crisis is resolved, now. All residents of the four ships have safely inserted into the target star system. The Kerbals look forward, pragmatic. The home owner associations lift measures to restrict populations. Over the next few decades, the populations within the star system will nearly double.

Some residents, namely the older generation, may choose never to leave the starship, whereas younger generations may want to explore the planets at first opportunity. Transport will gradually become regular, to the point where residents can travel to and from the surface as they please, but for now, they settle with sending a small party of three to explore the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA space capsule is tailor made for the planet.

Beyond this point, we soon run against the limits to what the game can represent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMigrations to other star systems will likely be expedited now that precedence is set, but it will still take many generations for the interest to be generated to do so.

Barring the discovery of unforeseen technology, the Kerbals are now spread so far across so many different stars and planets that their survival is now more favorable than ever before. Progress will be slow, but inevitable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough there is no sign that the Von Neumann probes will ever go away, there is no reason to believe that coexistence with them is not possible for hundreds of millennia to come. The planets on which the Kerbals reside are too large for the machines to practically mine. The machines are much more successful colonizing the stars breadth-first, disregarding terrestrial planets to focus on the moons and gas giants from which they derive fuel and metal. At the current rates of travel within our game, it will take at least a hundred thousand years before they are even capable of traversing the full length of the galaxy, saying nothing of when they will reach saturation. The galaxy is vast, and can provide for us all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is likely the Kerbals will never catch up to the accomplishments of the machines, but again, it matters little. The continued prosperity of biological life is all the Kerbals could ever want. There is the comfort of simple living, and the challenge of a boundless frontier. On many habitable worlds, the Kerbals can live as they always have. Some populations may advance. Some may retreat to agrarian life, or to hunter-gathering. Some may undergo countless cycles of decay and renewal before returning to the stars all over again. Some will evolve and diverge into forms beyond our wildest imagination. And together, they will be as numerous as the stars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00228derKRF.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022115.42\u0022 height=\u0022666\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/8derKRF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is the distant future, one millennium after the founding of the space program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kerbals have reached the stars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe End\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-04-18T21:22:31Z\u0022 title=\u002204/18/2021 09:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EApril 18, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Pipcard\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theJesuit","CreatedById":122369,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-19T01:16:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFantastic... and is inspiring me to do something similar with the Simplex mods.\u00A0 I love the self replicating concept and the long term vision.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
