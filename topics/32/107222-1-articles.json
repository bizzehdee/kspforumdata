So what to do now? Being an intermediate level player I was looking for a career challenge that is truly hard and not just grinding. After setting to extreme hard I found it tougher because of the part and facility limitations and was required to think outside the box to complete the earlier missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe initial play was alright by my opinion and has not been that long in my time (only six hours). Traveling to new areas (various places around KSC) and repeating experiments (Bob the scientist has a special purpose), the improved World Records system also reduced that grindy feeling. So continuing on I managed an orbit and now at the point where the Mun is next. The only wall I have found is the launchpad upgraded will cost 750 000 kerbucks and the only reasonable method I have is to grind science from space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/2jY4Q\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I practiced many times slapping my vessel together and with redesigning sometimes there would be a mix up which would result in causing problems in the execution of the flight.
