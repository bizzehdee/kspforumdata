But then I look around and I find more command pods, four of them in total, all with Jeb in. So A this point you can guess that the station duplicated it\u0027s self and then promptly collided with it\u0027s self. But wait two of the capsules where no were near the over two but where on there own at vastly different points of the orbit on there own, with no change in the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I don\u0027t know if this is a Bug in the Base game as I have three mods installed. one being an alpha.
