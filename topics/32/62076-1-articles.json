I have only had trouble here, recently, when I one time forgot to remove a docking ring I had attached facing the one I was using, for a reason i can\u0027t remember now. I had to remember to \u0022undock\u0022 that single part so I sailed into docking at 0.4 m/s and bounced off, and was scratching my lil\u0027 head until I remembered the wayward part. Other than that I almost never fail to dock the first time. I\u0027ve got rendezvous and docking down . . . they do get difficult when working with extra-small gravities since the slightest impulse has a gigantic impact but I\u0027ve internalized how to properly build a stable ship with good control, which is IMHO 90% of successful docking, having a ship that doesn\u0027t wobble like crazy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething I got relatively good at too before the 0.23 update was estimating my rocket sizes on the fly, after building so many. That\u0027s 2 1/2 years of rocket-building experience, not some quirky talent, though. I finally got Kerbal Engineer because 0.23 didn\u0027t introduce quite so much in the way of new functioning, so I kind of got bored and decided to see if I could do better with some numbers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also was doing this over a year ago: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VPc3eqRwLc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VPc3eqRwLc\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI searched for Kerbal-style Curiosity landing and either mine is the highest-rated, or it put mine on top because I\u0027m searching for it Either way, the picture-perfect landing of my rover is still something I\u0027m really proud to have accomplished. You can also see me kvetching about wobbly docking and I realized it\u0027s because this was the first introduction of docking and as is my way, I took the idea completely out of control and made the biggest monster I could manage before attempting to see if it was spaceworthy. Wow was that thing exciting to drive!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is, this is not an ordinary game, and the headroom for developing skill is really really large. So, I have not gotten tired of what I\u0027m learning here. I cannot think of any game I\u0027ve ever owned that I could spend this much time with and not get bored. I spent scores of hours playing one or the other half-life or portal or duke nukem or jedi knight years ago but no one of them ever occupied my attention for two and a half years so relentlessly. I did get better at it and that\u0027s why it is such an awesome game. Most games with this kind of difficulty level make me work like the dickens to hop over the correct pixel, which I find insulting. This game makes me work for my every achievement entirely on my own merits, which I greeted with a kind of \u0022FINALLY SOMEONE GETS IT\u0022 and have never looked back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I achieve something really spectacular, like that Curiosity landing, it is a goal I set for me, as high as I want, as out-of-the-ordinary as I wanted, and I was able to hit it. There were no boundaries outside of the credible, believable, not-insultingly-limiting physics. So yes people are getting very good at this because it in the best way actively encourages us to creatively solve very difficult problems, on our own initiative.

I had had enough of watching a 0.2 fps slideshow as my juggernaut, 600-part crafts struggled against lag with barely enough juice to go interplanetary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI learnt the delta-V equation and made a spreadsheet to calculate the minimum amount of fuel needed for a stage with a given engine/mass etc. From then on I have been a lot better. I managed to get to Mun and back with a 33 ton rocket, and to Duna and back with a 220 ton rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInitially I had to learn to dock, simply because I was so bad at making efficient crafts that I needed to refuel as often as possible. My first return trip to Duna consisted of sending up countless rockets up to a create a fuelling station (it probably took about 5 launches just to get a couple of orange tank\u0027s worth of fuel in there), fly it to Duna, then repeat again for another fuelling station in LKO and finally send a massive ship, which after two refuels, managed to limp back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t actually done any docking in quite a while (I have been trying to design missions so they don\u0027t need to), so I\u0027ll probably be pretty rusty at it when I try again. I\u0027m currently designing a ship to complete the Jool-5 challenge.

What really surprised me, though is that I had never heard about efficient ejection angles until a few weeks ago.
