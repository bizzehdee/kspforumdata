Within hours of me doing this, I noticed that a modder has made a Linear Aerospike Mod, Scott Manley would mention it in a video, and RLA would put one into production as well. How did I set off this wierd chain reaction of Linear Aerospikes? Am I made of magicalness? Was it all a coincidence? Is someone stalking me and relaying ideas to other people? Did I post something about the Linear Aerospike and don\u0027t remember? This all happened within 3 or so days.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T10:59:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.damninteresting.com/the-baader-meinhof-phenomenon/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBaader-Meinhof phenomenon.\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T12:27:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, although that has happened to me before.
