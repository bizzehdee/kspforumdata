I\u0027ve never had a joystick installed, and kept my hands off the keyboard/mouse the whole time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShip has Mk1 command pod, remote guidance unit (so I wouldn\u0027t have to kill Jeb), and inline stabilizer. It has no tailfins and uses the LV-T30 engine, so no gimballing. Any control (as I understand SAS) will therefore have to come from rotation wheels and RCS (when enabled). It also has two SRBs attached so it can reach orbit (one on each side of the main payload, in an east-west orientation).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI launched 10 times with SAS disabled and 10 times with SAS enabled. I took my final heading/elevation readings when the SRBs cut out, as the SAS was always able to bring me back vertical after they detached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith SAS disabled, the rocket tended to go either west (270\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, 284\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, 234\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, 237\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0) or southeast (133\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, 109\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, 142\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, 121\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, 156\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, 114\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0). Final elevations ranged from 75-87\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, and didn\u0027t seem to follow a pattern with direction. This may have something to do with the SRBs being on the east and west sides of the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith SAS enabled (but RCS disabled), the rocket tended to go west (7/10 trials - 262\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, 265\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, 265\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, 282\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, 276\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, 259\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, 264\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0). However, in two of the trials, SAS decided to take me southeast (119\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, 96\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0). Only in one trial did I really manage to go straight up (just a tiny bit east, elevation at 89\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 or better). All other elevations ranged from 84-87\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, I launched 5 times with both SAS and RCS enabled. In four of the tests, I ended on a heading of 270\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and 88\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 elevation. RCS remaining from my 100-unit tank ranged from 98.36-99.13. In the other test I went straight up, with no detectable heading, 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 elevation, and 99.51 RCS remaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, it seems to be less of over/under-correcting and more of a westward bias by the SAS. It is physically possible to fly this thing vertically (as shown by two of the tests, and I\u0027ve done this manually too). It\u0027s possible that this has to do with the aging speed of my computer - SAS might not be able to check all the required parameters before it\u0027s required to respond, and those small errors accumulate over time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wayfare","CreatedById":52072,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T17:36:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid some more testing on quickly-built rockets and design definitely seems to be a factor.

This leads to a sluggish response and cases where the SAS simply doesn\u0027t fight hard enough to compensate for drift caused by slight instabilities in design, even if they\u0027re so minor that old ASAS handled them perfectly - or, indeed, manual flight without an excessive amount of input.

What I mean is that there IS definite drift in the attitude, especially apparent after you start a gravity turn after launch. If you have enough control surfaces (by that I mean winglets, gimbaled engines and RCS), the drift seems to lessen. But the fact that you can manually correct for the drift with less control surfaces means that SAS is NOT using the control surfaces to its full potential.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-SAS does \u003Cem\u003Eappear\u003C/em\u003E to attempt to hold attitude better if you tap \u0027F\u0027 when you\u0027ve reached your desired attitude after rotating, rather than at the point where you let go of a rotation key.
