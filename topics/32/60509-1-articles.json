With fewer parts, it\u0027s easier to set more reasonable goals, achieve them, and then naturally look around to what to reach for next.

Giving players every part doesn\u0027t encourage them to use simpler parts in new ways. Personally, starting in career and learning how to do more with less has taught me to design much more efficient rockets. My latest mission in my current career mode game (Second career mode game overall) was going to Duna, Landing on Ike, and putting probes on Duna\u0027s surface prior to getting mainsails or nukes.
