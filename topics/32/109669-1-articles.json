Lately it seems like there\u0027s been quite a bit of complaining about the new aero and other aspects of 1.02. There have been a lot of duplicate threads and people annoyed at each other.\n\nMy question for you is: how can someone like myself, a relatively new user, be good member of the community? What specific tips would you give to a new member? What is the role of criticism, both of the developers and of other users? How can all members work together to maintain a positive community?\n\nI would really like to hear your input and put it to use. Just make sure that your comments are *positive*. In other words, don\u0027t complain about what other users are doing.

Not so much here, but in other communities, you\u0027ll see people that think that \u0022You need to fire this guy!\u0022 is constructive criticism. \n\n4) If you want help with a problem, be as specific as possible. Generic questions get mostly generic answers. For example, at the moment a lot of people are having problems with their rockets during launch. Given that most of the advice on that topic has to do with center of pressure/center of mass/thrust to weight ratio/ascent profile, including a screenshot of the craft and a description of at what point in the launch you\u0027re having problems would be helpful.\n\n5) #4 also applies to criticism. I think part of the reason Squad is getting conflicting feedback on aerodynamics is that people aren\u0027t being specific enough. At least one forum member is of the opinion that the problem isn\u0027t that the air is too thin or too thick, it\u0027s that spaceplane parts aren\u0027t acting as low-drag as they should be, so rocket people want a thicker atmosphere than spaceplane people. \n\n6) If you\u0027re just venting, say so.
