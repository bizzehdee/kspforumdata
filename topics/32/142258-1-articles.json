This way you can keep all the previous versions you want, just get the new version out of the steam folder whenever there\u0027s an update. Just a thought. Steam lets you copy the game to any directory you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-22T14:04:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat version does \u0027previous stable release\u0027 in Steam give you?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gooner","CreatedById":164503,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-22T14:06:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.13 unfortunately eddiew \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
