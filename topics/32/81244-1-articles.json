So the guy that joined in later thought I was a real rocket scientist, and started to ask questions about how things was done. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking he was asking about the game, started to answer his questions to the best I could, after second question I realized what he was thought I was, so going along with it I was able to get to the fourth Question before a few people could not hold back the laughter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein the end we got a great joke out of it, and hopefully a new KSP player out of it\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T16:39:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s amazing how the average Joe can think basic knowledge is advanced knowledge.
