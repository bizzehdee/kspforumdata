The thing I\u0027ve always loved about KSP is it\u0027s a \u0022what happens if you do this\u0022 kinda game, it\u0027s always been about experimentation and observation and not about having the game tell you what to do. Career mode adds a bit more to this, there is nothing in game that tells you how to make a rocket or about the different biomes around kerbin (and I hope there never will be), you have to discover these for yourself by having the scientific (or nerdy) curiosity to try odd (often fatal) things and see what happens. Perhaps the one thing the game should hint at in career mode is the importance of going EVA, but then again, anyone with a curious approach will try that without having it suggested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis game does require a fair level of observation and attention to detail. If you do an EVA report while in orbit but don\u0027t read the message and just click transmit or store like it was just XP, then you will miss that this EVA report was done over water (for example). Upon seeing that your next thought should be, hmmm I wonder what will happen over land, and then you find some land is grass land and some is....well, I\u0027ll leave you to find the rest. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lack of in game answers has also in part resulted in this very active and wonderful community because we all come together to share our findings, hidden gems and daft exploits. The fact that your first post here is kinda ranty is a bit sad, a \u0022please help me get more science\u0022 post (or reading some of the answers to other similar threads) would have probably got you further faster. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have managed to make a stable orbit (which from your post is a little unclear cos of the running engine thing) then you should be able to bring around 80 points back from doing a single orbit around the equator. If the lowest point of your orbit is above 70km and you have a little fuel left to deorbit, then you don\u0027t require any further power. You can just revolve round kerbin (indefinitely) and look down on your home world and wonder. When you pass over something that looks a bit different, ie the desert, then get out and do an EVA report and hang on to it (don\u0027t try to transmit it). If you do that over everything that looks different you will discover several of the different biomes and you\u0027ll get a decent amount of points to unlock the next free tech nodes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest problem about career mode that I see is it makes people too focused on the acquisition of points, like they where just xp. Yes you need to gain points, but you also need to do other experiments that don\u0027t earn you points, ie discovering where the atmosphere ends, how many boosters are needed to lift x and so on.

I find zero appeal in the idea of playing Angry Birds(though there are relating concepts), and I haven\u0027t played a war shooter steadily since Medal of Honor:Allied Assault. I find zero appeal in simplified combat and fighting over who gets to fly the next spawned plane. But that is what sort of gamer I am.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI applaud your effort to support your argument, though your effort is lacking. If KSP was just for massive nerds, it wouldn\u0027t have as much attention, and less so than the likes of Magic The Gathering and League of Legends. And yet I see regular gamers do playthroughs of it on Youtube like crazy, inspiring many other regular gamers to give it a shot. Zisteau just recently started his series (\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLVPJ1jbg0CaEsRhyNmZy7PMSl9eb4PSg1\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E ) and he seems to do it more for the lulz, but he does apply himself to achieve goals.\u003Cp\u003EI have been hearing a lot of griefing over career mode, with little perspective on the fact that this is just the first development on that mode with the concept that there are going to be changes as well as additions. Yes, career mode as it is now has its hiccups. Instead of complaining that it is crazy hard or just for nerds, maybe we should try supplying some ideas and concepts to what could be done with career mode a better concept. It should not be dumbed down, hell no. But it should make more sense and fit in better with how we understand a space program has gone before. If there is one thing I would suggest, it would be putting a decoupler in tier one. There is also every reason to believe there is going to be more things to gather science from, so staying in Kerbin orbit for more missions doesn\u0027t seem like a redundant function. There should be more emphasis on getting more out of repeating missions...to a degree. Especially when one considers we will have to be paying for parts eventually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I feel I got a bit off topic. While career mode as it has started seems a bit frustrating, swearing it off without thought that we should be contributing to improving it is simply wrong. If you can see some ways to improve career mode, then share it with the devs, constructively. If you don\u0027t, then don\u0027t give up, it will be improved. For the time being, there is and always will be sandbox mode. You can also use sandbox mode to try ideas to how to change up the r\u0026amp;d tiers, and contribute that to the developers. That is part of our function of being early access players.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
