On my system, which has a decent graphics card, etc, Mun looks a bit brown at times. And yes, darker than before. Overall, I thank you for the new look though, those craters are great! BUT, it does not look as much like our Earth moon as it did before because of the odd color.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T18:58:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood.

Think of Mun as a grayscale image. It now has a lot more darker gray pixels than before because of all the new little craters. Thus, from a distance, Mun looks darker. However, when you get close enough, you see more lighter pixels than darker ones, in the spaces between the craters and also in how the rims, which you can\u0027t see from a distance, are lighter colored than even the uncratered terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also noticed that when you\u0027re on the surface at night, it\u0027s not nearly so totally black as it was before, so maybe the actual brightness (as opposed to just the color) actually got bumped up a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PwnedDuck","CreatedById":54398,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T19:31:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have to point out, despite the Mun being just about as bright as before for me, my ship lights don\u0027t seem to actually have any effect on it at all.
