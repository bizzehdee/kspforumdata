The problem is that pancaking, asparagus staging and some other crazy contraptions were used because of the lack of even bigger rockets to send stuff to space. Anything below around a hundred tons to LKO will probably be alright, but monolithic launches for Jool-5 or other big stuff will probably not be able to reach orbit on one piece efficiently.\n\nThis types of missions could probably be done in smaller batches and docking in orbit, but there are some missions that require big launches in atmosphere as in the case of Eve. I know the Evian atmo will be changed too, but that doesn\u0027t mean it will be a lot easier to get out of than it is right now.\n\nTo fix this, do you think we will get bigger rocket parts or other tweaks that will make this kind of missions doable without recurring to asparagus/pancakes?"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T02:14:33Z","Content":"Reminder: single ring asparagus works fine in FAR, and without extra changes, launches from Kerbin and Eve will get free payload (or can easily be shrunk) due to the reduced \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV requirements."},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T02:21:42Z","Content":"Im already working on a 500t lifter to replace the annoying pancake/radially staged rockets ive been utilizing to lift capital ships. now with the fairings, im HOPING that ill be able to enclose an entire capital ship inside a fairing, making the common puller rockets redundant (anything with alot of wing armor needs a puller rocket or itll flip instantly). My new lifter is just a massive and i mean massive 2-3 stage launcher, with a heavy amount of part clipping, as from my experience its impossible to make a super massive (eg 500\u002Bton) lifter utilizing a vertically staged setup.\n\nStill, i dont believe its going to be a major issue, as pankakes will still work, they will just be way less efficient then vertical designs. I think the common 6 sided asparagus rockets will still be plenty viable, and really with new aerodynamics cutting drag for heavy objects, i think 90% of designs will benefit. really the only designs that will suffer from new drag are excessively flat things with no nose cones. Then again, considering pankakes/assymetric/completelyinsane designs work in FAR with some balancing, i fail to see why they wont in teh new stock aero in 1.0."},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T03:16:40Z","Content":"Almost all rockets get more efficient with *less fake* air.

Some engines with ISP of 400-600 in the 1m or 2m size parts would help the game have more variety, even just a bigger 800 ISP engine would help. Having bigger parts and a greater variety of engines are not mutually exclusive, though. I understand that by adding more parts you reduce the performance of the game, but many parts have been added in recent updates anyway so that doesn\u0027t seem to be a good reason to not do it.\n\n@Jouni The engines are indeed \u0022a little bit\u0022 off in TWR compared to other LOX engines, but nerfing the engines without adding anything bigger would only reduce your payload weight to LKO. This is not a good option if you are not intending to compensate it with anything else, thus the request for larger diameter (5m, maybe) tanks and engines. A 5m payload bay/fairing would be nice too.\n\nThe only problem I find is that when they fixed the size of the SLS parts at 3.75m there are not many bigger engines IRL that can work as comparison to make bigger engines without making them absurdly OP.\n\n5m sized SaturnV engines and tanks anyone?"},{"CreatedByName":"WWEdeadman","CreatedById":105591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T10:57:56Z","Content":"Guys, just saying, we didn\u0027t build the ISS on ground and shoot it up as a whole either.

Although the project was canceled before testing in 1992 by the incoming Clinton Administration, the design was thought to achieve thrust-to-weight ratios of 30:1 and specific impulses of at least 1000 seconds.\n\nLack of test firings of a *Star Wars* engine makes me rather suspicious. Did it *really* reach those specifications in calculations? Would it have reached those specifications as a physical prototype? Did it even exist at all?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Compared to modern nuclear engine designs, the LV-N is severely underpowered. Even at its current size.\n\nDitto for the chemical engines as well though. Modern chem engines can go up to 150 TWR in actual, real, production engines - the Skipper is like 20, the Mainsail is like 25, and the LFB and x4 is like 33. Oh and the 48-7S is like 30 for some bizarre reason~\n\nSo you\u0027re looking at a downgrade of 4.5x to 7.5x (ignoring the KR-2L and aerospike engines, which are outliers on either side). Multiplying the LV-N by those figures gives us 12.2 to 20.4 TWR - which comes close to the performance of engines that may have never even existed at all, and were definitely not tested. Not bad considering the LV-N is a first-generation prototype made by Jeb\u0027s Junkyard, and not a third-generation paper study.\n\nNote also that chem engines can reach specific impulses around 460 for hydro-lox designs, but the KSP engines top out at 370-380 for the big, high-TWR kinds and 390 as an absolute. Scale up the LV-N\u0027s Isp by that same factor, and you get 944-999 Isp. \n\nSo no, the LV-N isn\u0027t underpowered at all. It\u0027s a state of the art third-generation NTR in Kerbal scale."}]}
