You need to fly very straight with rockets for the first layer of atmosphere. \n\nThe main issue is that it was called the release version. As others have pointed out, there needs to be more improvement in different places.

That said, the foundation (the sand in the box) of KSP is physics and the assumed predictable nature of the model and its analogue to a player\u0027s perception of reality. However, if a player has no grounded perception of reality, then any simulation will likely fail to impress - in other words, if a person purchases KSP and they have no idea at all about the world around them, then it is likely they will be disappointed and set the game aside because it is \u0022too hard to play\u0022. KSP is not for the faint at heart- it demands a certain level of commitment and willingness to learn specific skills (some of which actually require a player to do a bit of study rather than just press a FIRE! button repeatedly).\n\nKSP must continue to press forward with increasing affinity toward a predictable and reliable physics based implementation of both atmospheric and space flight.

It is frowned upon to change the thrust or efficiency of engine parts in the game because it makes launches much easier, but changing the drag model from 1.0.2 to version 1.0 will save several hundred metres per second of delta-v in order to get into kerbin orbit.

Real aircraft and rockets tend to have lots and lots of flight instruments, and they\u0027re not just there for funsies. [here](http://www.aopa.org/-/media/Images/AOPA/Pilot/1402p/cessna2.jpg) is the cockpit of a [cessna 180](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cessna.180a.g-btsm.arp.jpg), which is a pretty simple aircraft.\n\nIn KSP we have a navball that\u0027s meant to provide most of the information. You\u0027ll also be using the altimeter, and throttle indicator now and then, and more advanced players might look at their vertical velocity and g-meter once in a while. That\u0027s not sufficient instrumentation if you want to go a long way down the realism path, \n\nWe\u0027re already pushing the limits of the instrumentation we have with 1.0.2 physics. A \u0022pretty standard\u0022 rocket will want to flip if it\u0027s very slightly away from prograde when passing through mach 1. You can add fins to correct for this, but \u0022real\u0022 rockets don\u0027t all have fins. The best you can do in KSP (if you want to fly it manually) is \u0022try to keep it pointing prograde\u0022. But the navball doesn\u0027t provide information at a high enough resolution for you to know that you are a fraction of a degree away from porgrade, which means you can\u0027t fly it \u0022manually\u0022 with the available instrumentation. \n\nIs that bad? Well, only if we want KSP to be a game where you can fly your rocket manually with the instrumentation available. If we don\u0027t want that... ie, if we want a realistic simulator, we\u0027ll probably need to add a lot more realistic instrumentation, and maybe have all our launches be computer controlled. But is that still KSP, or have we just remade orbiter at that point?\n\nThis already happens in KSP by the way... people who go with mods that add realism also tend to have more realistic instrumentation (FAR is the obvious example). It seems to me that this is the right way to do things: the basic game should be, well, \u0022basic\u0022. Simplified instrumentation, simplified controls, and along with that an appropriately simplified flight model. If you then want to press that towards a simulation, go with mods that add these features. it makes a lot less sense for the devs to spend a huge amount of time making a high fidelity simulator, and then have players download mods to simplify all of that."}]}
