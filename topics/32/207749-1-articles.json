I loved RimWorld, which was very much a simpler, more agile take on this same genre. This year we\u2019ve seen Stellaris and Kerbal Space Program, both more complex, but also genuinely enjoyable.\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022color:#111111;font-size:17px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022color:#111111;font-size:17px;\u0022\u003E\nWe set out to play Kerbal Space Program, a fresh take on a very familiar formula, but we also expected it to be different. What we didn\u2019t expect was how thoroughly enjoyable it\u2019d be to play. What we did expect was how uninteresting it\u2019d be to play.\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022color:#111111;font-size:17px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022color:#111111;font-size:17px;\u0022\u003E\nI mean, have you played Kerbal Space Program before? Didn\u2019t think so. This is still more space sim than other space sims, but it\u2019s different enough to give it a fresh take. It also happens to be very charming.\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022color:#111111;font-size:17px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022color:#111111;font-size:17px;\u0022\u003E\nSitting at a desk, with two computers and my feet up, I\u2019m not the most mobile man in the world. But I can still imagine myself floating in space, punching buttons with a realistic frustration at trying to get control of a tiny rocket.\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022color:#111111;font-size:17px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022color:#111111;font-size:17px;\u0022\u003E\nOur in-depth review of Kerbal Space Program will tell you more about its mechanics, but the easiest way to understand Kerbal Space Program is by seeing it from the perspective of a game jam over the weekend. You can probably guess what sort of jam that was, given how many brilliant indie games crop up.\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022color:#111111;font-size:17px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022color:#111111;font-size:17px;\u0022\u003E\nOn the first day, we ended up with a space game and the beginning of a story. It was something that felt like the sort of thing I\u2019d want to play as a kid, and not have to fight with crummy controls, crummy difficulty, or terrible politics. It was set in the Kerbal universe, with a persistent world where you can build ships, launch them into space and maybe become a space pirate or something.\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022color:#111111;font-size:17px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022color:#111111;font-size:17px;\u0022\u003E\nBut the design team didn\u2019t want to stick to a sci-fi trope and came up with a hero with the voice of Darth Vader. They wanted someone who was\u2026 well, more relatable.\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022color:#111111;font-size:17px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022color:#111111;font-size:17px;\u0022\u003E\nAs I played through the weekend, more and more elements of the game started to present themselves. Character creation is as easy as opening the character creation window. You choose your name, and all the fields are treated with the sort of care you expect from small development teams. Your name can be anything you want, and it\u0027s fully customizable. I chose Aeroblaze since it sounded like an alien name.\u00A0\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point, the game boots up and loads some asteroids, and you can either do some outpost building or play around in the planet-building or factory sim or rocket sim. However, when you create an asteroid, you can launch a spaceship and launch a rocket in space. It is this surreal moment that, as KSP\u2019s raison d\u2019etre is purely for exploring, has the potential to encourage exploration through experimentation and discovery.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of which help foster a community. KSP is free to play \u2013 it\u2019s all there for you, from the moment you download the game. There are no DLCs or even map packs. There\u2019s an activity park to work out how many hits of floating bananas you can get your KSP pilot to churn off before they turn into a deadly sugar crash. There\u2019s a competitive community where players achieve high scores on various orbital exploits. The creators have attempted to keep a level of community spirit alive despite its many flaws. They made a message board, and people dedicated their time to keeping people\u2019s ships in working order so that they can do it all again another time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the sort of community that has been built around its two most popular maps \u2013 Vacant_1, a vast science base now being developed by other fans, and Farstar_2, a slightly less mysterious, more populated corner of space. It has, however, in the past (see: a clash with the military) been difficult to be a Kerbal on these maps. For a while, you needed a license to play and got banned if there was anything non-standard in the writing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\nHopefully more to follow!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n(Just a note, I did tweak the settings a little to get it a bit more realistic. I had \u0022Start at beginning\u0022 on, and I also had \u0022Nucleus sampling top p\u0022 all the way up.)\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-04-30T15:12:21Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2022 03:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by RocketFire9\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ECombining my later post with this one.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-15T22:35:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think we need to worry about Skynet any time soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jcklemme","CreatedById":62597,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-16T20:16:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224116953\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207749\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221649964977\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022206401\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RocketFire9\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/14/2022 at 2:36 PM, RocketFire9 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSitting at a desk, with two computers and my feet up, I\u2019m not the most mobile man in the world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHilarious.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerb24","CreatedById":214340,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-16T23:07:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the hilarious results in the original post, I asked this AI what Kerbal Space Program is, and it gave me this.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#111111;font-size:17px;\u0022\u003EKerbal Space Program is a sandbox exploration and rocketry simulation game developed and published by Squad, the team behind the 2013 multiplayer shooter,\u0022 the team stated on its Steam store page.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022color:#111111;font-size:17px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022color:#111111;font-size:17px;\u0022\u003E\nThe game allows players to start out with little more than some crates and a few raw materials, and according to the game\u0027s Steam store page, \u0022you can create and fly the first in-game spacecraft, the Kerbals Space Vehicle, to become a planetary hero.\u0022\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022color:#111111;font-size:17px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022color:#111111;font-size:17px;\u0022\u003E\nThe project is the brainchild of Squad, the independent game studio behind \u0022\u0022.

Molyneux is now working with Valve on the new Half-Life for Steam (it\u0027s expected to be released in the fall), which has left a trail of crossed fingers and wondering for fans of Kerbal Space Program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I have to admit I do miss Kerbal Space Program,\u0022 Molyneux added in a follow-up Tweet. \u0022It\u2019s probably not the best course of action for both studios to end up having their names linked together after such a long and profitable association, but there you go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Admiral Fluffy","CreatedById":210816,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-16T23:53:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224118218\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207749\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221650153003\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002262597\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jcklemme\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 minutes ago, Jcklemme said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalf-Life for Steam\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalf-Life 3 confirmed\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketFire9","CreatedById":206401,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-16T23:55:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo maybe it\u0027ll come out before KSP2?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n(Just a note, I did tweak the settings a little to get it a bit more realistic.

Even though the team has definitely been hard at work delivering KSP 2, things keep moving around so much... i have to admit, I still set even my most optimistic dates too low and even I\u2019ve been having a hard time of it. We\u2019re so very close now but still out of touch. Sorry. Please don\u2019t get all baking punk on me. I know we are all as frazzled as those two kerbals in the rocket from the original. Back with our regular scheduled updates, I\u2019m going to make you wait just a little bit longer so as not to disappoint you guys. We know you\u2019ll understand. While you wait I\u2019m pleased to announce that the KSP 2 cloud map viewer is available today as a standalone installer. So you can run Kerbin\u2019s cloud map viewer alongside the standard visualization toolkit without having to install the visualization suite separately from the cloud map viewer.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022After a lengthy development, the hardcore sci-fi simulation game Kerbal Space Program 2 (KSP2) will be coming out this year. According to Chris Sawyer, the game\u0027s maverick creator, the second part of the space simulator will be released sometime in 2028. How upon release? That hasn\u0027t been focused out yet, however to very little surprise Chris didn\u0027t say how soon after launch stretch goals will be unlocked. With that said, Sawyer indicated to the official KSP blog that some tiers even which aren\u0027t out yet:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMissions include pushing things, beating devices, and messing with stuff.

Some of the quote, unquote \u0022balancing adjustments\u0022 (as opposed to balance tweaks) include a shift in how the ship matrix works (the general population hasn\u0027t used it, and all newcomers start learning it all at once), tweaks to laser tag control and effects, and changes to how the game handles orbital mechanics (instead of moving towards the center of the planet, characters can change direction by shifting the planet edge itself). It was developed by Squad and is said to have about four times as much content as the hit game that came out two years ago.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-05-03T16:30:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2022 04:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by RocketFire9\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
