Guess what, the clamp-o-tron can only decouple on one side. So the probe detached from the base, which left the clamp stuck to the probe\u0027s engine. Easy solution: edit .sfs and delete the clamp, right? \u003Cstrong\u003EWRONG!\u003C/strong\u003E Didn\u0027t work. In fact, that caused the game to glitch big-time, with Minmus disappearing completely whenever I tried to fly the probe. (the probe\u0027s staging diagram also whigged out, but that was no big deal compared to AN ENTIRE PLANET DISAPPEARING)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI never did get \u0022deleting the clamp\u0022 to work; the only way I was able to fix that third bug was by turning the clamp into a stage separator so it could detach at both ends.
