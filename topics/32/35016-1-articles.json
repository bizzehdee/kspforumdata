As far as why they were painted in the first place, I\u0027m not sure that it had anything to do with UV protection or any of that. I do remember hearing something about the change from I believe closed cell foam to open cell foam (similar to the expanding foam you can get at the store, I remember my parents had some around the house somewhere and after a while it turned orange as well) and the paint not sticking to it which is another reason why they stopped using the paint. Though it could be a combination of all those reasons I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sporkafife","CreatedById":38208,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-27T23:29:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fuzzy Dunlop\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fuzzy Dunlop\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI thought the paint was to protect the foam against UV, then they discovered it wasn\u0027t really a problem and stopped doing it to save weight. But I can\u0027t remember if I acctually learnt this or am just making this up.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E Yep, they originally painted the ET (external tank) on the Space Shuttle white to reflect UV rays. They thought that, because the Space Shuttle spends a long time on the pad prior to launch, that UV radiation could damage the tank in some way. I think they only flew the white tank for STS-1 and STS-2, and for STS-3 they realised that the UV radiation didn\u0027t really pose a threat so they could leave the ET unpainted and save a couple hundred kg of weight at the same time.\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I quite like the look of the white tanks. The contrast between the white orbiter and SRB\u0027s with the orange/rusty-brown tank is quite aesthetically pleasing, but I think the white ET just looked so much more elegant \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
