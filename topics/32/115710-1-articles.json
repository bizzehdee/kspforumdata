The method I\u0027m using so far is to place a station in orbit of Minmus with a couple of ISRU converters, tanks for fuel and ore, and plenty of power. A drill-equipped lander then goes to the surface, digs until its tanks are full, then hauls the ore back to orbit for conversion.\n\nI guess the other approach would be to have the ISRU converters on the surface as a permanent base. You could then either drill directly below the base, or send mining rovers out to collect the ore. Only the finished fuel would then get shipped back to orbit.\n\nIn the Jool system, there\u0027s a third possible option. Assuming the colony is based on Laythe, you could have a processing/fuel dump station in orbit of Laythe, and having mining ships bring the raw ore back from Bop or Pol. You could either do this with the lander, or have a separate ship to go between moons.\n\nAnyone found any specific advantage to either method?"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T13:36:46Z","Content":"I personally prefer the \u0022only lift the fuel\u0022 method. The only reason I prefer it (and it\u0027s marginal) is that you\u0027ll never run out of fuel while lifting it off the surface, yet you\u0027ll never end up docking to your station with fuel left over. So, it\u0027s more efficient.\n\nOne bonus of the orbiting station is that it\u0027s in the sun more often, and in night for less time, than a surface base so the refining can run all the time with less batteries, but that\u0027s not a big deal considering if you leave your surface base alone for a year and jump to it in the daylight, it will fast forward time and fill up all your tanks no problem.\n\nNo opinion on Jool. I\u0027ve not mined there yet. Is Laythe (I assume with an inbound aerobrake) more efficient than Tylo (with less dV in all other legs of the journey)?"},{"CreatedByName":"_stilgar_","CreatedById":147818,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T13:55:05Z","Content":"I think there is too much work with all that docking - I have Mk3 supply ship with ISRU - it lands, makes fuel and then if other ship needs it, it takes off and flies to it.

I just land, mine, fill up the fuel tanks, fill up the ore tanks, and dock with my orbital refilling station transferring fuel, and refining the ore into more fuel.

For one thing the tanker doesn\u0027t need to waste space (and mass and part count) on being able to carry both ore and fuel. It also saves me the trouble of manually transferring ore and/or fuel from one thing to another, except when I\u0027m actually using the tanker to refuel another ship. It also looks way cooler. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\n![screenshot172.png](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5zYekRyz3ek/VYZvViMGazI/AAAAAAAABec/fNsFB-375rQ/s800-Ic42/screenshot172.png)\n\n(That central cone, by the way, is the Engineering Bay. It houses the two engineers stationed at the Mobile Ore Combine to boost efficiency (and make repairs or modifications, thanks to KAS/KIS), and it can detach and roam around--with wheels or rockets or both--in search of better ore deposits."},{"CreatedByName":"Caelib","CreatedById":59329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T12:05:32Z","Content":"In my experience, the only efficient mining operation is asteroids."},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T12:08:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E In my experience, the only efficient mining operation is asteroids.\n\nBuddy of mine built a huge wrangler for tugging class-D\u0027s and was disappointed by how little ore they had.

This works particularly well for large landers since the addition of the ISRU is a (relatively) small amount of weight (My last minimus lander for this purpose held 21,000 units of ore), and has the big advantage that the lander can refuel on the surface so it always leaves the surface with full tanks. This is particularly advantageous if you tend to be overly cautious with suicide burns, since you can afford to be be very fuel inefficient on the way down. \n\nThis way may not be the most efficient in terms of \u0022Amount of ore wasted\u0022 or \u0022in game time used\u0022, but I feel it is the most efficient in terms of \u0022real world time used\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T15:44:12Z","Content":"Engineer Kerbals really speed up the ore extraction process a lot. Even an untrained one will boost the rate by 5, and every Engineer on board boosts it even more.\n\nMy own setup is to establish a proper mining base, and have a fuel ferry that actually does the fuel transfers to an orbiting station. The mining base only stores a token amount of ore and fuel, enough to allow it to process during the fuel ferry\u0027s visits to the orbital fuel station. The fuel ferry is basically all business: it\u0027s mostly fuel tanks. I tend to set both mining base and ferry up with what I call a \u0022KAS Mouse\u0022: a standardized mini-rover with a docking port, said rover being attached to the parent craft via a Kerbal Attachment System winch.

No landing legs. No SAS. No RCS (except tanks). Heck, you don\u0027t even NEED a probe core on it. My first stations are usually 5 or 7 orange tanks, 2 big RCS tanks, and 2 of each docking port. I\u0027m planning on doing similar with the biggest SLS tanks when I unlock them.\n\nI also like the station to just be topped off at all times. I fill it when I can\u0027t devote a ton of time to playing but have some spare time anyway.

I have landed some really improbable ships there. In many ways, I found it simplest and even most efficient to keep the ISRU on the Minmus surface and not even bother flying fuel up to orbit. Instead, I land the target ship (usually some high ISP and low thrust monstrosity) directly on Minmus, and do the refueling there. It can be cheaper to land and re-orbit the interplanetary ship than to do the orbital docking plus land and re-orbit the fuel tanker. (This only works on Minmus, and it pretty much requires KAS so you can refuel with pipes.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T18:38:00Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 06:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mikegarrison**"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T19:07:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Anyone found any specific advantage to either method?\n\nIn general, I believe it\u0027s more efficient (in terms of amount of fuel delivered to orbit vs. amount of Ore extracted) to move only finished product, not Ore (due to the empty weight of Ore tanks). It\u0027s definitely more efficient not to move the drills and refinery. So the most efficient set-up has 3 components: A land-based drill/refinery vehicle, an orbital product storage base, and a flying fuel tank (with as few non-tank parts as possible) that travels between the other 2.\n\nOf course, chasing that sort of efficiency is only really necessary if you\u0027re doing some long-term, large-scale thing. If you\u0027re just doing flags and footprints, and only intend to refuel maybe once per planet visited, then you can carry the hardware with you."},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T20:43:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Buddy of mine built a huge wrangler for tugging class-D\u0027s and was disappointed by how little ore they had.
