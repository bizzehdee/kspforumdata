There is also IPT (Interplanetary Transport (crewed)) and IPF (Interplanetary Freighter (autonomous)) which are large reusable vehicles designed for efficiently transporting cargo and crew between Kerbin and another planet.

Constellation 1 will be the network directly orbiting the main planetary body, and subsequent constellations will be for the moons in order of which is nearest to the planet (in the case of trojan moons (such as Ike and Nyke) the moon that is ahead in the orbit will have the lower number). The \u0022Satellite {number}\u0022 part is for counting and tracking satellites in the constellation.
