Now whenever I try to launch it, I get a popup asking me if I want to \u0022reopen windows\u0022 (which is a thing that happens when your Mac crashes), then, without clicking anything, a Mac crash report. When I click \u0022Reopen\u0022, it just crashes again. I\u0027ve tried completely cleaning it out and reinstalling (several times), but it just says the same thing.
