But maybe he was just bluffing. Maybe this is all part of his evil, twisted schemes... ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif)\n\nI mean, Rover\u0027s a pretty smart guy. How could he think that in 2 months not a single KSP player would travel to Dres and find dem roids? It\u0027s practically absurd, if you ask me.
