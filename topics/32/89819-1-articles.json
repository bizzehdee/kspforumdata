That is often easier then trying to meet conditions when going down. Using a liquid fueled rocket or jet engine will allow you to control reaching the test conditions and cut power as soon as the chute has been deployed through staging. While most tests involve staging, be sure to read the note just in case you need to run test instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-10T23:00:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find the parachute contracts nearly impossible to do on the way down. The windows are often well off the speed/altitude profile of any reasonable reentry. If you really want to take those contracts your better off makeing the cheepest LF rocket you can, just an engien, tank and probe core with the parachute attached. Send it strait up to hit the window run the test and come back down for a high % recovery. planes are another option if thats your thing although you\u0027ll want an action group to instantly cut the chute or set it on a decoupler so its not interfering with your ability to fly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kevlarburrito","CreatedById":128583,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-10T23:17:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I\u0027m having is that I reach the window and deploy the chute, I\u0027ve tried both up and down.

You just need to make sure that all the conditions are being met when you deploy the parachutes, preferrably through the staging. When going up, when going down, or when going sideways (e.g. with a plane), all three work.
