This was also a chance to thank Squad - one of the things missing before was truly abrupt slopes, where you could drive/walk up to a lip and look straight down a cliff; it always started sloping down and made a few transitions before. I think those \u0022sheer cliffs\u0022 exist now in plenty!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter some radar scanning of the new surface of Kerbin, I decided to land an unmanned probe at the highest point I\u0027d detected. The landscape is amazing, totally worth the view and the dead crewmember who tried a manned flight there and had to ditch in the ocean out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VYZ9hdw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VYZ9hdw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe snow cover is appropriate; Temperature sensors show it as -41 C there, with atmospheric pressure at about 1/4 of sea level. I\u0027m not sure if those distant dramatic peaks are taller, and not sure I can manage to land a probe on them - but they sure look awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think there are probably many new peaks over 6 km tall, so there\u0027s lots of amazing things out there to see just on Kerbin. This range raises abruptly from coastal planes, and if I drive slightly downhill I have a great view out to the ocean in the opposite direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose who want to know coordinates can PM me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWho else has visited extreme locations on Kerbin, Mun, Duna, or other remapped planets - or just found new amazing views?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheDarkStar","CreatedById":37056,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T04:39:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve heard that one of the moon\u0027s [easter eggs] is floating in a pit like Moho\u0027s polar [spoilers]\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T05:10:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheDarkStar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TheDarkStar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve heard that one of the moon\u0027s [easter eggs] is floating in a pit like Moho\u0027s polar [spoilers]\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s on the south pole of the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T05:21:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheDarkStar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TheDarkStar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve heard that one of the moon\u0027s [easter eggs] is floating in a pit like Moho\u0027s polar [spoilers]\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found a terrain scatter (rock) near the north pole that\u0027s floating.
