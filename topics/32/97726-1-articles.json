It doesn\u0027t abuse the randomizer to introduce artificial difficulty. All challenge comes down to the player\u0027s decisions within the consistent framework of rules the game sets out for them, and the player gets meaningful feedback from their choices as well. There are elements of resource management, strategic planning, engineering, project management, and experimentation, all of which I find appealing. At a higher level, the game involves both air and space flight, which are fascinating subjects to me. It allows me to explore other worlds (artificial though they may be) and work within different gravitational contexts while doing so. Higher still, it lets me feel like I\u0027ve actually accomplished something for all my hard work when a mission comes to a successful close, and like I\u0027ve learned something even when my plans come undone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Choose your answer from the above two.
