I was wondering what many of you have done to enhance your gameplay. Even any things that old KSP vets used to do, that no longer seem important (if there is such a thing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027ve been spending my time recently trying dock to a base on the moon with a tower piece I built. The rough thing about it is, it\u0027s a top/bottom dock. Meaning I have to land directly on it, and I\u0027m playing stock controls (no mechjeb).. Makes for some interesting challenge.. lol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Also, just to enhance the presence in my game, I picked up this SEVERELY overlooked mod.
