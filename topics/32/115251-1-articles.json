I\u0027m building a MKIII SSTO for interplanetary travel.

Would the extra weight affect the COM enough for it to flip during flight? If it were me, I\u0027d usually use Poodle\u0027s, mainly because they are easier to incorporate into a design without having to change it. It\u0027s your call, but keep what I said in mind. Rep if it helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T16:34:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was unable to get a Poodle MK3 into orbit - not enough thrust to get enough speed in the ballistic part (though I got a very decent MK2 plane with the Poodle). Rhino worked but the resulting craft was a total monster, 16 whiplashes to give it enough thrust in the atmospheric flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
