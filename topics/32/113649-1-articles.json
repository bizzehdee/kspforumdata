I know I\u0027ve seen people use KSP brand logs at the start of their videos.\n\nSpecifically this image posted on these forums [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/27671-So-where-would-i-get-a-high-res-KSP-logo).\n\n![SX2Bdi6.png](http://i.imgur.com/SX2Bdi6.png)\n\nI\u0027ve looked and haven\u0027t seen any where any you-tubers attribute the image source or artist, though that doesn\u0027t mean that\u0027s the \u0022right\u0022 way to handle it and the attribution may be in locations I haven\u0027t looked.\n\nI understand that the music produced by Incompetech is \u0022royalty free\u0022 and you can choose the license you use from their(his?) website, which gives \\*very\\* explicit instructions about how to provide attribution. I\u0027m wondering if Squad has a KSP branding kit that gives similar guidance.\n\nTheir FAQ states: \u0022We just ask to be given credit, a mention and a link to our website is enough. You must also make it perfectly clear that we are the copyright holders of KSP.\u0022 Is statement *a la \u0022*Kerbal Space Program/KSP is copyright of Squad\u0022, with a link, sufficient?\n\nFinally, the FAQs state that it\u0027s okay to monetize KSP videos, but the forum rules (Specifically 2.2.i) state that links projects for profit are forbidden. Does this include monetized videos? Again, I know lots of people link to videos by Scott Manley, Cybutek, etc, but that doesn\u0027t mean it **doesn\u0027t** violate the rules.\n\nThanks in advance for any informed responses. I want to start a tutorial series, but I really don\u0027t want to get harassed/sued by Squad if I express an opinion that they don\u0027t like about something.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T00:50:19Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 12:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Orbital Vagabond**"}]}
