Lack of cone antenna is like - reducing the fun of setting the network, actually, but whatever.\n\nAnyway, I\u0027m not feeling bad because this new system isn\u0027t comparable to RT and I\u0027ll probably still stick to RT.\n\n(and hopefully we don\u0027t have another bug like disappearing parts after reverting due to ore scanning record)"},{"CreatedByName":"Bishop149","CreatedById":82368,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T10:27:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Remote tech solves that with a computer to program in burns and commands whilst out of comms range.\n\nYep, also anything that\u0027s assigned to an action group can be pre-programmed to occur after a specific time eg. parachute opening.\n\nThis can be tricky though, the way I currently do parachutes on probes I may lack a connection to during decent is by tweaking the Deploy altitude and pressure settings of the chute so it opens once safe automatically.

You won\u0027t have much cause for satellites around Kerbin, but then I regard the way RemoteTech pushes that as unrealistic drudgework. Look at real life - the Mars rovers communicate to one or other of the Mars orbiters which then communicates to a dish on the surface of Earth.

Perhaps, even, level 1 gives the network hardly any range at all outside of the atmosphere, with level 2 reaching to the Mun, and lvl 3 to Kebin SOI. Then you could have the moons set up with satellites to propagate the signal further to the system, and make contracts just for that (That will at least make use of the satellite-based contracts that aren\u0027t polar orbits and surface stations).\n\nIn the end, as nalfz said, I\u0027m still gonna stick with RemoteTech."},{"CreatedByName":"viktor19","CreatedById":111560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T12:08:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...then the engineers need to be fired.\n\nAnd nothing beats 1.0.4 reentry heat in that department ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T12:12:32Z","Content":"Any even very rough ETA on 1.1?"},{"CreatedByName":"NJP","CreatedById":147695,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T12:26:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Any even very rough ETA on 1.1?\n\nI say it\u0027s far too early to come up with one now, given that they haven\u0027t playtested anything just yet."},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T12:36:54Z","Content":"It really does seem like RemoteTech lite.

Sure, I might miss having to overcome the signal relay to KSC issue and the time delay problem, but to be honest the DSN solution they are proposing makes a lot more sense. Relay networks are expensive and even NASA only really ever uses GPS to do orbit determination of low earth satellites. One thing I would like to suggest in hopes of making it more \u0022realistic\u0022 would be to copy/paste the physical tracking station to spots all around Kerbin. Even if they don\u0027t function and mainly exist just for aesthetics, it would still help prop up my brutally fragile suspension of disbelief.

I\u0027d like to see these things configurable:\n\n1. Already-established DSN, or having to set it up yourself upon starting career. Could be solved by placing stations around Kerbin, like the tracking station. (I\u0027m not for the planet itself serving as a tracking station itself, should make use of ghe actual tracking station.) Making the initial comsat network around Kerbin is after all a really fun part of RemoteTech, so this should be configurable.\n\n2. Occlusion fuzzyness, from soft to hard occlusion.\n\n3. Max range for tracking station/DSN in steps of covering 100 km from station, to all LKO to Mun to entire Kerbin SOI to Duna, to Jool, etc., and difficulty controls which upgrade level does what.\n\nSignal delay is the only thing I think does not belong in stock, and could be something that is still done in a mod with a good flight computer, like RT."},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T14:56:20Z","Content":"The problem with occlusion is that real life probes aren\u0027t controlled by remote control, they operate on preloaded computer scripts.\n\nSo, for instance, in my latest Duna/Ike mission I\u0027ve sent a mothership with an ore scanner (unmanned) and two spaceplanes, capable of carrying crew, but unmanned. After aerocapture, all three \u0022child\u0022 ships separate, the scanner goes to Ike and scans it. An unmanned mining rig lands in an ore rich location and the scanner is sent to Duna, to scan Duna.\n\nA real life mission would have preprogramed scripts. Mission control will, upon receiving information of the successful aerocapture, send a command so the ships separate and the scanner executes, in sequence, the required maneuvers to capture and Ike, scan it and return to Duna. Since those maneuvers are innacurate, mission control would later fine tune them, but the probe is not going to, for instance, fail to execute a burn because Ike happens to be between the probe and Kerbin. It will execute the maneuver as planned and, once it stops being occluded, mission control will know if it was successful or not.\n\nSimply put, Remote Tech is not realistic.
