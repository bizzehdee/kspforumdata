After aerocapture, all three \u0022child\u0022 ships separate, the scanner goes to Ike and scans it. An unmanned mining rig lands in an ore rich location and the scanner is sent to Duna, to scan Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA real life mission would have preprogramed scripts. Mission control will, upon receiving information of the successful aerocapture, send a command so the ships separate and the scanner executes, in sequence, the required maneuvers to capture and Ike, scan it and return to Duna. Since those maneuvers are innacurate, mission control would later fine tune them, but the probe is not going to, for instance, fail to execute a burn because Ike happens to be between the probe and Kerbin. It will execute the maneuver as planned and, once it stops being occluded, mission control will know if it was successful or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimply put, Remote Tech is not realistic.
