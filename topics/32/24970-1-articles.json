I\u0027m relatively new to KSP - I\u0027ve been playing it for a while, but never bothered to try anything more complex than a Mun landing - mainly because I lack the skills to build something capable of going further without assembling it in orbit, and found docking to be a tremendous pain in the jacksie.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now I\u0027ve seen the light and downloaded Mechjeb, and am happy to report success assembling a few components on the beginnings of my first orbital station. It is now my goal to build a ship capable of reaching minmus and deploying a manned lander to the surface, but I\u0027ll need your help on these points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. How much Liquid/RCS fuel am I going to need to reach Minmus? I\u0027m currently able to stick Rockomax Jumbo-64\u0027s into orbit and dock them with my station for later connection to my ship, although to call the whole system inefficient and unwieldy would be an understatement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. How should my ship be arranged? Here\u0027s a look at the parts I already have....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/c2NsHLe.png\u0022 alt=\u0022c2NsHLe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere you can see my fairly amateurish station, which maintains a height of almost 300KM on a near-perfect circular orbit around Kerbin. On the right you can see what will be the command module of my ship. I\u0027m planning to connect some kind of fuel tank arrangement to the docking port on the rear of it, followed/preceded by RCS tanks, with an engine assembly being connected last. The docking port on the front is not just a nice system for docking with stations - I\u0027m planning to attach my lander there. Once that whole system is together I\u0027ll make my attempt for Minmus, but if you guys could give me any advice on what to include and how I should put it together, it\u0027d be much appreciated. Images and examples would be lovely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Getting heavy parts into orbit is a pain right now. If anyone could share a practical method of getting whopping great fuel tanks/any other heavy parts into Orbit to use on my ship, that\u0027d be swell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Actually assembling the whole thing will probably be a pain too. Help would be appreciated. I\u0027m aware I\u0027ll need at least one component with some kind of manned/unmanned command system, some RCS thrusters, and a mono-propellant tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m more than happy to use addons. As you can see, I\u0027m already using Mechjeb, B9 aerospace, and NovaPunch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Since posting this I\u0027ve come sent up an RCS tank for the ship, and am in the process of connecting several fuel tanks to the station. I\u0027m planning to send up a fuel tank with an engine to fit to the rear of that RCS tank. The ship\u0027s fuel tank and engine will be self-propelled to the station and connected to the ship, at which point I\u0027ll fill it up again from the smaller fuel tanks I\u0027m connecting to the station. Once this is done, I\u0027m going to build and send up a lander to attach to the gantry-mounted docking port seen at the front of the command module of my ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/F1p8Iyi.png\u0022 alt=\u0022F1p8Iyi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the left: refueling tank - the first of several.
