I haven\u0027t been to Eve yet to verify, however.\n\u003E If true, this is probably not the physics that the devs intended. The real world interpretation would be that the combustion chamber pressure is literally lower than ambient atmospheric pressure... which simply would never be true for any actual rocket motor. Even a child\u0027s plastic water rocket would still have an ISP of 5-10 on Eve.\n\nI seem to remember there was a bunch of discussion about this when the ISP changes were confirmed in a devnotes way back.\n\nIt\u0027s just a case of gameplay vs realism. In reality a vessel on the surface of venus (75atm?) would have a lot of trouble with it\u0027s engines, so the engines are scaled to reflect a similar design challenge without the player having to actually wade through 75atm of pressure. In any case I expect the aerospike and the larger engines should still have thrust on the surface, it\u0027ll be mainly the dinky ones that struggle."},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T06:17:48Z","Content":"The jet engines work fine.
