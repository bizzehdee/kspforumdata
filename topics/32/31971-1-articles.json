It happened to me on a larger scale; I had dropped a big 20-Kerbal lander base on Eve, and drove my rover 20km to park next to it, and the second I came within around 100m the whole base exploded. I was pretty upset... but yeah, it\u0027s a bug, it doesn\u0027t always happen, but when it does, it\u0027s annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aragosnat","CreatedById":60487,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-08T03:37:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah. It can be normal as the physics on the first one are coming into effect as they are only rendered after 500 m )or was it 2500 m?). At least it seems like that for myself. Next thing would be if you had a quick save before landing the second one. Check and see if the first one had any part burried under ground too as well as to see if you have enough struts and the other thing it could be is that the higher the part count the lower the FPS will be which will make ships wobble more then they would normally at a higher FPS and then brake a part (which I think is the culprate). Reducing the detail level and see it it brakes then too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
