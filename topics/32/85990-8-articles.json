What you do is you build a rocket, fly somewhere and then click a button. It\u0027s irrelevant in this context whether the reason is that a contract told you to, you get science points from there or just felt like it. The contract and science system simply tells you where you need to go and what parts you need to take with you but those two properties are already included in the game by default. You\u0027re going somewhere and taking parts with you no matter what - they give you nothing new to do or think about. To me this feels like playing an RTS where you gather resources and build your base, train and upgrade your force, assemble and move them in good order to the other side of the map and that\u0027s it.
