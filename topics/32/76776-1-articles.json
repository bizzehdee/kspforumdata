This magnet strength is completely unrealistic and would cause a lot of problems in the real world. Real docking ports do not actually have magnets to avoid potential damage to a spacecraft, they just dock via clamps that keep a spacecraft in place. I\u0027ve been hoping for a mod that allows us to control this parameter, but have yet to find such a mod.

I\u0027m more or less perfectly lined up (maybe a hundred millimeters off tops). I slowly move in at 0.1 m/s. When I get within range of the magnet, it forces me towards the docking port very quickly, over 0.5 m/s.

Sure, it operates under similar rules of physics, but it has never been Earth simulator. A \u003Cem\u003Espace\u003C/em\u003E simulator, absolutely. The orbital physics are very real and easily transferable to real life (and vice versa) - there\u0027s no \u0027burn straight up and you\u0027re in orbit\u0027 or \u0027spaceships are planes in space\u0027 tropes, the laws of physics still apply.

Most of the things about the game are simulated in a decent manner. However, when it comes to the magnetic strength of the docking ports, all physics is thrown out of the window. Physically, magnets that strong on that small of a docking port cannot exist. I do not have hundreds of hours of flight training either and within a week of picking up KSP I was able to dock perfectly with a station. The whole process is incredibly simple if you understand physics. I only have problems when the physics don\u0027t make any sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tery215\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tery215\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewhy does it have to \u0022simulate\u0022 a lack of magnetic force?\u003Cp\u003Emaybe they just put magnets in it to make it easier on the noobs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit\u0027s not like that changes any simulation\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s certainly why they do it. But the reason that it should be simulated is because that is the very definition of simulation. To simulate something that actually exists. If you put two magnets at a meter apart, they won\u0027t pull each other together. You\u0027d have to have a very large magnet for something like that. This is basic physics. At most the magnet would attract at 0.1 meters from the target.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
