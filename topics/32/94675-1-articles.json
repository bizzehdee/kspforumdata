For my first month of watching ksp, I was mostly into getting mods like b9, fire spitter, boat parts, and other war mods, and when I first got it, that\u0027s how I played it, and I was a total newb who just built cool looking planes that crashed into the ocean. I also thought ksp was about explosions, as many of the you tubers were all about explosions. I stopped playing it for a few months, and finally started watching some of the REAL ksp people, like Scott, HOC, and Danny, and I figured out what this game really was about. This was around June. I than deleted and redownloaded my version of ksp. This is when I truly started ksp, though I was still thinking hyperedit was a legit way to do things back then and could not land on minmus, much less the mun. Of course, I eventually got really good at it, and a Duna expedition AAR might be coming up soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-27T16:26:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy cousin mentioned her son had been playing it, so I checked out the demo... 2 months later, I went and bought it (since v0.23.5).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Col_Jessep","CreatedById":4071,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-27T16:56:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure but most likely somebody on the Uber Ent forum posted about it.

Anyway, I found KSP back at the end of October or the start of November of 2011 (the exact date has eluded me now) by watching a video posted by one of the early SomethingAwful LPers, Maxwell Adams. He showcased KSP 0.8.4 and showed how fun it was to blow up rockets in a futile attempt to reach space. It looked interesting, so I went ahead and got 0.11 (which was the most current at the time). It was good timing: the approach of the pay-to-play version was announced not long after I started, shortly after I\u0027d made my first successful Mun landing in the then-new 0.12 version. I backed KSP right away when that happened. It\u0027s been a wild 3 years or so since then, but KSP\u0027s always been one of my top picks for what to play during that span.
