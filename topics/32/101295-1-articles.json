No time more than after Laythe One. After sending the mother ship the small space plane Osprey. And two small landers to the Jovian system. And returning after exploring laythe bop pol and even dres (It was a big modular ship with lots of fuel). And now it\u0027s actually happened. But I have seen mostly evidence of prints of stuff straight from the Construction Facilities (rockets and planes). So to the point. Will I be able to print stuff I have built in orbit?"},{"CreatedByName":"Doctor Axel","CreatedById":64944,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T17:37:16Z","Content":"Print all the individual parts and Gorilla Glue them together! =D\n\nEDIT\n\nMore to the point, that would be cool.

Now you can dock and undock as often as you want. Just make sure you keep a close eye on the polarity. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T18:41:24Z","Content":"You could use two magnets in each port, aimed oppositely so that the ports will stick as long as they\u0027re rotated the right way."},{"CreatedByName":"Blondai","CreatedById":80004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T19:39:08Z","Content":"Haha that would be awesome.
