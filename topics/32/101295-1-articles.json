No time more than after Laythe One. After sending the mother ship the small space plane Osprey. And two small landers to the Jovian system. And returning after exploring laythe bop pol and even dres (It was a big modular ship with lots of fuel). And now it\u0027s actually happened. But I have seen mostly evidence of prints of stuff straight from the Construction Facilities (rockets and planes). So to the point. Will I be able to print stuff I have built in orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Doctor Axel","CreatedById":64944,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T17:37:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPrint all the individual parts and Gorilla Glue them together! =D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore to the point, that would be cool.
