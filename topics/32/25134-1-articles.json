To me, it seems I should build a functioning space station, and eventually use it as a refueling depot to send my kerbals to the moon and planets. Only I don\u0027t understand how to do that. I\u0027ve looked at a few demo space station parts, but frankly I haven\u0027t figured out how to 1) get the heavy bastards out of the gravity well, and 2) I don\u0027t have a clue how to assemble them once I do. Is there a thread or something that explains this in some detail?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy other question is that probes just don\u0027t \u0022do\u0022 anything yet. I\u0027m assuming that will be something to come in the career mode or when we hit release. Is that correct?

Launch tanks from Kerbin is time consuming and about as least efficient as you can get. So installing the Kethan Mod is a first step. A second step is installing the ISA MAPSAT mod. This will give you 2 classes of active function probes. ISA will give you elevation maps of the bodies it\u0027s orbiting. And in the Kethane Mod are detectors which will show you where on a body deposits of the resource are located and gives you the tools to extract it and convert it into fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will need as first steps a launcher capable of sending unmanned probes to the Mun, fairly simple all in all. Fly those probes (recommend 60k orbits around the Mun) you will need to fly the probe (I recommend putting both the ISA Map dish and Kethan Detector (small) on the same probe to generate both maps at the same time) you can run it at X50 times acceleration, I recommend starting it before you go to bed and let it run while your asleep, because the Kethane detector takes a REALLY long time even at X50 speed to generate a full map. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have those maps, you can build and launch your parts for a station.

Don\u0027t push your ship to hard, While you\u0027re in the lowest part of the atmosphere keep your throttle as low as you can while still gaining altitude and speed. If you\u0027re pushing 200m/s before you reach 10-11k altitude you\u0027re wasting fuel as the atmosphere is bleeding off your extra energy. Check the map a lot, once you pass 13k check the map to see where your AP is. Once it gets to 70-75k cut your engines and coast to that point, then point directly at 90 on the horizon line and burn till you get your PE appearing and it\u0027s close to the same number as the AP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the tanks on my space station, they were empty at launch. There is a mod which gives you copies of all the stock tanks but totally empty. These are really good to use with the Kethane mod so you have empty tanks on your stations to fill with fuel.
