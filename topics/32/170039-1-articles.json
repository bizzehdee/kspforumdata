After about 2,500 hours I finally decided to try something different. After looking at different planet packs, I finally decided to try New Horizons. And it is absolutely fantastic. I don\u0027t know if any serious Kerbonaut wouldn\u0027t be willing to shell out 10 bucks (or more) for so much added gameplay. And I hear GPP is awesome as well (which is next on my list while waiting for Making History). I think this type of development is more than likely the future of the game.
