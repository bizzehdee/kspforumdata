fortress of a major corporation, and I like it that way, because now I\u0027m a middle-aged risk-avoider whose priority is supporting IRL responsibilities and looking ahead to save for a retirement

omniscient, immortal, and invulnerable)\u003C/span\u003E, I \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Estill\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E felt nervous and jumpy when I was working at a little place.\u00A0 Doing

seen a lot of companies make software, both from the inside (as an employee) and from the outside (as a customer).\u00A0 I\u0027ve seen good software development, and bad software development, and I have a pretty good idea of what both of those look like.\u00A0 I know what \u0022bad software\u0022 and \u0022bad development\u0022 attitudes look like.\u00A0 And Squad isn\u0027t

of a century of avid gameplaying, no other game has caught and held my imagination the way KSP has.\u00A0 And the KSP community in these forums is a thing of beauty-- \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eso\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E much nicer than the toxic stew that engulfs so much of the internet, which is why I agreed to become a moderator when they asked me (it\u0027s certainly not something I sought out).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of that is thanks to Squad.\u00A0 I haven\u0027t seen any other company that\u0027s delivered such wonderful stuff to its customers for so long, and maintained such close engagement, at such a modest price.\u00A0 They\u0027ve given me so much, which is why I \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecare\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 It\u0027s not like I get paid for any of this stuff, I don\u0027t work for Squad, I don\u0027t \u0022owe\u0022 them anything.\u00A0 I say all this stuff on my own dime.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI get to play with this \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Egem\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E that is KSP because Squad Did It Right\u2122, and keeps on Doing It Right\u2122.\u00A0 Not only are they \u0022doing it right\u0022... but to deliver so much of a game with such a tiny team requires taking some remarkable risks.\u00A0 Great, big, existential, potentially-lose-everyone\u0027s-job kinds of risks.\u00A0 If the folks at Squad had \u0022played it safe\u0022, KSP wouldn\u0027t even \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eexist\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Or if it did, it would be a small, dim, dull thing that would never have captured my imagination and ignited my spirit the way it has.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe have KSP because Squad, unlike me, had and continues to have the intestinal fortitude to go out on a limb, time and time again, and take significant personal risks to try to build something insanely great.\u00A0 Those risks are the price of admission.\u00A0 And when you have to take risks all the time, it\u0027s guaranteed that you\u0027re going to stumble and fall and break a leg occasionally... which is why I\u0027m willing to cut Squad plenty of slack when they occasionally drop the ball.\u00A0 I\u0027d rather have a fantastic game with an occasional dropped ball, than have no game at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E(Yes, the \u0022broken save games\u0022 issue on the console is one of those

supposedly \u0022doing it wrong\u0022... and the company they\u0027re dumping on is one that has poured years of passion and effort, at considerable personal risk, to give that customer this wonderful thing that has given the customer hundreds or thousands of hours of entertainment for a mere pittance... well, it grinds my gears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI try to be polite about it.\u00A0 I do sympathize with the gamer\u0027s point of view-- although I\u0027ve been a software developer for over twenty years, I\u0027ve been an avid game player for over thirty, so I totally get where the

living just how \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eastonishingly\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E hard it is.\u00A0 Yes, software is hard, but it\u0027s not obvious to the player.\u00A0 It\u0027s not the player\u0027s fault that they\u0027re clueless about software development, or even that they\u0027re clueless about how clueless they are.\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003EEverybody\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E is clueless about software development, except the folks who have actually done it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also can\u0027t really blame console players for being truly enraged about this situation, because this is where they \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecame in\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 They \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehaven\u0027t\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E had the benefit of all the years of great KSP gaming on the PC leading up to this point.\u00A0 They\u0027re entering the KSP world and right there, immediately, is this horrible game-ruining problem for them.\u00A0 It\u0027s not the console players\u0027 fault that they happen to just be spectacularly unlucky to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u00A0 They have a bad experience from the get-go, so it\u0027s totally understandable to be angry in that situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I do \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Enot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E mean to belittle any user\u0027s problems with KSP or with any other software, and I hope folks don\u0027t read what I write that way.\u00A0 If you\u0027ve got a game-breaking problem that ruins your enjoyment of the game, by all means complain about it!\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003EYou\u0027re\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E the expert

\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eall\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E you get to complain about.\u00A0 \u0022The game does this, and I don\u0027t like it.\u0022\u00A0 As soon as you step outside that simple

all this.\u00A0 I\u0027m hoping (perhaps naively) that I may be able to reach someone, and give them some inkling of what it takes to produce software, and why it is that things are the way they

particular trigger condition that sets it off.\u00A0 Either you get lucky and your testing process happens to trigger the condition-- in which case you see the bug-- or you don\u0027t-- in which case you don\u0027t see the bug.\u00A0 Doesn\u0027t matter how bad the bug is:\u00A0 if you don\u0027t trigger it, it\u0027s invisible.\u00A0 The fact that it\u0027s hellaciously horrible doesn\u0027t mean

get to turn is \u0022how much total QA do you do\u0022... but even there, you\u0027re constrained by the fact that, first, \u0022more QA\u0022 comes at the cost of other development tasks that are

this:\u00A0 You\u0027re a beleaguered space marine stranded on a dangerous planet filled to the brim with voracious aliens that want to chew your face off.\u00A0 You\u0027re alone, and you\u0027re in pitch black darkness, and you know that a swarm of them is probably charging you right now.\u00A0 You have a machine gun so you start blindly spraying bullets.\u00A0 You can\u0027t actually \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Etarget\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E them, since you can\u0027t see them-- the only way to know where one\u0027s located is if you happen to get lucky enough to hit one.\u00A0 All you can really do is try to lay down your machine-gun spray in an orderly grid so you try to cover as much area as you can.\u00A0 And try to put enough bullets out there that you hope you\u0027ve gotten all the really bad ones.\u00A0 But there\u0027s no way to be sure to get \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eeverything\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E.\u00A0 There\u0027s not even any way to

that \u0022hmm, I don\u0027t seem to be hitting as many of them any more\u0022, and eventually you run out of bullets.\u00A0 And then you hope like hell that the few you\u0027ve missed are small enough that they can\u0027t actually bite you in half.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you missed an innocuous one or a really lethal one... they\u0027re both equally easy to

the woe I\u0027ve been hearing has been this one, single issue.\u00A0 And there\u0027s really no way to prevent a single wild-card bug from sneaking in.\u00A0 It\u0027s a crap-shoot.\u00A0 It\u0027s possible to have a pretty thorough QA process and miss a bad bug, just as it\u0027s possible to live a healthy lifestyle and exercise right and eat right and still get really unlucky and get cancer.\u00A0 Because nobody can predict the genesis of a single cancer cell, any more than it\u0027s possible to predict a single bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes bad luck just happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not saying that that\u0027s necessarily the case here.\u00A0 I have no idea what Squad\u0027s or FTE\u0027s QA process looked like.\u00A0 Was it great?\u00A0 Was it shoddy?\u00A0 There\u0027s just not enough evidence to tell.\u00A0 I\u0027m sure you \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethink\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E there is, but if you\u0027re

I\u0027m not coming to this issue from the standpoint of software development. I\u0027m coming to this issue from a business standpoint.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSquad decided to port the game to consoles, outsourcing part of the job, and they ended up with a severely faulted product. I don\u0027t think this is up for discussion at this point. How did it happen, how to fix it, how long it takes, that\u0027s not relevant to the business - not development, business - decision I\u0027m questioning. The decision is this: \u0022The product we are selling is severely faulty. What do we do about it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the decision is \u0022We sell it anyways and pretend there is nothing gamebreaking on it\u0022 then you\u0027ll face complains. And selling a game with gamebreaking bugs without warning the customer beforehand is the very definition of a scam. That Squad and so many other developers get away with it speaks bad of the gaming market. If I were to take a similar decision in my business, I probably wouldn\u0027t be able to get away with it - my reputation would suffer, which would lead to customers choosing to buy from my competitors, and I may very well be sued - as I should.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, KSP is not a us$ 1 iPhone app. It\u0027s usually at us$ 40 and dips around us$ 25 during sales. That\u0027s 33% less than AAA game. And, contrary to AAA games, Squad expends a lot less in salaries, in part because they hire a much smaller development team and that team is based on Mexico, which has lower salaries than the USA (then again, I wonder how much AAA games are outsourced to India and other cheaper countries). So they get 66% of the gross revenue and far lower costs. How much? Well, it\u0027s not our business to know - after all, that part I wrote about not being Squad friends, investors or associates also means Squad\u0027s business isn\u0027t my own. But I don\u0027t think Squad is operating at loss, nor develops KSP as a hobby nor is a charity. They have what it seems to be a good business model.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat they need to do is to crank up sales as much as they can hiring as few people as they can - that doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027ll only hire two people, of course, but it does mean that keeping costs down mean keeping the team small. That\u0027s common business sense. That means extensive QA increases costs, it means delaying launches increases financial costs, as the surge of purchases when the game is released for a particular console gets delayed, and if they can get away with selling it while keeping the internal QA team small and debugging while customers are already buying, they\u0027ll do it. It\u0027s common business sense - if they can get away with it, that\u0027s it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird, as I\u0027ve explained above, the moment KSP became a released game didn\u0027t just meant \u0022Hey, we can now port to consoles\u0022. It means development can finish. They aren\u0027t mandated to continue developing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I disagree the continued development they\u0027ve chose to pursue is based on following what their customers want - seriously, who wanted a 2.5m subsonic jet instead of a 2.5m Nerv or a 2.5m Rapier? Neither of us has a market survey, if such a thing was ever done. But we have the subforum. Planets were added years ago. People has been asking, and wondering, about stuff to do in them for years. At this point, they pretty much look like an afterthought. Gilly has a ridiculous time warp limit since it was introduced and no developer ever said \u0022Oh, yes, that\u0027s an issue\u0022. Frankly, I wonder if there are developers who forgot what about Gilly. So go to the suggestion subforum, look for the more common requests and see when or if Squad even acknowledged them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222728726\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022146134\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221472086255\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022148725\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Just Jim\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Just Jim said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wasn\u0027t going to comment on this thread, but this statement is just bugging the crap out of me, and if I get into trouble for what I\u0027m going to say, then\u00A0so be it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off, Squad does\u00A0listen... trust me.
