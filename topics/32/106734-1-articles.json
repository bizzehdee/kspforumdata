Sorry for spelling mistakes, I\u0027m a terrible transcriber. I try and clarify what is an actual quote from Max (if it\u0027s wrapped in \u0022quotation marks\u0022, it\u0027s the best transcript of an official Squad member you\u0027ll find on the web), and what is a summary from myself as I\u0027m aware I switch between the two with 0 notice. When I say \u0027Squad\u0027, I mean \u0027the relevant people who are currently developing the game\u0027. As always, this is just a transcript of an off the cuff vlog of a non-native english speaker - some details may change or be entirely incorrect. Some mentions of 1.0.1 have already been noted in the patch notes, I know this - this is summarizing the Squadcast \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003ESquadcast Summary for 2015-05-02\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E - \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.twitch.tv/ksptv/v/4585539\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0000FF;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EWatch it here!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMonday morning, Max is picking Romfarer from the airport, then later, Kasper and Mike - they\u0027ll be planning the year for KSP and having a general vacation.
