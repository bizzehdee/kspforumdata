Before that, I\u0027d rather it didn\u0027t stabilize. Anyway, there is no way I can have my 0.90 SSTO design working here but I really don\u0027t mind. It was a small SSTO that could bring a \u0026lt;1t satelite into LKO using absurdly little fuel. The fuel costs for sending up a 800kg satelite would be something like what, 200 credits if even that much. It was completely ridiculous. Fun, cheap but ridiculous. Even in career mode, if I can\u0027t afford something slightly more \u0022real\u0022 than a SSTO-for-spare-change then I\u0027m doing something wrong elsewhere in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Habalabam","CreatedById":132821,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T08:23:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that I think should accompany every release is a working set of stock crafts. I don\u0027t doubt that the QA and independent testers have tried both massive aircrafts and SSTO. But with every major overhaul of basic physics, the paradigm of ship building changes. Online material from youtube/images become obsolete and even misleading. To have these differences visibly expressed in the catalog of stock crafts would keep everybody on the same page. Since we\u0027re now out early access and going mainstream then the stock crafts are even more important.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonboy","CreatedById":134111,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T08:52:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find the title of this thread strange considering I just threw together a simple SSTO plane in about twenty minutes.
