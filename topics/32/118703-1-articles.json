One previous crunch time was stock versions of DRE and FAR meaning fairings and heatshields also had to become stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow when your unmanned probe can be out of signal range, a basic flight computer would seem to be necessary in stock. Some people will not want this but if you can be out of signal which implies out of control then it will be quite essential.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022The first feature is probe telemetry.

There is no reason for a probe flight computer to be more complex than this. Make m-node, m-node is uploaded to probe (meaning the node must be at least _light-lag_ seconds ahead of the craft), probe executes m-node at the right time.
