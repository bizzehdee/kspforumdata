I have no more need for science, therfor I have to need for funds, or reputation.

Now you can try to make new objectives for yourself, like \u0022max out a few pilots\u0022, or \u0022max out all the buildings\u0022 (you may already have that one). Or \u0022make a million roots\u0022, or the usual sandbox goals like \u0022land on every planet\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Enorats","CreatedById":141841,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T17:02:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really like the new science lab function, as it encourages actually using the labs. That said, they need some work. Not being able to choose which lab processes which sample on a ship is annoying. Many samples are worth more data than a lab can even hold too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBalance is also a major issue. Currently every lab can gain data from any source, even those already studied by other labs. I can gain data from Kerbin, flying over kerbin, high kerbin atmosphere, LKO, HKO, solar orbit, and orbiting my destination before actually landing.. For every lab I send out. My LKO lab, orbital mun/minmus labs, and surface mun/minmus labs can fill my entire tree several times over without even touching surface data.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"justidutch","CreatedById":99185,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T18:39:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zipmafia\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Zipmafia\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI just recently landed a mobile research station on Eve with 2 kerbals in it after receiving a mission to do so.
