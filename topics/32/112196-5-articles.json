Whatever is needed to make it interesting or fun is implemented. So, ion engines lifting a 100t rocket from sea level, why not? Who\u0027s to say what is impossible in the Kerbal-verse?\n\nFrom what I\u0027ve seen and read over the years KSP is a balance between fun and realistic, with accent on realistic.\n\nIt has been using simplifications to improve fun (building out of thin air, fuel mining, fuel transfer), simplifications to avoid simulation problems (on the rails planets, SOI), scaling down to improve fun (smaller system, planets), scaling up to improve fun (high TWR, high ISP, high ion engine trust to improve burn time). But all of those simplifications and scaling are actually based in possible things. Fuel transfer is possible, but hard. RAPIER is possible, but hard, SSTO is possible but hard. Mining fuel on other planets and moons is possible, but you\u0027ve guessed it, it is hard. A lot of systems were added over time as the game was maturing, they were just missing at a time and were added over long period of time.\n\nSo yes, there are a lot of compromises on realism to have more fun, but realism was always strong in this one. There are no unicorns, warp drives and ion engines lifting 100t from sea level. In future Kerbals might eat, poop and have cities, because that was not high on list of important stuff, but your magic unicorns are nowhere to be found on that list. Your magic unicorn ion engines are not hard, they are impossible, so they are not included."},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T09:38:29Z","Content":"\u0022Sadness.

It\u0027s the time required for a transfer burn to Jool with a low-TWR nuclear stage. Burns taking more than an hour can be tedious, but 20-30-minute burns are still quite normal.\n\nKSP is ultimately a game about waiting, because that\u0027s what space travel is. You wait for the right time to launch the rocket. You wait until it\u0027s the time to start the gravity turn. You wait for the lower stage to burn out. You wait for the upper stage to raise the apoapsis high enough. You wait until the rocket reaches the apoapsis. You wait until the circularization burn finishes. You wait until it\u0027s the right time to make a Hohmann transfer to rendezvous with the target. You wait until the right point in the transfer orbit to make course corrections. You wait until you\u0027re close to the target, before killing most of the relative velocity. You wait as the ship slowly drifts closer to the target, before coming to a complete halt. You wait as the target ship slowly rotates, until the correct docking port faces the incoming ship. You wait as the ship aligns itself with the docking port, and then moves slowly closer to dock. You wait for the next launch window, and then wait for the ship to complete the interplanetary transfer burn. At this point, the mission has just only started, and there\u0027s much more waiting ahead."},{"CreatedByName":"Hotaru","CreatedById":135669,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T10:15:26Z","Content":"All of those things are either unrelated to the point of KSP and therefore fair game to be handwaved in the name of gameplay or simplicity, or in need of fixing along with the ion engines.

Same reason the contract system is simplistic and there\u0027s no political wrangling. Those of us who want logistics too (like me!) can install KCT. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Or how the planets are on rails and the sun has an infinite SOI?\n\nIt\u0027s also not about astrophysics. Planets on rails are a pretty good approximation of real life, and why should the sun\u0027s SoI be finite until we have another star system to visit?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Or that the universe\u0027s physics, planets\u0027 characteristics and how engines work changes every few months?\n\nIt\u0027s a computer program in development. This is a concession, not to *reality* but to *real life*. (Be fair, this shouldn\u0027t still be happening now that it\u0027s labeled 1.0, but that\u0027s a different argument.)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Or that infinite ore can be wished out of the ground?\n\nWe don\u0027t have hardware anywhere near large enough to mine on a scale that would deplete planetary resources. We\u0027ve got single drills, not strip mines! And the one type of body small enough for a single drill to deplete its resources--asteroids--*does* have depletable resources. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Or where magic spinning boxes can right your craft?\n\nI agree, reaction wheels could do with a nerf. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Or where the crew never eat, drink or defecate?\n\nI have to agree here as well, I would like to see some kind of stock life support. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Or where fuel can be magically created from rocks?\n\nIt\u0027s not the creating fuel from rocks that I disagree with, it\u0027s that *ore and fuel are equivalent weight!* You can refine 100t of ore into 100t of fuel! That doesn\u0027t make any kind of sense at all, and is right up there with OP ion engines on my personal list of things that *need* nerfing. Even if we keep it at an unrealisticaly high rate, at least make the ratio more like 2:1 as a token concession to reality!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Or where a claw can make two craft become one with fuel cross feeds?\n\nAlso agreed, I personally never use the claw that way and don\u0027t think it should be possible. We really could do with something like KIS in stock. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Its a game, not a simulation. Whatever is needed to make it interesting or fun is implemented. So, ion engines lifting a 100t rocket from sea level, why not? Who\u0027s to say what is impossible in the Kerbal-verse?\n\nThat logic is correct, for *mods*. Not for the stock game. Giving the Kerbals assault rifles so they can shoot each other would be interesting. Warp drive sounds fun too. Aliens, those would be interesting. Lightsabers are all kinds of fun. Should Squad implement those things too? Or should they be left to modders, because, although interesting, they have nothing to do with what KSP is about: *space exploration*?\n\nJust because it would be fun or interesting doesn\u0027t mean it should be in stock KSP. And just because it\u0027s already in stock KSP doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s not overpowered and in need of a nerf."},{"CreatedByName":"Zzabur","CreatedById":94190,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T10:47:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E They still need to be able to complete a burn in a reasonable time.\n\u003E 20 minutes is not a reasonable time.\n\nYou can warp x2-3-4 during burn.
