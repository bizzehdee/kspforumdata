I think in kinda hit a sweet spot when I started ksp. It was about 2 months before career mode version was released so I was too advanced in my game to scrap all my achievements and start with career mode but still too early to get bored of sandbox and wanted a challenge that career gives. Every now and then I\u0027m tempted to start anew but then I get an idea of building a new colony or a new space station and to have to start my current infrastructure (all those launches and fuel transfers from my kethane mines on minmus all to do again! Shudder) would be too daunting. I have two flotillas enroute to duna and jol and two large mining vessels training and evolving prior to a tour around the system. To scrap that and start with a few parts and digging kerbal dirt to get points seem pointless for me (not dissing career itself but its just where I am in the game)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think when currency comes out with contracts and gets fully integrated with the kethane and life support mods I might manually edit my science to unlock all the tech tree and start from there.
