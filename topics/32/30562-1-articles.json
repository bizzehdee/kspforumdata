SAS modules do not increase \u0027command torque\u0027 (aka rotation power), i.e. the torque applied when you press the WSAD keys. What they do is actually to apply a torque opposite to the direction of rotation of your ship in order to counteract that motion. You cannot control this, it is automatic, and you cannot direct it to make your ship spin faster. If you want to increase your rotation power you have to add more command modules.

It is in fact related to the Octagonal Struts (both kinds).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was told to put something inbetween Octagonal Struts and docking ports since the struts have some kind of physics problem. Well, that didn\u0027t solve the problem.

I had removed the Octagonal Struts from the side ports on my craft, but not the one on the nose, and it still had problems even if I used the side docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI basically created 2 sets of crafts. One set with a single Octagonal Strut on the nose, one set without.
