If you read on, please don\u0027t hold me responsible for giving anything away and spoiling your fun!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFriends, I need your help.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA few months ago I posted a thread suggesting that \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/153612-exploration-accolades/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EExploration Accolades\u003C/a\u003E could be added to KSP as an encouragement to revisit worlds and launch different mission profiles, as well as have the game record some of your achievements. I still think this is a good idea, but I also recognise that KSP has moved beyond that optimal stage of development when features like this stood any real chance of being integrated.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, I thought, why not simply create a catalog of places worth visiting and share it with the community as a giant destination-finder that does slightly better than just reward you with a bit of science when you get there. If there was enough interest, it could even become a massive compendium of lesser challenges, with sig-badge awards galore for the determined polyglobetrotter.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe trouble is, I don\u0027t have a great deal of time on the one hand or technical know-how on the other, to seek out and find these locations. What I\u0027d really like is for people to respond here reporting locations they\u0027ve found and tell me how to go there and find it myself. Hopefully I will be able to visit and verify each returned location before adding it to the catalog.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLet me clear, this goes a step beyond easter eggs (although they\u0027re welcome too). I\u0027m wanting to collect location information for:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nhighest peaks or ridges/deepest pits or trenches, (this might be retrievable from map data, but IDK)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nriver mouths/sources, \u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nlakes or pools,\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nmajor and minor impact craters,\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nthe north/south poles,\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nlarge and small islands\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nhidden/secret valleys\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nanywhere at all that you can reliably see something picturesque, remarkable or unique (I\u0027m thinking of Joolrise, but there must be better examples).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nanything else that might just be noteworthy enough to be worth a visit\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nPictures are not necessarily required (in fact in some cases they might ruin the surprise!). What I really want to know from you is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nWhat is it?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhere is it? (world and latitude/longitude)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhich way do I have to look from there to see it (if applicable)?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhat time should I be there to get the best out of it?
