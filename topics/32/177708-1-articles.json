Otherwise it won\u0027t be strong enough and you\u0027ll get all kinda issues if you try to time warp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-22T01:58:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the most popular designs for stock hinges uses linear-7 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports held in a cage of thermometers.\u00A0Getting them to work as as much an art as a science, but you\u0027ll start to get a feel for it soon. The legs and rotating part of the hinge need to be able to separate\u00A0from the main rocket, either with decouplers or docking ports, then reconnect with a docking port. Aligning the connection docking ports will be made much easier if the root of the landing leg ships is at their center of rotation. Making that work is easier with the Editor Extensions Redux mod. I also recommend WASD Editor Cam to let you see the fiddly little parts easily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
