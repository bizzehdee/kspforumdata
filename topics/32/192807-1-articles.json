If you want to ensure you\u0027re not going to have problems, do the following:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Copy the \u0022saves\u0022 subfolder to another location FIRST. Don\u0027t touch this copy. If you need to do anything with it, copy the copy, and work with that second copy. ZIP the first copy if you need to - this ensures that you have a known good backup of your save games.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Screenshot the directory list in GameData, so you know what mods are associated with those save games. Put that screenshot with the save folder copy.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. Copy your GameData\u00A0directory from Steam-\u0026gt;steamapps-\u0026gt;common-\u0026gt;Kerbal Space Program to another location. Now you have known good copies of \u0022GameData\u0022 and \u0022saves\u0022. Also copy your Settings file from the KSP root directory.\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. Right-click on the KSP app in Steam, select Properties. Go to the \u0022BETAS\u0022 tab. Select the desired version (ex. \u00221.8.1 - Kerbal Space Program\u0022). Click \u0022Close\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n5. Steam will update to the selected version. When it finishes, copy the whole directory somewhere else - this is your \u0022play\u0022 copy. It will never update on its own.\u003Cbr\u003E\n6. If there are problems with either the mods or the game saves, copy from your backups into the \u0022play\u0022 directory of KSP to resolve.\u003Cbr\u003E\n7. Change your Steam copy from the BETA version back to the current version. This directory will now update and remain current.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSteam doesn\u0027t care about anything it didn\u0027t install, and the default behavior is to not mess with mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8. Learn how to edit the settings file, config files, the persistence file in your game save, and about the various utilities people made to do that easier. The particulars are beyond the scope of this post, but if you\u0027re going to play a modded game and not use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, then you owe it to yourself and the community to educate yourself about how the game works and how to fix simple and medium-complexity issues. That\u0027s not a slam on you or anyone individually. I\u0027ve\u00A0been playing KSP for over 6 years, so the hard part for me is remembering what\u0027s automatic for me isn\u0027t for everyone else.\u00A0Some of us had a hard time with the learning curve, but we did it, and our game experiences are far greater as a result.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbove all, let\u0027s treat each other with kindness and respect. It\u0027s easy to get upset when a game doesn\u0027t work, especially when one pays for it, and it\u0027s easy to get frustrated with modders, even though we\u0027re getting those for free. They don\u0027t have to do this, and it\u0027s a seriously thankless job to make mods, take over mods, do beta testing, or moderate forums. Our first response in any of these threads should be to assume that the other person is a decent human being who is not deliberately trying to antagonize us or ruin our game. Because they\u0027re not - we\u0027re all just trying to enjoy it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-31T17:10:37Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2020 05:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by panarchist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ecorrect errors, clarify one point\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kspnerd122","CreatedById":199169,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-31T16:53:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso we should copy my entire game as i still want a game with updates rather than ending updates(as in, i want to get updates on my main file but on my modded save i do not want them because i still want the modern version of ksp that recives updates as normal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nalso i do not use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E but i know how to install mods by inserting them into ksp files\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ExtremeSquared","CreatedById":153192,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-31T17:02:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223764066\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022181547\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221585673587\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199169\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kspnerd122\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 minutes ago, kspnerd122 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso we should copy my entire game as i still want a game with updates rather than ending updates(as in, i want to get updates on my main file but on my modded save i do not want them because i still want the modern version of ksp that recives updates as normal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is absolutely the normal way to do things.
