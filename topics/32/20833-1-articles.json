There are several people who have been requesting a multiplayer feature for competitive and cooperative gameplay. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do agree about that it would be awesome. But as I\u0027m working a bit with programming myself I do also understand that it would be very demanding to include a function like that in the game. And I also believe that some parts of KSP maybe wouldn\u0027t work that good in Multiplayer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough I would really like to see more competitive gameplay. Sure there are these \u0022challenges\u0022 threads, and that\u0027s great. But for me it feels like it\u0027s not really enough. Therefore I want to present an idea of mine for you to see if anyone would be interested in this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea is to first of all set up a \u0022challenge\u0022. This could be anything, like making a successful mun landing for example. This may sound like the normal \u0022challenge\u0022 stuff. But my idea is to make the participants live-stream their games to a website (which I will set up if enough people are interested). This means that you, in real time, can watch people competing in KSP and see the differences of how they build and fly their spacecrafts to complete the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure there will be questions about the very long time which will be needed to complete a challenge in real-time. And I do understand that many people can\u0027t play in real time as most of us have lives away from KSP as well. Though I think there is a solution to this problem as well. In the game the \u0022flight time\u0022 are displayed in the top left corner of the screen. I think you could use this timer to decide a \u0022time speed\u0022 for the challenge. Here\u0027s an example: For each real time hour you are allowed to play 5 mission hours in the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this system the competitors will be able to do their everyday-life tasks as well as the challenge. And the competitors will still keep up at quite similar speed so that the spectators will still find it interesting to watch. Now I guess some of you will ask \u0022but if I\u0027m live streaming the game, how will I then be able to use my computer for other tasks?\u0022. The answer to that is that you don\u0027t need to live stream 24/7. Just stream when you\u0027re playing and if possible when you\u0027re not at the computer at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is just the basic idea of what I\u0027ve been thinking of. Before deciding anything more I want to know if this is something you guys would find entertaining. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd when it comes to time speeds and such I\u0027ve not decided anything at all. What I wrote above was just some thoughts and ideas. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe live streaming will by the way not be very hard to set up and it will be free as well. I think one of the best solutions will be to use ustream.tv\u0027s streaming service which I will then embed on the website dedicated to this project. And I will also fix a tutorial for how to setup the streaming. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m by the way working some with web development on my freetime for getting an extra income so I don\u0027t think there\u0027ll be any problems setting up a website for this purpose. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease excuse my not-very-good English.
