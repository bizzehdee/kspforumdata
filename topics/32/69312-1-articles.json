I do believe some players have been able to use drogues \u002B parachutes to arrest the plane\u0027s movement and bring it floating down. If it works, it provides the easiness of a capsule with the gentler descent and landing site selection of a spaceplane.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use some mods, but one of the useful things I\u0027ve found is air brakes. Air brakes, drogue chutes, retro-engines, all part of my grand experiments for safe and soft landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe emergency ejection safety cockpit is merely there for that one time in a hundred where an unknown, unseen failure renders landing unsafe. You know, the \u0022out of gas and I\u0027ve shot past the island runway with such force and so little altitude that I can\u0027t turn around in time\u0022 moments, or the times where your drop tank broke off one of your landing gear. So as you\u0027re coming in to land, you pop the ejection system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf KSP physics didn\u0027t destroy non-probed vehicles in suborbital flights after 2.5 km, the majority would be reusable. Only total loss are the air intakes that are ejected as a first step to emergency separation, in order to guarantee the engine shuts down. Parachutes deploy on flight half, decoupler is fired to jettison the wings, tail, engine, and rear main gear along with any residual fuel. Pilot half is now free floating, still in danger. Sepratrons are ignited to push the cockpit and remaining attachments away from flight half. Upon burnout, parachutes are deployed, SAS is disengaged. Kerbal and science modules touch down with full parachute deployment at 1500m above ground level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeedless to say, I took into account all total variables on how to separate the cockpit from the plane and not kill the kerbal flying within. Including on one design, jettisoning the wings before commencing full engine/cockpit separation to avoid the flight module being stuck on the back of the pilot module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also done my share of total-recovery-vehicles where parachutes are deployed to bring the entirety of the aircraft to the ground on soft silk.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
