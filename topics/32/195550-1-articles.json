The reason behind this was unknown, until it was revealed they had actually been hired by Valve, to work on... something.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, what exactly this project was has remained unknown since then, presumably due to NDAs and the like. But recently, Valve released this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361700/HalfLife_Alyx__Final_Hours/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHalf-Life: Alyx - Final Hours\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...effectively an interactive look into what Valve\u0027s been up to all these years. Now, I don\u0027t own it myself, but according to Daniel Hardcastle (aka NerdCubed) in his most recent video (which I won\u0027t link here due to likely containing profanities), the KSP devs hired were working on SimTrek, a Star Trek themed VR game! Unfortunately, it was cancelled some time ago, apparently so more VR development resources could be focused towards Half-Life: Alyx itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust something I found interesting, it\u0027s nice to know where those people who\u0027ve influenced KSP so much ended up\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-12T00:45:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s known that Valve usually allows their devs to work on whatever projects they please, so they may have ended up working on updates for Team Fortress 2 for all we know.\u00A0 Unless, of course, you have credit lists or something cool like that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DunaManiac","CreatedById":176003,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-14T21:57:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223819112\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022195550\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221594505499\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002259429\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GluttonyReaper\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/11/2020 at 6:11 PM, GluttonyReaper said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStar Trek themed VR game!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAw, I would have loved to see that!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022;.;\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-15T22:30:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe people who left were not hired away by Valve.
