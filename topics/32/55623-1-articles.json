I haven\u0027t had a single stranded Kerbonaut since I restarted my campaign in 0.22, because I tend to overbuild both in fuel capacity and landing leg strength.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; Unmanned vessels are handy for a lot of stuff, like mining vessels or gigantic boosters. The control nodes are lighter than a manned capsule, and the electricity cost is negligible once you get solar panels. The fact that no kerbonauts are risked in the process is just an added bonus. All of my stations, mining landers, rovers, and so on all use unmanned nodes; if they have any crew capacity, it\u0027s not necessary to function.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut most importantly:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3\u0026gt; When you\u0027re making hundred-ton vessels, adding a bit of extra crew capacity (a small hitchhiker module, or using a 2- or 3-man capsule when you only need 1) to a vessel doesn\u0027t hurt much. I\u0027ve got several designs that, if need be, could fly to Mun to pick up any stranded kerbonauts. Heck, my standard Mun rover uses a 2-man capsule but is typically unmanned, so I could just send one of those to them, and each has enough rocket power built in to bring them back to a Kerbin space station if need be. (Or just drive them to a moon base.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, there\u0027s no reason not to put that station around Mun anyway. It\u0027ll come in handy refueling vessels, and if you give it a small utility lander with a hitchhiker you\u0027ll be able to pick up all those stranded guys for easy transfer to a shuttle. But in the long term you just won\u0027t need that sort of thing as much, so you\u0027ll want to design that utility vessel to do other useful stuff as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"larsmaehlum","CreatedById":51566,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T11:22:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve landed multiple Hitchiker Storage Containers on the Mun(and a few other places) to rescue bigger crews.

I also avoid sending 3 Kerbals in a tiny capsule to Eeloo and enjoy taking habitability into account : so an interplanetary transfer module of mine will have several Hitchhiker pods, whereas a lander designed for a \u0022land-flag-photo-return\u0022 mission will probably not include one, depending on how much time the Kerbals will have to spend in their tin can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, most of the fun I derive from the game comes the very high value I attach to Kerbal lives and the design compromises I have to face when designing ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI even designed a SAR spacecraft with a lot of delta V and a few Hichhiker pods, but fortunately I haven\u0027t needed it yet... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T15:58:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is my Dres Rescue Mission\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/dPYAe\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
