I don\u0027t know them all off the top of my head, but they are easy to find.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese first three are relevant because Newton discovered they not only pertain to planets and moons, but all objects orbiting a central mass:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Kepler\u0027s First Law of Planetary Motion - All planets move in an Elipse with the Sun at one of the Foci. One critical equation that comes out of this is the formula for the Semi-Major Axis: Sma=(Pe\u002BAp)/2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Kepler\u0027s Second Law - Orbiting planets sweep out equal areas in equal time. A couple equations can be derived from this law that tell you exactly how much you need to change your velocity to change one elipse into another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Kepler\u0027s Third Law - The Square of the Period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis: R=P^2/Sma^3, where R is a constant. This one can be easily derived into a simple equation to determine optimal transfer angles for interplanetary travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Thrust to Weight Ratio (TWR): Which is simply Rtw=T/W\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Tsiolkovsky\u0027s Rocket Equation (this one I have MEMORIZED) which describes how much total change in velocity (referred to as Delta-V) a rocket has based on it\u0027s mass, fuel, and engine efficiency: Dv=Isp*G*Ln(M0/M1), where M0 is initial (full) mass, and M1 is final (empty) mass. Oh and G refers to the force of gravity at sea-level, which is ~9.8m/s^2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m like you, I would rather run a quick equation through a calculator and come up with the answer than run an add-on.
