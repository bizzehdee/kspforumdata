It is so annoying because before this PD launcher, I could have my modded games on install locations out of steams reach and stil have full steam functionality. The weird hidden launch parameters put inn to try to make steam force launch the PD launcher messes with the parameter settings. In fact. If you delete the PD launcher EXE, yet aim with your launch paremeters to launch from another location, steam will find out its missing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
