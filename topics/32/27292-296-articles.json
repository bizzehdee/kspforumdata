Though I was able to get a close intercept, my craft weren\u0027t capable of cancelling out the relative velocity in time to escape the moon\u0027s gravity. I think I\u0027ll just have to send a rescue mission with some extra fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, I decided to build a warship with my own custom-built missiles (just for fun). I was able to design a neat missile that uses Sepratrons to accelerate at 15g\u0027s for four seconds \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 surely enough speed to destroy any target. But when I tested them in space, they seemed incapable of damaging the spent rocket stage I had targeted. I eventually tried ramming the debris outright -- the collision tore my ship apart, but the debris was completely undamaged.

Launched a manned mission to orbit Eve and land on Gilly. I also launched a probe to Eeloo which will slingshot by Jool. The probe won\u0027t be getting much of a boost from Jool, mostly just using it for a small inclination change. But most significantly was what happened around Moho. My new \u0022Trifecta\u0022 probe arrived, which is a combination orbiter, lander, and rover. All three elements worked perfectly. The orbiter is in a good orbit scanning for Kethane, the lander and rover landing perfectly, and I had fun driving the rover all the way up the side of a larger crater to look inside. Reminded me of some of the photos from Spirit and Opportunity. The only thing I realized, is I kinda messed up the design of the lander. The way it was \u003Cem\u003Esupposed \u003C/em\u003Eto work, was a skycrane type delivery system would release the lander/rover combo onto the surface of Moho, and then the skycrane would fly off and crash in the distance. The only flaw was, I completely forgot to put a decoupling mechanism between the lander and the skycrane \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E. Thankfully, I picked a nice flat spot to land on, because with the skycrane still attached the thing is massively top heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other big thing that arrived at Moho, was the fuel resupply mission for my lander and return vehicle. Orbital insertion went beautifully, as did the rendezvous and docking with the lander. The only catch with this one, was after docking with the lander and refuelling it, I realized I had meant to rendezvous with return vehicle first, because I had a decent stage for the lander attached to the resupply vehicle, and once it decoupled, the rest of the vehicle wouldn\u0027t be able to dock with anything again. The lander and return vehicle are in very different orbits (in retrospect, I should have inserted them into similar orbits), so I don\u0027t want to undock, do a massive plane-change to the return vehicle, and then do another massive plane-change back. So instead, what I\u0027m going to do once my orbit gets to where I plan to land, is I\u0027ll use the entire resupply vehicle to kill most of the lander\u0027s orbital velocity, undock, then burn prograde and get itself back into a stable orbit. After I land, I\u0027ll then have the resupply vehicle head over to the return vehicle, and transfer over whatever fuel is remaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich makes tomorrow the big day for me.
