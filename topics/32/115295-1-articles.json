Do things that will help you master a skill set. For example, setting up an orbital refinery around Minmus and boosting ore up to it will help you get docking down. Moving the resulting fuel over to Mun will help with transfer orbits. Play all 3 modes as they each have their own strengths and drawbacks. Do crazy stuff just because.

When you run into a brick wall, take the opportunity to learn about what\u0027s holding you back. Learn the math/ engineering principles (education) and apply them to your efforts (practice).

I used to just dock visually, just keep checking at 90 degrees to make sure you stay lined up as you close in. Then I tried the Docking Alignment Indicator mod, which is especially awesome for IVA flying, and makes it even easier once you get used to it. You can do pretty close to the same kind of lineup with just the navball as well, line up your prograde with the target, used WASD to keep yourself aligned, and IJKL to keep the prograde marker aligned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn my list of things to figure out is what the heck an ejection angle is, and other useful things for planning efficient transfers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
