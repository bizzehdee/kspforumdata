I had just jettisoned my first stage booster away and thought nothing of the debris until I realized that debris has no indicator!

Latter is true, former is false as it turns out - I must now attempt a landing!). Anyways, with an early version of the ship, I made the mistake of allowing mechjeb to try to pilot it; like on every massive ship with small peripheral SRBs that I\\\u0027ve let it pilot so far, it shook the outer boosters off, which then collided with boosters further in and caused a chain reaction of structural failures, and created a massive sub-orbital debris plume 30-50km in altitude. The next two launches blew up due to crashing into the debris, ending up adding to the cloud. 4th launch finally made it through mostly intact (though it did lose two SRBs in a collision), but I accidentally hit the spacebar on an upper stage which had not completed its burn, and so I scrubbed that one.
