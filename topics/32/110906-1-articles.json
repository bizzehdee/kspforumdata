I\u0027m about to do a survey of Laythe and want to know roughly where I should be looking, biome borders maybe?\n\u003E Any info would be appreciated..\n\nThese days, Laythe only has 4 biomes: Pole, Sagan Sea, Shore, and Dunes.\n\nI\u0027ve noticed that in 1.x, most planets seem to have fewer biomes than they did in 0.9. Duna, for instance, now only has 4: Poles, highlands, midlands, and lowlands. IIRC, even after Custom Biomes became stock, several of Duna\u0027s large craters and basins had their own names.\n\nI\u0027m guessing this has something to do with the new Ore resource system. Because this is based on biomes, and because concentrations are randomized each game, it\u0027s easier on the players to have fewer, more generic and wide-spread biomes than to have lots of small, local biomes. That way, you\u0027re not screwed by having the only good patch of ore stuck in some small, high-latitude crater, but can set up your mines anywhere within the vast expanse of a planet-wide biome."},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T13:55:30Z","Content":"Thanks for the reply Geschosskopf.
