The RSS config for it makes it playable, I only have to launch maybe three relay sats, two of those for launching.\nAnd seriously, time delay for Eeloo would be like, eight minutes. IMO that\u0027s not really worth the bother of a command system. This addition seems like a good compromise and is just realistic enough.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E All that said, I do like the new models, they are very nice\n\nTotally disagree on that one as well, they look way too \u0022clunky\u0022 and the textures are just ... off.

It does seem to be a lot of parts to support this element, we\u0027ll have more antennas than we have rover wheels, or landing legs, for example.\n\u003E One thing I\u0027ve noticed about Squad implementing features that were previously done by mods: The heavy users of those mods are never satisfied. New stock aero didn\u0027t satisfy most FAR enthusiasts. Stock ISRU didn\u0027t seem to satisfy the Kethane/Karbonite/ScanSAT crowd. Better stock spaceplane parts didn\u0027t satisfy the B9 people. I expect I\u0027ll be one of these people when/if a stock delta-V meter is implemented, it will likely be simpler than KER (or alternatives) so I\u0027ll stick to the mod.\n\u003E \n\u003E The thing is, these implemented features make a good core for those who don\u0027t use mods and make those aspects of the game better for a majority of players (I don\u0027t think any single mod is used by the majority of the playerbase, I\u0027d be surprised if the majority uses mods at all). Players can then pick and choose where the stock game doesn\u0027t satisfy them and use mods to enhance those aspects. Best of all, the new features added lately seem to be made with ease of moddability in mind, so they should make it easier to have mods that are robust and fully featured without reinventing the wheel.\n\nEvery word, well said.

The most popular mods generate something like 30-50k downloads for any given version (the total download count is a more a reflection of how many versions of an addon exist, rather than just popularity), and how many of those downloaders actually use the addon is a different question. Given the numbers for KSP sales that have been thrown around this suggests that mods aren\u0027t nearly as popular as forum users like to think. \n\nSo having a relatively user-friendly version of a popular addon incorporated into the stock game is a good thing. Complaining that it doesn\u0027t provide all of the features of a given addon, or isn\u0027t hard enough doesn\u0027t make much sense to me. Just continue using addons if you want those features."},{"CreatedByName":"mid0r","CreatedById":146822,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T23:19:05Z","Content":"Dont they have more important stuff to code?!?"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T23:23:52Z","Content":"I\u0027m playing a RemoteTech game for the first time.

This isn\u0027t really realistic (come on, does anyone think that NASA, in a mission where the probe would need to do stuff while out of sight of the DSN, won\u0027t make sure the probe is able to do stuff anyway?), it doesn\u0027t make gameplay easier and, frankly, it doesn\u0027t make it funnier or better, it\u0027s just tedium.\n\nI guess two satellites in a polar solar orbit would be the minimum required grind to have LoS with everywhere in the kerbol system at least... sighs..."},{"CreatedByName":"Jett_Quasar","CreatedById":117851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T02:38:11Z","Content":"I like the idea of building a communication network, I think it will be a great addition to game play. The only problem is that the game really doesn\u0027t do a great job of supporting a lot of separate flights so I think once you\u0027ve placed the communications satellite in a proper orbit you shouldn\u0027t need to leave it there. Sort of like how the resource mapping works - once you\u0027ve established a polar orbit the scan is done and the satellite is no longer needed. To me that was the reason behind the orbital contracts but to have a specific requirement to set up a communications network is a great idea.\n\nJR"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T03:37:29Z","Content":"One of the things that can make RemoteTech tedious is that you can\u0027t make self-correcting station-keeping satellites in KSP.

Again, it\u0027s not a player limitation, nor a thing a mod can fix. The base game itself demands that the only part of the universe that can currently operate with the full simulation environment is a small sphere within a near distance of the camera. Everything else is frozen on rails. You can write all the station-keeping code you feel like in something like kOS and it doesn\u0027t do a bit of good unless you occasionally interrupt yourself every few days of gametime to re-focus the camera on the satellites so the KSP game engine will actually allow them to get off rails and do adjustments.\n\nIt would be handy if the main game allowed you to sync a few satellites in orbit to each other and lock them on rails TOGETHER as a locked SET, to simulate the stationkeeping that the game engine\u0027s limitations currently makes impossible. It could have tight narrow tolerances and say that before you tie them together into a locked set, you must first put them within very closely the same orbit, just differing by phase angle only - then it could put them all on the \u0022same rail\u0022 - remembering their phase angle offsets and locking them all to one satellite (i.e. remember that satellite C is 120 degrees behind B, which is 120 degrees behind A, and then just calculate A\u0027s position on rails, and derive B\u0027s and C\u0027s positions as being locked at 120, and 240 degrees off from wherever A is.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Pixel Kola","CreatedById":147216,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T06:31:20Z","Content":"I\u0027d prefer they work on a logical, more in-depth contract system so that THIS comm system has more purpose and not just \u0027hey, look its Remote Tech Lite and you can already do this stuff with half a dozen mods and even better\u0027.\n\nContracts should be their #1 priority.

I was actually thinking of writing a mod to do this. I was going to call it the orbital correction device, or OCD for short. I don\u0027t have time to do it now, or anytime in the near future, I don\u0027t even have a C# environment on my computer at the moment. But I don\u0027t think it should be too complicated. I don\u0027t feel any ownership of it and most certainly would not object to someone else making it based on the approach below.\n\nKSP stores orbital information as Semi-Major axis, eccentricity, inclination, longitude of PE, longitude of ascending node, mean anomaly at epoch and epoch. Of these, only the semi-major axis has any affect on orbital period. Vessels with the same orbital period maintain station relative to each other, and this is represented accurately by the patched conics used in KSP. There is no need to maintain a list of other satellites in the constellation or fix phase angles, it is sufficient to give them all the same SMA.\n\nThe code would execute every time a vessel is unloaded, and would look like this:\n\n    a = semi major axis of orbit of the vessel being unloadedMake a list of other vessels orbiting the same bodyFor each vessel in the list    b = semi major axis of orbit of the vessel from the list    if |a-b|/a\u003C0.0001 then        a=b        Break from loop\n\nThere are probably a few other useful features, like syncing SMA with that of celestial bodies as well as vessels (this would make stable quasi-lagrange points at L3, L4 and L5). It might also make sense to tune the 0.001 threshold above to different celestial bodies and altitudes to make sure it is always neither trivial nor impossible to achieve. A simple GUI indicating what changes would be made on unloading might also be good.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-25T22:36:03Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2015 10:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kermunist**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bev7787","CreatedById":136501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T23:35:58Z","Content":"I like the antennas.
