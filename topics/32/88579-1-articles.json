At these settings, it can be difficult to earn money from test flights, as the rocket I build to perform the test could easily end up costing more than I get back in rewards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got a contract to test the LFB in flight above Kerbin.

The point I\u0027m trying to make is that this kind of flight is possible. When I first tried out the contracts system, I assumed what most players assume and built an elaborate lifting vehicle to fly the required engine to the required altitude and speed, or orbit, or whatever, and then activated the engine to complete the contract. Now, I can use the engine to get there, and then activate it again under the required conditions. This has a huge impact on the usefulness of engine test contracts on harder difficulties.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daffs","CreatedById":109699,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T19:23:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENothing wrong with that in my eyes.
