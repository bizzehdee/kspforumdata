For instance, take the case of astronomy--before it was \u0022refined\u0022, it was mostly astrology. In the case of chemistry, it was alchemy. In the case of mathematics, it was numerology. And you have personalities that backed strange notions that were never proven correct. Like Nikola Tesla and some of his even more stranger ideas, and that guy from Norway who studied the Aurora Borealis (Birklandt?). So for me, the current \u0022mystery box\u0022 concept is somewhat a reflection of this, especially considering Kerbals are infamous for their \u0022average stupidity\u0022 as opposed to \u0022average intelligence.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rodion_herrera","CreatedById":66284,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T22:03:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the first time, there is a poll I really like about KSP, because the results of the poll (so far) reflects my likes/thoughts/observations.

Sure, career mode sorely needs missions to structure it more for the new player, and money to restrain progress a bit and balance the experience more.

But I\u0027d lost my entire saved game from previously, all my lovely bases *sniff*. So I was starting again somewhat jaded. I ran the Soviet Pack that I\u0027d always wanted to try (and wasn\u0027t able too with WinXP) and wondered what I was to do next? Grind out solar system spanning missions again from scratch?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, the .22 patch did add a lot of fun to the game for this somewhat jaded player; the Science is very, very Kerbal-esque in it\u0027s nature, especially the reliance on putting Jeb in odd situations to see if he discovers something new. Have you sampled the Launch Pad? Standing outside the capsule way up on top of the rocket? EVAing everywhere? Most amusing, as is the changing gel shapes and reports...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve not gone too deep into the tech yet, as I\u0027m re-learning how to fly an entire mission by hand. A few small annoyances; There\u0027s no easy way to see how data is stored. For instance, there seems to only be space for 1 crew report, and it immediately asks you to over-write it if you try again; but the gel is used over and over again... but on landing you only get one report saved? Where as the EVA, if you load it to the command pod whilst Jeb is still outside, or when you return to the pod records as many as you can get Biomes/locations for. Confusing. They need to tidy that up somewhat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer mode is interesting, but has two contradictory results; firstly it encourages you to experiment with a simple tool set, which will be good for newbies as it removes a lot of the frustrating information-madness that paralyses and spoils the fun for many; \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/chocoboasylum/videos?view=0\u0026amp;shelf_index=1\u0026amp;sort=dd\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u0027s one of my friend\u0027s youtube channel\u003C/a\u003E and you can see her slowly progressing only by my telling her in comments what all the information means. I suspect then Career mode will be a useful tutorial for her.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut on the other hand, there\u0027s one thing which is likely to put newbies off; you don\u0027t start with a Probe of any kind. And for people who want to follow alternative history, take the safer/cheaper route, or just don\u0027t like to risk their kerbals, that\u0027ll be very off-putting. Worse, there\u0027s no way to decouple the pod on the first rocket; now I went for a walk around Spaceport, and sampled the landing pad, looked at the gloop on it, and got enough points to unlock the decoupler; but remember, I know what it does and what I was looking for, so I didn\u0027t try and bring a pod back with fuel and engines still attached. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a couple of other, similar questionable design ideas; access to Electricity is one. Again, I\u0027ve many, many hours in KSP over the years, so I knew that, baring some serious screwup, Jeb and his data were coming back. I slapped some aerials on just to experiment, but in general I didn\u0027t use any Electricity. Which is fortunate because you don\u0027t get any until deep in the tech. I suspect they\u0027ve done that to try and teach people energy management, and limit progression; however all it will do is teach people bad habits later when they are doing long distance probes because they\u0027ll be thinking of bringing it back. Far better to separate clearly Kerbal and Automative science, and teach survival in one and energy in the other. Which means having a probe in tier 1 again! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, that lovely gloop container is nice, but it won\u0027t be when aerodynamics are properly introduced. Unless you have Gloop Science as a third \u0022path\u0022 which teaches you to streamline to sneak it in (or develop bigger boosters to get it up inside something else, like a Skylab/Mir style station). Also currently, and sadly, gloop doesn\u0027t recognise re-entry heat... nor does Jeb, so don\u0027t bother trying to build a cage around his pod so he can go out and toast, he he...
