The newfound tank suckage of the \u0027Nerv\u0027 is actually the most \u0022realistic\u0022. My research to date on long-term hydrogen storage at around 0.2:1 mass ratios (yes, \u0026lt;1) for a long-term liquid system, and 0.05:1 for a high-pressure compressed system (300 bar). Keep in mind that existing H2/LOX conventional engines are only used for getting into orbit (a very short timeframe) so they don\u0027t need long-term storage. Long-endurance spacecraft (Apollo CSM/LEM, deep space probes, etc) generally run on some flavor of hydrazine/NTO. von Braun\u0027s nuclear tug would require some sort of ... fuel tank magic to avoid boil-off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) No NTR has \u003Cem\u003Eever\u003C/em\u003E flown on a mission, so they aren\u0027t in fact \u0022real\u0022 at all.
