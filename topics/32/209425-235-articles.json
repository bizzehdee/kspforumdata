something really technical. some months ago our cable company stopped cabling, and so we were forced to go with streaming services. i have an old i5 machine doing media center duty.\u00A0the problem is, we are getting sick and tired of getting up to turn on the pc when we want to watch tv. try as i might i cant get the thing to wake up via wireless keyboard.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nrummaging through my components ive discovered i have everything i need to make an ir toggled switch. i found a 3.3v arduino pro micro. its a atmega32u4 board, which means i can use it as a usb keyboard/mouse (il connect this to an internal usb header). then i rummaged around for an ir sensor and found one that works. this thing will have a list of bindings on its eeprom to bind remote codes to keys, etc. if it detects the right ir code it will forward the appropriate command to the pc. however the main function will be to turn on the pc from an off state. enter the purple wire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe purple wire is the 5v standby supply on the psu. this delivers 5v all the time, even when the computer is off. the arduino on the other hand will be wide awake and looking for remote codes. if it finds one it will turn on the pc by bridging the power on pins on the mobo front panel header.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfirst issue (more of a sanity check really) that i can see is that the board will be connected to both 5v standby by the raw pin and 5v via usb. ground is also sourced from the usb (i think its good practice to source ground in only one place so as not to cause ground loops). i found a schematic of the pro micro and i think this is actually fine.\u00A0 there is a diode between the 5v on usb and the raw in pin (both go to the 3.3v regulator). i figure because the voltages will both be 5v, the diode wont switch on. also the 5vsb cannot feed back into the usb header. i cant think of a situation where the reverse would happen, unless something was really out of spec. is this correct or am i insane?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe second is how to go about switching on the pc. i dont have a schematic for my mobo, so im kind of flying blind on this one.\u00A0my instinct is that the pw\u002B is active low (pulled up to the standby voltage internally) and that the pw- is really just ground, shorting them starts the pc. if this is the case then i just need to connect a single pin header between the pw\u002B and an io pin on the arduino and i should be able to start it up by connecting the io pin to ground for a few ms, and then z-state it. alternatively i could bridge the pins with a mosfet and forget about the logic levels of the pins. the latter seems like the safest bet (says the guy always blowing up transistors), but the former would be simpler. if its active high, then im going to have to use a mosfet anyway as i cant switch 5v with 3.3v.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ne:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni think i was overthinking this. i did a not too exotic dry run with an arduino leonardo. just plugged into the usb port acting as a mouse/keyboard. the tv remote had a number of unused buttons, more after i went through the tv settings and disabled some stuff. ended up with 16 available remote buttons which dont do anything more than put an unobtrusive \u0022not available\u0022 box in the corner of the screen . i scanned the remote codes and put them in a switch statement. initial plan was to store bindings on the eeprom, but this solution is simpler. after binding every keyboard command for hulu to every button (with a couple to spare, hulu\u0027s player sucks) i realized that what i had made was a convoluted mess. so i ended up just using the mouse library. i got four cursor keys and an enter for scroll and click, ch\u002B/- (which arent used because im on hdmi) controll scrolling.\u00A0 and a closed caption toggle serves as a probibly not needed mouse 2. i wish i could use the numbers for 8-way control, but they keep changing the channels. moving at a rate of 1 pixel 11.1 times a second is slow. a 90 ms delay was the lowest i could use where the codes were still readable (remote codes are in the 10s of kilohertz and are as far as i can tell 32 bits long). i may have to raise that because the pro micro only runs 8mhz as opposed to 16. so i wrote some acceleration code. i need to tweak the numbers but i like it. dedicating 8 of the available buttons to the mouse seems overkill, but it worked out better than the available keyboard commands.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nim gonna keep a few though, the ff/rw commands for example (left and right arrows on the keeb) and pause (space) are in. mom cant get through an episode of jeopardy without going back at least four times, and she has to pause during final (the cheater). these commands are pretty standard on media players, vlc and youtube at least, idk about disney\u002B, but probibly. a dedicated gtfo command is essential on any ui. the escape key fits the bill and is mapped to eject, which seemed fitting. also i found a way to make the chrome app launch full screen, which eliminates some clicks and makes they guide easier to read. but i needed a way out of it, so\u00A0alt\u002Bf4 is in, bound simply to exit. i still got a play button, a stop button, 2 skip buttons, and an info. probibly do the skips as the up and down arrows, play an enter, and stop as the win key, so i can shut the computer down when im done. info will probibly be the power button for the pc.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\npurple wire shenanigans are not needed. apparently my usb ports stay powered when the machine is off. while the bios setting for wake on keeb is enabled, i figure the arduino is too exotic (to much root complex) for that to work. but at least it solves the first issue entirely. some reserch into the second issue seems to validate my suspicions. connecting the pin to ground for a tiny fraction of a second wouldnt hurt it much and it cant do anything in the z-state. this should be a one wire solution. il connect the power button to some io pins and just pass through the start command to the ground strobe. i might also add some indicator lights to the front of the pc, and perhaps an ir-out if i find a better remote. i can bypass the tv entirely, and scan out codes to the tv for power mute and volume, which are the only ones the tv actually needs and bypass the \u0022not available\u0022 popup, future upgrade stuff. building my own remote is also an option.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ne again:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni was definitely overthinking it. the 3.3v to 5v conversion was rendered moot when i discovered a solder jumper on the board to make it run 5v right off the usb port. thus eliminated the power problems i was forseeing. also overthought starting the computer. simply setting the pin from input to output and back again was enough to ground the pin and then return it to a high impedance state when i no longer needed it, only needing to run a single wire. internal usb connection required cutting the big end off of a microusb cable, and crimping some dupont connectors to the end. props to the usb standards people for being extremely consistent with wire colors. i also added a pair of wires with some male dupont headers to connect it to the fp power button. the actual build turned out to be very tight, sitting entirely inside the rather shallow front panel. i only had to drill out a hole for the ir sensor. i used a larger drill bit to form a dimple around the ir receiver dome to give it a wider field of view. i was going to epoxy it in place, but electrical tape worked out fine. routed the wires through the cutout where the slim drive would go if i was so inclined to install one (im not). code changes were minimal. i tried to do a watchdog timer, but it wasnt restarting correctly. if the arduino goes wonky il have to restart it by unplugging the computer. a hard reset button would be a nice to have but this case doesnt have one.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnow for the hard part, teaching mom to use 4 arrows and an enter button. so far its not going so well.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan

The voltages you mention are well matched, but unfortunately that is only half the story. The second problem then, I guess the voltage regulator is not capable of supplying all of the power your new computer uses during heavy rendering. The output power (in Watts) of the regulator must equal or exceed the power draw (in Watts) of the computer or problems will occur during heavy work. A UPS per se has the exact same requirement, however depending on where you buy from they may be available with higher output power ratings. The power ratings should be written near the voltage values on your regulator and PSU.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ARS","CreatedById":168061,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-11T12:03:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224101455\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002291282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221646997988\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002276902\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022monophonic\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n26 minutes ago, monophonic said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you could post some links and/or information about the equipment in question\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the response.
