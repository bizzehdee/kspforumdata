When Squad revises the tech tree, they should have this in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, concerning THIS update, I absolutely love it! I\u0027m finding fun new career challenges with the buildings and contracts, and building challenges with the mk3 parts. One tip for the parts though: WINGS. These things require a huge wing surface in order to get off the ground or to even glide well. But make sure to find a balance between that and drag, because as most of us know too many wings equals too much drag.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kithylin","CreatedById":130653,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T05:47:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022troyfawkes\u0022 data-cite=\u0022troyfawkes\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOK So... I know that probably no one cares about this except me... but...\u003Cp\u003EI was messing with the window size in settings (I always keep it one size smaller than my monitor because otherwise the toolbar covers it) when I accidentally switched the size up to the same size as my monitor and hit apply.

If your game crashes in full screen mode, you have to start it up again and can\u0027t pop out to do something else while your (admit it) 40 bajillion mods load up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I get tons of errors in my logs every time I alt-tab out of full screen KSP; that had to contribute to shenanigans AKA EVAing into a solar orbit from LKO somehow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...So yup, I\u0027m already sold on .90\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re having problems waiting on KSP to load modules.. you need to seriously look in to computer upgrades. Mainly storage I/O upgrades. You can pick up a 32GB 6 Gbps SSD on ebay for $24 used, just get one and install KSP there if you have to. I have my whole system on the gaming computer on a newish 1TB samsung pro SSD, starting KSP with a few modules and the load time is about 15 seconds from clicking start KSP to being at the main menu.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Avalon304","CreatedById":68304,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T06:01:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kithylin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kithylin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you\u0027re having problems waiting on KSP to load modules.. you need to seriously look in to computer upgrades.
