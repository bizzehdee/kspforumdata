One issue I\u0027ve found is that the planets don\u0027t line up as frequently to create the gravity assists. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of doing an opposition class mission to Duna in career mode to reduce the time waiting around in Duna orbit and get extra SCIENCE from an Eve fly-by.
