During the manufacture of the tanks, a spec change went un noticed, and old specced parts rated for a lower voltage were used on a higher voltage supply. The testing resulted in the thermal switch that regulates the heaters being fused. This caused the tanks to reach extreme temperatures internally, during the manufacture and testing phase, and also resulted in the damage that caused the accident during the Apollo 13 mission.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn order to get accurate pressure readings of the cryo tanks, they must \u0022stir\u0022 the tanks. A fan inside stirs the contents so it\u0027s evenly distributed. In the Apollo craft, there were oxygen and hydrogen tanks in the Command Service Module. These tanks feed into fuel cells to generate the craft\u0027s electricity, and the \u0022waste\u0022 of catalysing oxygen and hydrogen is H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E0... the water they use for everything from system cooling to drinking.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe oxygen tanks had been stirred multiple times on the trip already, and would have been stirred multiple times later, had they not blown. One tank eventually sparked during one of these routine tests, about 3/4 of the way to the moon.\u00A0When the oxygen tank exploded, it ripped up the plumbing, and they pretty much lost all the oxygen needed for the fuel cells. Mind you, they still had oxygen for breathing. Other systems were capable of providing that. Without the fuel cells, they could not keep the Command Module\u0027s batteries charged. They had to preserve a minimal amount of electric charge for re-entry, and worse, the C/SM was so badly damaged, they were afraid if they burned their main engine, the whole shebang would just go up in a bang. They had to shut down the Command Module, including the AGC\u00A0(Apollo Navigation Computer) after copying the data out by hand to paper and entering it into the LM AGC. They\u00A0all had to pack into the tiny Lunar Module, using it as a life boat. Because they didn\u0027t have a replenishable source of electric charge on the CM, they couldn\u0027t run the heaters, meaning the craft got VERY cold inside.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere was very little water as well, thanks to the fact that they got their water from that lost oxygen and the fuel cells it fed. The only water they had for 3 men was what the LM could supply, a vessel only meant for a 2 man crew, and only meant to be used during the Lunar descent, surface EVA, and Lunar\u00A0ascent.\u00A0One of the astronauts got a urinary tract infection due to the dehydration and near hypothermia they were suffering from. On top of that, the 2 man LM couldn\u0027t filter the carbon dioxide out of the air for 3 people on the full duration of the return trip... Suck in a gulp of air out of a bottle of carbonated soda... That\u0027s what breathing high concentrations of CO2 feels like, and they were near the unsafe limit. Beyond the safe limit, they would have lapsed into unconsciousness, and then death. The exceptionally talented ground crew, and the highly trained Apollo crew managed to figure out how to fit a Square Peg\u00A0into a\u00A0Round Hole. The CM Lithium Hydroxide CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E scrubbers were square, and would not fit the round hole for the LM scrubbers. They got it figured out with duct tape, a plastic bag, the cardboard cover\u00A0from a checklist, and some hoses off a space suit... Duct tape, sheer genius and determination,\u00A0and a bunch of junk saved Apollo 13.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway, they used the LM engines to do their course corrections, and at one point even had to shut down the remaining LM AGC. They had to do a manual burn at one point, using the sight of the Earth through a window as a reference, and all around, never even knew if their parachutes would even deploy, after all the time spent frozen, or if the heat shield was even intact, as it was directly up against the C/SM, where the explosion had occurred.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nRemember kids... These guys managed to fly their craft back home and MADE IT, after having nearly frozen like popsicles, without drinking hardly enough water, and while nearly suffocating at one point in the flight! They endured those hardships for 4 days! They had the \u0022right stuff\u0022 indeed! Those men were truly the best of the best of the best, picked out of the toughest, most resilient of candidates.
