This was clever.

By design, when parts are inside closed cargo bays, they are occluded from having aerodynamic forces act on them. Open the cargo bays, and they become part of the aerodynamic physics. Makes sense, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept on one trial, Scott closed the cargo bay doors on the carrier aircraft, and the surfboard immediately fell out of the sky.
