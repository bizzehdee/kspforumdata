You cannot see worlds in detail unless you are actually there (in map mode). This might require the game to randomize planets somewhat with each career (with a seed so people can share, and there can be a default seed that is normal, players have to choose randomized as a diff setting). This would force a sort of progression in career play, though you could bring all the gear and scan, then land if you like as well. Surface collection might actually matter\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 they actually worried in RL about lunar dust, for example. Maybe deep dust pools is a thing in KSP.
