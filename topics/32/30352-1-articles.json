On Duna distilling rocket fuel will be a simple matter of drilling down the surface (or better the ice cap) to reach water ice. melt it, siphon it up and split it into fuel and oxidiser via electrolysis and you\u0027re ready to pipe it up to tanker rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut on Eve your rocket for the final product is going to be sitting at a launch complex on top of a 6.5km mountain top to minimise that delta-V to orbit while your ocean is at... well sea level. That means some kind of rover is needed to cart material in between the two areas. You have the economic question of where is the best place to build the Blutonium refinery (seaside vs mountain top vs mobile) to minimise tanker trip, balanced against hardware required to send to Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there is the actual problem of refining. You have to siphon the water out of the ocean, dry out the liquids and separate out the Blutonium. On earth nuclear reactors are generally designed to run on natural or low-enriched uranium. But since the actual energy only comes from the fissile isotope (Uranium-235 on Earth, Blutonium-238 on Kerbin) it becomes economical to only lift off Eve with a final product of highly-enriched, \u003Cstrong\u003Eweapons grade\u003C/strong\u003E Blutonium with very high concentration of Biutonium-238 isotope.
