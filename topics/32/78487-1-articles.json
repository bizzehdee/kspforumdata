I don\u0027t mean, not completed. I\u0027ve sent up plenty of flights that didn\u0027t succeed in the pursuit of fulfilling a contract. But with the sheer amount of time given for each one, I\u0027m not sure there is a way to fail except to simply ignore them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceSphereOfDeath","CreatedById":69754,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T19:25:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve accepted about 50 contracts, never failed one nor came close to failing one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Metalsand","CreatedById":106785,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T19:34:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I feel contracts is nice but it could use some work. For instance, \u0022testing\u0022 parts and making money in-atmosphere means doing multiple contracts at once, which I liked. Using a spaceplane and testing the Mainsail engine in 80,000 Kerbin orbit net me a profit of 10 times what I paid (contract gave 400,000 to test, spaceplane cost 40,000 to launch because landing was rough and broke half the parts off) and gave me 128 science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn in-atmosphere test may be difficult, but it only takes 8 minutes usually. You don\u0027t need a YEAR to complete them. I realize that Duna/Jool missions will take up to several years to accomplish, and in real-life they have tons of time to accomplish missions but...I\u0027m accepting missions ahead of time so I can stack them, and I end up nearly having the experimental technology unlocked by the time I get around to testing some of it solely because I have so much time to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have 1,668,000 funds so far and most of the science unlocked so far and I\u0027ve only done 3 missions to the Mun and 1 mission to Minmus and to get similar results before in Science mode, I would have had to explore nearly the entirety of the Mun to get similar results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for starters, Science values should be tweaked per mode. In Career mode, the game is actually several times easier to progress because science is so easy to unlock from missions. I\u0027m having missions that more than double the science I get when I stack them making most tech unlocked before I\u0027ve even gone past Duna/Eve. Missions may be fun and challenging, but some of them are reeally easy and come up too often. I love the rescue missions, but I rescue one Kerbal to have another rescue mission pop up to take it\u0027s place. Finally, I feel that spaceplanes need to be revamped after this update. MK3 fuselage and MK1/2 fuselage still don\u0027t come with liquid fuel parts, meaning I have to jerry-rig space planes together if I want to use them. And finally of course, mission times need a bit more tweaking so that people can\u0027t just take on so many missions and not work on them until they get tech that takes away the challenge of doing them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Don\u0027t get me wrong though, I LOVE this update and have been playing tons of KSP again since it came out, I just feel like there are some adjustments needed to make it even better)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyomoto","CreatedById":64780,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T19:51:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that\u0027s fair to say. I think there should be some sort of requirement to actually do the missions that you take, so if you accept ALL the missions, they are expecting your next launch to whip out some results. The window to accomplish should be a lot shorter, and the window to accept a lot longer to compensate. I think that very small change would have the necessary effect. Either that or some sort of time needs to pass on the ground, I can understand giving me a year to complete it but I had a rescue mission around Kerbin with a 4 year window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I was being dramatic when I thought this was an emergency! I think modders will have a run on this but my initial question still remains, has anyone actually failed a contract yet?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"No one","CreatedById":112131,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T20:22:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve failed 2.

I havent failed one yet and looking at the failure requirements I doubt I will ever fail one. IF this is where they want to base game to be fore new players they really need to add difficulty settings. I came back after about 4 months to check out Career Mode and I love a lot of the changes but the difficulty is the one thing I wuld liek to see increased. It really is not very fun for a experienced or semi experience player. And all those new player will be come experienced one day too so there needs to be a mechanism to increase the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nhnifong","CreatedById":12196,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T23:06:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know if it\u0027s possible to fail the \u0022Explore the Mun\u0022 contract?

Yes, you need to do some for money and I agree with what you are saying but I was asking more on has anyone actually failed one? You can simply choose not to take contracts, and the ones you do take are inconceivably generous on time even for a new player.
