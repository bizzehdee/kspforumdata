Had to look it up to see it was Chinese players angry over the change to that whole \u0022your not a real hero/male\u0022 line. PC crap like that would just get a shrug and a head shake here, but it looks like more and more the review-bomb is getting used as the go-to weapon for angry players in China. Glad to see that Steam has a response to it now. They show the overwhelming number of excellent reviews over the past few years, and point out that the overwhelming number of negative reviews have come in the past few days; with an option to exclude those reviews from your page. Hope people thinking about joining the KSP universe can see this tactic for what it is: collective foot-stomping to try to get your way. Unfortunately, they keep using this technique because it\u0027s been producing results. Steam reviews are powerful and important. I hate to see them getting used dishonestly like this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"junoberries","CreatedById":182007,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-12T01:21:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbeing a woman id never understand why it\u0027s so hard for others to just except that gender does not make a person any less. a woman can do all the same things as a man.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think what you are seeing is the typical internet disinhibition effect in it\u0027s true and mighty glory. its really sad actually. but there it is.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI for one thing Kerbal is amazing and fun for anyone who can hack the challenging astrophysics either instinctually, with robotic assistance or with hard math.\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe thing is people bend to popular opinion over what is rational and true. reviews though ought to be taken with a grain of salt.\u003Cbr\u003E\nthere are good games with bad reviews and terrible games with extremely good reviews.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI completely agree with what you have to say. it is dishonest and serves nothing\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-12T01:31:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah it\u0027s been a \u0022thing\u0022 the past few days on the Steam forums, the moderator is doing the best he can with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t have a problem with them protesting it and stating their opinion but review bombing a game is really underhanded, especially over something like this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s hoping this can get resolved soon in a way that makes everyone happy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-12T02:19:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223192707\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022166419\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221507770562\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022175588\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cpt Kerbalkrunch\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Cpt Kerbalkrunch said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe change to that whole \u0022your not a real hero/male\u0022 line\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had my head in the sand and/or clouds for a while regarding both KSP and China, but I don\u0027t understand this reference.

KSP changed it to refer to the Mun. I guess players liked it, but some people complained about the line being sexist, so they changed it. As it turns out, the phrase in Chinese doesn\u0027t really have a gender to it. It translates to \u0022hero\u0022 or something close to it. Anyway, Chinese players are angry it got changed because the line is so famous to them. I read a quote that said it would be the equivalent of changing \u0022mankind\u0022 to \u0022homosapien kind\u0022 or something.

It\u0027s the tactic of review-bombing I can\u0027t stand. It was the Steam advertisement that showed me the \u0022forgotten parachute\u0022 video when 1.0 was released that made me look at the store page originally, but it was the reviews that actually made me buy the game. After the second review, I was convinced. They were so overwhelmingly positive, and made the game sound so great, that I just had to try it. Dollar for dollar, I consider it to be one of the best purchases I\u0027ve ever made. Without the reviews though, I may never have tried something that looked sort of goofy. That\u0027s true power, and I think we all rely on the honest opinions of other gamers.
