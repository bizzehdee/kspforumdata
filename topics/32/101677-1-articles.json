Very easy to get to; weak gravity, so orbital maneuvers, landings, and takeoffs are all cheap; a variety of interesting landscapes to explore (flats, slopes, and plateaus); and minty-fresh flavor. Also the flats are excellent runways for landing and takeoff of spacejets!\n\nWhen I have the infrastructure for it, Jool\u0027s moons are fun to play with as well.
