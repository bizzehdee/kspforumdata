I criticize only for the fame and rep, and not because I actually think the game can be so much more than what it currently is. I will change my ways immediately.\n\nThank you! I highly appreciate your wise decision. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) I am pretty sure its possible to care for a game like KSP and be part of its fine community without driving some kind of \u0022Moan Train\u0022 thats equally unfun as these Hypetrains ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nEdit: Maybe \u0022NagTrain\u0022 is better, but english is not my native language so sorry if i got it horrible wrong.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-04T14:45:54Z\u0022 title=\u002204/04/2015 02:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by smart013**"},{"CreatedByName":"laythelover17","CreatedById":130302,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T19:17:14Z","Content":"Laythe Base and station.

HOPEFULLY, I\u0027ll notice that Steam stealth-updated me BEFORE I fire up my current save and hopelessly corrupt it.\n\nThen, I\u0027ll quit out of KSP, backup my current save to my \u0022Old KSPs\u0022 directory where I\u0027ve already placed a copy of 0.90, restart KSP 1.0, and start a new Sandbox game. Which I\u0027ll use to relearn how to fly a basic orbit/reentry mission with the new aero model, figure out what all changed when they rebalanced parts. Next up, redesign my old stable of existing standardized craft, figure out how to aerobrake re-usable deep-space tugs (I expect that will be an ugly and frustrating learning experience... none of the old tools will work, nor will they be easily updateable because now the aerobrake maneuver will depend on things like how much fuel is left in the tanks when you hit atmo...).\n\nOnce I feel like I\u0027m kinda-sorta semi-competent, I\u0027ll start a new Career game."},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T02:41:17Z","Content":"1st ill most likely crash the game, then crash whatever craft i build a few times, then crash land the craft after i manage to liftoff.\n\nThen ill:\n\nMake a 6th generation of Tri-Fighters (assuming the aero doesnt make them entirely obsolete given how i clip some wings internally to make them look a certain way and not sacrifice lift and performance).\n\nAlso, im most likely going to make the 1st non-kraken-drive fully self-sustainable SSTO, able to refuel itsself with the new parts. I have to say refueling is something ive been waiting for a while (whats the point of making a massive bunker when you cant even refuel stuff from said bunker?).\n\nThen ill prolly make more capital ships (and make better launch vehicles for them since we now get fairings that will I HOPE be able to fit a capital ship inside them).\n\nOhh, and assuming my save isnt broken, crew the entire lunar corporation base i spent quite a bit to make/replicate to small details with female kerbals (LC used female cloned soldiers or something of the sort)."},{"CreatedByName":"Drethon","CreatedById":100831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T12:28:08Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been planning a Kerbal exploration system using remote tech and life support for some time.
