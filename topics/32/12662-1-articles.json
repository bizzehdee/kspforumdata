It\\\u0027s modular. There\\\u0027s a part, the telemetry transmitter, which must be attached to every ship you want to receive telemetry from. But the actual data comes from PartModules that can be put on \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E part. I\\\u0027ve got a bunch of sensors in various degrees of polish, but the two that are relevant here are the atmosphere probe (which returns temperature and pressure data) and the KPS sensor \u00E2\u20AC\u201DKerbin Positioning System, har har har, which gives lat/long/alt. I\\\u0027m attaching the source code for you guys.

The whole thing is run by ArcturusTelemetryController, a static class (which isn\\\u0027t actually static, but whatever). ArcturusTelemetrySensor is a base class that inherits from PartModule; individual sensors inherit from ArcturusTelemetrySensor and implement ArcturusTelemetryDataSource. ArcturusTelemetryTransmitter handles the actual networking, and also interfacing with the main Unity event loop to poll the sensors however-many times a second, where the however-many is user-configurable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, you add a sensor to any part you like by putting its PartModule info into the relevant part.cfg file, like for example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EMODULE\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E name = ArcturusTelemetrySensorAtmosphere\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EMODULE\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E name = ArcturusTelemetrySensorKPS\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust add those lines to the bottom of part.cfg, and boom, that part will be wired up with those sensors next time you launch the game. (Note that PartModules are saved to the persistent.sfs file, meaning you can\\\u0027t add PartModules and have them magically apply to saved flights \u00E2\u20AC\u00A6 at least not so far as I can tell. You need to start a new flight at the launchpad for PartModules to take effect.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, technically you could just stop there. Just adding the sensor PartModules to your part gives you \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E functionality. Specifically, you get a right-click display that looks like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UYPCU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UYPCU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this case, I attached two of my sensors \u00E2\u20AC\u201Dthe atmosphere probe and the KPS receiver \u00E2\u20AC\u201Dto a Probodyne part converted to a MechJeb pod (don\\\u0027t judge me), and you can see them updating in real time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrouble is, sensors will only give you real-time displays \u003Cem\u003Ewhen they are active.\u003C/em\u003E Meaning if you\\\u0027ve got a sensor in your command pod three stages up, it won\\\u0027t do anything until you\\\u0027re in orbit, because before that the lower stages are gonna be the active stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you can get around this by using a telemetry transmitter. Unlike the sensors, which are PartModules and can be installed in any part, the transmitter has to be its own part. I don\\\u0027t know from modeling or anything, so I\\\u0027ve just been using a Probodyne antenna part with a modified part.cfg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ro3MX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ro3MX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see this one has just a button on it. Right now (by default) the transmitter is transmitting at low speed: one transmission per second per sensor. You can hit that button to switch the transmitter to high speed: ten transmissions per second per sensor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo turn a part into a telemetry transmitter, just change its module name from whatever it started out as to:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003Emodule = ArcturusTelemetryTransmitter\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote, of course, that doing this will make that part \u003Cem\u003Estop\u003C/em\u003E being whatever it had been before. So, y\\\u0027know, don\\\u0027t do this to your command pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the part.cfg parameters for the telemetry transmitter, plus their default values:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EreceiverAddress = 127.0.0.1\u003Cbr\u003EreceiverPort = 65534\u003Cbr\u003EreportsPerSecondAtLowSpeed = 1.0\u003Cbr\u003EreportsPerSecondAtHighSpeed = 10.0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe receiverAddress must be an IP address; I didn\\\u0027t bother including DNS functionality because I\\\u0027m lazy. The two reportsPerSecond parameters obviously set the number of reports you get per second in both the low and the high speed modes. Internally, you\\\u0027re limited by the fact that the transmitter polls the sensors in the main physics event loop, so you can\\\u0027t get more reports per second than you get more physics frames per second. Oh, also the reporting interval is not deterministic. The transmitter will \u003Cem\u003Etry\u003C/em\u003E to wait exactly one second (or whatever) between reports, but it won\\\u0027t do a very good job, because it can only run as often as the Unity engine lets it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, one more thing. You can have multiple telemetry transmitters on your ship. The transmitters and sensors work in what\\\u0027s called a \u003Cem\u003Efederate.\u003C/em\u003E When you start your flight, the various sensors and transmitters all register themselves with the controller. The controller picks one transmitter of all the available transmitters on the ship to be the primary transmitter (it\\\u0027s first-come, first-served). That\\\u0027ll be the transmitter that actually does all the work; the rest will be idle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what if that transmitter is bolted to the side of your first-stage fuel tank? What happens when you stage and that tank drops away? Do you just lose the telemetry signal? Nope. The last thing the transmitter does before it gets disconnected is notify the controller that it\\\u0027s going away. The controller then picks one of the \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E transmitters, the still-working ones, and makes \u003Cem\u003Eit\u003C/em\u003E the new primary transmitter. There will be a little blip in your telemetry \u00E2\u20AC\u201Da loss-of-signal followed by an acquisition-of-signal \u00E2\u20AC\u201Dbut failover happens fast. (Within one physics frame, actually.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, what about the data format?

terms of columns. The first column is the channel number. The transmitter always broadcasts on channel 0, and each sensor in the ship gets its own channel starting at 1 and counting up. In this example, channel 4 is an engine sensor (not included in the downloads here).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight after initial acquisition of signal, up at the top, the transmitter sends out headers describing the data format of each sensor\\\u0027s report.

Here you can see the atmosphere sensor reports external temperature, static pressure and dynamic pressure, while the engine sensor reports the throttle setting and the gimbal angles. Et cetera and so on, really. Sensors can report whatever they need to, since the reports are all channel-muxed anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you read through this report, you can piece together a neat little story of what happened. See the temperature sensor on the engine, channel 3? The only piece of data it reports is the internal temperature of the part it\\\u0027s attached to. Before liftoff (all those lines where MET is zero) the engine temperature is basically room temperature \u00E2\u20AC\u201Dabout 20\u00C2\u00B0C.

In that case, the temperature of a part would vary based \u003Cem\u003Esolely\u003C/em\u003E on the ambient temperature and its intrinsic properties, and not on atmospheric pressure at all. That\\\u0027s where the smart money is, if you ask me.

That\\\u0027s possible, and frankly it\\\u0027d be kinda awesome if it were the case, but I just haven\\\u0027t done the science yet.

The sensors, in turn, are now programmed to update their GUIs only when they receive an update from the controller, but to update their internal data structures on every fixedupdate from the controller, which happens every physics frame.

And works!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I\\\u0027ve made good progress on the temperature thing, by the way. I figured out two things. First, the game ignores the heatConductivity and heatDissipation part.cfg parameters. Just overrides them completely. So you can\\\u0027t make a radiator that way. But I was able to work around it by subclassing Part, and I learned that heatConductivity \u00E2\u20AC\u201Dthe actual runtime parameter, not the config-file one which is ignored \u00E2\u20AC\u201D works exactly like I thought it would. It\\\u0027s the exponent in Newton\\\u0027s law of cooling. The instantaneous temperature T of an insulated part at some time t in the future is given by Ta plus To - Ta times e to the -hC t, where Ta is the ambient temperature, To is the starting temperature of the part and hC is the heatConductivity value. How this works with heatDissipation I haven\\\u0027t figured out yet. All my real experiments have been done at sea level, \\\u0027cause I still haven\\\u0027t built a thermocouple that can give me meaningful temperature data in a vacuum. From sample to sample, the temperature oscillates between -200\u00C2\u00B0C and 250\u00C2\u00B0C, but if you average it out, you get a meaningful temperature that \u003Cem\u003Eappears\u003C/em\u003E to depend on orientation toward the sun. A one-by-two-meter cylindrical part oriented broadside to the sun while in orbit has a much higher average internal temperature than the same cylinder oriented ass-on to the sun.
