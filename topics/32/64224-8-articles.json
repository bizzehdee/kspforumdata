It needs an engineer\u0027s attention, as the chutes need to be refitted, and recently developed scientific equipment needs to be mounted, but otherwise it should still be OK. Only challenge: It\u0027s out of fuel and doesn\u0027t have a probe core. On the other hand, a small tug with two probe cores (one undockable) and a small fuel reserve will do the trick. The other two station components are waiting in low Kerbin orbit for their transfer window to Duna... Bringing the fuel depot to Kerbin orbit cost more fuel than planned, due to a severe lack of struts (the launcher was wobbling so bad, it was barely controllable), but as the lander anyhow just has 5 chutes left (RealChute Mod), the fuel should hopefully still be enough.
