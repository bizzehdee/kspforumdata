After leaving mun\u0027s soi for the second time, you are still slower than her , and also slower than Kerbin (probably you took a pair of reverse gravity assists), enough to be dumped out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI."},{"CreatedByName":"Lagopus","CreatedById":114576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T14:50:09Z","Content":"I doubt that Mun is capable of giving that much boost.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T14:53:17Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 02:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lagopus**"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T15:55:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I doubt that Mun is capable of giving that much boost.\n\nYes, it really is, actually. If you place yourself just right you can end up with a Kerbin escape trajectory with just a little more Delta-V than you would use for a basic Mun encounter.\n\nA lot of players, like myself, who plan Munar free-return trajectories find that the same amount of Delta-V for a good free-return is just the right amount for a good departure from Kerbin SoI."},{"CreatedByName":"Zuroc","CreatedById":141636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T16:24:19Z","Content":"I think he is referring to the fact that his periapsis is way low, which should be impossible with a Mun assist."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T16:43:16Z","Content":"Yeah, that\u0027s more than a single Mun-assist should be able to do. Periapsis is inside Moho\u0027s orbit, which should cost several km/s while the maximum theoretical Mun assist is a bit under 1100m/s."}]}
