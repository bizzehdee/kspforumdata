Some of them that I have had in the past somehow gave me insight for future projects, although I cannot remember them thoroughly anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, people, have you experienced this before?

Pending.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was an undetermined time and place in the future of KSP, and I was playing multiplayer with a few of my relatives. It looked like that we have spent weeks on building a gigantic ship in orbit to go to another solar system in hope of landing on a new planet. The ship was ten times as large as anything I have built as of now. The interface and interactions with the environment while in EVA mode was very similar to garry\\\u0027s mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt takes a day to make the trip, and another to prepare the landing. The landing capsule that us (three to five) people were going to use was not conventional, and actually a VTOL lander truck. However, just before leaving the mothership, we are hit by some unknown debris in orbit. Catastrophic damage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mile-long ship loses control and starts falling into the planet. Most of the external bridges collapse killing all of the NPC crew members. In panic, we decide to leave, but did not have our ship filled with enough fuel. We realized that after we left. Large pieces of scrap metal slowly pass us and crash into the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlowing down just enough, we soften the landing by quite a bit, preventing our own deaths will minimal damages. The landing vehicle, however, was upside down after rolling in it for a few minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately (somehow), we had everything we needed to make a small base. Farms, mining utilities, and other things were added to our lopsided vehicle for makeshift shelter. Later, we built a large radio tower/dish thing to send a rescue signal since there was no way any time soon that they would get back. Years pass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I will add more to this soon, I don\\\u0027t have enough time to get all of my thoughts together right now)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-02T00:54:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had a dream the game could actually properly support spaceplanes.
