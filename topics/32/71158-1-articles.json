I just wanted to see how some new (mod-added) solid boosters would perform, so I put together a 2-man capsule (lander can mk2), a rockomax x32 fuel tank, and an engine below. Three parts vessel, literally. I attached a couple of radial decouplers with boosters and launched it.

Only the engine, which could be fired to generate power with its alternator. There was still some fuel left, but it would not last long either. I could not send a resupply vessel because there was no docking port (and no claw to circumvent that issue, as it was in 0.23). And I couldn\u0027t simply go back to Kerbin either because there was no decoupler under the capsule, no parachutes, and no landing legs.
