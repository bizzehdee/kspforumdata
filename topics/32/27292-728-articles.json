Got my intercept with a mostly polar orbit and then attempted to launch an identical vessel for the mun, but it just fell apart. After scan orbiting and landing on minmus I did some quick calculations and figured I should have enough to transfer to the mun, scan it, land, take off, and return back to kerbin. So I did just that and even completed an \u0027orbit the mun in a specific orbit\u0027 mission along the way, and the whole mission only took 116 days. duna probe is waiting for transfer window\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DocMoriarty","CreatedById":57433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T00:47:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI edited my recent story (with lots of pictures) and added an epilogue: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/132782-Doomsday-Ahead-Will-Kerbalkind-be-Rescued-%28Story-with-Pictures%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/132782-Doomsday-Ahead-Will-Kerbalkind-be-Rescued-%28Story-with-Pictures%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bev7787","CreatedById":136501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T01:49:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve started building my space station with the \u0022original\u0022 name of KSS\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Belphegor","CreatedById":118918,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T06:17:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etook a few attempts to get it safely out of the dense part of the atmosphere but after that all was good\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/621849045056057121/35BC5501F82767031C75B810267EA1DAEA82AA96/\u0022 alt=\u002235BC5501F82767031C75B810267EA1DAEA82AA96\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/621849045056059495/503075F637850B255F164987A19F3BE3D65966CE/\u0022 alt=\u0022503075F637850B255F164987A19F3BE3D65966CE\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fail-Man 3D","CreatedById":67177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T06:57:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tested revision 6 of my new Eve SSTO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything was going okay, until MechJeb suddenly decided to land on the opposite side of the planet while less than a kilometer from the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI almost salvaged the landing manually, but a non-obvious slope caused the vehicle to fall over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Otf35Fo.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EUnreasonably huge picture\u003C/a\u003E, taken during final approach.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cuky","CreatedById":111755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T11:32:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot much today.
