If what you said is true, it would be a great improvement. Thanks for the information, I will test the jet ASAP.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt most certainly is, I had a spaceplane I designed in 0.22 that was just enough to get to orbit, play around a little bit, and then head home. No chance of having enough delta-v to go to the Mun or Minmus. That same spaceplane shocked me in 0.23 when at about 30 km altitude, 2300 m/s velocity, it was still both climbing and accelerating. It was in a 122 km x 20 km orbit when the engine finally died, and only needed 60 delta-v from the rockets to circularize at 122 km (I was still low enough in the atmosphere that drag ate a little bit of the apoapsis). It was originally designed as a bit of an airhogger, five ram intakes for one turbojet engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maccollo","CreatedById":72759,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T06:52:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, you can make a very small SSTO with a 4.5 meter tank, a rapier engine, a ram intake and a lander can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis configuration of just 4 parts is easily capable of doing a mun flyby, so I would say this thing probably has it\u0027s uses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, the design of the engine is very boring and uninspiring.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T11:55:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI did a retread of Brotoro\u0027s SSTO crew transfer shuttle and got it to work with just RAPIERs. That freed up some space in the middle for a heat shield if and when I ever decide to dabble in deadly re-entry, and it\u0027s fewer engines but looking at the cost I\u0027d say the only true benefit is that it\u0027s an absolute joy to fly! I can see the appeal of RAPIERs for smaller craft that aren\u0027t trying to lift too much. It\u0027s also nice to cut back on the number of action groups you need. I\u0027d say it\u0027s pretty well balanced.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
