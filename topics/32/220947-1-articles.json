But when I decoupled I noticed that the burned out booster \u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/WbRj5Wa\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eshot ahead over the probe head\u003C/a\u003E. It seems that the momentum did not transfer to the part that got deoupled. Is that the case? I figured the whole vessel has upwards momentum and if I decouple the heavy part the head will fly ahead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReference: We found out in a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/179030-ksp-130-tweakscale-under-lisias-management-2474-2023-1007/?do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=4340376\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Eprevious experiment\u003C/a\u003E that a smaller rocket can reach a higher altitude than a big one, because its heavier weight pulls it down far longer than it has extra thrust.

A light, non-aerodynamic probe would experience a lot a drag as soon as it\u0027s released into the atmosphere, slowing it down quite a lot. While your rocket (even empty) is probably heavier and more aerodynamic, and is able to \u0022punch\u0022 through the atmosphere a lot easier. I can\u0027t find any examples now, but I remember that Scott Manley used to keep his empty boosters attached a little longer while in atmosphere if he wasn\u0027t thrusting, for this exact reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for that experiment you\u0027ve linked - I don\u0027t know the specifics because I\u0027m not familiar with Tweakscale, but \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/187168-lisias/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022187168\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/187168-lisias/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Lisias\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0might be able to clarify - it looks like the result there was that the higher\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ecross-sectional area\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0was what was slowing down the larger booster enough to counteract the additional momentum from the higher weight, which isn\u0027t always necessarily true for every design.

It\u0027s a function of frontal area and aerodynamics.
