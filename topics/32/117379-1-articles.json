I leave the engines running throughout the whole maneuver, meaning from the runway into full circular orbit while keeping the spaceplane nose as close to the prograde marker as possible. This is essential to build up speed when going with a low TWR of about .60 to .70. A spaceplane with more TWR is usually a fuel leech. Using this technique i get cargo of up to 35% of the launch mass into 85 km orbit... meaning a 100 ton of launch weight from which 35 tons are cargo. I have never done that with a more aggressive spaceplane (not with one, that has actual use and is not designed for a challenge run - there i have seen 50%...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick is, to circularize very early, say at an altitude of 55.000m. Then you need VERY low thrust (below 10%) to increase your orbit. On multi-engine setups it saves fuel when you can switch off engine pairs during the insertion burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Edit] However, i am curious.

I\u0027m only just starting to mess around with spaceplanes in 1.x and I\u0027m surprised this approach works so well for you ... I shall try it and report later. In 0.90 and earlier it was certainly worth doing a flat, low-thrust, burn to circularise in the atmosphere, but that was making the most of jets\u0027 fuel-efficiency. In 1.x, once on rockets (or closed-cycle rapier) I would have thought you\u0027d want to gain altitude as soon as possible to get out of the draggy air, then circularise. With rapiers, especially, TWR isn\u0027t an issue as they\u0027ve got to have the high-drag jet punch anyway, so must have enough rocket power. The main thing is not to climb so steeply that you lose the horizontal velocity you\u0027ve previously fought to gain of course.

The gains in apoapsis you are receiving are not free. I would bet that you are paying for it with angular momentum. That is, you are not also increasing your periapsis at the same time. You may get to space today, but your circularization burn will cost you more dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note, 30 km is about the altitude I flatten out during my \u003Cem\u003Edescent\u003C/em\u003E. Many folks talk about lowering your periapsis to 30-40 km and then killing your velocity with airbarkes. I use a burn that places the ground intersection of the orbit at KSC. I spend little time in the higher ranges of the upper atmosphere and keep my AoA around 20*. By the time I hit the thicker air around 30 km, my orbit appears to be taking me directly into the mountains west of KSC. And I would hit them without the lift at that point (probably burn up first, but the end si the same). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAngular velocity is exchanged for vertical velocity as drag and lift equalize, and the orbital path begins to \u0022flatten out\u0022, raising the periapsis and pushing the orbital ground intersection past KSC and into the sea. My horizontal velocity remains about the same during this, but my (negative) vertical velocity is drastically reduced.
