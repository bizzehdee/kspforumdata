Basically, it is rasing your Ap to a point higher then your target orbit at Pe. Then burning at new Ap to raise Pe to target orbit, and then burning (retrograde) to lower your Ap to target orbit. At times, this is more efficient then a direct Hofmann transfer (when the ratio of final semi major axis to initial semi major axis is 11.94 or greater according to wiki). The reason it is more efficient is because of the Oberth effect (rockets function better the faster they are moving).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I wanted to apply this to some basic things in game. Like setting an orbit close to the mun for escape or mun encounter. According to wiki Mun has a semi major axis (SMA from now on) of 12,000,000. Assuming an initial parking orbit of 85,000 after launch the ratio would be (11,000,000 / 85,000) 129.41. Meaning, that a bi-elliptical orbit change would be better (save delta v) assuming you don\u0027t go crazy with your first Ap change burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter some more napkin math. Int SMA / Fin SMA \u0026gt; 11.94 flop the equation around to Int SMA /11.94 \u0026gt; Fin SMA should give us the change in altitude for when bi- elliptical can possibly become more efficient. Starting from an initial orbit of 85,000, calculates to 7118.92. Again, assuming you don\u0027t go crazy with that first Ap kick. In my example, I would guess a 12,000,000 Ap would be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I am no math, or orbital flight master. I would still need to figure out what a Hoffmann transfer would cost, then figure out the total cost of the bi- elliptical (3 burns) then compare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to assume that my math for when bi- elliptical can possibly become better then Hoffmann is incorrect. 7119m just seems so small, but delta v isn\u0027t figured. Is my math or theory on this incorrect? I still haven\u0027t been able to do delta v calculations (not sure of the formula or its factors, and I\u0027m sure mass will be a major portion which I currently don\u0027t have access to realistic test numbers).

The problem is, how often does that happen? The only SOI that isn\u0027t extremely limited in size is the sun\u0027s, and since you\u0027ll be starting at Kerbin there\u0027s nothing more than 12 times its distance to go to. If you\u0027re going from LKO to, say, Minmus, then maybe you could do a bi-elliptic to get there with less energy, but the bi-elliptic requires a burn at a point outside the orbit of the thing you want to intersect, and you can\u0027t go far beyond Minmus before leaving Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence (at which point its gravitational pull becomes zero, meaning a bi-elliptic wouldn\u0027t work at all). A burn to Mun is a bit more manageable, but you\u0027d still be pretty limited in where you placed your outer burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd your math is wrong. Semi-major axis is a RADIUS, not an ALTITUDE. There\u0027s no \u002285km SMA\u0022 orbit around Kerbin, because the planet\u0027s radius is 600km; the orbit you refer to has an SMA of 685km. If you\u0027re trying to get to Mun (SMA 12000km), you see that it\u0027s less than an 18:1 ratio, so you\u0027re not far above the break-even point of the bi-elliptic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other problem is that a bi-elliptic is just not as easy to do in KSP, because of timing. A \u003Cstrong\u003EHohmann\u003C/strong\u003E (not Hoffmann, not Hofmann) transfer has the big advantage that you can initiate it at any point on your circular orbit and immediately see whether you\u0027ll intersect your target. So if the timing isn\u0027t right for your transfer, just hit time acceleration until you\u0027re a bit further around the orbit. I\u0027ve had times where I went five or six orbits before the transfer lined up correctly. But with KSP, that sort of acceleration takes little effort, so it\u0027s not a problem. A bi-elliptic transfer has a severe timing limitation; you\u0027re not circularizing at the outer orbit, so you have to immediately thrust at apogee and hope that the new perigee intersects the object you want. Chances are it won\u0027t, which means you\u0027d need to rotate or expand the first burn, which means adjusting the second burn again. Lather, rinse, repeat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd in most cases, the amount of delta-V you save is small, on the order of a few percent. This isn\u0027t usually worth the headaches, because in KSP we can\u0027t design things precisely enough. In the real world you can make a design have JUST enough fuel to get to its destination, so it really helps to save a little bit, but in KSP we\u0027ve only got a small assortment of fuel tank sizes and we can\u0027t be as precise on our steering, so we\u0027ll generally overbuild. Heck, on my first Minmus landing, I had enough spare fuel to land on Mun on the way back, because the design I was using was intended to go to Duna; doing a more complex orbital insertion just wouldn\u0027t have made much of a difference.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SmallChange","CreatedById":3519,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T19:07:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBTW, It\u0027s Hurfman.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iRommel","CreatedById":63519,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T19:17:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe hoffman maneuver is an attempt to has more cheeseburgers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"itsme86","CreatedById":59895,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T19:17:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI looked it up, it\u0027s Hulkman.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ComradeGoat","CreatedById":59041,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T19:26:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBi-elliptic is something I only ever use when I want to make a massive orbital plane change.
