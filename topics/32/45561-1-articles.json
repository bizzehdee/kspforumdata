Looking closely at it, the tracking station says my plane is at the Kerbal Space Centre, when its very clearly in a crater on the dark side of the Mun. It even has 100% fuel, something that i definitely do NOT have when/ if my SSTO ever makes it to orbit. The last time i saw it, it was sitting comfortably at the real KSC, testing its scorpion style KAS magnet. (The idea was to leech off all of my semi-full debris tanks in orbit, the handy \u0027eject\u0027 feature on the winch means you can do it all from the safety of the cockpit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave i found a top secret kerbal Mun base? Or some sort of magical portal that transports my perfectly happy terrestrial (kerrestrial?) planes? Or is this just random bug, and i should maybe grumble and get some sleep?

Mods i use are: Quantum Struts, KAS, Kethane, Lazer systems, SubAssembly Manager, and Chatterer.
