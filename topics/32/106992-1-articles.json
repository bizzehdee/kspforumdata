But for general advice: keep your profile aerodynamic (ie. don\u0027t have any protruding structures on it, especially near the top), try to use a gimbal-enabled engine if you can, and stick a quadrio of steering fins near the base of the rocket. Also, during ascent, be sure that you keep pointed fairly close to the prograde (yellow circle) marker. You can\u0027t just violently pitch around in the new aero model unless you have some serious wings on your craft, and that has its own problems too (such as inducing quite a lot of drag)."},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T22:35:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I generally keep my ships under 250m/s or so to atleast 5k. you try that? also fins. a few on the base of your rocket. post a pic\n\nBasically this.

Since you don\u0027t have any payload on top, and because the fuel tanks in KSP drain as a single large tank (all the way from the top to the very bottom), your rocket becomes bottom heavy very quickly.

It only just BARELY had enough fuel to safely capture at Kerbin and was quite unstable at launch, so I\u0027d probably add a tad more fuel and some wings, however, I think you can see that it\u0027d only be very small alterations needed from watching this video with such a similar design.\n\n-The lander is obviously a completely different beast to this rocket, but I didn\u0027t want to make the video 45 minutes long to cram in both.\n\n-Don\u0027t go too fast! Getting very mild visual \u0022wind effect\u0022 or whatever that\u0027s actually called is okay. Any more than that and your losses due to drag are going to be more than your gains from getting away from the planet\u0027s gravity faster. You definitely should not see exterior flames while launching. At least, that\u0027s been my experience. So use thrust limiters on solid boosters to keep speed to reasonable levels until you get up high.\n\n-The lighter your upper stage is the better. I get a lot of work done adjusting my orbit with only ~35 units of fuel because the craft is so light at that point, and the fuel I have left is probably enough to return the ship shown to Kerbin (if I wanted to). Definitely still would\u0027ve had enough even if I hadn\u0027t entered the Mun\u0027s SOI at an advantageous angle by pure luck. Also keep in mind that a light payload has a knock-on effect and means you need less fuel on the stage before the payload, which means you need less on the stage before that, and so on. Obviously don\u0027t leave any vital equipment out, but minimalism is your friend.\n\n-Fairings... Only use fairings if your upper stage has lots of crap sticking off at weird angles making the rocket do strange things. They\u0027re heavy, don\u0027t bring one if you don\u0027t need it. Make sure you make them as thin and pointy as possible if you do use one. If you add a big fat fairing to an upper stage that\u0027s generally pretty thin and well balanced, you\u0027re going to add both mass and drag, instead of reducing drag.\n\n-Maneuver efficiently. I\u0027m not actually very good at this - I don\u0027t have any physics education or anything like that, but... well, if you\u0027re flying in a much less efficient way than shown in the video, that\u0027s... bad, I guess?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T11:56:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 11:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Troubletcat**"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T11:52:21Z","Content":"Fairings serve another purpose: they protect your payload from burning up due to overheating during ascent."},{"CreatedByName":"Mipe","CreatedById":109421,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T11:56:27Z","Content":"This wonder took Val and Bob to Minmus and Mun orbits, where Bob did his EVA walks to the science lab and experiments in that service bay, taking data and resetting experiments every time.\n\nYes, that\u0027s asparagus staging. Fuel lines are well worth it. Note that you need to upgrade astronaut complex to get EVA, which is a must and should be attempted as soon as you can do orbit.
