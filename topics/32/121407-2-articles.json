Real Fuels, FAR-like aero, life support, all that jazz. The mods currently available seem so clunky, with parts that don\u0027t always fit, and ugly U.I.s for some of the gameplay mods, and few stockalike parts. That\u0027s why I prefer using SMURFF and stock/stockalike parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea with an official RO DLC should be that you should be able to completely recreate some historic or interesting missions from real life in the game, even if the places you go look different. Duna is much more red than Mars, Jool is green, but both should accurately represent their counterparts authentically. In fact, Duna has to get rid of Ike. Maybe Ike can become a fourth moon of Jool. Mars gets two asteroid moons. Gilly can stay around Eve, but Eve has to become smaller (to scale I mean, obviously with the rescale it would become larger) and gain a thicker atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the solution is to have several different types of starter systems. Kerbin, KerbinXL, KerbinROXL, EarthMini, and EarthRO. Kerbin is the stock game as it is. Kerbin XL is just the planets as they are rescaled by 10x. Kerbin Realism Overhaul XL is Kerbol system rekerjiggered into a better representation of the Sol system, EarthMini is the Solar System downscaled by 10x, and EarthRO is Earth Solar System in full scale with the Realism Overhaul stuff.

For any DLC to be worth it to me, it would really need to be more of expansion packs that add a lot to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as realism, I would rather have that as a standalone game rather than an addon for KSP. KSP is cartoony and not entirely serious, and any attempt to reconcile a serious realism overhaul with the stock game would likely require a total conversion anyways, so I would rather have that as a separate game where the engine can be tweaked to account for the additional realism rather than shoehorning it into the current game (basically what RSS/RO does already).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I do think that stock KSP could benefit from a little more realism, especially by adding life support (to fix the current balance issues between probes vs manned missions) and possibly the option to increase the planet sizes (would make for a great difficulty slider option).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T18:52:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lord Aurelius\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Lord Aurelius\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewould make for a great \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Edifficulty\u003C/span\u003E option slider\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EIt\u0027s not really adding \u0022difficulty\u0022, it\u0027s adding \u0022difference\u0022.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T18:58:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENah, the only thing id actually pay for (although i still think it should be free) would be a vast and i mean VAST performance increase over older models.
