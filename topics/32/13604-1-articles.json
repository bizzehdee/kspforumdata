And I realize there are no hard answers this early in development, so this is as much for discussion as to get info. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Do we have any idea how long a capsule will support Kerbals? Right now it doesn\\\u0027t matter if you miss a launch window or somesuch because you can just go around again. But will that leave the guys running out of air when \u0027real\u0027 crews are implemented? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. What\\\u0027s a reasonable speed for hitting Kerbin atmo?

When components start costing, how important will efficiency be? Will we need to fly razor-thin fuel margins? (It will be interesting balancing this against #1: too fast and you go broke, but too slow and crews suffocate.) They\\\u0027ll need to strike an economic balance with the game. For example, I liked Railroad Tycoon 3 a lot, but it\\\u0027s economic system was unsatisfying because it was geared toward \u003Cem\u003Eexanding \u003C/em\u003E your empire. You \u003Cem\u003Ecouldn\\\u0027t \u003C/em\u003E lose money, it was just a matter of getting rich as fast as you could, and there was little satisfaction in running your empire once you had it, because money would pile up in heaps and there was nothing to spend it on. I\\\u0027m hoping KSP turns out more like an open-ended Sim city than a scenario-with-an-endpoint Tycoon paradigm. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luigibro606","CreatedById":8700,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-03T20:07:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the air thing, there\\\u0027s a Zoxygene Plugin which already simulates this. :3\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pyre","CreatedById":20921,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-04T01:03:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.
