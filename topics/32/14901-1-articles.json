I\\\u0027ve played games where I can\\\u0027t get on a ladder that\\\u0027s designed into a fixed level, for heaven\\\u0027s sakes. I actually chased a rolling plane down the runway and got back in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* you can transition from climbing to jumping to RCS to flopping to walking seamlessly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* the low-G gait on minmus just slew me. That he waits for his foot to hit the ground before he jumps. Can\\\u0027t wait to see what high-G looks like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe devil is in the details, and well done getting so many of the details right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrLucky\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Matticus88","CreatedById":30754,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-23T16:57:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe animations are brilliant i agree. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vostok","CreatedById":22467,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-23T17:03:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027d also like to congratulate Squad on the revised explosion dynamics, they are far more satisfying than before, whilst looking slightly less \\\u0027meaty\\\u0027, which I\\\u0027m sure can be fixed at a later date.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein 0.15, if any component on my rocket exploded, the whole thing would instantly explode, however now I get a nice \\\u0027disintegration\\\u0027 with loads of parts remaining intact and raining down in the surrounding countryside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there was one thing to improve, it would have to be giving debris that\\\u0027s been near an explosion a smoke trail, this would create an awesome \\\u0027spidery\\\u0027 effect for the explosions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut back to the EVAs - Seamless ladder transitions, and lovely ragdolling effects, especially in low gravity. Wonderful how the game detects my crazy ladder placement and uses it exactly as I expect. Especially, as DrLucky said, on dynamic objects. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI chased a runaway rover on the mun at 10m/s, and caught up with it with the EVApak, and managed to grab on while it was still moving. Stellar job on the transitions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe positives on this by far outweigh the negatives, but if I were to make any negative comments, I\\\u0027d say that the jumping height in general, to me, seems a little too high, and the mun walk cycle still seems a little fast for low gravity. As well as this, the EVA rotation control is a bit annoying, it would have made more sense to just have an auto-orienting direction, instead of orientation, and bound rotation to Q and E. but apart from those few things, and the fact that there\\\u0027s no passenger module yet, the EVAs are possibly the best thing, in my opinion, to happen to KSP for a long time. The new dimension and replay-incentive of crew rescuing is a great thing. That, and the launch clamps. I love them, they make all my crazy rockets come true. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, again, Well done Squad on another tremendous update! Keep it up!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Endeavour","CreatedById":21125,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-23T18:43:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOverall, the EVAs are spectacular. I also love how big the rockets are now. They finally look like the monsters that they are\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I must complain that there is no ladder that can get Kerbals on top of things like fuel tanks. You need to use a ladder at a weird angle that looks very wrong. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, Kerbals can\\\u0027t be controlled when upside-down relative to the camera. They automatically flip over. Not a real big issue, but i feel like Q and E should control this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ydoow","CreatedById":10165,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-23T18:45:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m absolutely in agreement with this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.16 was buggy (what else is to be expected with a Beta game?), but the animations were flat out incredible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes here and there needed a bit of polishing, but nothing I could really yell about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was very, very impressed\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"your mom","CreatedById":2028,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-23T18:53:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ydoow\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ydoow\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E (what else is to be expected with a Beta game?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlpha* =P\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes I havent been able to play the game yet but from videos the EVA animations look great.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RayneCloud","CreatedById":11227,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-23T19:58:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat post, the dev team needs it.
