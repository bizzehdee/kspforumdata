I have faith in Squad as they have so far delivered a great gaming experience. If they feel like switching directions I\u0027m sure they have good reasons for doing so. It\u0027s not like they are throwing darts at ideas. I think they are trying to make the most accessible and fun game they can for all players, and are letting the modding community provide the advanced-challenge content. The community comprises of a lot of different players at different skill levels who consider different things fun. For example, I have no interest in FAR or IonForge as these addons don\u0027t sound fun to me, but other people really enjoy that level of challenge. I think Squad has so far done a great job at servicing ALL of the community, and trust them to continue to do so. Would I have preferred resources before multiplayer? Sure.

I understand (and share) the disappointment, but to try and downplay Squad\u0027s regard for and commitment to the community is asinine. If Squad is no longer allowed to make design decisions on their game without a cacophony of bitter accusations then they may as well walk away from the project now, because they\u0027ll never never finish a game when a successful launch requires they implement every single design request to every single player\u0027s satisfaction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I fail to understand those dismissing mods as a solution to this.

Within the next few months, we are likely to have a variety of resource options available to suit different play styles and desired complexities.
