Afaik only difference is that decoupling is staging event (not shown as such by default, but can be enabled in VAB/SPH). This is handy, since you can decouple from any part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingPete","CreatedById":127384,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-11T17:10:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ll get \u0027decouple node\u0027 on docking ports that were docked in the VAB and haven\u0027t been separated yet.

So because you never docked your craft together (they came preassembled), you don\u0027t have the Undock option. Once decoupled though, the docking ports will work normally, so next time you redock, you\u0027ll see the \u0022Undock\u0022 option :-)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* so no just another docking port\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
