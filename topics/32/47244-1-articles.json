But when you start exploring more distant targets and bigger goals (and bigger goals means bigger and more complicated ships) the game becomes less and less enjoyable and more and more time consuming with poorer and poorer results not by the lack of your space engineering and or piloting skills but more and more due to the bugs and crippled FPS. In the end bugs was the factor that stopped me for playing KSP any further. Building the flawed lander design is one thing sad but encouraging in the way (to build a better ship) but inability to land your ship due to the faulty docking port is another, same with parts are dropping of the big ships for no apparent reason anomalous spinnding forse, lander legs falling off after save\\load, ships get stuck in the surface of the planets, strange freezes when spacecenter becomes unrespondable, corrupted savegames after some bugs. Huge burn times for intraplanetary travel without any good way to speed up the process. Someone would say \u0022It is space exploration it is not for the faint of the heart, it is supposed to be hard\u0022 but actually it is not space exploration it is a game about the space exploration and the game shuld be more fun and less annoing. It is especially worrying that even gameplay at the current stage is significantly flawed the dev team is now concentrated on R\u0026amp;D and other carrier parts of the game rather than ironing the countless bugs that can easily ruin dozen hours of gameplay.

Most of them have already a year or two of development put into them before they are announced, and even then people quickly forget until the next year\u0027s E3 when more is featured. Most of those games have closed Beta tests with the testers under strong NDA\u0027s. When you really don\u0027t know what is going on, you tend to not pay attention to its development time until it reaches open Beta or is released. KSP seems to be longer because we are following its development so closely, and the bugs are more noticeable because we are actually seeing them.

I just feel that after more than 2 years of development game is equally far from being finished as it was during it\u0027s first release. I also think that maybe before brining so many features such as the whole solar system it would be more reasonable to add planets slowly with proper testing of the each celestial body. Also the benifit of early access looses part of it\u0027s meaning if usual players can\u0027t report bugs (exempt this forum). The Squad shuld have bug tracker (or even ingame feature) where various bugs culd be reported by the community but instead of going this way Squad goes for the mod support. The mod support itself is good for a finished product, instead we have flawed buggy alpha with mods on top of it which makes it\u0027s own bugs and renders proper bug tracking virtually impossibler, since there is unique combinations of mods (interacting with eachother) in each players version of the game. More than that, each release makes mods incompatible or faulty. So every time new version is released the mod community need to adapt to it and the Squad itself have to resort to closed testing group with limited nubmer of tester. It all sound really poorly planned for me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you are feeling like KSP isn\u0027t doing so well, then it might be time you took a break for an update or two.
