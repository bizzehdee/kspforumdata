It was nothing early on to stick a probe core on a command pod, load Bob in, and milk the Mun and Minmus for tons of science. Then came the comms system in 1.2 and doing that wasn\u0027t so easy anymore, as a matter of fact probe cores became kind of, not pointless, but harder to use, and suddenly manned missions with pilots became the way to go, tipping the balance once again. In this current state having life support becomes the final weight to balance the whole system out. If you haven\u0027t tried it, or were put off by it previously, try it now with the comms system active in your game- I think you\u0027ll find it to be an interesting addition that adds flavor as opposed to an optional level of difficulty. I\u0027ve always wanted to like LS before but it always felt tacked on and burdensome, now it feels like it really belongs as a proper cog in gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MGCJerry","CreatedById":95202,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-19T23:29:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was a huge fan of the mod \u0022Snacks!\u0022.

It would, as was pointed out, make sending Kerbals everywhere a little more logistically challenging, as probes are right now.\u00A0Perhaps keep it to two resources, \u0022Life Support\u0022 and \u0022Waste\u0022 (or whatever you want to call it), have a time limit after which it either kills or just disables your crew (this can be changed in the difficulty settings), and it can, like the comms system, be either activated or disabled per save through the difficulty settings.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the same way that stock comms is like a simplified version of Remote Tech, stock life support could be a simplified [insert favourite life support system here], and could be disabled with a click of a button. Thus, if people want a simple life support, they can, and if they don\u0027t, they can simply disable it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd, of course, if you want something more complicated, mods will still be around to add all sorts of other features.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-19T23:57:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d support simple life support such as Snacks!, or a little more flexible like USILS, but I\u0027ll say it yet again - we need mission planning tools built into the game, starting with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E info and ending with detailed long-term maneuver planning - before it should be implemented. We\u0027re already lacking this when all we need to worry about is fuel requirements - adding LS\u00A0adds a time requirement, and will result in a lot of dead Kerbals because there\u0027s no real concept of time as a resource in the game right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"obi_juan","CreatedById":89945,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-20T00:34:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter my first days in the game I started to play with \u0022TAC - Life Support\u0022...
