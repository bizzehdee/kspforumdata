This alignment could use the gravity assist of Jupiter to slingshot towards any of the other outside planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Grand tour in the Sol systems case was first brought to attention by a aerospace engineer of JPL in the early 1970s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was estimated that this Alignment occured every 175years (roughly) and could send an object to any of the planets Jupiter, Uranus, neptune and dwarf planet pluto. Maybe even a assisted flyby of mars with the least amount of required delta V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is. Does such a launch window also occur in the Kerbal (Kerbol system) Preferably to reach Duna, dres, Jool and Eelo in one mission only to use delta V for small slingshot course corrections as voyager 2 did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOfcourse the Kerbol system doesn\u0027t have 4 large gas Giants as gravity well. But to my theory any planetary system has a window for a grand tour to be made possible. In a system with bodies of lesser gravity the scenario would only be less likely to occur but instead take place every multiple hundred years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I don\u0027t know yet is which Kerbal year is the perfect alignment. And how long would it take for each cycle to return for a perfect grand tour alignment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anybody learned the perfect planetary alignment in his KSP experience throughout play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf so my question is what is the year, month, day, hour, minute or maybe even the very second for the optimal launch window to succeed in a Grand tour of the Kerbal system?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u003C/strong\u003E Accidentally posted this in general ksp discussion.

The two planets are locked in a 3:2 resonance, which, coupled with their different inclinations, ensures they cannot collide. \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
