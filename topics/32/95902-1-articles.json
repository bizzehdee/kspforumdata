Personaly I moved them over to the num pad. I control all my rotation with the left hand like normal but at the same time I can control translation with my right. I like 8/2 for up/down 4/6 for left/right and 7/1 for forward/back.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s what I do when using the keyboard. I basically stole the key mapping from Orbiter: 8/2=up/down, 1/3=left/right, 9/6=forward/back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022XenonBlade\u0022 data-cite=\u0022XenonBlade\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPretty good layout. I\u0027ll have to plug in one of my PS3 controllers and try it. I think I\u0027d be putting max engines on R1, cut engines on L1, and brakes on Circle though. I use the engine controls a lot more than brakes, and having them all in one place is important to me.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a good point! It never occurred to me that the two could be combined. I guess the only situation where this would be a disadvantage is if you want to hold the plane against the brakes while the engines spool up, though as you said, the keyboard controls could be used in that case.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-08T17:20:21Z\u0022 title=\u002201/08/2015 05:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FlyingPete\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Freshmeat","CreatedById":111048,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T17:38:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use dual gamepad for pitch/yaw and translate sideways, and two single axis joysticks for roll and translate forward/back.
