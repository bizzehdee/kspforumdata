I don\u0027t think I\u0027m hearing the concepts you\u0027re trying to convey.\n\nThe nosecones reduce drag when they are attached to an attachment node of a stack.\n\nWhen you start adding rockets to the sides, they have their own drag calculations because the game considers it another vessel adjacent to the original vessel.\n\nLets for example say that the central stack, the middle rocket has a drag value of 1 and has the drag reduced by 0.5 with a nose cone. That alone now has a drag of 0.5.\n\nWhen you add 4 boosters to the side, all with their own nose cones, the drag for each of them are also added to the whole craft. The central stack (0.5) plus the other 4 stacks that are considered separate entities (0.5 x 4) which is = 2.5 units of drag as a whole. The game applies the 2.5 drag on the ship. It doesn\u0027t matter what orientation or rotation you apply to the boosters to make them look like they are behind something, they will still induce that amount of drag.\n\nNow, if you were to instead combine all the boosters under the central stack using a 4-way adapter, the drag now becomes a total of 0.5 because they are part of the central stack joined by attachment nodes. The rocket should fly faster and higher.\n\nI know this is completely weird and unintuitive, but that\u0027s how the game engine currently sees drag."},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T12:17:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Now, if you were to instead combine all the boosters under the central stack using a 4-way adapter, the drag now becomes a total of 0.5 because they are part of the central stack joined by attachment nodes.
