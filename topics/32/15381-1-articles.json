Between the ability to repair that, and also mentions of different sorts of launch towers, pads, and assembly buildings for your customizable needs, I would see that idea will be very feasible. I would also be a strong proponent, myself, as it would be wondrous to be able to build a launch base on the Mun. For one, it would help immensely to get a better feel for physics and handling there, as well as making interplanetary missions much more affordable. If you only need to escape from the Mun\\\u0027s gravity well to get to the other planets, you won\\\u0027t need as much as from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leopardenthusiast","CreatedById":26084,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-27T08:12:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOther bodies?

But before that, we need docking. Which could deliver cargo and fuel and parts so we can build with it.
