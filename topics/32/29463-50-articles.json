I happened to notice that it looked like that kerbin, eve, and moho should be lining up in what would be a low delta v capable orbit around the sun. So I add a few science modules, fuel tanks and engines to my mun/minimus capable craft, throw Jebediah into the seat and off he goes. Did a deceleration burn to start dropping towards the sun and managed to reach eve and pass through there no problems, had to do an adjustment burn in Moho SOI otherwise I would actually pass too close to it and throw off my orbit. Now I\u0027m on the far side of the sun, and amazingly enough, only need to do a burn of 150m/s and I\u0027ll be on a path back into kerbin\u0027s SOI, so I use up the few drops of fuel left in my current engines, drop them and then realise that when I had redesigned my command section from a kerbin returnable mun/minimus lander to this stellar explorer that I had upgraded the fuel tanks slightly, but had forgotten to put on engines. So quickly send off a few disposable probes to get some quick science so that I can make a rescue craft. Got enough science, built the rescue craft, but by this time Jeb has gotten so close that i would need a 4.5-5k m/s change to intercept him, and having never done an actual intercept before decided to use the rescue craft on a few asteroids to practice interception on them. Unfortunately this has left Jeb on an orbital path that brings him back close to kerbin every 3-4 game years. Next time he\u0027s close to kerbin I go out and try to catch him, but burned too much fuel, and had not quicksaved so back to kerbin goes the rescue ship. It turns out however, I should have gotten into Jeb\u0027s ship just to check his orbit as he would come to encounter Eve once again this orbit, and I don\u0027t know if it was just a close path, or if some aerobraking occured, but Jeb left the Eve SOI at almost 90 degrees to his original entrance path. A path that terminated inside of the star. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow along comes today. I\u0027ve built and launched this new ship with the intention of intercepting ike and duna, and landing on both, and from there heading out to the next planet out from the sun to at least do a fly-by. so get the ship up into kerbin orbit without any significant problems, aside from securing the lander \u0026amp; command sections with supports to the engine sections. Aside from those two sections flopping around at times like a wet noodle in the wind when I go to full burn on my engines and making my HUD gyro go nuts, it\u0027s not that bad actually. To make things simple for the initial travel I had attached the lander to the command module top using a stack separator and would then dock once the lander was back in orbit to refuel. Turns out by doing this all my kerbals were in the lander, and none in the command module, so once I get into Duna SOI, I transfer the command staff into the command module leaving bill in the lander. However I\u0027m leaving something out about this. when I had entered Duna SOI, I happened to be on an intercept path to Ikeso I burned the last of the fuel left in my initial transfer engines (the ones I started with from kerbin) and actually get into a 60/180km orbit of Ike. Burned a little fuel to tighten that orbit to a 50/55km orbit and I\u0027m now ready to send Bill on his way. Detach the lander from the command \u0026amp; transfer engine section and as I\u0027m on a nearly perfect polar orbit through the night/day side equally, I do my initial burn from orbit and I\u0027m all set to touch down right in the middle of the day side in about 20-25 mins, so about 15 minutes later I know I\u0027m about to reach the dayside of Ike and start preparing for my braking burn, when I notice something on the ground of ike passing underneath me. Not thinking much of it, I decide to turn on my lights just on the off chance I was actually close enough to see anything there on the nightside. Turns out I was as about 2 seconds after I turned them on, I plow into a mountainous cliff there on the darkside/dayside border that had been blocking all the sunlight as I got closer to the ground.

I\u0027ve built and launched this new ship with the intention of intercepting ike and duna, and landing on both, and from there heading out to the next planet out from the sun to at least do a fly-by. so get the ship up into kerbin orbit without any significant problems, aside from securing the lander \u0026amp; command sections with supports to the engine sections. Aside from those two sections flopping around at times like a wet noodle in the wind when I go to full burn on my engines and making my HUD gyro go nuts, it\u0027s not that bad actually. To make things simple for the initial travel I had attached the lander to the command module top using a stack separator and would then dock once the lander was back in orbit to refuel. Turns out by doing this all my kerbals were in the lander, and none in the command module, so once I get into Duna SOI, I transfer the command staff into the command module leaving bill in the lander. However I\u0027m leaving something out about this. when I had entered Duna SOI, I happened to be on an intercept path to Ikeso I burned the last of the fuel left in my initial transfer engines (the ones I started with from kerbin) and actually get into a 60/180km orbit of Ike. Burned a little fuel to tighten that orbit to a 50/55km orbit and I\u0027m now ready to send Bill on his way. Detach the lander from the command \u0026amp; transfer engine section and as I\u0027m on a nearly perfect polar orbit through the night/day side equally, I do my initial burn from orbit and I\u0027m all set to touch down right in the middle of the day side in about 20-25 mins, so about 15 minutes later I know I\u0027m about to reach the dayside of Ike and start preparing for my braking burn, when I notice something on the ground of ike passing underneath me. Not thinking much of it, I decide to turn on my lights just on the off chance I was actually close enough to see anything there on the nightside. Turns out I was as about 2 seconds after I turned them on, I plow into a mountainous cliff there on the darkside/dayside border that had been blocking all the sunlight as I got closer to the ground. No problem I thought, I\u0027ll just go ahead and restore my quicksave as I\u0027ve now been quicksaving everytime I\u0027ve done a MAJOR transfer between the planets one as I enter a planets SOI, and once prior to leaving it. usually also did a quicksave prior to getting out of my landers just incase there was a problem with my guy getting back in.

Docked up to the refueling station, topped off the tanks, and went on my way. The upgrades I did do have improved handling immensely (still turns like a wounded cow tho) Now I\u0027m currently finalizing my approach transfer, when I realize that I forgot to add additional monopropellent tanks to any parts of this monstrosity and the lander only has enough for me to do 2-4 rendevous with the transfer section (based on my current level of skill).

That\u0027s where the problems began as apparantly on my 3 man crew, Bob happened to be my best lander pilot, as Bill and Doodwig managed to do this about a dozen times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Cv1kniZ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Cv1kniZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Cv1kniZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003Eand then once I reloaded for the 13th time, and managed to get Bob there minus the rest of his EVA fuel this happened more than a few times.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Egu6RLE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Egu6RLE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Egu6RLE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Bob be Nimble, Bob be quick, Bob jumped over the rocket ship)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen once I did get him into the ship, accidently decoupled the four landing rockets, reload again \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EDark Force Engineering - Launching Kerbanauts into space since early 2014\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EEngineer to Mission Control - You know, maybe we should think about getting them down out of space at some point\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9Mission Control to Engineers - Why, they seem happy up there?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-03T16:54:00Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2014 04:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Ruthgar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eresized the photos\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PaladinFoster","CreatedById":114164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-03T03:46:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EToday I learned a hard lesson in lander design. I attempted to land on the Mun and I realized that there was just barely enough fuel in the lander stage to actually slow down enough for a safe descent. Me, being a not so great pilot, managed to wait just a touch too long before burning and crashed into the surface at roughly 45mps. The whole thing exploded, but the command module bounced up into the \u0022air\u0022 again for some reason. I realized it would hit the ground pretty hard when it did come back down, so I instructed Jebediah to bail out, and then guided him down with his thruster pack. So Jeb is now on the surface of the Mun with only his space suit to keep him alive, and only a few small pieces of the vehicle that was supposed to bring him home left. Nonetheless, he proudly planted a flag.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumrex","CreatedById":103753,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-04T03:28:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust experimenting with new variable builds for different items in contracts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mUY0Age.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mUY0Age.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/axhXSpH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022axhXSpH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should have just set up a sign outside KSP for the day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7ioei4M.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227ioei4M.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-04T06:41:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo I will not go to space today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/9ikcBLb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9ikcBLb.png\u0022 alt=\u00229ikcBLb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis kethane and ore miner fall apart on launchpad \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo idea that is wrong with it, might be some parts who is clipped inside it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably have to rip it apart and rebuild it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
