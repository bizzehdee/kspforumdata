High deposits of Kethane, so I imagine the other resources would be abundant there as well, and if not, whatever I COULD get from the Mun is, you know, right on my doorstep, no multi-month mining missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus: Basically the same reasons as the Mun, except the color is much more annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGilly: Pretty much the lowest delta-V cost to get to interplanetary. Easy to take off and land on, though rendezvous with the huge captured asteroid is a bit tricky. Easy to map, I\u0027m guessing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPol: Similar reasons to Gilly, as it\u0027s the SECOND lowest gravity planet currently in the game. However, preliminary mapping shows that Kethane deposits are scarce (yet present), and if resource density is assumed to be the same for other resources, it may be limiting in the places we can mine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna is another viable option, as the atmosphere allows for parachute landing (shut up, it does, I\u0027ve had a design fail because the skycrane touched down safely with parachutes and had to be thrown away so the rover can be deployed.) So, a parachute landing would rid a lot of delta-V, and it just seems like a friendly place to set up a base.
