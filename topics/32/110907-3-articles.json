This is the only real way to play KSP. Pure stock installs are for players that want rocket science handed to them on a silver platter.\n\nJust make sure those parts aren\u0027t all engines...\n\nAnyways, I usually play a fairly heavily modded game, but I do understand the appeal of stock. Stock is great for sharing craft and comparing missions and has a certain simplicity to it with not having to install a bunch of mods and keep them all updated.\n\nUnfortunately IMHO, KSP is still unfinished and is still an early access game in everything but name (and price now) and every time I go back to stock to build something I could potentially share, I end up missing all the niceties from mods that really should be stock (new/rebalanced parts mainly that fill in the holes in the stock lineup and KAS/KIS and life support, along with the occasional system rescale so I can build appropriately large rockets).\n\nAt least the essential UI/info and and graphics/audio mods still let me share craft while dramatically improving the game."},{"CreatedByName":"Xacktar","CreatedById":88876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T18:49:09Z","Content":"Four things keep me playing *mostly* stock.\n\n1.

I don\u0027t have to face that annoyance when a mod I\u0027ve come to depend on is suddenly abandoned and no longer used. \n\nIn addition, when I do finally tire of Stock KSP, then mods will be there.

Can I do it if I must? Sure. I can also stick a fork in my eye, if I must. The enjoyment of this game for me comes from designing a program or vehicles capable of executing what I want them to do, without my involvement in every fine detail of the manuevers.

(provided they bought it) You have access to it. I have access to it. Slash has access to it. Everyone starts with stock, and therefor stock is the biggest group of people because it literally includes everyone.\n\nNot everyone can run mods, especially RO, so that group of people is naturally much smaller than the stock group. If Slash focuses on stock craft, it can be used by everyone in the community, because we all have access to stock KSP. It may not work in RO, but thats a given. Just cause you play RO doesn\u0027t mean you don\u0027t have access to stock. If you made RO craft, yeah they would work for you. And anyone else who has your exact RO config.

It felt like the only way to have achievements and designs feel meaningfully comparable to what others have done\n2. Lack of interest in spending time maintaining mods and dealing with any issues arising from their use\n3. Belief that Squad would be more focused on creating a broadly balanced and satisfying game than a modder who has his own playstyle and preferences in mind (ie. parts could be overpowered, not fit well with career flow, etc.), and I figured eventually Squad would get around to pulling in the best mod ideas themselves.\n\nI have to say though that I\u0027ve just recently reached the point where I\u0027m giving up on stock play.\n\nBasically I\u0027ve been disappointed that point #3 above hasn\u0027t held true -- especially at its 1.0 release status. So I\u0027ve been really excited by the [SETI mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106130-1-0-2-SETI-CommunityTechTree-Contracts-Greenhouse-BalanceMod) which aims to pull together a wide range of popular mods, contracts, and a custom tech tree into a cohesive, balanced career gameplay experience that looks to be much more well thought-out and diverse than the stock game. I\u0027d be much happier if it were Squad doing this, but I think it\u0027s pretty clear at this point that Squad wants to stick to the minimum necessary and leave everything else to modders, so I\u0027m really happy that somebody is taking up the banner of creating a great career game from that platform.\n\nEdit: Hah, of course Yemo, the creator of SETI, slips a post in just ahead of mine.
