Telling people, \u0027right, spin that ball until you see the green cross then activate your thrusters\u0027 and they get it. When doing docking for the first time I\u0027ve seen very few good descriptions of adjusting your approach and sometimes I just want to shout \u0027Turn on RCS and use I-J-K-L to move the yellow wings into the middle of the pink circle\u0027... tell a new person that and they actually GET it... okay so they don\u0027t get the theory of what it is they\u0027re actually DOING, but that can come later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, for many people to learn how to do something, they need to do it \u0027idiots guide to\u0027 style and once they\u0027ve done it, they\u0027ll begin to understand what they\u0027ve done.

He was a highly regarded in his field, and the physics department considered his presence a boon. However, I had him the first semester he was involved in that university, so there was a bit of a learning experience going on even from the Physics department\u0027s point of view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe man was brilliant, and the level of physics he was teaching was basic enough to him that he found it intuitive. And that\u0027s where the problem starts. Since he found it intuitive, he had never actually gone through the process of learning it, so he really didn\u0027t understand how to impart that knowledge to a room full of students that didn\u0027t find it intuitive. And yet, the defect was obviously with us because it was such simple and obvious stuff. And yes, he\u0027d say that during rants. One time he went so far as to call the entire class a bunch of sheep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of the semester, they quietly shuffled the teaching roster so that he never taught that level of physics again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I get it. I\u0027m the same way with programming. I was taking lvl 300 or 400 classes before any professor taught me anything that I hadn\u0027t worked out for myself intuitively before starting college. The only computer science class I ever had any problems with was one taught by the kind of professor who\u0027s tests consisted of parroting definitions, and one missing word would drop your score by 25%. I had a harder time in that class than my classmates that had always had to work hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite that, I can\u0027t teach programming because for me, it\u0027s all so intuitive that I barely have to think about it. Of course you do this then that, that\u0027s how it works. I have a very hard time breaking down how I do the basic steps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short, don\u0027t assume that because you had to work hard to learn things in this game that that means that you\u0027re the wrong person to try to teach it, or to write up a tutorial on it. Knowing how you learned it is as important as what you learned.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-11T19:25:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have to agree with Tristavius there.
