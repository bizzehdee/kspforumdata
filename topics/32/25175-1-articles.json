I was able to play the demo for a long time, and also at a friend\u0027s house, where I helped him build lunar rockets and refueling rigs (He really sucks at the game, but he also likes it). I just want to ask if there is a kind member here that is able to gift me a steam copy of the game. I really want to support the developers, as I know they are trying to make a living for themselves, and not like EA, who already has a lot of money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I live in a small European country, where our credit card is not supported by steam, and the few times I was able to buy stuff online were because my father was able to send money to me as a birthday gift. (He is in china, and I don\u0027t see him often). So, I am kinda asking if someone on this forum is able to buy me a copy of the game for free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I have seen some people that bought games for others, (like that minecraft guy named vaxx), so I thought maybe I could ask nicely here, and perhaps someone might be able to buy the game for me.
