If there are struts attaching your subassembly you\u0027re saving to other parts, you need to strip them off.\n\nOh yes, my subassemblies are self contained and thoroughly tested individually as separate craft. That\u0027s why it\u0027s frustrating when I can\u0027t use them without significant rebuilding. If I had it right the first time, I certainly would forget something on the second time. \n\nIn my experience the system fails about 40 percent of the time. Moving from the SPH to the VAB is especially problematic. I\u0027m guessing that the symmetry rules are enforced differently, and this throws any struts way off. They do not have to be attached to other things to suddenly face the wrong way. Half the struts that supported your undercarriage will suddenly be facing out in space. One workaround is to never use symmetry when strutting, but that\u0027s not an optimal solution when so much of the game depends on symmetry.\n\nMerging has other issues that go beyond struts. Sometimes only half the craft you are loading as a merge shows up. Sometimes the parts are grossly misaligned. I wonder if it\u0027s the same bug, and that the parts are so out of position sometimes that you just can\u0027t see them."},{"CreatedByName":"LostOblivion","CreatedById":111504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T21:59:26Z","Content":"The one thing I find annoying with subassemblies and merging is that you can\u0027t always attach them.

No exceptions. If it\u0027s launched vertically on a rocket, it goes in the VAB. If it\u0027s launched horizontally like an aircraft, SPH.

I build a rover in SPH, save it as a subassembly, then build the transfer stage and lander/deployment system in VAB, load the rover and attach it, load a launch stage subassembly and attach it, then just add struts and fairings. First build big, complex bricks in buildings where they belong, then assemble the craft out of 3-4 such big bricks in the building it will be launched from.

The root part of a lander should usually be its command pod, but if you want to attach it to the top of a rocket, then the bottom part of its stack must be the root part for it to attach, which is usually the engine. Now, if you have a multi-stage lander then having the engine be the root part doesn\u0027t work very well with KER for instance, which pretty much assumes a part in the upmost stage be the root."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T11:56:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The thing is, the \u0022correct part\u0022 doesn\u0027t really make sense.
