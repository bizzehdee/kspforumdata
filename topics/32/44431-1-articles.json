I found with the way the game is currently programmed it seems that it\u0027s not possible to have one on the planet Kerbin. I modded the KAS mod to make a space elevator. Then I tied it to the ground and try to launch a rocket to geostationary orbit. It doesn\u0027t work so well. It seems once you get too far away from the ends of the cable (about 10km) it disconnects. So I decided to attempt the same thing on Minmus due to it\u0027s low gravity and speedy rotation. I\u0027ve only had marginal success. I managed to create a sky hook (by accident when the cables disconnected and flew straight up into space) that could hold my ship in low orbit at slow speeds (the cable extended upwards 10 to 15 km). I can land on Minmus, attach the cables, but I don\u0027t know how high geostationary is for that moon. If it\u0027s past 10km or so it probably won\u0027t work so well. Does anyone know? It would help a lot and I don\u0027t have the time to look at the math at the moment. Has anyone else tried this sort of thing with success? It\u0027d be cool if I could hoist cargo into orbit on a KAS grapple!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASI Director","CreatedById":64746,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T00:49:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I\u0027m not mistaken, Minmus\u0027 Geostationary orbit is beyond its SOI, so yeah.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: No, it\u0027s not.

Unless you take the time to hoist the payload all the way up to geostationary altitude, the payload will still require a lot of fuel because at any lower altitude, its orbital velocity upon release will be less than required for its altitude. The lower you release the payload, the more fuel and TWR it will need to get into a stable orbit before it falls back into the atmosphere. This kinda defeats the purpose of having a space elevator based on a cable hanging from above.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T03:07:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe physic limits of the game prevents one from constructing a space elevator. In real life, it may be possible to make the cable from ultra strength carbon nanotubes. Getting the first strands of that cable into space and anchoring it to the Earth\u0027s equator and to a counterweight way beyond geosynchronous orbit is another matter. It also becomes a target for orbiting satellites that would promptly cut it dropping the cable to Earth and flinging the rest into a solar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tygroux","CreatedById":75717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T03:36:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn alternative solution would be to set up a Station in Geosynchronous Orbit with the Orbital Construction Mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen we would need to be able to transfer ressources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the lazor mod does that.

However to make the game easier Squad increased all the planet densities by an order of magnitude. Making them much tinier and causing them to have a much smaller SOI. A good example of this is Jool is a gas planet in the game but has almost exactly the same size and density characteristics as the planet Venus IRL. So a space elevator could probably be built from the surface of Kerbin without using any fancy nano tubes. Also what I was doing was a test. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the test had succeeded what I was going to do was attach cables to the ground at the KSC. Then have two ships attached to the cable in space. A smaller one below geostationary and a larger one beyond it, maybe a third one geostationary. When something was going to be hauled into space, the smaller one closer to Kerbin would release a cable which would descend to Kerbin. There would be a few cables attaching the stations together. One of which would actually be two cables attached to some kind of carrier with two winches attached to each station. That way objects could be ferried from one to the other. So the load could be transferred to the ferry and pulled up the rest of the cable by the station beyond geostationary. If you wanted to release it at geostationary you would just have to stop the winch at that point and release the cargo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand my accidental sky hook did work around Minmus.
