The music is pacey, definitely grew on me. I am thinking the beat is a fast reggae/ska, so not garage nor techno, am wondering if it has a name. Its pretty cool anyway 8) though relentless, morning music not evening music. Reminds me of fatboy slim a little in that it has rhythm and a sense of humour about it. I like the underlying creepy Hollywood alien vibe, which kind of fits given that our ships are piloted by little green men. IMHO the reggae beat gives it a 60\\\u0027s 2-tone association which keys into the era of UFO paranoias and public fantasies of official coverups re: aliens visiting Earth.

I did some R\u0026amp;D to find the smallest possible single shot \u0026amp; return vehicle and then built the first big launcher around that. The key is not having ASAS on the final lander stage, so it is very light and has a lot of DV in its half tank. It is also fairly easy to fly because the capsule SAS damps its motion well enough as it is so small. The R\u0026amp;D allowed me to practice flying it and decide on optimum deceleration burn timing for the lander etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
