Apparently, launching a rocket through the atmosphere produces a *lot* of heat on the parts that face the airstream. In this case, this was the Mk1 command pod.\u003Cp\u003ESince the Pod is connected to the Probe core, the pod heats the core via conductive heat transfer (touching hot things makes you hot as well).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the Pod has a much higher heat tolerance than the core, and the core explodes from all the heat it gets from the Pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a real engineering phenomenon: thermal soakback. I\u0027ll give an example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a jet engine, the combustor is where all the burning happens. Combustors are made of super high temp alloys (usually nickel-based). But the fire inside is still hotter than the combustor wall can survive. So the wall is cooled by airflow. Also, heat gets into the fuel injectors and fuel manifold (because they are physically attached). And that heat is carried away by the fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what happens when the engine is shut off? Well, the airflow stops. And the fuel flow stops. That\u0027s what was carrying away all your heat. Fortunately the flame stops too. So the combustor wall has no more heat coming in, which means it slowly cools down. But it cools down by radiating and conducting and convecting the heat away. Well, that means the heat goes from the combustor and into the fuel injectors and fuel manifold. Since no more fuel is flowing, they get \u003Cstrong\u003Ehotter\u003C/strong\u003E after the engine is shut down. A lot hotter. So much hotter, that you have to worry about them coking up the fuel that is still sitting in the manifold.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd insulating them only makes the problem worse, because the heat soaks in but can\u0027t get back out. That\u0027s what space is doing to your rocket. Vacuum is a great insulator, and the heat is conducting from the hot parts to the formerly cool parts. With vacuum being such a good insulator, it just builds up there. Real world problem that is showing up now in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
