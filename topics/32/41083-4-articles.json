The total weight of a KAS docking system is higher than using docking ports, but it\u0027s all concentrated on the winch side: the connector port on your actual craft weighs very little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe downsides are that it\u0027s dramatically more wobbly than docking ports, and it REQUIRES a kerbal on EVA to make the connection, but the weight savings on the craft are probably worth it at least some of the time. Not to mention you can \u0027dock\u0027 at distances up to 50m that way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FEichinger","CreatedById":58255,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T13:00:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022loknar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022loknar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Emost people\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[citation needed]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll I see is a vocal minority, just like with the End Flight button.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shand","CreatedById":57781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T13:23:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHas anybody played the \u0022we\u0027re in alpha, all artwork is pretty much placeholders\u0022 card recently?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso howcome you guys aren\u0027t screaming that probe bodies need clearer \u0022this way forward\u0022 markings?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m all in favour of adding a window to the port for pretty viewingness but it won\u0027t make it clearer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewe\u0027ve already seen some obvious pics of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/44599-Clampotron-Sr-Docking-Port-PSA?p=574898\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post574898\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eside on viewing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/thumb/4/4e/Clamp-o-tron-sr-correct-usage.png/180px-Clamp-o-tron-sr-correct-usage.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eends\u003C/a\u003E are blindingly obvious!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecan you post a screenshot, or craft file, of a situation where you might struggle at the time of connection? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(checking later is hard with every part - so thats not fair. how do you check your engine is on the right way up if you\u0027ve already got a decoupler below? you detach the bits beneith, and check. why expect anything different with your docking ports.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still maintain that its easy to tell as you place it, and checking at the end of construction when you\u0027ve surrounded it in bits you cant take off for various reasons is a really bad design process\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brigonos","CreatedById":75552,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T13:57:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow did this make it to 10 pages?
