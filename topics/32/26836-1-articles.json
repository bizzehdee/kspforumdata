I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m thinking of a few hitchhiker cans along with some solar panels, a rover for the residents to go exploring in, and a mobile refueling platform. Other than that, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not sure what to bring, even if it doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t serve any actual purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brabbit1987","CreatedById":65801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T16:18:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just build things and pretend they are other things.
