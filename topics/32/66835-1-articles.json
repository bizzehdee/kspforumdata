So often turning the other way round and thrusting, or trying to do as large a burn with thrusters is just a waste as I would be way past where I would need to be, but in a closer orbit and therefore have to wait longer than if I just recalculate from the one I am in as soon as I realize my mistake.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TerLoki","CreatedById":30301,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T18:42:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, who forgot to press \u0022T\u0022 before the maneuver?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T18:46:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb isn\u0027t compatible with the latest update.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T19:32:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe need a docking port alignment indicator in real life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: And quicksaves.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T19:51:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThree guys crammed into a small capsule for 34 hours?
