I just tested it when trying to correct my course only 40k up on re-entry. I spotted something that I suspect may be the other KSP (Have yet to see it!) and tried to correct; but it required a speedy burnoff of over 2km/s due to the angle, and I went bingo fuel and was in a flat stall. I was unable to get any lift by diving, oddly, and ended up falling more or less straight down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, being able to attempt a correction (next time at higher altitude, if the need arises) is always nice. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"E.
