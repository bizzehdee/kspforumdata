I discovered that the first version of the mothership didn\u0027t have the delta-V or even a way to refuel. So after an excessive amount of explosions; I managed to lob a second mothership into Kerbin orbit, rendezvous with the first mothership, transfer over the three rovers I had already launched to the first mothership, launch the other three and dock them, and refuel the entire monstrosity.

Slowly though it was at first, it was still faster than Manfrid could run on the Mun, so the kerbal quickly decided to use his jetpack. But he failed to land on top of the rover the first couple of tries, and by then the thing had picked up quite the speed. Unwilling to quit, Manfrid chased the mini-rover for more than 2 km, reaching speeds of over 18m/s, when he finally managed to land right on top of the seat. The mini-rover shot through the canyon, building more and more speed towards the canyon wall. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd suddenly I learned that Manfrid had to be standing to be able to properly board the seat.
