Due to the only liquid fuel usage, i find it hard to build larger stages of nuclear engines - as before Mk3 parts are unlocked, only mk2 and mk1 pars are available - and the mk2 parts are difficult to use on rockets, as all adapters, nosecones, etc. have LF\u002BOX, decreasing efficiency. Though efficiency is still better than normal engines for larger craft (I assume), the need for many engines due to their small size and the assorted heating problems leads me to consider not using them. Also, using them would create problems in the logistics chain for a craft, as refueling a nuclear powered craft from a station leaves surplus oxidizer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theend3r","CreatedById":97560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T12:16:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETAC Fuel Balancer is one of my essential mods and one that can solve the surplus oxidizer problem as it allows you to dump fuel. This could be especially useful if you use resource mining to refuel your station. The nukes should be the endgame solution to everything so talking about not having parts unlocked is pretty meaningless. Not to mention you don\u0027t actually \u003Cem\u003Eneed\u003C/em\u003E to use nukes for anything.
