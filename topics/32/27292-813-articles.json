As the rover arrived, it was decided to take a break from a successful landing of something far too large to be landing in one piece. Upon resuming the game, when the physics kicked in, the huge rover burred itself in the sands of Duna, paused for a moment, then entropy ensued. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe attached picture is 6 years later. The cargo ship has disintegrated, but it\u0026#39;s load of struts is still exploding. The explosion ripped a hole in space and time, and time is nearly stopped for everything within 2.25 km in all directions. Landing on the site is not possible, as time grinds to a stop before you can touch the ground. Scientists back at the space center think Jeb is having fun being tossed around on the end of a strut, and estimate it will be 65,000 years before he is ready to stop horsing around and place an order for a new load of supplies. The other engineers don\u0026#39;t look like they are having as much fun as Jeb...[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/idpoPcv.png[/IMG]\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-24T14:34:14Z\u0022 title=\u002211/24/2015 02:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by keoki\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DunaRocketeer","CreatedById":103193,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T09:33:07Z","Content":"\nMade some improvements to my vehicles to add a few more tons payload to orbit - exended the centre tank so I can use the centre engines during first stage flight.
