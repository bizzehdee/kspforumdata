Very rarely I find a need to go there for some reason, and I always think \u0022wow, I remember this place\u0022. It seems like a lifetime ago, but this was once the Holy Grail. Landing on it was all I could think about at work.

With a large, abandoned mining and science base that now collects nothing but dust. Kinda sad, actually. I\u0027ll have to get back there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMinmus? Ah, Minmus is like an old friend you come to resent after a while. The refueling operation there was once the backbone of my space program. Every interplanetary ship stopped there to refuel on the way out. I literally spent a few hundred hours landing and refueling my fuel shuttle, then refueling ships. I grew to depend on it, and then grew to hate it and finally stopped doing it altogether. I learned to get better at the game, and am much happier for it. Now, I enjoy going back to Minmus, just cuz it still looks really cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuna/Ike? Love it. I see them as a single entity (and they practically are), and so together, they rank high on my list. I love their relative size and distance. I think it makes for a fantastic visual. And since it\u0027s the first planet most of us go to, it\u0027s a real eye-opener as well. As in, \u0022you thought the game was cool\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ebefore,\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eit\u0027s going to keep getting\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ebetter\u0022\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEve? Pretty much the pinnacle of our game, IMO. Love going there, and love how hard it is. It\u0027s sort of the great equalizer. Even if you use information mods, I don\u0027t think you have an advantage over those of us who don\u0027t. Just because \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E says you have this much Delta V and this high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027ll work well on Eve (or that you can even land the thing in the first place). You actually have to go there and see if it works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGilly, on the other hand, I avoid these days. I think it\u0027s cool, and I like the way it looks, but landing (and even taking off) is so excruciatingly tedious that I don\u0027t go unless I have to. I have a refueling operation there that I \u0027ve used maybe 3 times in 50 years. It was meant to refuel Eve landers that got back to orbit. Instead, I send the rescue from Kerbin. It takes more gametime, but it takes less of\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emy\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0gametime; which is much more important.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGonna be in the minority here, but I love going to Dres. He\u0027s a shy-guy, so he doesn\u0027t like meeting new players, but it\u0027s worth the trip. The inclination is tough, and it\u0027s out in the middle of nowhere, but I like the whole vibe of the tiny planet nobody likes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJool? It has to be everyone\u0027s favorite destination isn\u0027t it? There\u0027s just so much to do, and the visuals are fantastic. I love watching all the moons flying around. And this is the place that teaches you the true power of the gravity assist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the moons themselves, Tylo is cool because, I swear, you can actually\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Efeel\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the gravity when you\u0027re landing. I\u0027m not sure how else to describe it.

I\u0027ve landed there a couple times, but never really found a love for it. I\u0027ll have to try again, maybe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd Vall just elicits a yawn for some reason. Not sure why. Gonna have to try harder there, as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like Bop, maybe for the inclination and low gravity, but, like Gilly, landing is a pain. Yet another refueling operation of mine that collects dust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really do like Pol. One of my first and favorite refueling operations. I\u0027ve gotten a lot of use out of it. It\u0027s my favorite place to leave from, as well. You can leave direct, or dip down to Tylo for a boost home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI absolutely love Eeloo. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s the crazy Pluto-esque orbit (sometimes closer than Jool, sometimes further), the awesome Europa-esque look of it (the coolest looking planet, IMO), or the far-out Neptune-esque\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Efeel\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0I get from going there, but I always enjoy it. I take tons of contracts there, and have half a dozen ships on the way now. I\u0027m building yet another science and refueling operation there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, after a lengthy post (apologies), I get around to the actual point of the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

I play by trial and error, and guesswork based on experience. But at Moho, I keep guessing wrong and coming up short (I try never to over-build anymore, so I\u0027m always pushing the envelope). I\u0027ve missed 3 out of 4 times. By far my worst \u0022success\u0022 rate of any world. I bounce off of Eve, but I still keep underestimating what I\u0027ll need. And what\u0027s worse than going to Moho? Sending a rescue operation for a ship that\u0027s in an orbit roughly the equivalent of Moho\u0027s. Three times. I finally decided to set up refueling operations to make my trial and error method easier (cuz I\u0027m gonna keep going back until I get good at it). I sent a mining and science base and set it up.

In my personal mod settings, these massive moons get reduced in size to 2x the proportional radius of their analogue). Laythe becomes more like a titan analogue, but still quite different. Tylo: 0.296 G and 496km radius (then 3x scaled along with almost everything else in the system).
