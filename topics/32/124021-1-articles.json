It treated all the things in space like they were stationary on a map, and you could just thrust toward them to get there. Anybody who\u0027s tried a rendezvous in KSP knows that ain\u0027t the case when you\u0027re more than just a few scant kilometers apart.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know what you mean, but in principle there\u0027s no fundamental issue with making a rendezvous using EVA thrusters only as long as you thrust in the right direction. The movie got the direction wrong, but not the situational reasoning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022boa3532\u0022 data-cite=\u0022boa3532\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EActually, the supply pod did have the capability of a Mars intercept (The booster for the\u003Cem\u003E Taiyang Shen\u003C/em\u003E from the Chinese) , the problem was they had less than a month to put the pod together and the only option was to crash land the pod on Mars at about 300 m/s in which the supplies had a low chance of surviving.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*SPOILERS WARNING* The issue was one of time. To rendezvous with a ship on it\u0027s way to somewhere in a given time costs exactly the same (or more actually) as going there yourself in the same amount of time. The reasoning was that for the mothership to make the return to Mars they would need to make their acceleration burn (instead of a deceleration burn) BEFORE reaching Earth (described in dialog), so the rendezvous with the pod would require the pod to accelerate to Mars insertion velocity anyway!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-31T13:47:48Z\u0022 title=\u002210/31/2015 01:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by The_Rocketeer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darnok","CreatedById":85708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-31T13:42:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWouldn\u0027t be more realistic and safer to just send small capsule with resources as independent mission to Mars?
