I guess I noticed something was wrong right before the radial liquid fuel boosters mounted lower down ran out of fuel (there were 4 decouplers instead of two pairs of 3 like the last one), and I panicked and advanced the stage. Rather than releasing the boosters which would have been bad enough (I have done this a few times, and sometimes they will hit the rocket, other times they bounce and cause it to break up, which is survivable), I released 4 radial fuel tanks positioned above 3 pairs of boosters fastened to 3 center engines. Between the explosions from impact, and the explosions caused as the remaining boosters disconected and aimed their exhaust right into the center stack, the rocket only managed to live for a few seconds after that even as I frantically started trying to advance stages in the hopes of getting an engine running before it failed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also had a great one with my camera truck, where I stuck the camera out to one side and then accidently drove into my rocket.

The truck exploded, alone with much of the camera boom. The rocket itself took about 5 seconds to die since the explosions weren\\\u0027t enough to take it out.
