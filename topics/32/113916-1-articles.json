I used the Kerbal Alarm Clock and Hullcam mod to keep the camera in the same angle about once every 10 nights and a constant screenshot at the same time each night for about 72 kerbin years. \n\nFor those who dont know what retrograde motion is, it is the apparent motion of planets through the sky as we are passed or are passing them in orbit. \n\nSoure: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_retrograde_motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_retrograde_motion)\n\nIf anyone has any ideas on how I can continue this easier than what I am doing now, or has any other ideas i can try, shoot me a comment (I think, because this is my first ever post)!
