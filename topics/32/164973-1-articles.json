Speaking as a person who had serious financial issues a few years ago\u00A0I couldn\u0027t afford the full game (or the Internet) for many years - but the demo was so fun and so much could be done with the basic parts it was enormously satisfying and entertaining. KSP\u0027s demo is easily as fun as the full version of many other games - so if you can find it, regardless of version, go ahead and have fun; you\u0027ll enjoy it a lot. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-31T18:53:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed5617743873\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/163917-what-happened-to-the-demo/\u0026amp;tab=comments\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=3136185\u0026amp;embedComment=3136185\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment#comment-3136185\u0022 style=\u0022height:268px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI asked about it a month ago, and apparently the servers still work, they just aren\u0027t actively pointing to them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis might be the \u0022old\u0022 demo, the one on Steam (I think) was based on 1.0.0, and the one on Squad\u0027s site was based on 0.18 (the last they released for free).\u00A0 I might have those backwards, but I suspect that they will only ship one demo based on 1.0.3 now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of the information on this board should relate pretty close to the 1.0.0 demo.\u00A0 The 0.18 demo is still quite good, but has some really strange effects:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a \u0022souposphere\u0022: you want your rocket to go straight up for 10,000m, then make a hard right (45 degrees East) turn until apogee is \u0026gt;70,000m. 1.0.0 and later work better with a more realistic pitch progression.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere aerodynamic model is silly, parts have drag regardless of position.\u00A0 Experienced rocket designers of this era designed rockets that looked more like pancakes than rockets.\u00A0 1.0.0 fixes this, although horizontal staging may well be more stable (big rockets get unstable when noodly now).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is optimal at 2.0 (throughout the souposphere).\u00A0 This is hardly true on Earth or modern Kerbin (i.e. 1.0.0 and later).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are probably other weird things to discover (and deal with while changing versions) but 0.18 pretty much captures the feel of launching little green men into space just as well as 1.0.0.\u00A0 Have fun whichever version you get.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-31T19:45:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe 1.0 demo is awful. The part selection is very limited and seemingly designed less to give you a good idea of what the game is like and more like a difficult version. Mun, Minmus, Sun, and Kerbin are the only celestial bodies (an improvement over previous version\u0027s Kerbin, Mun, and Sun), but getting to the Mun with the demo parts is not really possible in the 1.0 demo for someone new to the game.

The atmosphere uses an in-development model that didn\u0027t even make it to 1.0, almost soupier than the souposphere of 0.90 and earlier, except this time aerodynamics matter (and given all of the radial parts and the limited 1.25m fairing, aerodynamics is not something you can really get)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would actually recommend you try 0.13.3\u00A0(available on the forums for free) or 0.18.3 (free demo, no longer available from Squad) if you can find it.
