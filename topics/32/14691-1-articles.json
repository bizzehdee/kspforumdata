This is a bug that happens when you leave Kerbin\\\u0027s Sphere of Influence and enter interplanetary space. When this happens, the game stops representing your velocity as being relative to Kerbin, but instead calculates your velocity relative to Kerbol - which it does by adding your velocity to Kerbin\\\u0027s velocity as it orbits Kerbol. The combined velocity is so great that PhysX loses precision and large errors can occur. Under some circumstances this can rip ships apart, but it can also create vibration and turning forces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe collision problem has been fixed as of Release 0.16, and it is hoped the Space Kraken bug will be fixed in a not-to-distant future release.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"E.

As the vessel reached the middle atmosphere, something about the air speed caused the wheels of the cart to gradually extend farther and farther from the cart. Eventually, one or more of them would overlap with a rocket part. These overlaps caused quickly increasing turn forces which would lead to loss of control. The only solution was to either slow down, or get out of the atmosphere. Then the wheels would return to their normal positions, and normal physics would resume.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe aware that parts can flex and twist during maneuvers. So if the parts twist a certain way into an overlapping position, that might explain the intermittent nature of your sudden loss of control.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-20T07:15:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn that case, the single gimballed engine would be the only thing trying to control the mass of the ship against any slight wobbles or incipient rotations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat, and the command pod (which has a small build-in SAS unit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVessels up to \\\u0027medium\\\u0027 size can be made stable with only a command pod and (one) ASAS.
