I think the devs just wanted alot of variety in there to keep us from getting bored. Also different orbit inclinations and gravities and atmospheres make this a ton of gameplay for an alpha product.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-09T00:15:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would guess that the issue you had is because most of Bop\u0027s surface is above the \u0022Automatically switch to surface velocity\u0022 altitude for an object 65 km in radius. So if you\u0027re still on orbital velocity on descent, yeah, the ground tend be moving significantly quickly beneath you, (more than 30 m/s at the equator. So yeah.) If manually landing on Bop, manually switch the speed indicator to Surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexL","CreatedById":32200,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-09T00:20:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMight I ask how one would do such a switch Maltesh?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-09T01:53:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EClick on the speed display on the navball and it will switch from Orbital to Surface speed, or vice versa.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpsterMan","CreatedById":32671,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-09T03:11:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022maltesh\u0022 data-cite=\u0022maltesh\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EClick on the speed display on the navball and it will switch from Orbital to Surface speed, or vice versa.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had NO IDEA that could be done!
