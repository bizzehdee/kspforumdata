Even if you rotated them 180 degrees, they\u0027d still fire in the same directions they do now when you use the translation keys (IJKL). \n\nBasically I don\u0027t think there is anything you can do (at this point) without changing your keymapping."},{"CreatedByName":"ShadowZone","CreatedById":112420,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T14:36:31Z","Content":"I am using arrow keys for rovers so wasd and ijkl are reserved purely for flight and RCS controls.
