I flew it a few days ago, but I realized something. That little rocket sure can\u0027t carry anything more than itself, can it? So its payload is virtually zero. What about that super giant rocket that you take to the Mun to make some Munar base? Its payload is probably 10 mass (what exactly is the unit for mass?). I have not made a formula yet, but in theory the more delta-v a rocket would have would affect the amount of payload it can carry. Right? I want some feedback on this, please. I can\u0027t really grip this because I am not a physicist or rocket scientist or anything like that, but I don\u0027t want to look stupid because it\u0027s an obvious fact that the more delta-v there is, the more payload you can carry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Altair1371","CreatedById":6754,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-10T23:53:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s not exactly true. I could have a highly fuel efficient ship that has a massive amount of delta-v, but not enough thrust to get out of the atmosphere. You need a thrust-to-weight ratio greater than 1, and 4000-5000 delta-v to enter LKO. That determines the payload you can carry up there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bluejayek","CreatedById":18471,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-11T00:18:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat you really want to look at is the delta-V delivered to a given payload. You could have a rocket that has 9000m/s delta-V, but the final stage that gets that speed is only a 0.8mass pod. Or you could have a rocket that also has 9000m/s delta-V but the final stage that gets that speed is 10 LFT-3200s with a mass of lots. Delta-V and payload mass are not the same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat governs this is the rocket equation: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta V = ISP * g * ln (m0/m1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere delta V is your delta V delivered to final stage/payload, ISP is the specific impulse in time units, g is standard gravity 9.8m/s, m0 is the initial mass of the rocket, and m1 is the final(payload) mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis equation governs a single stage rocket, and the final mass would include the mass of the engine and the dry mass of the tank. Multistage rockets are more complicated, so lets stick with this idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs stated above, that equation says that the more starting (payload \u002B fuel) mass you have, the higher your delta-V. However, this is a logarithmic relation, so after a certain point you hit serious diminishing returns. Below it is shown graphically what this looks like for an ISP of 400s, and a payload mass of 5. You can see that from 25 to 50 you get about an increase of 50% delta-V, but from 50 to 100 its closer to 25%. This is why you cant just continue building arbitrarily large rockets and get insanely far, there is a point where you start getting so little gain its not worth it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XKrQ1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XKrQ1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother way to look at the rocket equation is to re-arrange it for the payload mass, and assume delta-V is fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Em1 = m0 * e^-[delta-V/(g*ISP)]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis equation is LINEAR in m0. This means that if you want to launch a payload that is twice as big at the same delta-V, you only need a rocket that is twice as big on the launchpad. This is in contrast to getting a delta-V that is twice as large for a given payload, which can require much more then twice the fuel, as illustrated above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helped clear some of the confusion for you. Note again that this does not apply exactly to multistage rockets: For them you have to apply the rocket equation from start to end of each stage in sequence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and what Altair said is also quite true. When you look at launching from a planet, as opposed to just in empty space (which the above applies directly to), you have to take into account air resistance and gravity drag. This is why ion engines, despite being MUCH more efficient (read higher ISP) then chemical rockets, are not used off the launc pad: They do not have enough thrust to lift themselves or any payload off the launchpad. They are however very efficient once you get into orbit, and numerous space missions and sattelite utilize these thrusters for this purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-11T00:20:57Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2012 12:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Bluejayek\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-11T01:48:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethe more delta-v a rocket would have would affect the amount of payload it can carry \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EAs I understand it, it\u0027s the other way around.
