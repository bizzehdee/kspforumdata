However... What exactly doesn\u0027t need to be loaded? At any second, any part in the game might need to be referenced as it has come into physics range, and frankly the packing/unpacking lag is bad enough. For example, you might say that Moho doesn\u0027t need to be loaded in Jool\u0027s SOI, but then BAM-thanks to some OP fusion drive or something from a mod, you\u0027re on a 2-day trajectory towards Eve at high time warp, and there\u0027s exactly two seconds before Eve comes into view and you need those assets. Even if you dynamically load and unload assets based on trajectory (if your trajectory is going towards an ore base, load up the drill assets), then if you turn out to not be going there (say, a mistaken thruster firing knocked you out of orbit, then you just went through several seconds of loading for nothing), and the forum gets flooded with people going \u0022hurr my gme frze when i was ovr minmus dis gam sux i h8 u squad.\u0022 64bit is probably coming in the U5 update anyways.
