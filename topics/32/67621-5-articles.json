On the note of balance, I don\u0027t think \u0027balance\u0027 is quite as important as people are making it out to be either. I do believe it is in Squad\u0027s interest to maintain the main appeal of the game\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACdesign. Not because people like or dislike part X, but simply because people CAN like or dislike part X. Obsoleting parts would suck the very soul out of the game. We play to build, not to min-max like some MMO. Our successes have been because of our ingenuity and perseverance, not because we \u0027leveled up\u0027 until it was easy. In some ways, it\u0027s basically the MechJeb argument. I have absolutely no interest in anything done with MechJeb, period. Once I know MechJeb was involved, I cannot tune out fast enough. Some people feel differently. At its core, MechJeb handles makes KSP considerably easier. I think a lot of people would be happy, and roughly the same number completely disappointed if it were included in the base game. We\u0027d even get the same arguments, \u0022The cost of unlocking it makes, blah.\u0022 \u0022It\u0027s overpowered blah.\u0022 But I will throw my cards in the \u0027overpowered\u0027 hat simply because any part that reduces decision making at least has the potential to threaten the core of what made KSP interesting in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, because of this I feel obligated to speak on the sandbox issue as well. I hate you people. You ruin games. It\u0027s fun to prototype, it\u0027s especially nice when you are trying to do something mod related (like maintain one), and I\u0027m not against it existing. Sometimes I just want to build something. What drives me to arms is your steadfast belief the game should revolve around you. You get access to everything for free, there are no obstacles or requirements, and yet you are the first ones to complain when ANYTHING gets added to ANY game with a sandbox mode. \u0022Hazards that might damage my creations? NOOOOOOO!\u0022 You side with people who say absolutely inane, insane baloney like, \u0022I don\u0027t want to play survival, but I want survival features.\u0022 Developers waste so much time trying to make the sandbox players happy and you NEVER ARE. So next time you ask for your precious sandbox be balanced, keep this in mind:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESandbox has no balance. You get infinite everything for free. You have no limitations, the game doesn\u0027t force you to do anything. Therefore it is feasibly impossible to balance sandbox mode. Don\u0027t like the new engines? Don\u0027t use them. Don\u0027t like the balance? Change it. That\u0027s the point of sandbox, to craft your own experience. Stop trying to ruin career mode. Your version of the game is finished, and as a bonus you get everything career mode players get without restrictions or limits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an aside, text doesn\u0027t really allow me the full use of tone, body language and expression to marry sarcasm, humor and playful anger.
