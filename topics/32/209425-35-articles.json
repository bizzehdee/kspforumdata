The only difference might be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Sound. HDMI is capable of carrying sound, DVI is not.

HDMI is capable of some encryption techniques that DVI is not, so some Blu-Rays might only be played via HDMI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Resolution. DVI is typically supporting higher resolutions, but if you are using 1080P or 1200P both are equally fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would go with the on you got the cable for. Remember to buy online and cheap when you buy digital video cables, as an expensive cable will get you exactly the same picture.
