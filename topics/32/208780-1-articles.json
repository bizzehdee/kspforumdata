I\u0027ve never managed to get *ANYTHING* from Eve\u0027s surface to orbit. I was trying for just a probe core. Needed to get it back to Kerbin for a mod I was using (Progressive Colonization System). If I could get it into orbit, picking it up with a claw on another ship wouldn\u0027t have been hard. I saw someone else show how he did that trick, but he made crucial use of parts from the Breaking Ground DLC, which I don\u0027t have. I think I\u0027ve also seen other explanations of how to do it, but they seemed to predate a change in Eve\u0027s characteristics that made it harder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-03T00:52:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224150066\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208780\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221656568068\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002273725\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Superfluous J\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 6/30/2022 at 7:47 AM, Superfluous J said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore seriously, I think the one I laugh at the most because holy cow that\u0027d suck if I ever even thought about trying it, is \u0022Extract X units of ore from Eve and deliver it to Gilly\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight, I got that one.

Any experienced player can make a grand tour, but having to land the same part everywhere? this means using the same lander everywhere, or having some kind of modular lander where you always use the same command pod. The second requires a lot more creativity than a simple grand tour, and the first requires the capacity to make an eve \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003Essto\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-07-03T00:55:17Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2022 12:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by king of nowhere\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
