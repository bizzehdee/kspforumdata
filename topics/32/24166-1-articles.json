Starting small and working up is a really big help with SSTO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most likely problem with flipping for you is that your center of thrust is not inline with your center of mass. This is very important, as the thinner the atmosphere gets, the less your control surfaces will be able to counteract any misalignment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso be sure that your center of mass isn\u0027t changing too much throughout the flight. As it can more forward or backward of your center of lift, things can get a little chaotic. You want the center of mass to stay on or in front of your center of lift, and not deviate much from either position. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EListen to RoboRay about the action groups - that is key. You should also be able to throttle down with the jets and rockets both enabled to get more use of the jets, while still getting a positive velocity change. When you drop below about 50% throttle, then shut down the jets and power up those rockets!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you need some examples of successful SSTO craft, I can post a few. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flixxbeatz","CreatedById":29991,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-26T16:58:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022deadshot462\u0022 data-cite=\u0022deadshot462\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m no expert in SSTO\u0027s, but I think a large part of your problem is \u003Cstrong\u003Eyour plane\u0027s size is too big.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003Cem\u003Ebut \u003C/em\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/11214-The-K-Prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back?p=319011\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post319011\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ewhat about\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cem\u003E \u003C/em\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/11214-The-K-Prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back?p=311581\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post311581\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ethese things\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cem\u003E?\u003C/em\u003E they\u0027re big, yet \u003Cem\u003Ethey can fly.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I missing something here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I\u0027ve also made small spaceplanes, hoping that I\u0027ll make it finally.

You\u0027ll get a good idea for what size you can have before scale issues crop up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut to your specific design, there are five things that can explain what you\u0027re seeing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1\u0026gt; Your Center of Lift (CoL) is too far from the Center of Mass (CoM). Note that the CoM moves rearwards as the plane burns fuel, so the indicators in the SPH need to be tweaked a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; Your Center of Thrust (CoT) is too far above or below the CoM. It\u0027s easy to line them up horizontally, since your design is symmetric, but you should check vertically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----- Note that the stock landing gear are bugged. In the SPH and VAB they\u0027re treated as having their listed mass of 0.5 tons, but in-flight they actually have zero mass or drag. So, your CoM in actual flight will be higher than you thought it\u0027d be, especially if you\u0027ve got more than the minimum three wheels. When making sure that your CoT and CoM line up, remove all landing gear, and put it back on afterwards. (This only applies to stock gear; if you\u0027re using wheels from another mod, like modular multiwheels, then it works just fine.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3\u0026gt; Your drag is too much. The intakes are well forward of your CoM, so when they\u0027re applying a lot of drag, it\u0027d pull your nose away from your velocity vector. Since your nose will be pointing above your velocity for any spaceplane, this\u0027d pull the nose further up and lead to a flip. The solution here is something you should be doing already: create an action group, assign all but a couple intakes to it, and have the group toggle each. On takeoff you close most of the vents to minimize drag on the runway, and don\u0027t open them until you\u0027re above 10-12km. Once you reach the altitude where your engines need to shut off, close those vents again. (And you won\u0027t need them during landing.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4\u0026gt; It\u0027s not enough to just pitch up and turn ON the rockets, you also have to explicitly turn OFF the turbojets once they\u0027re almost out of air. Engines don\u0027t consume air in a perfectly symmetrical way, so if one set of engines runs out of air (and flames out) before the other, it\u0027ll put you into a spin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fifth possibility, related to the others, is that you just didn\u0027t put on an ASAS system. Or you did and it didn\u0027t have enough SAS to compensate for the imbalances in forces from the above factors. Or you went with the Avionics system, which never completely stops any imbalances in forces. (I use Avionics a lot, so I have to get used to continually pulling the nose up/down as the CoM shifts from fuel use.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d guess it\u0027s #2, personally. It\u0027s the big reason why the most successful SSTO designs are all coplanar, with everything linked horizontally. It\u0027s not that you can\u0027t make something bigger, but your CoT tends to get out of whack with the CoM and it\u0027s harder to line those two up perfectly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeekin","CreatedById":61185,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-27T01:08:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood news!
