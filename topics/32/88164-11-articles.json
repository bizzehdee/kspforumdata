According to wikipedia: \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u0022In general, Russian rockets are closer to the BDB concept than their US counterparts. US rockets tend to be built of the most modern, lightest materials available and to extremely tight tolerances, using often purpose-built custom parts, resulting in great expense. Many of them require very careful handling to avoid being damaged while on the ground. Russian rockets, on the other hand, tend to be built more heavily, and are easier to handle.

Their stats are crappy enough that they could be very deep-throtabble, restartable LH2/LOX engines with really low gimbal ranges, their low isp is just because of the stupidly short nozzles underexpanding and the throttling requirements (at least 95% difference) screwing the efficiency by requiring a large pressure range in the combustion chamber. The only glaringly wrong thing about them is the thrust-isp curve with atmosphere, and that could be changed with the aerodynamics overhaul.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut my suggestion comes more from this: a flat \u0022\u002B5 to reaction wheel power in the cockpits crewed by this kerbal\u0022 is easier to implement, and it will make your ship truly easier to pilot and land. Call me weird, but for me there is just no freaking way a kerbal piloting can make the fuel burn at a higher temperature or pressure for a given throttle setting, while on the other hand, the idea Jeb has an easier time keeping the ship pointing at the maneuver marker during a burn, or the retrograde velocity marker during a landing, is easier to stomach. It will still save fuel, mind you, but because I find easier to pilot the ship that is supposed to be piloted by the good pilot. And nobody will scream at you because they can\u0027t reproduce the performance without that pilot when you post the file up. I stand by it, and the multitude of comments about thrust, isp, physics taking exceptions, and ship exchanges being affected by experience seems to avail my opinion.
