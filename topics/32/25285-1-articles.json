I\u0027ve suddenly ran into a problem where each and every rocket (Including the default rockets) I launch causes the LSE\u0027s to explode once I release them and engage the engines. I\u0027ve always had the engines and LSE\u0027s release in the same first stage with no problems before. I recently installed the Lazor system for the docking CAM but that is the only mod I put in recently and it seems rigt after that I now have this problem. This is causing my heavy rockets to wobble baddly in the first few meters and only my extremly solid builds survive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Any ideas how to fix?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T16:32:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELazor mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T16:36:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour only option at the moment is to remove the mod.
