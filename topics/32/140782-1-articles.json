\u00A0Because the stock system will certainly set the ranges of the various existing stock antennae to something other than what they have in either RT or AR, will rely on new stock antenna parts for long-range relays, and will want to use a different set-up of those relays than either mod. \u00A0Thus, even those who currently use RT or AR will likely lose contact with at least some of their stuff. \u00A0So, with this disaster-in-the-making looming on the horizon, it seems pointless to try to get anything started until we know what we\u0027re dealing with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-31T16:27:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, that\u0027s the poll I love.
