At distance, the engine\u0027s lighting excels. In motion, KSP is fully able to sell the majesty and awe of space exploration.\n\u003E It\u0027s a reminder: we did that. On the back of science, yearning and, yes, a nearly apocalyptic competition between two superpowers, we strapped people into giant combustible machines and shot them out of our planet. We did that, and it was amazing. Kerbal Space Program is . . . brilliant because it holds a mirror up to one of humanity\u0027s greatest achievements, and only does so when you have the greatest possible appreciation for the skill, dedication and courage involved. It\u0027s a rare and wonderful game, and deserves the strongest possible recommendation.\n\nYeah, that sums it up for me.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T20:08:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 08:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mr Shifty**"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T19:11:35Z","Content":"This could be combined with [this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118058-Media-feedback-reviews-on-KSP-1-0)."},{"CreatedByName":"Ikaneko","CreatedById":109214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T19:13:52Z","Content":"I think SQUAD\u0027s just won PC Gamer.
