(my understanding is that cargo will travel there seperately; my original version did have a rover)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nShould the booster be using the 3.5m parts (Saturn/Nova class) or 2.5m? (Unable to derive anything, since all they really said is \u0022large booster\u0022. I used 3.5 in my original version)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhich one is more realistic: using\u00A0Solid Booster, Liquid Booster, or no Booster? (This one is literally a \u0022use of liquid and/or solid booster)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHow many people does it carry in total? (My version can carry 6, but original plan is 3?)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIs having nuclear battery realistic? (That\u0027s what my original version used)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI do realized that lunex is mostly just on paper, but I do want to get the replica version done well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-24T19:37:37Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2016 07:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Jestersage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
