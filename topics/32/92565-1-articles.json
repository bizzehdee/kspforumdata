My guess is yes they will release it in the beta phase. This next patch concludes all of the groundwork IIRC for the code being ready to just add in more assets. I think once the final groundwork is placed is when we will hopefully see an influx of assets added. Whether or not the groundwork is complete for the resource refueling system will be complete by 0.90 is beyond me, but we can only hope. At that point, we will see parts, planets, moons, new kerbals both male and female, and more asteroids, maybe even a belt or two. I believe the planets will be not the first thing worked on post 0.90, but they will be discussed hopefully by squad by the end of the first or second quarter next year. Heck, they may even give us a rough road map as a second Christmas present to go with the 0.90 update. I don\u0027t see why we wouldn\u0027t have two or even three gas giants by the time 1.0 releases......mmmmmmm 1.0...... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Linear","CreatedById":26619,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T22:11:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome.
