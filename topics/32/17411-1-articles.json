I tought,woulent it be cool when you build the craft to be able to double click on where it says 1,2,4 ect for the stage name\u0027s and be able to rename them? such as \u0022Shoot seperation\u0022 Booster ignition\u0022 ect ect. Just an idea! I\u0027m sorry if it\u0027s ben brought up before but it\u0027s 1 of the things,I think wouldbe awesome for a futur Version release \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"silent_prtoagonist","CreatedById":1927,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-21T11:41:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis has been suggested a few times, but I think it\u0027s worth repeating. At some point there\u0027s supposed to be a rework of the staging system, which might include something like this. My guess is that rework will come with docking, whenever that get\u0027s implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dermeister","CreatedById":41487,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-21T11:42:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds good \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Martonaut","CreatedById":26366,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-21T11:59:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eme likes the idea\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Millst0ne MK II","CreatedById":13384,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-21T12:06:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMe like!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMe want!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad add!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Karppikala","CreatedById":2751,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-21T12:38:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would be really useful!
