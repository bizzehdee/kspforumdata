In sandbox all you can do is land a base, expand on it, land a rover, land a refinery, (depending on the planet), land a SSTO, and land a boat. Then you can drive around but after seeing the sights there\u0027s NOTHING to do. It is one thing I dislike about KSP vs reality. A lack of things to do aside from the personal achievement aspect. I\u0027d like to see surface activities beyond \u0022soil samples\u0022 and such. Even in career mode all you do is land a base to X spects, maybe expand and also use it launch various side activities such as go to X location and do X experiment. Its lacking. In reality, the Apollo astronauts had hours worth of things to do, heck, I could try to do EVERYTHING POSSIBLE to REPLICATE an Apollo mission and yet ONE of they\u0027re EVAs are longer than my entire mission. It\u0027s sad!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy immediate fix would be to add KIS/KAS or some system alike it. Since instead of launching everything, I can assemble it in space or orbit. Moreover, it would be far more useful for using the cargo bays. Since I can launch a module base for a station, then send kerbals over to the cargo vehicle, collect the parts, install them and such. That would take a while, and be closer to a real life EVA. Ofc, I would also suggest adding failure mechanics. So carrying spare parts would also be desirable and it would again expand on the KIS/KAS mechanic. I can directly reference the Skylab solar panel deployment failure which required an EVA to help fix it. Then on the same mission they had to deploy a blanket to absorb heat due to a radiator failure. Both of which required EVAs, and required taking a part from one place to another. All within the range of KIS/KAS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also like to mention the Apollo 12 EVA to collect parts from the surveyor space probe. Granted, this can already be practiced by landing a probe, collecting science then awaiting a crew. Then I\u0027d like to ALSO mention how other Apollo missions deployed various probes and devices on the lunar surface for research, but they weren\u0027t in a cargo bay, some of them were carried within the LM itself. So being able to carry and deploy satellites held within parts would be nice. On the same missions, the astronauts would be seen tossing hand held satellites into lunar orbit AGAIN expanding on this mechanic!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is all realistic, and has basis within space and it also adds to the game mechanics.

I agree clouds and geological events would be great to have, with some sort of alarm/warning system. For instance, players should be able to see which volcanoes are active in the map view and, within a stockified KAC, an alarm triggers if one of them is about to erupt. You can ignore, evacuate the surrounding area if you have a base, or send a rover or lander to investigate \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Franklin","CreatedById":89718,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T21:57:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI should correct myself: getting there the first time or two is fun.

The contract system could be more adaptable so that you can get some contract choices while on the surface, I think that could be a fun aspect, even if they are more on the simple side. I\u0027m optimistic about the 1.1\u002B releases however because it will allow Squad more access to making a bigger game thanks to the Unity upgrade.

Also, space travel historically has a intrinsic connection with aviation. Just ask yourself what all the Mercury and Gemini astronauts have in common... All (or at least most) were test pilots.
