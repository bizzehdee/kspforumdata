Too bad the mod is making my game do all weird kind of things, so I decided to put the mod aside and wait for some other versions. In the meantime, the only way to get a little more visual is to crank up the gamma but there is no in game way of doing that. I really hope that someday a night cam will be officially integrated, or the the very least: some brightness settings is the options menu.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tokay Gris","CreatedById":58301,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T12:44:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust Murphy striking again, I guess....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Iren","CreatedById":58417,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T12:45:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI kind of got used to dock only by looking at the pink mark on the navball.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tokay Gris","CreatedById":58301,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T12:51:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo do I.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAround Kerbin, I don\u0027t care about the attitude of the ships...
