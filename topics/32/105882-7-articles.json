First post ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) This post made me curious about KSP 0.9 vs 1.0 ascent profiles compared to the Skylon hypothetical ascent profile provided by Reaction Engines. I felt that Exclipse was actually mistaken, and that 1.0 was actually closer to the Skylon model. So I tested it out!\n\nLike the Skylon graph, the last point is roughly where I cut off the main engine, before the orbital insertion burn. Skylon uses OMS engines to circularize it\u0027s orbit, and both of these SSTO\u0027s carry OMS engines because of that. Probably not the most efficient design, but it works! Here are the results:\n\n**KSP 0.9**\n\nMass: 18.3t\n\nEngines: 2 Rapier engines, 2 OMS engines.\n\n0.9 ascent was fairly traditional. 45 degree climb, leveling off between 10-20k to build up to about 1300m/s before kicking up to 45 degrees again between 20-25k to raise the apoapsis to about 75k. Circularized to a 85x85 km Orbit, with plenty of deltaV to spare. \n\n![EJuarLml.png](http://i.imgur.com/EJuarLml.png)\n\n![oD3l036.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/oD3l036.jpg)\n\n**KSP 1.0**\n\nMass: 26.6t\n\nEngines: 2 Rapier engines, 4 OMS engines\n\nFor 1.0 my strategy was to either maintain or increase airspeed. Took off at about a 20 degree angle, lowering my climb to about 10 degrees to maintain airspeed when i hit the drag wall at Mach 1. Stayed at about 10 degrees until I started picking up speed past Mach 1 at about 5km altitude. At about 10km altitude speed started coming on fast and I started pitching up to about 30 degrees off horizon going 540m/s. Slowly pitch down in a gravity turn to about 25 degrees (Velocity vector is at 20 degrees, so 5 degree AoA) at 24km altitude and 915m/s surface speed. At this point Rapier jet mode is dying out, so I switched to rocket mode. I try to stay close to the velocity vector (5-15 degree AoA) to reduce airspeed loss due to drag, until main engine cutoff at about 45km. I forgot to take a point at main engine cut off, so that isn\u0027t on the graph below, unfortunately! Ran out of main engine fuel before the end of the circularization burn, but finished it with the OMS engines with about 200m/s deltaV to spare, I\u0027d estimate.\n\nA further note, reentry without airbrake spam is actually pretty straightforward with this thing! I aimed for a 40km periapsis, and came down pitched about 45 degrees. At 40-35km I started S-turning like mad while keeping the nose as high as possible, using the control surfaces and the torque wheel. By 20km airspeed was already down to about 600m/s! Then, simply glided it down, landing it at about 65m/s using wing mounted spoilers to slow me down towards the end, and the drogue chute to slow me down faster while on the ground.\n\n![2qK57sFl.png](http://i.imgur.com/2qK57sFl.png)\n\n![Dw9BldRl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Dw9BldRl.jpg)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTo me at least, 1.0 is much closer to Skylon. But i also think different craft might have different ascent profiles, based on mass, lift, drag, thrust, etc. EDIT: It\u0027s also notable how much quicker it is to get in to orbit now. In 0.9 it took nearly twice as long to get to the main engine cutoff point!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T05:05:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 05:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Binho**\n  \nForgot to mention something"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T05:00:12Z","Content":"\u002Brep for graphs!\n\nI like graphs."},{"CreatedByName":"CptRichardson","CreatedById":269,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T05:02:26Z","Content":"Dude...

Now I\u0027m not afraid to add another pair of elevons, or to toss on a set of canards.\n\nI suppose the best way to think of 1.0 is this: Take everything you learned from the past several revisions of KSP, and throw it all away.

Haven\u0027t done a single-stage rocket, but the last thing I did was trying to get to orbit using nothing but solid rocket boosters. Nearly managed it. Couldn\u0027t quite tweak the fuel load for the last handful of sepratrons, nor the thrust for some of the old RT-10\u0027s to be quite right. Always ended up either a few hundred delta-V short, or a few hundred delta-V over. Still was a fun experiment.\n\nI actually have been having more fun in 1.0 Stock than I\u0027ve had in any previous Stock version. Normally after a day or two, I put KSP down until the mods rain in, then I stuff as many as I can into the poor game and make it work.
