A real shuttles uses a mix of SRBs and the main engines to get into orbit and even then it doesn\u0026#39;t use them for the entire mission. Once in or near orbit the shuttle uses its OMS engines which in KSP standards are monopropellant engines.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI suggest removing that silly tank on your tail fin and add SRBs for early thrust. I also suggest maybe upgrading to mk3... Might work better for you since the vectors were made for the intention of use on the mk3. Yes I know that the 2.5m are small in comparison to the mk3 parts, but they still work. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe SRBs should provide initial thrust in the beginning, but after 100m/s you will have enough speed to stabilize. As the SRBs burn out your TWR of the vectors become that much more important. The gimbal comes into play when your SRBs are gone and you need to adjust for the moving CoM in your ET. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI can explain further but this should be enough for now.

And I\u0026#39;m still impressed by how big an issue that scaling Kerbin down by a factor of 10 really is (and how Squad makes it seamless). I figured they left out an obvious fix for jets/turbofans (other than the issue of being ripped to shreds once they exceed maximum air velocity), because spaceplanes are cool and fun to make, but the problems appear deeper than that.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe answer why *stock* KSP makes it easier to fly spaceplanes than shuttles is that jet engines can reach nearly orbital velocity on Kerbin, but not Earth. The reason that jet engines are not scaled down is that they would need to be scaled down by a factor of 10 or so, and then wouldn\u0026#39;t lift off at all (I\u0026#39;m assuming that the throttle is linear to thrust: swapping weasly for jumbo jets on the mallard *just* barely got the plane off the runway, but left me scrambling for every m/s for the next several kms, and never seemed to get above 100m/s *or* 50m of altitude). The scaling KSP uses to make orbiting easier and faster has some weird side effects, and one of them is that spaceplanes are easy. Shuttles, on the other hand don\u0026#39;t make much more sense on Kerbin than they did on Earth (even though refurbishing the whole thing isn\u0026#39;t required).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhy a factor of 10? My understanding is that air resistance at minimal speeds is linear. Once you hit turbulence (bicycle speeds) it goes quadratic. Over the speed of sound it goes to cubic powers. So to halve the speed you need to lower the power by a factor of eight (rounded to 10, and half probably isn\u0026#39;t nearly enough). While this is suspiciously similar to horsepower vs. speed on wheels, it gets there by different means.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n* For Soviet values of shuttle, I think it was hauled into space by liquid boosters. The shuttle\u0026#39;s on-board engines (presumably had some if only for circularization), were even less important.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T22:37:40Z","Content":"\nThe STS orbiter design is just about the most challenging thing you can make in KSP, but it *can* be done.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[spoiler=Flight of the Kolumbia]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g13/GoSlash27/KSP/Shuttle%20Kolumbia/Kolumbia3_zpsoqjhrbzn.jpg[/img]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g13/GoSlash27/KSP/Shuttle%20Kolumbia/Kolumbia4_zpsgi3jggmx.jpg[/img]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g13/GoSlash27/KSP/Shuttle%20Kolumbia/Kolumbia5_zpsfln9bmvl.jpg[/img]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g13/GoSlash27/KSP/Shuttle%20Kolumbia/Kolumbia6_zps3qoaqaq9.jpg[/img]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g13/GoSlash27/KSP/Shuttle%20Kolumbia/Kolumbia1_zps93bloi7l.jpg[/img]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/spoiler]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;ve been making stock shuttle replicas since KSP 1.0, and it\u0026#39;s never gotten any easier.
