Afterward, I took a moment to learn the part\u0027s behaviors. If I wanted the port side facing outward, I place it, then zoom in real quick to ensure the ring is facing outward. If I want the port facing inward, I know that it will (for some reason) usually jump to mounting on the body, but if I pull it back a tad, it will \u0022click\u0022 back to another node (representing the ring).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never had issues with badly-placed ports after taking the time to learn how it behaves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame thing with the other docking ports. If they aren\u0027t in an orientation that\u0027s ready to slap on, they will likely not jump in place when I bring them near, so I rotate them accordingly first. If a docking port starts flipping around and rotating madly around a point instead of clicking in place, I change my view so that I\u0027m looking at the mount point almost edge-on, with no ship geometry behind it, and then it will click in when I bring it near.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that said, I agree that it should be a relatively minor thing to add some kind of visual cue on the Sr port\u0027s markings to show \u0022this side up\u0022. The textures on the main faces are useful for this, but are just similar enough to cause a bit of confusion. In this aspect, even the other ports have a bit of an issue (at least for me). One thing that drives me batty is having a docking port on the nose of a ship. If I select \u0022Control From Here\u0022, the navball flips 180 on a roll. I placed it right-side-out alright, but it\u0027s upside down! D\u0027oh! The only cue I have for placing it correctly in that aspect is the little handle that\u0027s part of the texture inside the port\u0027s docking face. Unfortunately I can never seem to remember whether that handle needs to go up or down, unless I launch and test it first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I decided I\u0027d try to modify the textures a bit to make them a bit more helpful, without being blatant enough to break the visual style they already have. Sadly, the format these textures are in makes it rather difficult to do, even with the existence of a wiki post that describes how to convert .mbm textures. Despite multiple attempts, I can\u0027t seem to get anything out that looks accurate enough to attempt editing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadweasel","CreatedById":23123,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T17:10:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESheesh...
