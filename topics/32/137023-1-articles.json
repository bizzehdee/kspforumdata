My name is Bob Kerman, and I died a year ago. I\u0027m not dead currently, but I did die. Smashed into the mun, nothing left. Rather painful. After that there was... I was... this place... it seemed, so, beautiful. It seemed like kerbin at first, but on later inspection, it seemed to have some of the aspects of all the other planets and moons. Lakes of explodium seemed to dot the surface in some places. The sand in the deserts was, red, duna sand. The poles were green and minty, like minmus. Rocky bits of munar surface appeared in the mountains. It was paradise. I lived there for 50 days with Jeb and Bill, who had died at the same time as I did. At the end of those fifty days, lightning struck all around me, and I closed my eyes. When I opened them, I was lying on an operating table at the KSC. There was no way they could\u0027ve retrieved my body for reainmation, they must have... [unintelligible]... flesh samples...[unintelligible]. But in time, everything went back to normal, just as it was before the accident. I almost thought it was a bad dream, but there was still the missing time to account for. I knew that my suspicions were correct when an orbiter detected a crater with the debris of our craft inside. I feel very... nervous about the fact that KSC can just make a new me if I die, but Jeb seems to like it. He\u0027s even more fearless than he was before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galileo","CreatedById":150430,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-15T19:44:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/152665-rocketsquid/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022152665\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/152665-rocketsquid/\u0022\u003E@RocketSquid\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0I would highly recommend the movie \u0022Moon\u0022 with Sam Rockwell to you if you haven\u0027t already seen it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-15T20:19:41Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2016 08:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Berlin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HMIC","CreatedById":138981,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-15T20:18:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello, my name is Dabney Kerman and I\u0027m curently in minmus. \u00A0It\u0022s been 6 years, 3 months 18 days since I left kerbin.
