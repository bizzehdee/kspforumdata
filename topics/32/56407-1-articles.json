In your blog, you said that resource mining has been shelved. What does this mean? How is this different from \u0027on the back burner,\u0027 \u0027in the wings,\u0027 or other such positional statements made about various aspects of the game at different times? Is it cancelled, and is it cancelled completely? You\u0027ve been very careful, I\u0027ve noticed, to consistently refer to it as \u0027the old resource-mining.\u0027 Before we make assumptions, does this mean that there is some sort of resources mechanic, of SOME type, still planned?

While we share a lot in common with MMO-style development processes, it is different in that the MMO is essentially complete from the start and receives new updates to extend content for players who have done everything. The Early Access game is still incomplete and must devote development time to adding features that might not seem important to experienced players, but make it easier to be picked up by new players, or make the overall game experience more complete, even if it doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t make it more lengthy. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was very heated debate over the weekend on just what you guys \u0027must\u0027 do.
