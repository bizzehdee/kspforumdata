For one thing, I imagine that kerbals would only fly missions you specify (like mechjeb without the \u0022cheaty\u0022 feeling some people get about it), but based on crew stats so that more trained/talented (read: more expensive) kerbals fly better and are less likely to crash than their less qualified comrades.
