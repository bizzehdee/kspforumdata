The formula to keep relatively correct mass by size is Every time you double the size (aka 1,2,4,8,16) You would multiply the mass (150) by 8.. so if you double the size, the mass = 1200 if you double it again (rescale 4) then you multiply it again by 8. I currently have mine set to rescaleFactor = 4 mass = 9600. makes for an interesting asteroid encounter.. lol.. this of-course is supposedly still not the correct mass, as from what I understand, the asteroids basically have the density of Polystyrene to begin with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
