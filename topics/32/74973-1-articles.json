The 32-Bit/4GB of KSP on Windows of course applies only to KSP itself, it doesn\u0027t care about total RAM usage. Total RAM usage is only limited by how much you have physically installed. And of course OS/Motherboard limitations, but I\u0027m assuming you knew what you were doing when upgrading your PC, and you shouldn\u0027t be able to hit Windows 7\u0027s RAM cap with a regular PC.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkeh","CreatedById":72122,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-13T22:36:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, so maybe I am too stupid for the internet, unsurprisingly I am still confused.
