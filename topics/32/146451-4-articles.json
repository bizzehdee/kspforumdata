Perhaps they were not so bad several iterations ago when they were first added to the game, but assigning one or two of their best aircraft design staff members to: (a) design three to seven (one total beginner plane, that uses the lowest tier techs; one intermediate, one advanced, additional at each level and/or a spaceplane). (b) do a Youtube or three in which they walk the viewer through how these models are designed and why, basically use them as an example of how to effectively design a really good basic plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-25T14:10:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222728785\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022146451\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221472089815\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298495\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pincushionman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, pincushionman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason is twofold, really.

This remains the case for as long as the pilot likes, and can be left completely alone until the rocket is in vacuum, at which point there\u0027s only the force of gravity to worry about, and due to the fundamental physics of attaining orbit (gravity turns etc) is no longer really a resistance force, just a limiting factor (you have \u003Cem\u003Ex\u003C/em\u003E time to raise periapsis above 70km). Going up fast enough that you don\u0027t fall down again is mostly a case of going in a straight/radial line a lot and a perpendicular/horizontal line a little, and the more up you go the less across you need to go for the same result. Even a total noob (given enough time) should be able to figure out how to go way way up and then have a load of time to figure out they need to go across to miss the planet on the way down. Inefficient, but easy.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA plane is fundamentally more complicated. First of all drag and gravity are at 90 degrees to each other. Second, rather than just having an engine that pushes them in a straight line, they also have wings, which take some of the forward thrust of the engine and turn it into perpendicular \u0027thrust\u0027 (lift), and extra drag. So now the vehicle isn\u0027t just opposing two resistances that are aligned, it\u0027s opposing 2 perpendicular forces using two perpendicular forces, one of which is a variable product of the other.
