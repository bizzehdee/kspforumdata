Unfortunately the process can\u0027t be reversed by the looks of it. When staged they have added ballast but if you were to shutdown they do not revert and the extra ballast is permanent. That means \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E vessels would have to much ballast if they were to refill. Although I haven\u0027t tried if you could re-dock vectors to the sub and re-stage them would be a workaround, maybe someone else will see before I do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis trick is a very good thing since using jet engines underwater you will loose fuel mass and the ship becomes more buoyant. While vectors would sink by themselves anyhow you could add them to adapters or on the sides. The vector shrouds look submarine like anyhow, are very aero/hydrodynamic and you could stage them in sequence to add ballast as you burn off fuel. Of course you\u0027ll have to place them so that they re-balance evenly.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere are other ways to alternate buoyancies by close/opening cargo bays. If a cargo bay content is buoyant it will be calculated when the cargo bays are open while open cargo bays themselves are more buoyant when open. You\u0027d think they\u0027d fill with water and would therefore sink, silly developers lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing vectors would be better weight wise since they\u0027d sink by themselves anyhow and using cargo bays you need more weight to submerge so the overal weight of your sub will be higher (that\u0027s less speed and less fuel economy)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EInflatable airlock\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain I have a Mk1 cockpit with 2 Vectors but 2 on one end with 3 inflatable airlocks at the top.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.

On the other hand you can toggle airlocks to increase/decrease ballast.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA staged Vector may not be as heavy in water as a Ore tank Mass to Mass but you can clip, stack and form factor to 1.25m only for potentially faster more aerodynamic submarines.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBecause the effect of a airlock mass to mass and per magnitude of effect using a single airlock you could combine the effect of both to fine tune ballast.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf your intention is to use the airlock fine tuning could be easier if the mass of the Sub is heavier. Try to distribute them evenly for balance.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPut the airlocks on action groups to tune the effect as you burn of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may be able to stuff a cargo bay with ore/vector ballast and put the airlocks inside to decrease drag for faster speeds and have free ballast control.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHappy diving \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-03-30T12:56:46Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2019 12:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Aeroboi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aeroboi","CreatedById":186653,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-30T13:19:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EUpdate!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBest solution for hydrodynamics.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E1.

It doesn\u0027t say \u0022diver\u0022 terless for no reason... \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThis is weird because these tubes have these air scoops sticking out which would increase resistance in water one would presume. Maybe the scoops are scales like on a actual sea animal, who knows...\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt seems the Pre-cooler and engine nacelle do slightly worse. The other added benefit is that the Diverterless has the most air intake at low speed, and as we all know, subs are slower so it\u0027s the best choice to get the most intake air underwater of all the available intakes. AFAIK you need one per jet engine but you need forward speed for the intakes to function properly so the Sub shouldn\u0027t sink to fast at negative velocity to potentiate the effect of a air intake underwater.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cu\u003E2.

The most Hydrodynamic way of doing things known and ducumented is to just stack the large ore tank and make the front and aft pointy using engine plates, adapters and proper nosecones.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHaving tested I could never go much faster then ~50m/s underwater.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe large ore tanks have these curves around them and by the looks of it isn\u0027t the most dynamic shape of what might be possible, then again, what else is there to sink that is 1.25m or 2.5m wide apart from the other ore tanks and vector engines?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, nothing really. However, I tested the submergeability of several parts and found out that the SM-25 Service module (which is buoyant) doesn\u0027t require that much added weight in order to submerge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s best about this Making history part is that everything within the shroud is protected from drag.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe other benefit is that it seems to be much more Hydrodynamic when submerged then stacking the large ore tanks together.

IIRC the above Sub does 66 m/s max instead of 62 m/s underwater.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Vector is slightly more negatively buoyant. The radial holding tank is the heaviest of the ore tanks. Plus points are that they are small and can be dragged inside any cargo container to shift the heavier then water mass. The 1.25m service bay is small and the radial holding tank just fits in to create small lightweight vessels that are hydrodynamic.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe vector has to be shrouded or contained in a cargo bay as it suffers drag underwater more so then a service bay.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Mk2 and Mk3 cargo bays does also shield the content like in the atmosphere. In a way water is just air but heavier/soupier. But for some reason opening the doors creates a buoyant effect. The same with one landing leg and inflatable heatshield.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the bottom line is that the service bay contains the mass (buoyant or negatively buoyant) and yes it also shields from drag. That\u0027s for the SM-25, 1.25m and 2.5m service bays (The latter though is quite buoyant)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also create my slightly negatively buoyant.
