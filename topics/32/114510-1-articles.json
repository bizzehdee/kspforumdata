The plane broke apart, only Jeb\u0027s cockpit survived. Jeb looked back but saw no remains, so he walked 100 meters, did his survey, then reboarded his cockpit to recover the craft. Bob was dead. I checked the VAB, sure-enough, no scientist. I was saddened, but figured \u0027hey these things happen\u0027. Then, about 8 missions later, I\u0027m filling out a ship\u0027s crew and- hey, where\u0027d you come from Bob? Orange-suit Bob was back. So what happened? Did the game re-spawn him, or did he really not die and it took him days to walk back after I recovered Jeb?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Anomalous burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI launched a rocket with cross feed, and noticed that 2 engines that should have had identical piping and stock were not bleeding down the fuel stocks at the same rate. Before the stage could be seperated I had to wait an extra 3 or 4 seconds for the 2nd liquid fuel booster to burn out, and then make a flight correction to recover the ball. So, does this ever \u0022happen\u0022 in the game, that odd things like this pop-up, or do you think that if I tore down the rocket stage by stage I would find an engineering error of some kind to blame?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T03:22:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) Kerbals respawn after a while at lower difficulties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Probably there\u0027s something wonky in how the stages are laid out.

These issues are partially resolved with jet engines, as they now drain fuel equally from all tanks to ensure correct CG positioning. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor rockets, keep in mind usually they drain \u0022top down\u0022 or for spaceplanes, front to back. That means the top/front tank will drain first. If you have external tanks or side tanks, the outermost tanks will drain first followed by the center core. Sometimes during heavy use of symmetry or undo/redo in assembly mode, the fuel feed sequence may get corrupted somehow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout rebuilding the whole craft, I have remedied this in the past by placing cross-feed fuel lines between the affected tanks (meaning, allow fuel to flow both ways), or removing all the fuel lines and re-doing the fuel lines. Simple designs and fuel flow layouts is my best bet of avoiding such issues. Ensure you do a ground-fire test to ensure everything is working right before an actual flight! It\u0027s difficult to troubleshoot a solution when it happens in the stratosphere at Mach 3.5...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs your issue is occuring on a set of liquid fuel boosters, do ensure both engine thrust values are set the same, and that the fuel supply for both sets of engines / tanks are isolated for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the issue persists, there are mods that allow you to override fuel flow sequence and manually balance fuel tanks.
