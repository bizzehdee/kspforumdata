Some of them ask you to do EVERYTHING (including build the ships) in stock. Others just state that the ship needs stock parts. This means to me that in the first case, KER or MechJeb in the VAB at ALL is bad. I\u0027d even not build a ship using those tools and then copy the ship in the unmodded game, as that breaks the spirit of the challenge if not the actual wording. In the second case, using tools to help build your ships is fine as the challenge only asked that it work in stock, not be built without the benefit of the useful tools these mods provide.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd of course in any case if you\u0027re not sure, ask. Most challengers know if a mod would break the spirit of their challenge, and your asking them to clarify will at worst let you know if you want to try the challenge, and at best it will prod them to make their OP more clear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
