The back plate to make the ports fit to the case will be supplied with the motherboard, so almost any board should fit in any case - within reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A case often has top/front ports. Check whether your specific motherboard has headers for the ports your case has and those that you want to use. Most recent motherboards will have USB2 and USB3 headers, so using those ports on a case should not be a problem. eSATA, Firewire, et cetera depends on the motherboard. Be sure to check out where the headers are located on the motherboard, as sometimes they are stuffed away in awkward places.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T00:51:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am planning some upgrades to my rig soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent set up:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMotherboard: Foxconn H77MXV-D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERAM: 8gb DDR3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECPU: i7 3770 - with a cooler master hyper 212 EVO cpu fan\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVideocard: Nvidia GTX 660\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPower supply: Cooler master 550watt supply\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI plan on adding more RAM, just because my motherboard can handle it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I need advice on is the videocard.
