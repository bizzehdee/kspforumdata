Why? I had a contract with that altitude and 16.5 and 17.5 listed altitudes to do a temp scan. I only had the basic jet engine available and was determined this mission would be completed by a plane with those engines.\n\nAfter many failed attempts first trying light and fast to operate push up to those altitudes, then trying the \u0022Moar Boosters\u0022 approach, I was using more jets, since losing thrust was the main issue at altitudes above 10k. The more engines worked for very little altitude gains. I spent roughly 15 hours trying to come up with a pure jet design, I would see very slight improvements with each attempt then I eventually seemed to hit a wall.\n\nI finally decided a pure jet plane for this contract was not feasiable and decided to go with an jet/rocket hybrid. Jet engines would carry me to the target area and to around 13k and the rocket engine would take me the rest. I spent roughly 4-5 hours designing a plane that would remain stable when the rocket fired at both high and low altitudes, stable in normal flight, capable of rough terrain landings, able to hit Mach I with the jet engines alone, enough fuel capacity to use the rockets multiple times and leave enough fuel to return to the KSC and the usual stuff.\n\nI had my design tested and proofed then took off to head to the first target area to get the tempature scan. Nearing the area I double check the altitude I need to reach to meet the mission criteria and realized I was already at the target altitude. The contract requirments was to be at any altitude below what was listed.\n\nThe good news I now have a design standing by in case any missions popup requiring a plane capable of long range flight and multiple ascents to altitudes around 22k or capable of suborbital flight.\n\nPS: I am not being sarcastic in the title of this thread. really enjoyed the design challenges, failures requiring to go back to the drawing board and it was fun trying and eventual coming up with something close to what was originally conceived."},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T20:08:46Z","Content":"I\u0027m having trouble with a contract testing the basic jet at 25,000m going 300m/s.\n\nThat\u0027s...

Highest I got on the basic jets alone was around 13-14k. I managed 15K once with a very light overpowered plane but the problem was it was somewhat short ranged and had stability issues because of speed. I am sure someone can exceed those heights, really the first time I am spending any meaningful time on planes for atmospheric flight. Usually I am focused on rockets."}]}
