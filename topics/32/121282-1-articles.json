I have noticed that if you have multiple strings of 2 (or more) physicsless parts connected, it does seem to have a larger impact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never paid much attention to this because it\u0027s rare that I would connect multiple phyiscless parts together without any normal physics parts in the middle, but for a specific build I\u0027m doing at the moment it\u0027s become significant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else noticed this?

So attaching multiple of them in sequence, and then to a \u0027physics\u0027d\u0027 part is resulting in a whole bunch of extra calculations applied to that part every second.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-21T06:29:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think that\u0027s the reason, this effect has been around since... well... since I started playing pretty much.

Also, I\u0027ve seen it stated elsewhere on the forum that when physicsless parts are chained to other physicsless parts, the physical properties are lost instead of being transferred up the chain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEg: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECubic octagonal strut connected to fuel tank: Mass and drag of strut added to fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut cubic octagonal strut connected to second cubic octagonal strut connected to fuel tank?
