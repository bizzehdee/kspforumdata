By careful burns at apoapsis you might get it done without spending much dv (but spending a lot of time warp). If you\u0027re lucky you may even brake by gravity slingshot off something else, such as Eve. After you enter Kerbin\u0027s SOI at reasonable speed which will allow you to stay withing the SOI after aerobrake, you can use series of shallow aerobrakes in the atmosphere to get on low orbit and then perhaps try to aerobrake and land from there.

I was able to bring a whole transfer stage down safely and intact with only the batteries and solar panels on the side exploding from a Minmus orbit. If your speed just slings you outsystem after a minor aerobrake you can use that 800m/s Delta V at the AP to reduce orbit for another aerobrake with the least delta V expended, so you can do it several times if needed.
