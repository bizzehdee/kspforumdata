Yeah, I remember all there was available to aid in landing was ASAS (which still required some control), SAS (if you want controlable SAS), or completely manual. I also remember needing to use winglets to land if depending only on stock parts (which made it very tricky if untrained unless you perform the necessary training).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully in the near future, we will be able to create special landers that act as payload to the point we can return to (or least bring near) the actual rocket (provided you know how to bring it up close to the rocket). With that in mind, it could enable even more interesting training since it is a way to learn how to dock (which is not built-in yet). One of the tasks that would need to be done is to utilize RCS or liquid rocket engines (RCS is probably best to prevent screwing up) so you can properly bring the kerbals back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne interesting condition for that though is that you may eventually need a multi-crewed command module rocket to even attempt such a feat (unless you got a remote controlled rocket \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E).
