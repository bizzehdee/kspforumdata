Specifically, first flyback to the runway with a spaceplane. After the glitchy disaster that was the previous attempt, I loaded up the RAPIER test plane. I ripped out the old payload, and replaced it with a support rig and the new payload. Added an empty Mk2 cockpit, some RCS thrusters and a docking port. Also, changed the RAPIERs for Turbojets, shuffling wings. One of the best things about RAPIERs is the ability to attach wings etc. - so changing to turbojets makes a structural change, too. For rockets, I put in eight 49-7S-cubic octagonal strut sets, four on the central tanks, and four on the outer ones. A couple of fuel lines needed to be added to ensure flow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/NADM78.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NADM78.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/JIsd7Z.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JIsd7Z.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was also running a Turbojet test (though I do have it by research), and an orbital rescue mission.

Then, after doing two simulations, it was decided that launching the damaged first stage was not doable without dropping four additional tanks and engines, in order to get symmetric thrust. Well, the stage could still match its specifications, but only because it was designed to launch at sea level and had a head start of more than 1.9 km of height. All other stages were fully intact and the rest of the launch went exactly as planned, as did the rendezvous with the mothership in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter bringing the mothership to a higher orbit around Eve using fuel that was left in the Eve lander and the transfer stage from Kerbin, the Gilly lander was decoupled and landed successfully.
