Yesterday i was experimenting with a new ship of mine, mainly using liquid fuel engines. So my aim was to reach a stable orbit around kerbin. When i reached 40000 metres I tried to reposition myself. Well and that failed \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E I was about to crash into the ground when I got back in stable position. Then I thought, I wasted so much fuel already why don\\\u0027t I try to get at least very high. So I used all my remaining fuel to get high, in a 75\u00C2\u00B0 axis from the ground. When I checked my map I noticed how the \u0027orbit\u0027 I had till then expanded in an insane amount, even trespassing the mun\\\u0027s orbit. It all ended up in me going on a journey 66.000.000.000 metres away from the earth. The whole trip took me around 10 hours, and my kerbins left their planet for over 300 days.

My longest space trip, however, took only a few seconds (Again, mods). I modded the command module to have insanely low mass and drag values, and an insanely high crash tolerance. I flew this command module into the ocean, where the ocean caused the module to bounce back out at some 18,000,000,000,000,000,000m/s (May be off by a few zeros), where it somehow stopped at 6,148,000,000,000,000,000m from Kerbol.
