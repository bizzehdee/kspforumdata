All was going well on my way there, I had a nice liftoff, managed to get myself into an orbit around it and was feeling pretty pleased with myself. \u0022This is good,\u0022 I thought, deciding to attempt a landing... Little did I know, it wasn\u0027t going to be the landing I had dreamed of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I was landing, I decided to record it, for keep-sake, but the nerves got the better of me. Let\u0027s just say, it didn\u0027t have the greatest outcome possible. I had a little too much horizontal speed, and suddenly realised one of my ships landing legs had decided to snap off and abandon me, urging his closest neighbors (the fuel tank and booster) to join him on his mutiny.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob managed to get (read: slump) out of his ship and taste Minmus air before he made his rather unlikely return home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Okay,\u0022 I thought, figuring I\u0027d have enough fuel left to make it into orbit and get back to Kerbin safely. Applying thrust, I span wildly out of control, and in the process managed to rip off the parachute part I had fitted to see me land safely back on Kerbin. With no chance of a safe Kerbin touchdown, I went full throttle, wishing only to give Bob Kerman a swift and relatively painless death, but fate was too kind to Bob that day and instead opted to see him chase his runaway ship off into the sunset...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResults of my first Minmus landing are below.
