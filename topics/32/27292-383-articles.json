I had to test the launch escape system while landed on Minmus. So I strapped it to the top of a small lander instead of a parachute, well aware that this would probably be a one way trip, and landed it on Minmus. The first stage burned in Kerbins Atmosphere, and the second stage was already back on its way to reentry into Kerbins atmosphere for recovery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the lander is standing on the surface on Minmus. I activate the launche escape system, the lander twirls around like crazy, smashes against the surface, loses three of his four landing legs and several smaller parts. It bounces back and maybe about 500m up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI look at the instruments: the experiment did not succeed. Why? I ponder this for a few seconds while watching my semi-trashed vehicle missing first a small hill and then two mountains by just a few metres. Maybe I have enough fuel left to leave Minmus and at least recover what I can? I start to burn again to get into a very low, but stable orbit around Minmus. Steering the craft is really hard, because its center of mass moved far to the side where the remaining landing leg is. I had to limit my thrust to about 1/4th to keep it controllable somehow, hoping that I would gain speed fast enough before crashing into the next mountain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI look at my fuel level: almost gone. This was designed as a one-way trip, after all. At least I am crossing a few Minmus biomes at a very low altitude. I use my thermometer to transfer a little science back to kerbin. Why did the experiment fail, I ponder. Then it hits me: the experiment is checked about a second after activating it, so in this case I was already thrusted back from the surface, so the experiment didn\u0027t succeed. I look at the burned-out launch escape system. Hm...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI look at the ground below me: fair enough. We are on Minmus, after all. We should be able to land anything here, even without gear. I carefully burn retrograde, set up on the remaining landing leg, tilt over to one side and carefully land without any further damage. I activate the burned launch escape system again. Success! Yay! And now for the fireworks: I set to full thrust, and burn the remaining fuel. I slide over the surface of Minmus, down the slope. Once I hit ground, the launch escape system explodes, and thrusts the rest of the ship a few metres higher. The engine crashes into the ground, bumping the remaining tanks and the core of the lander back up - and then: freeze.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP froze, no chance to reactivate it. In fact I had to reboot my computer, because the rest of the windows desktop didn\u0027t respond that well, either.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DocMoriarty","CreatedById":57433,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T12:50:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI built another tiny transport space plane today: SPT Leviathan 1_01\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmpty TOW: 116t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax Payload: 94t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax TOW: 210t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines: 17 rapier\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel: enough\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart Count: 371\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanned to transport big SLS tanks or tugs based on big SLS tanks into LKO without stealing fuel from them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere a view in the secret construction facility on Kerbin:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/leviathan_01.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022leviathan_01.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngine test.

I restored to the quicksave I made when entering Eve\u0027s sphere of influence, and continued from there. First, I took gravitic readings - the Gilly lander probe is intended to return to Kerbin with six different gravitic readings, three temperature readings and even a seismic reading - the expensive equipment and high value data should all make it back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/OQPoAy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OQPoAy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, aerocapture at 60 km followed by a few shallower aerobrakes brought me down to a nice 355 km over 100 km orbit - all in the Near Eve region. I took readings, transmitting one temperature and keeping the other on the Gilly lander. Then, I targeted Gilly and corrected inclination. I brought the periapse into the atmosphere and decoupled the Eve lander probe, before turning around to get back into a stable low Eve orbit and decouple the Eve satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/LsJJA0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LsJJA0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/RTbw2a.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RTbw2a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI changed focus to the lander-probe.

A 5500km retrograde circular orbit is where I decoupled the Gilly satellite, then I turned completely around to go and do the landing on the day side. That also was rather straightforward, if a little slow. I took all the readings I wanted, transmitting orbital and landed temperatures, and keeping a copy of each alongside all three Gilly gravity readings and the seismic one. After that, I launched back to Eve orbit, escaping Gilly immediately after I had completed its exploration contract. At some point before the landing, however, the Gilly satellite hit a mountain and was annihilated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/PxScg8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PxScg8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith some aerobraking and a little fuel use, I got down into a 100km circular orbit to await the return window in a little over a year.
