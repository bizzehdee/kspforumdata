One thing is to send a sounding rocket up. Light the fuse and off it goes. Space flight takes a whole lot more. Computers to compute trajectories, commlinks, all those things. So yeah, to me it makes perfect sense having to upgrade these two buildings to unlock man. nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T05:08:23Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 05:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LN400\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
