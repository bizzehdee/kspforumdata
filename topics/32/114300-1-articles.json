The issue I did see, however, is that KSP on OS-X will crash and spin the beach ball once it hits 3.2GBs of virtual RAM (which seems to happen anywhere between 2.2GBs-2.8GBs of Actual RAM). Windows can push that a bit further, and handles out-of-memory crashes a bit more gracefully. (Basically: Windows KSP crashes to desktop, OS-X forces me to kill -9 it.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also the whole thing with KSP on OS-X being rather unstable and random since 0.24, to the point of being occasionally unplayable. And little nuances that just haven\u0027t been right for some time. Ex: I toyed with 1.0.4 a bit on OS-X last night and it would only recognize half of my mouse clicks in the VAB. Every other scene was fine, but the VAB was being wacko. Restarted and that issue went away. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYMMV.
