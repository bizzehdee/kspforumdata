First post.\n\n**Has anyone had experience with comparing KSP performance between similar (or identical) computers, running OS X and running Windows? I\u0027m just curious because I can configure Boot Camp and install Windows 7 on my Mac if it\u0027d see [markedly] better performance.**\n\nI understand both would only be running the 32-bit version\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\n\nI\u0027m currently on a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013) with 2.4GHz Core i5 (Turbo Boost up to 2.9GHz), 8 GB memory, and Intel Iris graphics. Playing the game at half-Retina resolution, 1280x800.\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T23:19:36Z","Content":"Using the model of 13\u0022 MBP just before yours (non-Retina), I saw no \\_performance\\_ differences between running in Windows (via Boot Camp) vs running in OS-X. The issue I did see, however, is that KSP on OS-X will crash and spin the beach ball once it hits 3.2GBs of virtual RAM (which seems to happen anywhere between 2.2GBs-2.8GBs of Actual RAM). Windows can push that a bit further, and handles out-of-memory crashes a bit more gracefully. (Basically: Windows KSP crashes to desktop, OS-X forces me to kill -9 it.)\n\nThere\u0027s also the whole thing with KSP on OS-X being rather unstable and random since 0.24, to the point of being occasionally unplayable. And little nuances that just haven\u0027t been right for some time. Ex: I toyed with 1.0.4 a bit on OS-X last night and it would only recognize half of my mouse clicks in the VAB. Every other scene was fine, but the VAB was being wacko. Restarted and that issue went away. \n\nYMMV. And it\u0027s probably downright nice on an OS-X machine with a real graphics card. Or maybe not.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T00:16:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 12:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cydonian Monk**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shawn28","CreatedById":143994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T23:34:48Z","Content":"i have the exact same Mac ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) KSP works amazing. i haven\u0027t installed Windows yet, but i do have Linux on Boot Camp and KSP works way better on OS X. the only thing i really don\u0027t like about playing KSP on OS X is the KSP \u002B OS X instability issue, which is almost impossible to play with in OS X 10.10.3 :/ that issue isn\u0027t because of OS X, it\u0027s because KSP 1.0.x is made with Unity4; which is not compatible with OS X 10.10.3 :/ so when KSP updates to Unity5, it should work perfect on OS X (no promises, they might also finish KSP 1.1.0 when a new Unity/OS X version coms out :/ so you never know)\n\nif you are patient, i think it will be better to just play KSP on OS X without shadows (fastest rendering quality); which fixes the KSP OS X instability issue, and wait for KSP 1.1.0. but having windows on a mac is pretty useful, so if your going to use it for other things too, then i think you should get it ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n-Shawn- ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"JohnnyDNGRSLY","CreatedById":147050,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T23:36:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6KSP on OS-X will crash and spin the beach ball once it hits 3.2GBs of virtual RAM\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 Windows can push that a bit further, and handles out-of-memory crashes a bit more gracefully.
