As I understand it, Orbiter fulfills that niche. We don\u0027t need arguments trying to remind them to keep it fun, this game is amazing.\n\nIf you want 150% unrealistic engines, then mod them. They don\u0027t belong in the stock game. Just like any other sandbox game, you can completely ruin the theme by what you include in the stock experience. Minecraft shouldn\u0027t come packaged with anti-monster turrets and a shop where you can buy any weapon imaginable. 7 Days to Die shouldn\u0027t come packaged with the ability to fly. The best approach is to make a game that is self-consistent with its own theme, and then allow the people to customize things as they see fit through modding.\n\nIt\u0027s been said in this thread, better than I can put it, that the game is meant to represent real space exploration at a basic level. They\u0027ve stuck an amazing balance between realism and fun, keeping it as close to realism as possible without ruining the fun.
