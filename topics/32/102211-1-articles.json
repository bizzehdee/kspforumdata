Just how far do I trust my own piloting and navigation abilities (without quick-save and do-overs, and without MechJeb).\n\nWhen I first started playing the game, the answer would have been an obvious \u0022no\u0022 to all missions. But as I\u0027ve learned to play the game better and started to get a feel for what kinds of things are likely to end tragically and what things are relatively safe, I\u0027ve decided that there really may be some KSP missions that I feel confident enough about to risk my life on. Of course, it depends greatly on the mission profile. So, here are the missions that I think I could risk my life on and the missions I would have to turn down. What are yours?\n\n1) Landing on Minmus: YES!\n\nAssuming I use a fairly simple craft that has already made several successful unmanned landings on Minmus, I would do this one in a heartbeat! To be able to fly around that amazing landscape with a jet pack would easily be worth the risk of getting there. Landing on Minmus is a breeze, so there isn\u0027t much to fear there. My only real concern would be about something going wrong on launch. Which brings me to:\n\n2) Any launch involving solid boosters: HECK NO!\n\nRegardless of whether or not they make the launch more efficient, there is no way I\u0027m getting within 10 miles of one of those trash-cans-of-boom. I have found that the odds of a catastrophic launch increase substantially when I introduce a rocket that I can\u0027t turn off. With a liquid-fueled rocket, even if the launch goes haywire for some reason, I\u0027m relatively confident that I can shut everything down, decouple my command module, and parachute to safety. With the solid fuel rockets (even with the bug-fix that keeps them from spinning into my core), if anything at all goes wrong in the launch, I can pretty much kiss my Kerbal life goodbye.\n\n3) Any launch involving an overly-complex rocket monstrosity: No again.\n\nSimple rockets...I could possibly trust with my life. But anything that requires asparagus staging or boosters on boosters...no thanks. \n\n4) Landing on the Mun: Probably not.\n\nGiven my landing history on the Mun, statistically I\u0027ll \\*probably\\* be okay. But I\u0027ve crashed and burned enough on the Mun that I would probably chicken out before the landing and head home.\n\n5) Landing on Gilly: Absolutely.\n\nIn fact, you are probably safer on Gilly than you are staying home on Kerbin. If you trip on Gilly, it would take 5 minutes to hit the ground. I would just have to stay far away from that freaky seam in the planet that spells instant death to those who explore it. The only somewhat scary part would be aero-braking over Eve, but if I choose a conservative altitude, it\u0027ll probably be just fine. And I would have a chute on my lander anyway for the return trip home, so if I did get sucked in to Eve, I would probably survive, but I would probably never get home. Which brings me to:\n\n6) Landing on Eve: Nuh uh.\n\nThe odds of me hitting one of those tiny high-altitude targets on the first try is next to nil. Although...considering I have infinite time and stamina I could theoretically hike or swim across the planet to climb a peak and be rescued. But...nah.\n\n7) Landing on Moho: Nope.\n\nIf I build a rocket with enough Delta-V to get myself to Moho and home again, it\u0027s probably not a rocket I would feel safe even sitting in on the launch pad.\n\n8) Landing on Duna: A hesitant yes...\n\nI would have to really sike myself up for this one, but I would probably go for it. My landing success rate on Duna is pretty good, but there are just so many things that can go wrong in that landing...chute deployment tearing the ship apart...thrusting too hard during the powered landing which inadvertently cuts the chutes...coming in at an altitude where the atmosphere is too thin. But if I tested my ship with a couple of unmanned missions first (just to verify that my parachute placement didn\u0027t tear the ship apart on deployment), I think I could risk my life on it.\n\n9) Landing on Pol: YES! YES! YES!\n\nIn fact, this would be my first destination. I would land on the side that always faces Jool and I would lie on my back on one of the summits of Pol and gaze up at the sky. I would use my time-warp super power to make Jool oscillate through the sky like a giant yo-yo, and I would lie there and watch the other four moons in their never-ending cosmic dance. Then when I needed some activity, I could fire up my jet pack and orbit the planet. The scary parts of this mission would be aero-braking over Jool or possibly getting an accidental encounter with Laythe or Tylo that caused me to waste a lot a fuel. But as long as I choose a conservative altitude to aero-brake, the most likely negative outcome is that I would just run out fuel and have to be rescued. But if I\u0027m the one floating around in space and I\u0027m running the space program, I can always make sure a rescue mission is next on the launchpad.\n\n10) Landing on Bop: Yes.\n\nVery safe to land on, much like Pol. Except the absence of flat spots on Bop kind of weirds me out, so I don\u0027t think I would want to stay there very long. I would always be feeling like I didn\u0027t have my V8 today.\n\n11) Landing on Tylo: Never in a million Kerbal years. \n\nThat moon is just giant death trap.\n\n12) Landing on Laythe: I probably shouldn\u0027t...but IT\u0027S LAYTHE!\n\nIt\u0027s even-money odds that I miss my target and land in the ocean. And even if I miss the ocean, it\u0027s even-money odds again that my lander rolls down a slope and is permanently disabled. But even knowing all that, I still might be tempted to take my chances and go for the beach vacation. Of course, by day 7 of swimming for land (with my infinite stamina), I\u0027ll probably be rethinking the whole decision.\n\n13) Landing on Eeloo, Dres, or Vall: No, thanks.\n\nThey just don\u0027t make the cut in the risk-reward analysis. I would probably make it there and home okay, but the landings aren\u0027t a cake walk. And why would I want to go there anyway?\n\n14) Anything involving rovers on any planet: Not for me.\n\nI have never yet had a rover-driving experience that didn\u0027t end with a ball of explosions tumbling across the terrain. (Then again, maybe I just always play with my rovers until they crash. So, maybe that\u0027s the only way a rover session \\*can\\* end.) Anyway, I\u0027ll drive them remotely, but I\u0027m certainly not getting in the seat."},{"CreatedByName":"EdFred","CreatedById":108599,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T16:52:29Z","Content":"tl;dr\n\nyes."},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T17:21:57Z","Content":"No. Anyone who would climb aboard a vessel I designed for space travel and possibly landing on celestial bodies, would easily be considered an idiot. \n\nI could probably get Karl Pilkington to do it."},{"CreatedByName":"montyben101","CreatedById":74173,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T17:26:59Z","Content":"Vall is amazing!

Likewise, the designers are probably not flying their horrible contraptions of death crafts, but rather get the expendable crew to fly it for them.\n\n...Why do you think most of them are so terrified all the time?

I can always test whether a landing is safe by sending the lander down uncrewed first (of *course* it has a probe core; for as little as 30 kg, why wouldn\u0027t it?), and thanks to my extensive network of automated karbonite mines on Minmus, Pol\\*, and Gilly\\*\\*, fuel is not a limitation.
