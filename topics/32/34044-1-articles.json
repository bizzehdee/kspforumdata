Estimates put it around top speeds of mach 12-24. the only problem is that the heat buildup would be so high the craft will desentagrate/melt. There have been unmaned tests that have all suffered from this problem. Current ideas to deal with this are developing more heat resistant materials to cooling the plane with the fuel prior to burning(like rocket engines). Also this would be normal for a craft reaching orbital velosoty in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T04:53:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fried\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fried\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/YFHKa\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/YFHKa\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis dosent happen in our world\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealt:15900m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Espeed:1440m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting near hypersonic speeds while still fairly low in the atmosphere?
