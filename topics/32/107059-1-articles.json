So all of that experience is MOOT, with the new aerodynamics.\n\nIf you were new you would know this game is hard, and it is hard. The game also got \u0022harder\u0022 with the new areodynamics to a degree as there is more to think about. But truly this game isn\u0027t easy, its just you thought you knew everything and now there is something new to learn. So the game is hard again. \n\nIf you give up on the first day then yes this game is not for you. Going back to the old ways wont really help anyone actually invested into learning KSP. \n\nYou can\u0027t turn far from Prograde during your gravity turn or you risk tumbling out of control. All engines that had gimbals were pretty much buffed to provide added control during ascent and decent. You also can\u0027t ascend to fast with crazy amounts of thrust as you risk burning up during ascent (you really need to be going fast)\n\nI do have to agree controlling earlier rockets is more difficult. But its more piloting error, not game error. I personally like how rockets actually take some skill to fly, planes shouldn\u0027t be the only ones that need to be flown with skill. If anything just learning how to ascend through the new atmosphere should be fine. Just use the LV-T45 for the gimbal, grab a few fins for stabilization and build a basic 1 stack rocket. Unless its far to long you will be fine. Just don\u0027t be so aggressive pulling away from the pro grade during your gravity turn."},{"CreatedByName":"Wiseman","CreatedById":116239,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T03:04:36Z","Content":"If you\u0027re still trying to go up to 10k and then turn 45 degrees, that\u0027s why your rockets are losing control. I started a completely stock career, and getting things into orbit hasn\u0027t been a problem at all. Launch without too much power (thrust limit your early SRBs, manage your throttle on liquid engines - if you\u0027re seeing mach/reentry effects, you\u0027re going too fast), nudge your rocket 5 degrees eastward when you\u0027re going roughly 100 m/s, and then just follow your prograde marker to victory. It\u0027s quite doable with sleek, realistic looking rockets, and I\u0027ve been putting some silly things into orbit as well, but I\u0027ve had a lot of practice with FAR. If you\u0027re still having trouble staying on target, SQUAD has created new tier-0 fins that should make learning the new aerodynamics a lot easier from the first launch, and bigger fins at tier 2.\n\nGood luck!"},{"CreatedByName":"JackDugan","CreatedById":139522,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T03:07:57Z","Content":"I am on a hard mode career and am relatively far in. I have got into orbit about 20 or so times and the next will most likely be for a moon landing. It isn\u0027t hard if you put wings on the bottom if necessary, use aerodynamic nosecones, and follow the most efficient flight path. The new aerodynamics mean you have to redesign your rockets. Don\u0027t try turning 45 degrees at 10 Km. In fact, my second launch was an orbital launch."},{"CreatedByName":"samstarman5","CreatedById":12469,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T03:18:40Z","Content":"It\u0027s really more about the speed you are at when in lower atmo. If you aren\u0027t going too fast, you can manage some turn at lower atmo with little problem, as long as you aren\u0027t treating your craft like it is an X-Wing. This is aerodynamic ballistics, not fly wherever you please on infinite fuel and blasters, kid. Even the best built jets will go out of control if you bank them hard enough at high speeds. You are getting a crash course in air making you its ...... If you don\u0027t treat it right, it will throw you back down at the ground and tell you to stay there.\n\nWith 1.0, I didn\u0027t even plan on going anywhere but up from the beginning. I just use each new size of SRB to just go straight up and rack in the cash and prestige from the altitude, speed, and distance records broken. As well as any science I can gather from the goo and crew reports. Until you get as far as making orbit, there really is nothing else necessary to do, and by then, you should have access to much better parts to help you manage maneuvering in atmo better.\n\nSo, in lower atmosphere when you are shooting for space, don\u0027t turn hard. Baby taps to make gravity turns is the way to go. In fact, it will be ideal to not even go full or even three-quarters throttle from launch. Better to accumulate that speed slower so you can manage easier turns at the start. When you hit thinner atmosphere (darker blue on the bar), then start pumping it up. You will actually get better efficiency out of it."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T03:22:38Z","Content":"I\u0027m currently on Tier 8 in Normal mode career. Your big mistake is relying on reaction wheels to do things they shouldn\u0027t be able to do. Control fins will hold the rocket stable, but you have a choice.. either an engine that gimbals or a fins that are active. Try not to do both. If the engine gimbals, use static fins to keep to keep it flying straight, and don\u0027t go too fast. It seems backward to those accustomed to the soup-o-sphere, but the faster you fly the harder it is to change direction."},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T03:24:48Z","Content":"I am now tempted to do a video series on career mode on hard difficulty."},{"CreatedByName":"Tarheel1999","CreatedById":123965,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T03:29:49Z","Content":"Scott Manley has a new set of videos on career mode.

Speed in the lower atmosphere is an issue beyond just wasting delta-v, turning too far away from the prograde marker at low altitudes is bad a lot of the times, TWR of 1.6 - 1.8 seems like the sweet spot for most of my designs on the launch pad, fins are a must if you are having trouble(you can launch without them but having that control surface makes things a little easier), you need to start your turn early like almost off the pad early or at least below 1k(this is no more than a 5 degree turn), I am finding it better to leave SAS off until the upper atmosphere since it seems to want to resist the turn.\n\nMost times now after my intial 5 degree turn I am only controling the throttle with SAS off letting the rocket turn by itself, this took several reverts with different rockets for me to get down. I am not an expert but speed seems very important in controling the turn, too fast your rocket resist the turn, too slow your rocket will turn to fast(someone may correct me on this but it is what seems to be happening). I also found it helpful to just focus on getting as close to orbital velocity as fast as I could and ignored my AP during several launches. It help me figure out efficient launch profiles which I am still working on but I am getting better with each launch costing me less delta-v and getting the AP closer to my desired altitude.\n\nTo sum up going too fast is bad, turning too aggressively is bad, start your turn early, with enough launches, practice and good designs you will have a rockets that get to orbit almost on their own."},{"CreatedByName":"TinfoilChef","CreatedById":43840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T03:40:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Don\u0027t try turning 45 degrees at 10 Km.

If you had just thrown up your hands and given up, you would have never enjoyed playing KSP at all.\n\nYou have a huge advantage over the completely new players who are just now starting to blow stuff up. Trust me, getting to orbit with the new aero is not that hard, and didn\u0027t take me too long to figure out.

The first fins that are actually any use are on a 45 science node. The fixed fins I mostly find to be a different flavour of horrible to fly. Rather than flipping over if you stray from prograde, you\u0027ll just end up stuck on too shallow a trajectory and your rocket ends up as a lawn dart.\n\n\u003E OP, think back to when you first started playing KSP.

First time out I had a few issues with bringing enough delta-v, but I wasn\u0027t having to fight rockets flipping over if you stray more than a few degrees from prograde. Ditto for FAR - that was different, but I found it actually rather easier to fly with. 1.0 Career mode is just annoying until you have tier 4 techs at present as you basically have no decent control options."},{"CreatedByName":"bakanando","CreatedById":126310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T22:37:49Z","Content":"I still find career mode more playable in 1.0/1.0.2 (tried both for atmo testing with low tech) than it was in 0.90. The progression feels smoother if a little forced. There\u0027s amost no grind in 1.0\u002B too (at least in normal mode), which is always good."}]}
