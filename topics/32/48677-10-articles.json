This unlocks decouplers (both inline and radial), goo samples, the LV-909 engine, the larger SRBs, and landing struts, all of which play a role in step 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Mission to Minmus: Minmus doesn\u0027t have biomes unless you count the normal three (surface/low orbit/high above), so this is mostly about the goo, a surface sample, and crew reports/EVA reports on the surface of Minmus. I don\u0027t remember how many points here, but it unlocks struts, fuel lines, the rockomax 48-7S (which is OP in 0.22), the first solar panel (very big thing), and the materials lab part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Mission to the Mun: the Mun has six or seven biomes that increase the number of EVA reports you can do in an equatorial orbit. I radioed back all of the experiment results from the Mun, and then departed, throwing myself into an orbit that just barely left Kerbin\u0027s SoI. Once in the sun\u0027s SoI, I did the three goo reports, the materials lab, an EVA report, and a crew report. I headed back to Kerbin, and just the EVA reports and results from the sun\u0027s SoI resulted in over 800 research points, on top of over 200 points radioed back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo three missions that weren\u0027t fully optimized, and I\u0027m already done with tiers one through three, have most of tier four researched, and about half of tier five.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the topic of the OP: Needs something between Awesome and OK. Not sure I\u0027d call it Awesome yet, though tweaking the tree and research rates might tune that up. On the other hand, definitely better than just OK. I haven\u0027t voted yet, but given that breakdown, I\u0027d have to go with Awesome. Last night was the second time in months that I\u0027ve stayed up \u0022way too late\u0022 playing KSP, and the other time was right after we saw the initial parts list for career mode and I decided to do a trip to Duna with just those parts (one way in my case, though at least one person has done a round trip with the same parts).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-17T18:06:33Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2013 06:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Eric S\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brapness","CreatedById":73986,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T18:03:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s somewhere between ok and awesome for me.

I think this update is awesome. I see people going on about maxing out the tech tree in very few flights; that hasn\u0027t been an issue for me. It\u0027s taking me plenty of time to get things done, but I suppose I\u0027m an average player. I also think some people are overlooking that this is only the first career mode update, and there are plenty of features to be added, like money, which will likely prevent those large builds capable of landing on the Mun happening on their first flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having great fun, working with limited parts and having a new reason to visit old places again, I feel like I did when I first started playing KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bioman222","CreatedById":30364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T18:04:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s pictures from my ScienceSat-1:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JmLPj1Y.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JmLPj1Y.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/da6Xcuf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022da6Xcuf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T18:05:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E11/10\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lions","CreatedById":79155,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T18:37:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei don\u0027t say the update is bad, it is a necessary building block to the end product.
