Just like some people don\u0027t want to build their own PC part-by-part -- they just go out and buy some pre-built Dell or ASUS gaming desktop, plug in their keyboard and go. There are likewise plenty of gamers who want to buy a complete gaming experience out of the box, from one place, and know that it was all designed to work and already quality-tested as-is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFourth, pretend you are a software developer with enough funding to afford a team of \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E10\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E programmers/artists/etc. You think you can get the base game completed and released in 4 years, and there are a bunch of features you want to add after release, in years 5 through 7.\u00A0 You allow players to get your game in early access, and by the time you reach version 1.0, there are already \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E500\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E modders, and they have already implemented every feature you planned for years 5-7 of development, naturally because they outnumber you 50 to 1, but they made those features slightly differently than you had in mind. Should you just abandon your roadmap now because someone else finished the game for you, albeit not quite in the direction you would have done it? What if a mod that implements one of those features you had roadmapped gets abandoned by its creator? THEN do you scramble to fill this now gaping hole in your game, but now you\u0027re behind your timeline because you relied on some random internet stranger with no ties to your company and no obligations to support that mod to make your game good? IMO that\u0027s a really, really bad business model.

This is a fun little cartoony rocket simulator we\u0027ve turned into everything from a colonisation simulator to a full fledged real time strategy game with multiplayer. It just means you have to adapt to the game\u0027s limitations to pull these things off, not expect it to adapt to your specific use cases, even though to their credit Squad have been trying to\u00A0cover as many of these as they can lately.
