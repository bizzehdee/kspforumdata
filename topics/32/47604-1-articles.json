R\u0026amp;D is just entering testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you read the dev blog on how they\u0027re handling testing now then you know that each piece gets some individual testing time before the whole thing is tested together. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd you should know that R\u0026amp;D is the largest piece of .22\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding that all together and we have .22 wrapping up active development and soon to be entering the test phase as a whole. But this is just my guess based on what I cited above. I\u0027m not expecting them to announce that .22 is in the testing phase this Tuesday. I would expect it closer to the one after.

The notification system that they set up to let us know where the release is in the development path is pretty much borked because they changed the process of testing. With that said, it\u0027s anyone\u0027s guess. Pessimistic estimates say at least another month.
