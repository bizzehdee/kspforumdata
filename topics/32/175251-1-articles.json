I\u0027ll give an example from just today...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have been searching the forum and YouTube trying to understand docking(specifically the rendezvous), I never could, at least not until today. I was looking at the physics of it and then it hit me like a rapidly decelerating crew cab Mk1. The way to rendezvous two ships in orbit is to take one into a higher or lower orbit to match velocities. I am sure for many of you this is child\u0027s play, but for me I had not realized it until a few minutes ago. I will provide a few pictures below, showing how I figured this out, but I am very glad that I did so because I can now build better space stations than one launch versions.
