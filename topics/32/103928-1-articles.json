But I\u0027m unsure if it could be classified as a desertic or a volcanic planet, considering how there\u0027s evidence for and against either, as I shall lay out here:\n\n**Desertic**\n\nFor:\n\n-The soil is composed of sand, and not of ashes or magma rocks/obsidian.\n\n-It is quite possible that its dense atmosphere caused too much heat to be trapped in it, causing it to degrade into a desert.\n\nAgainst:\n\n-There\u0027s liquids in the surface, which could be anything from fresh water to rocket fuel.\n\n-Since it is a hothouse planet, it\u0027s quite possible that Eve could be encased by clouds, which would fit more for a volcanic planet than a desertic one.\n\n**Volcanic**\n\nFor:\n\n-As stated above, a volcanic planet has more reasons to have a cloud thicket.\n\n-The volcanoes could be responsible for deeply increasing Eve\u0027s atmosphere and temperature, turning it into a death world. This could mean that Eve might be a geologically-active world.\n\nAgainst:\n\n-As stated above, it would make more sense for a volcanic planet to have a surface mostly consisted of magmatic rocks, and some deposits of ashes.\n\n-No volcanoes are actually seen.\n\nFeel free to correct me if I pulled out an [Artistic License for Chemistry](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseChemistry)."},{"CreatedByName":"ouion","CreatedById":38531,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T18:56:59Z","Content":"Is it possible it can be both desertic and a volcanic planet. I mean the sand could be volcanic sand as on Earth is commonly found on beaches. Probably some areas of Eve is cooled down and allowed volcanic sand and rocks while others are molten and volcanic.
