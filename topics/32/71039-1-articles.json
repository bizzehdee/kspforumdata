Do you just warp ahead to correct phase angles and not worry about all the \u0022wasted\u0022 time? One career mode I noticed I was 46 years into it, and I thought that was a lot of wasted time considering I was only doing one mission at a time. Warp ahead to get Duna in position, warping while going to Duna, warping while waiting for Kerbin to come back into position. Well that was a few wasted years. Repeat for Jool and Eve. So I decided to start career mode over. I will now only warp the time it takes to get Mun. While waiting for the other planets to get into position for transfer, I\u0027m simply constructing bases on Mun and (soon) Minmus. I\u0027m only 30-some days into my career the tech tree is completely knocked out in 9 Kerbin days, and I have a Mun base with 23 or 24 modules (all a separate mission to bring each module) and two rovers. Once the Minmus base is complete, I will start construction on interplanetary ships, and try and run concurrent missions to all the planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s your approach to time?
