With enough intakes some craft can reach orbital speeds just on jet engines, so those craft don\u0027t need to angle upwards at all, you just go fast until the apoapsis starts to rise on the other side of the planet. Other planes might have underpowered rocket engines and a low amount of lift, so they have to point up at about 45 degrees just to prevent themselves falling out the sky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest path into SSTO\u0027s is probably the aeris 4a. With the Scott Manley tweaks, it\u0027s a proven design which you can use to practice ascent profiles. The next step is to build a clone using slightly different parts, and then finally progress onto bigger and better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/yUQXqG_edKQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"helaeon","CreatedById":101767,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T09:29:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy general SSTO profile is as follows... (I usually am flying dropships like cupcake\u0027s or jet rockets but this works pretty well with planes too)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFly straight up to about 10km - lower if you\u0027ve got a really good TWR, then pitch over to 45 degrees. At about 15km go down to 30 degrees. This is where you really want to start keeping tabs on your vertical ascent, you want to maximize the amount of time you\u0027re under air-breathing power. Now you want to keep as close to terminal velocity as you can, even exceeding it as you climb to 25km. Keep pitching down, much like a gravity turn, to keep your ascent under control because we are looking for horizontal speed. Once you start hitting your ceiling start pulling back on your throttle so your jets don\u0027t flame out if you do it right you can ease it back to almost nothing. You should still be climbing about 50-60m/s and still accelerating, even if just a little. Towards the end it will be to keep you from having your apoapsis drop from air drag. It seems to work best if you can make 40-45km before you cut your jets entirely, at which point you switch to rocket power, but resist the urge to pitch up, stay facing prograde for the burn just like your usual gravity turn. You should be going about 2km/s - 2.3km/s so your circularization burn will be tiny. At 25km you should be at 1.6-1.8km/s at least. The thing that gets you on this profile is air drag can bring your apoapsis back into the atmosphere if you don\u0027t do it right (usually 100km is safe). If you do it right you\u0027ll use very little liquid fuel and almost no oxidizer (sometimes you only need it for circularizing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have something that can show you your apoapsis without checking the map and your needed air vs what you\u0027re getting (to help with the throttle part).
