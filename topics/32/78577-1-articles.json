I was playing on KSP when I was doing a tutorial on on getting orbit around the mun, I decided to Hyperedit myself there, thus completing the tutorial. Then I used the MunshotA ship to go to the surface of the mun, but i couldn\u0027t because I couldnt turn a engine off. So it was like a mass relay because the all engines were on and I couldnt turn any off. Then the most epic thing happened. The KSP theme somehow played. and I managed to shut off the engine. I failed to land on the mun though. Has anyone else had the KSP theme play at a time in space or whatever?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bobnova","CreatedById":75385,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T05:23:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI noticed there was music playing on the way down to Mun on my first manned mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDidn\u0027t really click at the time, but it\u0027s pretty cool now that you mention it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Secret Agent Kirrim","CreatedById":98579,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T05:41:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m not alone.
