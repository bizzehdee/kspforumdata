I think the time warp issue is more of an imprecision error, where when you go from 1x into a low, then to a high\u00A0warp rate, the game sets the\u00A0orbit of current vessel\u00A0on rails and probably increase gravity so when the time step per i game second\u00A0goes down, orbits don\u2019t change. However, if you suddenly go into a high rate from 1x, the game ends up increasing gravity too early and causes the orbit to instantly shrink just before its set on rails.
