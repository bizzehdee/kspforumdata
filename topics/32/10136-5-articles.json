I did try to recreate it my self and failed hard. ^^\n\nYes, I\\\u0027ll certainly share that. But first I have to put together a mod pack kind of thing so you\\\u0027ll have the same parts, since many of them I made with simple config file edits.\n\nIn other news... I am very discouraged right now. I spent a good chunk of today (not recording) attaching Prospector to GRUNT 45-B and troubleshooting the whole assembly. Still haven\\\u0027t tried to launch it, because I want to be recording that, but it will reliably stand up straight without anything breaking.\n\nI\\\u0027m getting **one** frame per second. (Second per frame?)\n\nI\\\u0027m willing to record a few minutes of very low frame rates just to get the thing launched on its way... but this may not be playable. At all.\n\nWhat do I do now?\n\nMake a note: 470 parts is too many for KSP. It\\\u0027s barely even taxing my CPU, but I\\\u0027m thinking the game engine itself just can\\\u0027t do it."},{"CreatedByName":"Sordid","CreatedById":535,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-15T01:54:43Z","Content":"How long did you test it? In my experience, ships with large numbers of parts cause framerate drops while the game is loading the terrain and also cause the loading of the terrain to take much longer than it should. Loading the terrain somehow conflicts with the physics and the engine doesn\\\u0027t seem able to do both at the same time without a massive performance hit. What I usually do is press Esc (or hold it down, rather, to make sure the game registers it) to open the menu. That pauses the physics and allows the game to load the terrain almost instantly. Close the menu and boom, good framerate. I find doing this is a lot faster than waiting for the framerate to smooth out on its own (which it will, eventually).\n\nAlso, are you planning to do other games besides KSP? I loved that Silent Hunter series..."},{"CreatedByName":"White Owl","CreatedById":10849,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-15T02:42:17Z","Content":"Good thoughts, Sordid. Thanks for trying to help.

The game can\\\u0027t handle it. I\\\u0027ll have to launch Prospector with a boring, plain ol\\\u0027 disposable rocket and keep GRUNT handy for simpler payloads.\n\nOh well. Lesson learned.

So, in my experience, the framerate does seem directly linked to the number of parts the game engine has to keep track of at any given time.\n\nSince performance becomes much better the second I jettison my fairly complex launch stage, I get the notion the game dumps those parts from working memory, and just assigns it a coordinate as debris."},{"CreatedByName":"speedio","CreatedById":17052,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-15T09:12:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Good thoughts, Sordid.
