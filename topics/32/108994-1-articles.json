Playing Career Mode, I like to be able to recover as much as possible of my launches, and since SSTOs are no longer capable of significant payloads, I\u0027ve been using various sub-stage rocket designs to carry payloads into orbit.\n\nWith my current unlocks, this primarily revolves around the LFB KR-1x2 \u0022Twin-Boar\u0022 and a ring of 8 Turbos around it\u0027s waist, as well as a probe core and chutes to control it\u0027s decent back down into the atmosphere. I\u0027ve used this pattern, as well as one that doesn\u0027t use jets, to boost loads of 10 tonnes or less into sub-orbital trajectories up to about 130km, at which point I stage off the payload and stabilize it\u0027s orbit under it\u0027s own power. I\u0027ve had as many as 15 launches go off without a hitch, and that was even doing it poorly [excessive heating, etc.], but every time, she held firm and landed safely.\n\nMy issue is that, looking back, I loaded an earlier save to change some of my Tech Tree purchases, and now I can\u0027t get it to work at all [no, I didn\u0027t change any part unlocks involved]. She takes off just fine, gets beautifully into her coasting phase, but whenever I stage the payload and begin it\u0027s stabilization burn, about halfway through the burn, the lifter [several km behind] randomly explodes. No overheating, no re-entry [still over 100km up], she just disintegrates, with literally EVERY part detaching from every other.\n\nIs anyone else having such issues, and if so, can you recommend a fix?"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T03:34:20Z","Content":"Too fast too low.\n\nProbably."},{"CreatedByName":"Aerindel","CreatedById":109952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T03:39:50Z","Content":"Add a probe core to your lifter section and then switch to it after you separate, see what the destruction log tells you after it blows up."},{"CreatedByName":"Joseph","CreatedById":143881,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T05:15:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Too fast too low.\n\u003E Probably.\n\n This is happening long AFTER I\u0027m out of the atmosphere.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Add a probe core to your lifter section and then switch to it after you separate, see what the destruction log tells you after it blows up.\n\n It has one, and I did that... instead, the PAYLOAD disintegrated... I slowed it down, and noted that the trajectories began going erratic and changing suddenly for no reason. \n\nIt kept doing it, so I did a repairing install, seems to be stable again.

A ship I built would start shaking wildly then explode for no discernable reason. \n\nThere was some part damage during a stage separation, so I went back and added separatrons and ensured a clean separation event, but to no avail. Just kept shaking wildly and exploding. \n\nThat got me thinking that there may be a bug I\u0027d discovered. So I made a few saves in the launch process hoping to be able to help by sharing the saves with Squad. \n\nThen I tried an older ship that I\u0027d used half a dozen times previously, and it would explode also. So, then I wasn\u0027t so sure that what I was seeing was related to the build or parts.\n\nThen I rebooted, and everything worked fine afterwards. \n\nSo, blah blah blah, by all that I guess I\u0027m just saying, did you try rebooting?"},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T11:10:40Z","Content":"Did either of them use the Kraken container AKA the size 2 service bay?

The game loads the ship and begins applying physics right around 2.3k out from a target, you can easily notice when it happens as you approach a large ship or station as it freezes for a second or two right at that point every time.\n\nI\u0027ve had several stations spontaneously explode into all their component parts just as the game begins to apply physics to them at this point as I approach them with another ship.

I\u0027ve found that if there\u0027s *any* clipping at all inside a service bay, the whole ship will occasionally start shaking uncontrollably until it risks tearing itself apart. You can temporarily end the tremors by opening and closing the bay, but it will happen again.\n\nSo at any rate, that might not be your problem, but it is a known issue."}]}
