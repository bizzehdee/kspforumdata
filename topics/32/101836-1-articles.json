It\u0027s possible to add mesh components via ModuleManager configs (an example would be the color-coded discs on top of engines and the like, in the Color Coded Canisters mod). Light-up window panels could be added on top of the stock models. It\u0027s just tricky (and somewhat time consuming) for the modder to get the size and positioning right, which is why I\u0027ll probably never get to it personally. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
