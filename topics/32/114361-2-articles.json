While I am fully aware there are mods for this, I do feel that the way points and resizing are things that should be in as default. \n\nOne day I would also like to see a redesigned or second career mode. What we have right now is very good, I\u0027m not criticizing it by any means. But after using Kerbal Aircraft Expansion, it makes me think it could be more. Sure it\u0027s Kerbal **Space** Program, but space flight came after air flight. So why not have the option of starting from wooden, barely flyable contraptions, to prop air craft and jet air craft. A long natural progression to space craft and space exploration."},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T16:23:42Z","Content":"What do I hate about KSP?

The game will register the ship as a probe, and will not auto assign any crew. Or, if you attach a capsule to another capsule, one of them will always be empty.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E That there is no thumbnail of the parts I am supposed to test in the contract description. I can\u0027t remember which decoupler is called what if my life depended on it.\n\nYou can open the contracts window while in the VAB or SPH to verify the name of the part you are testing. What you hate is the fact you have to read words instead of look at pictures.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I politely disagree. It was 4 months between .90 and 1.0. Yes the hotfixes can be a bother to some(cant really call 1.0.3 a hotfix when it took a month and a half), but the meaty updates(.24,.25,.90, ect...) generally have a 3-5 month gap.\n\nConsider the fact SQUAD is still making changes to the basic structure of the game, with changes to part configuration and temperature system even in the most recent patch update, one can easily say the game is still in a testing phase, and is indeed updated far too quickly.\n\nSpeaking of this, I hate the fact we still haven\u0027t gotten to the final setup for the aerodynamics, temperature, physics, and parts configuration. Not to mention, the U.I. being a patchwork collection of post-it notes doesn\u0027t help things either. What I would really like to see is SQUAD halting these incremental updates, and just take the time necessary to finish the damn game."},{"CreatedByName":"ouion","CreatedById":38531,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T17:16:32Z","Content":"whobbly rockets and dissembling rovers those things drive me mad:mad:"},{"CreatedByName":"TrooperCooper","CreatedById":110599,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T17:19:33Z","Content":"I hate having to wait for mods to be updated for new patches.
