At least you can get to other planets and stay around them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERank 4: Great Player\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotes: Your interplanetary technique has gotten better! Far less wasted fuel now, and landing is no problem on any of the bodies (except maybe Tylo; hardly anyone can handle that even at this stage of skill!). Getting back to Kerbin is generally doable, as long as you have enough fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERank 3: Master Player\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotes: Functionally speaking, you can get anywhere in the KSP solar system. Likely some things are still quite challenging (like getting on and off Tylo, or Eve), but overall you have a solid grasp of the game. Likely you have some pretty glaring weak points in your skillset in spite of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERank 2: High Master Player\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotes: Certain aspects of the game can still trip you up (probably spaceplanes and/or docking; most have problems with one or the other), but other than that you have the game mastered and are thoroughly capable of just about any task you can think up. You may well quickload a few times during not-quite-routine missions, but usually you don\u0027t need that unless you\u0027re trying to get an absolutely perfect maneuver done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERank 1: Grand Master Player\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotes: Not much about KSP still flummoxes you. Orbital maneuvers are easy, getting to orbit is easy, missions almost always go off without a hitch, etc. Maybe some reliance on quicksaving and quickloading, but it\u0027s not really necessary for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERank A: Legendary Player\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotes: Absolutely nothing is challenging to you about Kerbal Space Program. Getting to orbit is an afterthought. Planning missions is relatively quick and painless, and always works out right. Quicksave and quickload are completely unnecessary outside of bug avoidance. You are one with the Kerbal Space Program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERank S: Ultimate Player\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotes: You\u0027re taking things above and beyond the norm. Even the legendary players are awestruck by your skill. Challenges on the forums and Reddit don\u0027t even faze you. Complex mega-missions like grand tours are a breeze. Very few players ever reach this level of skill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo going by those titles, I guess a player hits Expert level when they\u0027re able to run missions in the Kerbin system without problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would say I\u0027m a Rank 3 player who is good at docking.
