The bugs need squashing before more goes in. I signed on to an alpha/beta test way back, and I\u0027m good with that. However, when I get a \u0027release\u0027 version of a game, I seriously wonder about the competence of the game makers when I feel like I\u0027m Beta Testing Balance (\\*COUGH\\* Final Fantasy XIV \\*COUGH\\*)."},{"CreatedByName":"Torquemadus","CreatedById":97777,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T21:46:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E We don\u0027t plan on stopping work at 1.0 at all, so we\u0027re maybe better off leaving some stuff for 1.1 and getting to work on the specifics of what can make the existing stuff in the game truly shine.\n\u003E my question to you is whether you\u0027d prefer we try and add more features, or focus more on things like the aero overhaul, bugfixing and balance?\n\nIf I understand this question correctly, we\u0027re being asked if we will support some of the previously announced 1.0 features being put back to 1.1 to give Squad more time to work on them.\n\nThis sounds like a good idea to me. I\u0027m very enthusiastic about the new features. I want these features to be given the attention they deserve. I don\u0027t want to see them rushed!\n\nAero is obviously turning out to be a major feature. It seems appropriate to give aero it\u0027s own patch. It\u0027s clear that Squad want to give bug fixing and balance the attention they deserve too. I\u0027m expecting aero to make a big impact on balance, especially where spaceplanes are concerned, so I\u0027m keen for them to take the time to get this right.\n\nI would be surprised if we don\u0027t see Valentina in 1.0, since she has already been officially revealed to the community.\n\nThere are a number of features that we haven\u0027t seen or heard much about in the devnotes yet. Re-entry heating and ISRU are likely to be major game changers, as these will both greatly affect the way players design their craft. It\u0027s important that these aren\u0027t rushed. I also think it\u0027s important that the players get at least some input into how these features will work, we currently know very little about them. I would suggest releasing a specific patch that deals with these two features and the game balance changes that they will cause!\n\nI wouldn\u0027t be surprised if the infamous \u0022barn\u0022 buildings are causing more trouble.

Core features which accomplish your past goal, allowing this update to be called 1.0.\n\n2. Other features you\u0027ve told us you are working on (things mentioned in DevNotes for example).\n\n3. Potential new features not previously mentioned.\n\nIt is possible that everything you told us about so far falls into #1 and then #2 would be an empty list, but I suspect that not everything you have mentioned to us was part of your original design goal. I think most of the posts in this thread agree that #3 is NOT needed for a 1.0 version, there is plenty of stuff on the list of features you\u0027ve told us about already.\n\nI am going to assume that the 1.0 release date is already set in stone, otherwise you probably would not have asked for any of this feedback. With that assumption in place, then I think it would be helpful if you could list out the core features that accomplish your past goal to call this 1.0 - the things you will definitely have in a 1.0 release regardless of what we say. Then show us a list of everything else you have mentioned to us that you are planning for 1.0 or have already worked on for this update - it is that second list that we could then prioritize for you along with general bug fixes, stability, polish, etc."},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T22:10:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is anyone besides Squad clamoring for KSP 1.0?\n\nProbably like, two or three fanboys maybe.

My 2 cents:\n\nI would go with finishing aero, since that is a game-changing save-breaker, along with bug-fixing, optimizations, and a balancing pass (probably not the last). Beyond that, it is important not to frustrate new players.\n\nHands up! How many of you put your first rocket on the pad and then mashed buttons and clicked things until it finally launched?\n\nI hope the new tutorials will walk new players through everything they need to know. However, bear in mind that not all new players will try the tutorials. I think it is important that players be able to view, if not edit, the key bindings in game from the esc menu (one of my frustrations when I was learning the game). Along with that, being able to view, and preferably edit, action groups on the fly would be exceedingly useful, perhaps as an engineer skill.\n\nSpeaking of skills, the current experience/skill system is disappointing, to say the least, partly because it is completely automatic and railroaded. In the kerbonaut complex, players should be able to choose what skills to spend their XP on and train their \u0027nauts in. There is no reason a scientist can\u0027t pick up some piloting skills, just make it expensive, XP and fund-wise, to open a second (or third) profession line.\n\nRegarding the starting manned debate: If people really want to start unmanned, fine, give them the SAS-less Stayputnik, while your starter pilot still has SAS. But the option to use either should be there right from the start. After all, the reason the Japanese had to use *kamikaze* pilots because they didn\u0027t have any type of guidance system, and the Germans only had very rudimentary guidance systems for their V-1\u0027s and V-2\u0027s."},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T22:34:37Z","Content":"It appears this thread has run its course. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E As you fine gents and ladies in the forums and reddit learned, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re looking at the dev process of 1.0 and considering our priorities regarding the content we deliver and the quality that it is at.
