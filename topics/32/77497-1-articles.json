Oh and by the way, first pic belongs to Temstar). It involves moving the modules around using a \u0022base crawler\u0022 that attaches to the modules from a docking port along their bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i39.tinypic.com/20g0cv8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220g0cv8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom 2 pics are where I block.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t understand how the fuselage can be attached to the attachement points (or the docking ports) from their sides like that. Once the fuselage is picked up all attachement points that aren\u0027t at the ends are ignored.

You need to touch your mouse onto the back of the docking port, and not just align the FL-T800. This may still not look like what you are going for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could also turn the rover into a subassembly. That way you can build your base pieces, then attach a rover underneath if you want. Then you can build that example section of yours by starting out with the FL-T800 as the root. Then surface mount the docking port to it. When the module is all done, grab the rover and attach underneath. The rover\u0027s top docking port will need to be the rover\u0027s main attachment point, which must be done when you are building it to be a subassembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are talking about the thread I think you\u0027re talking about, most of the modules were built and landed separate from the rovers.
