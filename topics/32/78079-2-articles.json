For some reason I thought it would be a good idea to combine it with a likewise subtly tricky engine test. It took about 5 tries with this, first a T45 test at high speed 330m/s at 7200 m to 8600m had about 3 secs to fire it as I was accelerating, then I used the T45 to provide attitude control for a power dive at about 12km to test the radial chutes at over 460m/s. I was surprised it held together as well as it did, but I kept fluffing the test windows.
