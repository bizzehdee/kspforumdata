Ofcourse disabling automatic updating in Steam is also possible.

I am not using Steam myself but I hear it will keep track of how long you have played your Steam games (?). I don\u0027t know if it does this for alpha-stage games like KSP as well. This may or may not be something you are interested in. Also, some people prefer to deal with a \u0027trusted\u0027 outlet with regards to their online payments, in this case Steam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not heard anyone say that there\u0027s anything extra you would get with Steam... (Certainly hope not.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to chrischambers\u0027 present - your friend must have opened a KSP store account, in which case he\u0027d need to transfer the credentials to you so you can continue to receive the latest updates.
