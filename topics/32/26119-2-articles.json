The angular momentum is minimal. Yes, you\u0027re causing angular acceleration of a portion of the fuel supply as fuel enters the fuel line. However, you\u0027re also causing angular deceleration of an equal amount of the fuel supply as it exits the fuel line. There will be a brief moment where there is only acceleration as the fuel line fills, and a brief moment where there is only deceleration when the tank is empty but the fuel line isn\u0027t. That doesn\u0027t sound like ever-increasing, and hardly sounds unstoppable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think part of our disagreement is that you\u0027re basing this on it spiraling in, which it doesn\u0027t do. It moves circularly, stops (or at least makes a 90 degree turn dumping it\u0027s angular energy into whatever forced it to turn 90 degrees), then moves directly inward. I understand conservation of angular momentum, I just don\u0027t think it applies here the same way you do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do agree with the danger of it. The engineering challenge impossible? Difficult, yes, but I don\u0027t think I\u0027d call it impossible since that\u0027s very similar to the external tank on the space shuttle, not to mention the fact that the Falcon 9 Heavy is scheduled to test soon (later this year, if I remember correctly), and while not true asparagus staging, has many of the same technical challenges, though at a smaller fuel flow rate since each fuel line is feeding half of the center stack at most, instead of half the center stack plus two other complete stacks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T20:43:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pbhead\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pbhead\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere is a reason why I only responded to that section of your post. other factors harder, yes.
