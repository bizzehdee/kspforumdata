Glide ratio is the L/D ratio, and that depends very heavily on craft geometry; you need to find the glide angle that minimizes drag while maximizing lift. If all you know is wing area and mass, that tells you nothing about L/D and optimum glide angle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"I_Killed_Jeb","CreatedById":84817,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T19:46:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222346053\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022129087\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221451758765\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002275006\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, NathanKell said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNope.

Shape has a gigantic influence on drag, and non-wing drag will tend to be rather higher than wing drag, so your wing might have a higher L/D at one angle whereas your craft in total will have a higher L/D at another. Trying to make that kind of drag-from-mass estimate is exactly what KSP\u0027s old aero did, to cataclysmic effect. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxL_1023","CreatedById":152317,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T21:08:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFAR \u00A0(Ferram Aerospace Research)\u00A0will tell you your L/D ratio in real time, but as it also changes aerodynamics around your values would probably be (at least slightly) different in stock.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
