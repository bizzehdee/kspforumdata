Is this intentional? Are Kerbals supposed to be being slowly roasted in spaceplanes?\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere is also something about the Mk1 inline and it\u0027s heating that seems odd. \u00A0Even while the rest of the plane has cooled down (or at least no longer showing temp bars on any parts) it still shows that\u0027s the MkI inline is\u00A0hot. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the first pic, after re-entry and dropping the speed to about 1000m/s I then went into a steep dive,\u00A0note the only part with temp bars is the command pod. \u00A0Its still hot after landing and the last pic shows Jeb after getting out with his temp bar right into the red.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022c2L8MXph.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022639\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/c2L8MXph.jpg\u0022 style=\u0022width:500px;height:320px;\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022733uzhyh.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022639\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/733uzhyh.jpg\u0022 style=\u0022width:500px;height:320px;\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022t0F2c3qh.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022639\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/t0F2c3qh.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, he\u0027s hotter than the command pod.
