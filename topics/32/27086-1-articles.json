It\u0027s pretty much due to past experiences when I\u0027ve had an awesome ship that had like 1 non-stock part on it, I get rid of the mod or plugin associated with that part, and my ship disappears...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntil earlier today I came across a plugin for a mod. The plugin was \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/mechjeb-command-pods-probes-0-18-robaus-warehouse/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMechJeb Command Pods and Probes\u003C/a\u003E and pretty much what it does, is let the stock Command Pods and Probes have the built-in ability to use MechJeb. Now I don\u0027t use MechJeb much, and even less because you have to attach a non-stock part to a vessel to use it, so I went ahead and gave the plugin a look.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a bit of research I came to the conclusion that I was going to install this plugin, but the only issue was that since I have \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/remotetech-3/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERemoteTech\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/ioncross-crew-support-plugin/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EIoncross Crew Support\u003C/a\u003E, both my Command Pods and Probes already had plugin properties saved in their part.cfg files, and if I just dropped the zip for \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/mechjeb-command-pods-probes-0-18-robaus-warehouse/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMechJeb Command Pods and Probes\u003C/a\u003E into my KSP folder, it would completely overwrite the other plugins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I decided to do was go into the part.cfg files and see just exactly what this plugin was adding to the parts, then transfer the properties over manually. As I was doing this however I came to a (for me) rather surprising discovery about the plugin, that \u003Cstrong\u003Eall it was doing was adding the same properties that are in the MechJeb part\u003C/strong\u003E into the Command Pods and Probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow... With this in mind, I have come to an amazing conclusion that will help drastically with my fear of non-stock parts. The conclusion is... \u003Cstrong\u003EDon\u0027t use non-stock parts!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, this is a rather obvious way to solve a fear of non-stock parts, but there\u0027s more... Instead of using these non-stock parts that are for plugins such as MechJeb, Protractor and Logomatic, I can instead \u003Cstrong\u003Emove the functionality of these non-stock parts into stock parts!\u003C/strong\u003E ITS AMAZING!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, there is my little awesome discovery for the day, if anyone wants to share their opinions on the matter I would love to hear them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TriggerAu","CreatedById":57838,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T07:34:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat find Cori, I use this method myself and remember when I understood it too. in the mod copy of the game I play I tend to only use plugin style mods, so any that require a part in a ship to run I do as you have and add the module pieces to the right stock parts - adding the lazor docking cam to docking ports, adding flight enginerr to command pods, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a fan of this method, now to see what 0.20 brings...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
