As with everything that we disclose, folks, please do remember that things do change.\u003Cp\u003EIn 0.25, the Win64 build is actually more unstable than in 0.24.x. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhereas in 0.24.x we\u0027d see it being pretty reliable with stock but crashing with add-ons/plugins, in 0.25 it crashes for nearly everyone and almost at the exact same point. We\u0027ve spent a significant amount of time in Experimentals, both on a tester and developer side, looking into it, chasing leads, narrowing down reproduction cases and generally digging deeper and deeper into probable causes. However, despite the efforts of a handful of the testers who have tirelessly (and I mean \u003Cem\u003Etirelessly\u003C/em\u003E) worked on it since the beginning of Experimentals, we have yet to hammer this one out, find the cause and fix it. The dastardly issue that causes it to crash still eludes us. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelieve me, this frustrates no-one more than myself, the testers who\u0027ve worked so hard on the issue and, without a doubt, the developers. However, sometimes we have to bite the bullet, call it a day and concentrate on the issues that effect all platforms. Until such a point where this issue is at least narrowed down to a specific cause, if not fixed, 0.25 Win64 will continue to be extremely unstable for many. We\u0027ll hopefully have something sorted out for the release that is beneficial to all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy apologies that the win64 build has such issues, but rest assured we work tirelessly to hammer \u0027em out!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you can all still enjoy the rest of the delicious update when the time comes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the update!

I think the biggest problem is that Squad didn\u0027t empthisize enough that the building destruction was due to a major feature that will be released in 0.26. From what I have read it seems that many users think that it is a feature in its self and not the result of a greater mechanic. Because from what I can gather we wouldn\u0027t have destructible buildings if we didn\u0027t have the major feature in 0.26.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf people misunderstood, it\u0027s because they didn\u0027t read the Dev notes.
