But why are the models for the new building wonky? Why does the destroyed runway allow a small rover to fit snug underneath with room for a Kerbal on top? Why are resources never coming? Why did this take so long? This game is in alpha, not regular access, not beta, alpha. Bugs are prone. You should fix them, but also get rid of experimental tests. Give it to us, not someone who signed something saying you\u0027ll give them the report. It\u0027s like you guys don\u0027t even know about the very forum section you made for bugs, and how to treat them. I paid for this game to get a game that is fun to play, and constantly updated. Not a game that\u0027s fun for 5 hours and updated two/three times a year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, stop forcing Mod packs down our throat. I don\u0027t want FASA or RSS or FAR, I want KSP fixed. You guys are hired by us, in a way, to do your job, which is to fix the damned game, and make it better. If it really is hard to make updates, then tell us. Tell us exactly what your doing, and issues your having. Perhaps my eyes will open, if they aren\u0027t already. But also consider this as an eye opener, because this update is the most depressing update released. No fun in it except new plane parts and updated model (That doesn\u0027t have the interior yet, even though it\u0027s based on the old one, and is only a matter of pushing internals in). At the very least release a bug update once a week, and maybe a fairing, or internal once a month, along with large updates at the normal pace. At least you\u0027ll seem busy, and that\u0027s all I want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T07:08:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou paid a pittance for a game in a WIP state.

It\u0027s not just plugging in some new assets and say some magic words and good to go. Stuff get optimized, rewritten to accommodate new functions and new stuff added. The point is not so much how many new features and assets that get included in a new major update, but that the new update conforms to the roadmap the developers have set out for the finished product. We\u0027re in early on an ongoing project. It is not as if we bought into the new billion dollar flashy iteration of CoD or something such trivial. We bought into something different - better. An indie studio with patience and no set deadline. And thanks to us, the funds to complete their vision. So it may take a while, that is fine.

Believe me, you don\u0027t want to have to deal with some of the bugs that have occurred before the builds get nicely stable. Spaceplanes exploding because you engaged ASAS? Yeah, no. Whatever you see in the release versions is incredibly mild compared to the horrors I\u0027ve witnessed, and if you do find bugs that haven\u0027t been reported, we have a support section for modded and unmodded installs that is there specifically for making Squad aware of problems so that they can prioritise and deal with them as they come up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course if you \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E want to deal with the unmitigated terror, keep an eye out on the Daily or Announcement forums. You\u0027ll find applications for experimentals crop up every now and then, and the team can always use useful bug testers. The main reason for keeping those builds under wraps is precisely because of the instability mentioned above. If that sort of thing went live, these forums would probably collapse under the strain of the complaints, and nobody wants that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd with that, I think this thread is done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
