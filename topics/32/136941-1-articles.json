Take the CoM of the asteroid, and attach the drive section so that it provides a force straight through the CoM. Then, to allow the drive section to do a useful amount of work, attach an ISRU unit and several drills somewhere that the CoM won\u0027t be moved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeally, you will want the CoT going straight through not only the CoM, but also the approximate center of volume (CoV) so that when you aerobrake at the target body, the asteroid doesn\u0027t flip around nearly as much. Now, this suggests putting the entire assembly on in a single taller vessel, so that everything is protected by the asteroid\u0027s mass and bulk during reentry, but that is, in fact, the wrong way to do this. The best (in my opinion) way to wrangle an asteroid is to attach a series of very short modules to the surface all on one side of the asteroid, such that you can align the CoT, CoM, and CoV, which will translate roughly to having the CoL/CoD in that same line during an aerobraking maneuver.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving all of the components in a single rocket will increase the likelihood of the rocket flexing under the thrust, even when using the relatively low thrust of a NERVA cluster. My solution prevents that as much as possible. One can even have a drive section made up of only a Klaw, probe core, and the engines, as the asteroid will cross-feed between tanks clawed to any other part of it, which allows for some truly low profile Asteroid Wrangling modules.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR: build a bunch of shorter modules and attach them closer together, because taller rockets get all wobbly, which runs the risk of an escalating procession, and a lack of controllability\u00A0to the massive space rock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-15T00:54:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did an asteroid ship long before mining was a (stock) thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nTmzTU\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://flic.kr/p/nTmzTU\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI grant it\u0027s not the biggest rock, but a pusher seemed to work fine for me.

And steering is handled by the separate \u0022control sections\u0022, they act to turn the asteroid which in turn turns the drive section with it.
