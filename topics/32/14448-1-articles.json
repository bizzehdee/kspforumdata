Most control surfaces seem to have the opposite of the intended behavior, no matter where or how I place them. As in, if I tell the craft to go left, all the control surfaces will orient themselves as if to push it right. If I try to raise pitch, all the control surfaces move as if to drive my craft into the ground. This holds true no matter what orientation the control surfaces are placed with, it adapts to always do the opposite of what they should do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-17T07:28:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat sounds really weird, Stromko.

The MK2 and MK3 cockpits have the reversed input that I was talking about, but the MK1 and Command Pod don\\\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther components that I attach winglets to also seem to reverse the input like that. Currently I have an Mk1 cockpit on the pad with a \u0027Mk3 to Mk2\u0027 hull module attached behind it. The winglets on the hull module are reversed, while the winglets on the Mk1 cockpit are acting as they should. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I seem to be experiencing is that some components will reverse the input on winglets, others won\\\u0027t?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: After a couple hours work I was actually able to get a controllable plane into the air, by experimenting with what parts did and did not reverse the control service orientation. It doesn\\\u0027t matter at all how I flip the control surfaces when I put them on, all that matters is that some base components will cause any control surfaces put on them to have their output flipped once in-game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m done tinkering at the moment, though. On the nth attempt to refine the design, it glitched and now loading the design takes a few minutes and once it\\\u0027s in half of it is transparent and bright white, while the right side of the screen is filled with a single stage consisting of landing gear and some sort of struts alternating all the way down. Couldn\\\u0027t take the bugged part of and salvage it or anything.

In screenshot 75 the canards are correct for turning right, 76 for pitch up (sorry, that one\\\u0027s a little hard to see), and 77 for roll right. Is that not what you\\\u0027re seeing? Are you rotating the canards before attaching them, because strangely enough, I found that this caused the reversed set to work backwards for pitch and yaw, but they still worked correctly for roll. (No, come to think of it, they\\\u0027d still \u0027work\u0027 properly for roll if they were 180 degrees off, wouldn\\\u0027t they?)
