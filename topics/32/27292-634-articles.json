Got said craft into the perfect position, it was going the right way, I had all the required equipment, but the game didn\u0027t credit me for fulfilling the contract\u0027s conditions. Realized later that I\u0027d missed the most basic requirement - \u003Cstrong\u003Eit had to be a new craft\u003C/strong\u003E. I\u0027d sent a probe I\u0027d launched previously... #facepalm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I switched over to the Bad Idea 7e, a 4-passenger Mun lander hauling a group of tourists with Valentina at the helm. Got to Mun, landed, Val planted a flag to fulfill another contract, launched back to space, burned for home...and ran out of gas. Val and company are now stuck with a Pe of 600,000 meters. #doublefacepalm\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGot Val out to push. The moment she stepped out of the capsule, the ship started tumbling for no apparent reason. Couldn\u0027t hold its course, so pushing was not an option. I was lucky to get Val back into the cockpit before she ran out of jetpack thrust...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo problem, sez I! I use KIS/KAS!! I\u0027ll send up Bill in a rescue ship (Ferris would have to pilot, since Jeb\u0027s out with Bob headed to Minmus) to plug in and transfer fuel!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have any docking ports, plugs or winches unlocked in my tech tree. #facepalm_trifecta\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut wait! There\u0027s a 90-science node that I haven\u0027t unlocked that has Clamp-O-Tron Jrs, which would be enough to dock on long enough to transfer a little bit of fuel! So all I need to do is go get some science, unlock the node and the rescue mission is on! So I load Ferris and Bill into a Bad Idea 7d, a science Mun lander, and send them to the Mun. Got them into orbit, landed them in the East Crater...to remember as soon as I saw the results of the sci bomb explosion - no science collected - that the East Crater is where I\u0027d sent Jeb and Bob on the Munar first landing mission and they\u0027d already tapped out that area. It was before they could plant flags. Not enough delta-V to takeoff, reach another biome and expect to make it back to Kerbin. #mega_facepalm\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily, I found a spot on the way home (in high orbit around the Mun) where I hadn\u0027t already plumbed out all the science, and I was able to get about 80 points worth from what was left out of that area. I might\u0027ve preferred to pick up a soil sample or two, but oh well. I got that science back home and was able to unlock the Clamp-O-Trons. In the process I was able to level up Bill. Now the challenge will be to get the rescue ship up there and everything in place before the Bad Idea 7e\u0027s trajectory is thrown off by another Mun encounter. Couldn\u0027t tell you when that would happen. Hoping to pull off the rescue this evening. Meanwhile, I need to find some aspirin...I facepalmed a bit much last night......\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T13:43:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFinishing a Minmus mission that managed to get to four biomes easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrought home a tourist tour around Kerbin\u0027s moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransmitted my first 50 lab science!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScanned Kerbin for 10 science!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce more started designing a space station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstalled some part of the Rennaissance Pack and got all excited about how much better even half the deal looks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sufficient Anonymity","CreatedById":57923,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T14:20:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat did I do in KSP today?

So I needed a little quick cash to upgrade Mission Control again. The two-man tug set off from Stopover Station, gathered a pair of orbital rescuees, then returned them to the station. They used a descent pod, so I needed to put another up.

While it uses primarily lower-tech parts, this rocket is cheaper and more effective (bringing a greater unused fuel quantity) than my previous fueler. It still needs to drain a touch from the four radial payload tanks, but that adds up to less than an FL-T100, and a descent pod was brought up, too. I think drag-reduction has helped it, mostly, though I guess it could also bring some Monopropellant up. The new pod is higher-tech and lighter than the old one, but it\u0027s still two capsules, a \u0027chute and a probe core at heart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/ewfeyB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ewfeyB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also managed to scrape together enough science and funding to get the Aviation node and buy its parts, so with my midrange SPH and runway, I put together a cheap little plane to fly to the Island Runway.
