However, when 0.19 came around my game began running a little bit smoother. I turned them on and brought the density up to %100, but when I opened up the game, no trees/rocks were to be seen. I thought maybe it was just the space center, so I went to the tracking station and opened up a Mun Base: same result...nothing. I played around with the slider but it had no effect (%100 is just as dense as %10). Getting desperate, I turned on cheats and strapped a Mainsail onto a tiny rocket and began traveling around Kerbin in search for terrain features. Nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know the feature works and I\u0027ve seen how dense it\u0027s supposed to be in videos. So... what am I doing wrong?
