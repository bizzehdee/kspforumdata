While passing a few hundred meters over the moon I started a burn with my mailsail engine that I had not used yet. Well the stress was too much for my poor docking ports to handle and the ship split into four pieces, that\u00A0proceeded to smash into each other. Half the crew was instantly killed while the other half (Propelled by the collisions) smashed straight into the mun\u0027s surface.

It was around the time that I was just beginning to understand how to put a rocket together to visit the Mun - the key phrase being \u0022beginning to understand\u0022. I had yet to figure out how to dock, so all of my missions at that time had to be direct ascent. I also didn\u0027t know how to quicksave.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I sent a kerbal to the Mun. The lander fell over. I sent a rescue mission: an uncrewed command pod with a probe core for control.. I neglected to include solar panels, so that mission flew straight past the Mun. The next mission I sent involved two command pods, one of which contained a pilot. I managed to land that within a couple of kilometers of the initial lander (oddly enough, precision landing from low orbits has never posed much of a challenge for me). Of course, that lander fell over too. I think I ended up having to send a mission to Minmus in order to unlock the 3-kerbal command pod, after which I sent a third rescue mission to the Mun to recover both of the kerbals who remained stranded there. That one was a success.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother disaster I had was failing to include enough fuel in the ascent module of a Mun lander (this one used the Munar orbit rendezvous technique). I managed to EVA my kerbals into Munar orbit, but I forgot to pick up the several hundred points of science data that had been collected, and so the entire mission ended up being fruitless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nascarlaser1","CreatedById":166190,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-23T17:20:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpace Taxi 1.
