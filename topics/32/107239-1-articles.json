Instead of spamming xenon tanks, you can re-purpose a FL-T400 or something like that. With the LV-N now using only Liquid Fuel, it would also neatly solve the whole \u0022all rocket fuel tanks now have crap mass ratios when using LV-N, even when dumping out the Oxidizer\u0022 problem.\n\nEdit: There\u0027s probably other things a stock fuel tank switching module could do, like custom fuel/ox ratios for spaceplane tanks or something like that.\n\nEdit2: Now that we have wet wing parts stock, being able to switch those tanks around would be nice as well.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T19:43:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 07:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SciMan**"}]}
