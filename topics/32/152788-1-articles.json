I\u0027ve created a Kerbin space station and a Mun space station but I am not sure what to do next. I don\u0027t fancy going to eve but I still haven\u0027t done any\u00A0science recovery from Duna or a manned mission. I either needs some tips on how to get a manned mission to Duna and back or any suggestions on what to do next(please don\u0027t suggest a surface base of any kind as I have ruled them out as pointless except minmus mining bases.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chiron0224","CreatedById":147812,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-30T19:30:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nManned Duna landing is probably your next step.\u00A0 I\u0027ve only done it a couple of times but I do mine Apollo style with a Command and service mother ship and a disposable lander.\u00A0 One advantage that Duna has is that it has an atmosphere so you can make use of parachutes to help kill velocity thus conserving a lot of fuel on the lander.\u00A0 Here is an album of my own Duna mission, don\u0027t click if you don\u0027t want spoilers and want to figure it out on your own but do click it if you want an example of one way it can be done \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/gallery/BCeWu\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/gallery/BCeWu\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Magzimum","CreatedById":167187,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-30T20:11:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI say a Kerballed mission\u00A0to\u00A0Duna or Gilly!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuna is the bigger challenge, but by the description you give us, you should be able to pull it off. Don\u0027t be afraid to fail, then you will only learn faster.\u00A0If you wanna take it slow, you can first get your Kerbal in orbit and back. But you are probably ready to land them on the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGilly is also fun. It\u0027s super-low gravity and weird orbit gives new challenges.

If not, you should practice. Assemble a multi-module station around the Mun, because the lower orbital velocity there gives you more room for error on docking (e.g. around 20m/s instead of several hundred for a moderately efficient rendezvous). Most interplanetary missions pretty much require the ability to dock; you can do them with a direct ascent profile but it\u0027s rather difficult.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, when you can dock spacecraft in orbit with reasonably good efficiency, a Duna mission is probably the first step to take towards making a successful interplanetary space program. You\u0027ll want a Duna lander, and a mothership that waits in Duna orbit. Duna missions are pretty easy once you know how to do orbital rendezvous; not much more challenging than the Mun. You\u0027ll need to know how to find the right launch window, because you can only get to Duna efficiently at certain times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ty Tan Tu","CreatedById":167214,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-01T16:19:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking at your already impressive accomplishments, how about landing an unmanned mining ship on Duna with a large fuel tank and some type of habitation module?\u00A0That way you make make fuel on Duna for a return trip to Kerbin while you are planing your manned mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-01T16:20:02Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2016 04:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Ty Tan Tu\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DocMoriarty","CreatedById":57433,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-01T23:21:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure how you are doing with science and if you are actually playing career, but if so i recommend doing missions on Mun (all large craters, each is its own biome) and to Minmus to do and return science so that you can unlock most of the research tree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI usually have unlocked nearly all the science before I start going to other planets.
