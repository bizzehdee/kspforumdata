For naming planets? I usually take a word that kinda describes them and translate into latin. For example, Canite is latin for blown. and Canite is a planet where a large portion of its surface was blown off. Or I do a little adjusting the latin word so its not potentially the same as somebody elses planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheOrios","CreatedById":207750,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-04T19:59:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni just kinda take whatever comes to mind\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni\u0027ve had crafts with names like \u0022Ares\u0022 and \u0022Voyager\u0022 to \u0022Onion\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mahnarch","CreatedById":114432,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-04T20:25:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe had a previous thread but, it would probably be a necro to post there. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EMine get named for their function using the \u0027SoHo\u0027 method.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E2ManNoSciMunFrturn = 2 Kerbal (man) with no science aboard for a Free Return Mun trajectory.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E4PassTAJSubOrb = 4 Passenger, Temp, Atmo and Science Jr, Sub orbital.
