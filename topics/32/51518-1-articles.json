So i thought just a bug, Rub that off, But then i tried to get the other guy to my buggy and...He got close then fell down and was getting up and fell through the map! I was like..Okay, So far this mission has been pointless due to this bug i guess, I then presumed just not to jump and speed time get the rest of the guys in the buggy...the leader of the search party (ME) fell through the map, Only 2 kerbals left!
