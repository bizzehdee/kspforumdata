Even with six of them powering one ion engine I can only run it consistently at around 1/3rd thrust. Rather than go into the part files and tweak the numbers (which would unquestionably feel like cheating) I\u0027d like to try and find a new part. Before I go and attempt the daunting task of designing a new part from scratch, I\u0027d like to know which models already exist out there.
