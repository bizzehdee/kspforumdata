Instead of doing what I might normally do and quicksave my way back into orbit and try a much shallower approach, I decided to go for it. my AOA was around 40 degrees during reentry and by the time I hit 30 km I was still going mach 6.2 and I was sure I was finished. But I managed to level out and gain altitude after that, as I watched KSC whiz by at 1.8km/s 30 km below. I pulled the plane around and went in to land. I quickly realized that I had slowed down too much and did not have enough fuel to reach KSC. Then I remembered the Island runway, I did have just enough for that. I set navutilities for Island runway 27 and began my ascent. when I was 10 km out I was still going 500 m/s, too fast to close. I ruin my perfect lineup and do some s turns. I manage to get my velocity to around 200 m/s at 2 km out. I descended, knowing I would have to touch down right as the runway began. I then realized there is a hill in front of the runway! I hit the engines and pulled up, narrowly avoiding firey demise.
