Thats for performance reasons but personaly I have no problem just nukeing them from the tracking station if its passing through the atmosphere. I figure their orbits would decay naturaly anyway if the simulation was compleat. Anything else I either leave or push outa orbit manualy although I generaly design missions to not leave random flotsam in orbits baring the ocasional transfer stage that ends up in a solar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
