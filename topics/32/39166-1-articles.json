Yesterday, I created a thread (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/42142-Two-Bugs-for-the-Price-of-One\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/42142-Two-Bugs-for-the-Price-of-One\u003C/a\u003E!) detailing a couple of bugs that had occurred to me. I come back to find that nobody has replied to the thread, which is a little disconcerting and somewhat rude in my opinion. So I decided to bump the topic to move it to where people can actually see it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly to find that the mods had moved it to some archive that neither I nor anyone else can reply to and which, in fact, will be deleted soon. Not only did nobody look at my problem, but it has been swept under the rug. So I ask the moderators, why has my problem been ignored and placed to where nobody will find it? I provided all the information that I could, including a save file, so what did I do wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Custard Donut (In Space)","CreatedById":58058,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T18:45:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was another small patch recently, could it maybe have fixed some of the bugs you were experiencing?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chaos_forge","CreatedById":64960,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T18:46:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe forums have also been rearranged.
