You have the mass of the fuel tank and engine, and you have the mass of the fuel. Now, if you take an SRB and fire it off alone, it will always have to lift the mass of the tank and engine, even as the mass of your fuel goes to zero (and runs out). Now, if you take two separate SRBs and fire them off simultaneously, they go to about the same height. If you take two SRBs and duct tape them together, they\u0027ll still go only as high as the two separate SRB, because, while the craft has twice as much fuel, it has twice as much mass as well. You can do this with as many SRBs as you want, and they\u0027ll always go the same height. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, think about what you said, about putting two SRBs on the side of an SRB capsule with a capsule on top of it. With one SRB under it, the SRB gets bogged down, because now it has to lift 1 capsule, along with its fuel, tank, and engine. However, if you put 2 SRBs on the side, the weight of the capsule is now divided among 3 SRBs. So, now the each only have to lift 1/3 of a capsule, plus one fuel tank and one engine. If you have 4 SRBs, it becomes 1/4 of a capsule. With 5 it becomes 1/5. However, the SRBs always still have to lift their own weight. So, if you have 99999999999999 SRBs and one capsule on a craft, each SRB has to lift their own weight plus 1/99999999999999 of a capsule. As you add more SRBs, you can get infinitely close to the equivalent of just one SRB to the point where you can much ignore that capsule, but you can never quite make it to equal exactly one SRB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you attach a car to boulder, odds are you won\u0027t be able to move it much.

Lets say I have a booster that has a thrust of 1 ton-force and weighs 1 ton. As TWR is thrust divided by weight, that gives me a TWR of 1 divided by 1, which equals 1. Now if I take a second identical booster and strap it on, I\u0027ve doubled the thrust to 2 tons, but I\u0027ve also doubled the weight to 2 tons, that makes my TWR 2 divided by 2, which also equals 1. We can see the diminishing returns if I strap a payload on top of this rocket (lets say it weights 500 pounds, or a quarter ton) and start adding more boosters. Now my rocket weighs 2.25 tons, but still has 2 tons of thrust. That means that the TWR is now 2/2.25 or .89. If I added another booster to compensate for that, we\u0027ll have a rocket that has a thrust of 3 tons but now weighs 3.25 tons, that brings our TWR up to .92. Another booster gives us 4 tons of thrust, and 4.25 tons of weight, but, when we divide those numbers, the TWR only goes up to .94. Add another booster and the TWR only goes up to .95. My numbers are rounded a bit, but you can see a trend here, right? For every booster I add the TWR goes up half as much as the previous booster. We\u0027ll eventually reach a point where the weight of the boosters added all but negates the added thrust of the new booster.

In fact, if you consider that as you add more fuel mass, you also must add some dry mass for the additional tankage, the ln term in the rocket equation ends up having an asymptote.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have dV = Vex * ln (m0/m1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook at the ratio m0/m1. That\u0027s full mass over dry mass. Let\u0027s assume we have a fixed payload of 10 kg, and that for every 10 kg of fuel we add, we need 1 kg of tankage dry mass. So, dry mass m1 = 10 \u002B x/10, and full mass becomes m0 = m1 \u002B x = 10 \u002B x/10 \u002B x = 10 \u002B 11x/10.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you then take the ratio of m0/m1 and simplify, you end up with something like (100 \u002B 11x)/(100 \u002B x). As x grows significantly large, you can begin to ignore the 100\u0027s and just have 11x/x, which simplifies to 11. That means as x grows large, the ratio approaches a value of 11 but never exceeds it. Thus, the natural log of that ratio can never exceed ln(11). The whole equation develops an asymptote - a value it approaches, and to which you can get arbitrarily close, but never reach or exceed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically as you continue to add more fuel, more and more of what you add is being expended to lift what you added instead of the payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this ignores the fact that adding mass to the craft lowers your TWR which has its own problems.

Get the ship off the ground - sounds pedantic but the first few seconds of flight are important, and getting the LF engines up. Sometimes you just need a thruster than can push that load up to 30 or 50 meters per second over a few seconds, then go bye-bye. The first few seconds of flight add more apparent:actual DV to the flight (this means devices that add thrust on the pad do not show up as much vacuum DV, but because they prevent hoovering of the craft on the pad, they can add alot to the actual DV the craft has when it reaches space). So those Sepratrons can come in handy for some loads just to get them moving, then kick them off with a TT38K. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that needs to be remembered is that momentum is important. if drag(100 m/s at LP alt) = 1g*mass then 50 m/s = 1/4th g and 25 m/s = 1/16th g. G-force is falling most quickly (change of g per change of altitude) close to the ground. So the force of drag is trivial at the launch pad, so its best to fight g with as much force as the ship will tolerate. So getting a vessel off the ground can take a vessel that has exactly 1g of acceleration moving and it will stay moving and begin to accelerate, but to do so you have to get it away from the pad and give it a seed momentum. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJob #2. Get the ship to 100 m/s (lower if its a sensitive load) - affords powering down the LF engines and sparing them until their ISP is higher. During this part of the flight drag force and gravity force are roughly equal, gravity is falling and main engines may need to be powered down more to prevent overspeed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJob #3. Get the ship past 5000 alt at 160 m/s - This separates from 2 because that span from 1000 meters to 5000 meters and from 100 m/s to 160 m/s the booster is carrying as much drag as it is fighting gravity, very little left to accelerate, and the craft accelerates because drag is falling, fuel is falling, and because gravity is falling a few percent. Main engines are still coming down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJob #4. Pushing fuel, Those inefficient space engines waste fuel, and the booster has a very draggy nose. So I put an aerotank on the nose of the booster and fuel line then I can use that wasty engine to help on the load. Tune the tank to expire when the booster depletes and ditch the booster and the weight of the tank, The main engine now has what it had on the launch pad, plus 100 m/s momentum, plus cleaner space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejob #5. Beyond 5000 meters the role is pretty minor, for single LFOx stages it might be to push an LV-909 or poodle to the point that its ISP is high enough to prevent fall back, otherwise better to switch to LFOx stages. If you are not pushing thrift next stage engines up, its time to switch to LFOx. IN some cases you might want to push the structural limits of the craft to exceed the speed of sound at 15000 alt in order to impart enough momemtum on a lousy atmosphere engine so that gravity and drag are low enough that it can do its job. The problem is that boosters hate to turn, and staging them at an incline can cause crash back (you lose your main engines due to booster collisions). So you don\u0027t often end up better since the boosters cannot make the desired gravity turn and you have an inefficient conversion of forward momemtum to desparately need horizontal momemtum. There are times with specific set ups where you WANT to go higher-up to make that turn, particularly if your craft is lumbering along (sensitive payloads), you may be better off with a asparagas setup.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T14:38:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESince SlabGizor117 asked us to ELI5 (Explain Like I\u0027m 5):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s pretend I want to lift you up as high as I can, but I\u0027m not strong enough to lift you at all, so I get a friend and we lift you together.
