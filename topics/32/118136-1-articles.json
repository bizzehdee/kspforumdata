I ask because I find that the default brake torque is often too slight to make a short enough landing in most circumstances, and I find it is a good idea to up the torque in order to help bring it to a controllable stop. A caution when doing this though, make sure that the rear wheels receive much more torque than the front. I prefer to leave the front torque alone and double the back torque from default, usually. If you have too much torque up front and not enough in back, you might find your plane flipping over its nose. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn that note, the new(ish) A.I.R.B.R.A.K.E.S. part is brilliant for this. Place a few of these near the back of your plane above the center of mass, make sure they are disabled for pitch and yaw, and just activate them like you do the wheel brakes. They can help to shed unwanted airspeed before you touchdown without throwing off your approach. Use them carefully to get down to a controllable gliding speed as you are coming in, and they help you slow down more quickly once you have made contact with the airstrip too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GraviTykillz","CreatedById":60694,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T20:04:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:System;\u0022\u003EA.I.R.B.R.A.K.E.S.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis makes all the difference for me in sheading speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T21:04:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022martinborgen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022martinborgen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes, I have been thinking of placing flags, however, upon switching to my spaceplane, the loading bugged and all parts separated.

I would say you should try and get down below that before touching down.
