The final decision was taken to park it at around 160 meters off the port of the station, and stop wrestling with a clearly underpowered SAS system and a just barely adequate RCS one, to call for reinforcements from AKS (Alpha Kerbin Station). The resident WorkBee was activated, moved to intercept, and captured the module. This time, mindful of their previous mistakes (see: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/29533-What-did-you-do-in-KSP-today?p=1693137#post1693137\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/29533-What-did-you-do-in-KSP-today?p=1693137#post1693137\u003C/a\u003E), the guys at Kerbal Space Centre were careful.
