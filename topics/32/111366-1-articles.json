They\u0027re a doddle---don\u0027t worry about them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 1.0.2, you get a greater slowing effect much higher in Jool\u0027s atmosphere than before. The Pe you need to get your Ap where you want will of course vary with your relative speed compared to Jool, which in turn depends on the angle at which you cross Jool\u0027s path, but any sort of reasonable efficient transfer on or near a window works out about the same. I haven\u0027t yet had to set my Pe lower than 190 to get out near Laythe. This means you hardly enter the atmosphere at all, so aren\u0027t in it long enough to heat up to dangerous levels no matter how bright the flames.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, your Ap post-aercocapture at Jool is now WAY more sensitive to slight differences in Pe, as in only a few hundred meters. There\u0027s really very little difference in Pe altitude between not capturing at all, getting an AP out near Tylo, or being eaten by Jool. So as always, set Pe, hit F5, see what happens, F9, tweak your Pe very slightly, F5 again, repeat until you end up with what you want. I can\u0027t wait until the Trajectories mod learns how to work in the stock atmosphere, which will reduce the hassle of this a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T23:59:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI can\u0027t wait until the Trajectories mod learns how to work in the stock atmosphere, which will reduce the hassle of this a lot.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a build up now that tentatively works with stock 1.0.2.
