During the airbreaking (at about 10k metres, maybe less), I saw a column of white smoke, about the size of a man (or maybe two kerbals, one on the other\u0027s shoulders) on the surface of the planet, appear for just a few seconds, then disappear. I don\u0027t think it had any limbs, but it did tail-off at the bottom, suggesting it wasn\u0027t just a cloud or anything, and it was off the decent path my rover was taking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know Duna is the stand-in for Mars in this game, so... are there ghosts on Duna?
