You do not escape the SOI of course, but that is not the definition of escape KSP uses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing a suborbital is an interesting strategy. That would require that at the point you leave Kerbin you have an orbital velocity of 1803 m/s around Kerbol (so your eliptical orbit is below Kerbol\u0027s surface). This means I guess escaping at about 7481 m/s retrograde.
