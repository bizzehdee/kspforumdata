In Photoshop, you would use either Merge Layers or Flatten Image to combine two or more layers into a single image. Alternatively, simply saving the file as a\u00A0 .jpeg, .png, .bmp, or other file type that doesn\u0027t support layers will automatically \u0022flatten\u0022 the image.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, having said that, I think we might be looking at something different here. I downloaded one of your flags and zoomed in on it with Photoshop (my eyes are not that\u00A0good anymore) and it does look like the \u0022minimalist.png\u0022 is visible through the \u0022custom flag\u0022 layer. I\u0027m not really sure what the specific command is for that, and I have no idea what would cause the minimalist.png to turn into a negative image, but I can offer some thoughts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you\u0027ve surmised, simply\u00A0merging the two layers would hide the ripple effects behind the foreground images. What I would probably try doing is leaving the custom\u00A0images (the flag and the mission patch) as a single layer with a transparent background. I would then move\u00A0the minimalist layer to the front, and gradually make it transparent (Photoshop has an \u0022opacity\u0022 slider) so that the custom elements show through it. I would then play with the contrast and brightness so that the darker \u0022ripples\u0022 continued to be visible while making sure the custom images weren\u0027t too washed out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless you\u0027re wanting that specific pattern of ripples,\u00A0it would probably be easier to use your editing software\u0027s tools to add a fabric effect to your custom image. It\u0027s also worth noting that KSP adds the \u0022minimalist\u0022 background automatically to in game flags, but not to the logos that appear on the ships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did a little bit of digging, and it looks\u00A0like you may be looking for Paint Shop Pro\u0027s \u0022Arithmetic\u0022 command.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://help.corel.com/paintshop-pro/v19/main/en/documentation/index.html#page/Corel_PaintShop_Pro%2FCombining_images.html%23\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://help.corel.com/paintshop-pro/v19/main/en/documentation/index.html#page/Corel_PaintShop_Pro%2FCombining_images.html%23\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-05T19:13:20Z\u0022 title=\u002210/05/2017 07:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 5, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Ten Key\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
