The view would have been awesome, but I messed up the landing just by inches and started to slide down the hill. On my way down (very long drop), debris was falling of but in the end the command pod and one solar panel survived so I planned a rescue mission. I built a craft, sent it to the crash site on Minmus and landed it 200 meters away from the crashed pod. So far so good, but then weird things started to happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI pressed \u0022[\u0022 to switch from the rescue craft to the crashed pod, but it didn\u0027t do anything. Then I tried to go to the space center and control the crashed pod from there, but that button was dead. Stuck with this situation I wanted to end the flight, but again... dead button. So, there was nothing else I could do: switch to the task manager and kill the process. After that I reloaded my game and I was rather surprised to see that the rescue craft was still orbiting Minmus... like it had never landed? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis turned out to be an endless loop. In total I\u0027ve tried this 3 times, all with the exact same result. After that I ended the flight by restarting the game and terminate the orbiting rescue craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know what\u0027s going on here? What triggered this? It seemed like a normal flight, nothing strange at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T08:03:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour game crashed, it did an autosave while you was in orbit and restored this then you started again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T09:08:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had something similar happen like this more than once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a software glitch associated with something going on at the crash site or orbiting craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s frustrating, but if it keeps happening, the only thing you can do is delete the flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily it is a rare bug.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T09:41:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got a bug like this in where I docked and the spacecraft blew up.
