Another prime example of hot lo leverage this is to sort by part diameter size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-A taller Hanger building\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ability to add/remove/change command modules during building\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-More obvious highlighting of selected parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Allow a staging overview, ie ability to highlight all parts activated in a given stage stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Remove static parts from staging view (one can not \u0027activate\u0027 a strut, for example.

Take the folding latter as an example. I have to click the part on the craft to activate it currently, but it would be nice to just do so from the staging menu. Even better create a sub-menu with the flight ops GUI that groups all dynamic parts together, for easier access of activation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Allow a special \u0027emergency\u0027 stage, that would activate, say, an escape tower, and be assigned to a given hot-key.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope any of that helps.
