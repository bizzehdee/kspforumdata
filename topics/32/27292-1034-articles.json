I kind of goofed off on them for the Eve mission, but when Duna came into alignment I sent two rover-carrying probes that way, and I got the gravity assist on one of them pretty much on the nose (and understood what was slightly off with the other one). In any case, I\u0027m getting them there with barely more fuel expenditure than it takes to get to the Mun. Also getting a feel for delta-v expenditure in general.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway. Eve Explorer I. I got her to Eve all right. My design worked out mostly okay although there were a couple of hiccups: the rocket was very tall and somewhat wobbly so launch was something of a white-knuckle affair; I had to pilot manually because \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E would throw it into a crazy oscillation.\u00A0Also, my extra fuel tank ran out during the deceleration burn towards Eve, and I hadn\u0027t intended for the possibility to jettison it before getting there and setting up the experiments. I did some savescumming to see if I could figure something out, but the configuration of my ship wouldn\u0027t let me without throwing the geometry really completely out of whack, so I ended up hauling that empty tank all the way there. If I had understood gravity assists properly that might not have been necessary. Another hiccup was that I had installed the decoupler rings for the Eve lander in the wrong order, so they stuck on the heat shield. That was more of a cosmetic issue though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomewhat more annoying was that I had failed to pack enough batteries on the lander to transmit back an atmospheric analysis -- that\u0027s 72 Science sitting there with nowhere to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than that, the mission is going more or less according to plan.

The hauler, orbiter, and science modules are on their way back, although it\u0027ll be another year before the orbits are in sufficient alignment to get there. I\u0027m confident I have more than enough fuel for the job.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext time I\u0027ll pay more attention to orbital inclinations and gravity assists, provide for more contingencies, and be a lot more efficient about it.
