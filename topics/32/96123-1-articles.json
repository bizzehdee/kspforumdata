I still hadn\u0027t quite figured out how to get good paths and so I tended to just have a stack of shields in the way and hoped for the best. I had Jeb piloting this ship that was a mix of a communications satellite deployment vessel as well as a science ship. I was playing with the communications mod, so this was pretty necessary for my first trip or two. Anyway, he was coming in for a polar landing (snagging some delicious polar science) and he was coming in a bit too hot. I left the descent rocket in place and when it began to redline, I burned the last of its fuel, but quickly the rocket, then the tank, then the separatron burned away. Then the first shield. Second. Third. I\u0027m getting worried because its clearly going to burn Jeb up and I have nothing left. I\u0027m freaking out going \u0022What can I do?!

To make it worse the flight computer predicted a Mun flyby resulting in Kerbin SOI escape for the next round around Kerbin. All I could do was making Jeb to get all science data gathered on the Mun go on EVA and make a correction burn with the jetpack and pray. Fortunately It was enough for him to reach a stable orbit and on the next launch window the rescue mission was succesful. Jebs rocket still orbits the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T22:21:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFive kerbals went to Minimus for a training mission, a \u0027get science data from\u0027 contract, and a parts test.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI forgot the antenna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter realising I\u0027d cocked up the maneuver node and quickloaded.
