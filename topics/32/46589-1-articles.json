You can use copyrighted material, even for commercial purposes, so long as it is done as a \u0022fair use\u0022 ... one of many exceptions to the copyright owner\u0027s monopoly on use. The leading case on this is Campbell v. Acuff Rose which involved 2livecrew\u0027s parody of the song \u0022pretty woman\u0022 ... used without ANY permission from the original owner. Read and follow the rules in that case and you\u0027ll be fine.

Squad cannot say much so long as you are not trying to \u0027pass off\u0027 or otherwise use their trademarks to misrepresent your work as theirs. For instance, typing the words \u0022Monkey Squad\u0022 is a violation of trademark, but is acceptable under the theory of \u0022nominative use\u0022 in that one cannot speak of a product without using that trademark. Describing what you did today, ie playing KSP, may use trademarked terms and images but is not a violation because there is no other way of describing your day without using them. ie \u0022I ordered a Coke with my lunch\u0022 is not a violation of Coke\u0027s trademark. The best way to ensure this protection is to include a \u0022not associated with xyz\u0022 disclaimer somewhere on your work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not your lawyer.
