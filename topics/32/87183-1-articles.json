I made a tank that shoots the big NASA SRBs horizontally (with some fancy fuel tweaking for them and attached Sepratrons), and it has 12 such shots. They typically hit buildings at about 350m/s. Using this tank, I\u0027ve found that any given building might take from 1 to 8 or more shots to destroy, even with I shoot it in the same place on them from the place on the ground in multiple tries. This applies to all actual buildings, from VAB to various parts of the R\u0026amp;D complex, even to Tracking Station dishes. The only \u0022buildings\u0022 that routinely go down from a single hit are the spherical fuel tanks, the water towers, and other things that are essentially just decoration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea why building damage is so variable, but I\u0027m totally cool with it because that\u0027s kinda how things are in the real world. Anyway, the plan is to NOT destroy buildings. Like Harv said, good players should never have to worry about this. So the short answer is, if you\u0027re having trouble killing your buildings, then you need to improve your KSP skilz \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, that\u0027s buildings. The runway I consider totally fine as-is, too. TBH, I\u0027ve never broken the runway except intentionally with a VERY heavy vehicle build simply to crush the runway. I\u0027ve never had it happen from a plane I intended to be an actual working vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat leaves the launchpad. I have had this break on me a couple of times. First time I had an insanely huge rocket that just broke it under its own weight immediately on physics load. But I fixed that with the simple expedient of jacking the rocket up a short distance with launch clamps. The other time was testing the landing legs of a 3.75m lander weighing only about 20 tons, so I flew it up about 20m and then cut the engines and let it fall, and it killed the pad on impact (although the legs worked fine \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E). So lesson learned there is to not do drop tests on the launchpad but hover the thing off to the side a bit first. And in the meantime, launch rockets from the runway until I feel like spending the money to fix the launchpad \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m happy with things the way they are. There\u0027s no real excuse for damaging your buildings accidentally, the runway seems reasonably durable, and even if the launchpad is flimsey, there are very simple workarounds to protect it. And having buildings reasonably likely to die from mishaps is a good incentive to become a better player.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tripzter","CreatedById":75335,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T05:34:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBuildings are great however the runway and the launch platform should not be breakable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T08:25:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tripzter\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tripzter\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBuildings are great however the runway and the launch platform should not be breakable.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut... realism!

And they are, in terms of being resistive to being totally blown to bits. However, even in real life they\u0027re actually quite vulnerable to minor damage. Concrete spalls and chips, sometimes cracks and tilts slightly, and airplanes are constantly having small parts fall off. All these things can put a runway out of commission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue is that planes move so fast that even a slight imperfection in the surface can trip them up, blow tires, or kick up debris that damages the plane. Remember what happened to the Concorde? That sort of thing, although, without such a disastrous outcome, happens all the time, and the potential for disaster is always there. So runways have to be inspected almost constantly for damage and FOD, and are frequently taken out of service for minor repairs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s just from normal use. Now imagine if you crash some large plane on it. Sure, the plane will splat like a bug on the concrete surface but its sturdier bits will gouge up the surface. Then when the firemen spray water on the lake of burning fuel, the hot concrete underneath will spall, the rebar in it will lose its strength from exposure to heat, etc. All of this will make the surface unsafe and require extensive repairs, maybe lasting months due to having to rebuild large sections. Now, after the wreckage gets carted away and the soot hosed off, you might not be able to notice any damage from a distance--the runway still looks like the strip if concrete it was before. But it\u0027s messed up bad in detail and thus the need for repairs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, keeping all this in mind, I don\u0027t think the KSP runway is too fragile.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
