Where can I sign up/join this if possible? I actually do stream KSP, I\u0027m a hardcore player (using deadly reentry and life support) on interstellar trips. My local buddies usually watch me but if any KSP fans are out there I would like them to join in. Is there anywhere I can post on the forums when/where I will be streaming? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m mapping out another interplanatery flight possibly for tonight or tomorrow to Eeloo if anyone wants to watch. Just wondering if there was a forum to share these on or if I just post them here. Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
