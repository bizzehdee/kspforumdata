I went home last night intending to spend a few minutes knocking together a rocket and heading off, but I spent an\u00A0hour\u00A0just designing a rover full of science gear along with a\u00A0deployment system. Then I had to mount it under a lander with enough clearance underneath\u00A0to drive off before discovering the landing struts were in the way, the struts were\u00A0too short and on top of that I\u0027d forgotten to add actual rockets and fuel\u00A0to get it down to the surface. Then there were size limits to accommodate the fairing.\u00A0What followed were\u00A0several iterations and configurations of parts in various combos as I compromised, hit walls, deleted entire sub-assemblies and moved toward a complete design at a snails pace. \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time I had the entire rocket assembled, three hours had passed and I had no time to actually fly it. And I loved every frustrating moment of it. You have to wonder at the amount of work NASA engineers had to do even during the relatively simple Gemini program. I\u0027m really starting to enjoy myself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks to the devs and the community who supported this excellent game in its formative years.

The crewed vessel was thrown together sort of adhoc, the only considerations given proper thought were the food and EC supplies.
