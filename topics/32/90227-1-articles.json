I then had a ferry which would take them over to mun and minmus where their hitch hiker can could dock with a pad on the ground next to a munbase - I was planning a duna base as well as a large passenger ferry to take them out there and back. I was also planning on making a luxury resort on Laythe and have a ferry system to a port in low laythe orbit with ssto\u0027s which would shuttle the tourists down to the resort.
