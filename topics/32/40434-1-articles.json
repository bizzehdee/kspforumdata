However after the .21 patch I have been rebuilding my Kerbal empire and recolonizing Duna and Laythe. During one such colonization run I happened to find myself leaving Kerbin at a high altitude (slingshot maneuver from the Mun after visiting my Kethane refineries there) while a Munar eclipse transpired. I was actually very awestruck at the sight and thought I would share it with the community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you Squad for making such a wonderful game.
