I suppose its not really an SSTO if it lands with less parts than it took off with, right? Tweaking of the base model will occur, and a second attempt will be made tonight. I think key is setting the Mk2-Mk1 forward LF as a non-draw reserve for balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, Murphy\u0027s Law would have it; after 10, \u0022artful, aesthetic\u0022 designs, the one I threw together that looks like a collapsed Pipe Organ is the one that works... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf a further test is successful, I will see about posting in the K-Prize section- this has certainly caused enough angst \u0026amp; time expenditure to warrant trying for the badge! - Special thanks to Slashy, whose postings on SSTO philosophy were very helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T16:35:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENah, its still an SSTO, you made it to orbit in one piece!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts just not a SSTOAB...
