Squad has already upgraded from unity 3 to 4 in the past and that went fine without too many serious issues. Unity 5 might be a bit more complicated since it brings so much new features but still probably very doable and nowhere near as hard as porting it to a different engine. And what you say about more memory use is kinda wrong as well, since the game as it is now is not optimized yet and still has alot of extra code needed. Squad has already stated that there is work going on behind the scenes that will greatly reduce the amount of memory it uses which will more than make up for whatever new features that are added.

And Windows KSP uses less RAM with OpenGL, which is another reason for Squad to focus on it. Oh, and anti-aliasing not working with AMD GPU\u0027s.
