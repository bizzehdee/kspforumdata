Otherwise, you have to run windowed (smaller than screen resolution) and not minimize, but keep the window open. I think the game deactivates when minimized no matter what the settings are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t remember if someone posted the way to run in full screen window or not, but I think it was here before the forum wipe.
