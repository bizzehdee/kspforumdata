If two years on he\u0027s still so bothered by this after having been laid off by Squad, one has to wonder what he\u0027s been doing in the meantime?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are usually some ill-feelings in any layoff situation like this, that much goes without saying,\u00A0but generally speaking you get a new job, get busy there, and the feelings dull with the passing of\u00A0time and lack of time to worry about it in the interim. If he\u0027s still this vehement about things this far along one has to wonder if he\u0027s been able to find gainful employ in the meantime. If not, could this be due to a lack of real qualifications and skills? I mean, I\u0027m not trying to put the guy down but streaming is something you can get for free from the community and doing some HTML work to structure a newsletter is not a 40 hour per week activity. If he\u0027s got real skills and brings such good things to the table then he should have had no problem finding employ elsewhere and being swept up in the excitement of working there, not carrying a pitchfork for two years waiting for the opportune moment to stick it to Squad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond that, he\u0027s throwing out information to make Squad look bad but really doesn\u0027t provide enough detail. What was the nature of his employment with Squad? Was he hired on as a full-time W-2 type employee, a part-time employee,\u00A0or was his role more that of a 1099-MISC contractor? NDA means nothing, most any company will have you sign a non-disclosure agreement when you take a job with them, especially in the gaming space. If he was a contractor as opposed to an employee, $2400 could really be quite reasonable. For example, he mainly talks about a newsletter and streaming. Streaming he was apparently already doing for free, so I don\u0027t see why Squad would opt to pay for it, and the Newsletter shouldn\u0027t take more than a handful of hours every week, certainly not 40! If he wasn\u0027t satisfied with his pay structure he was certainly free to seek employment elsewhere, yet he only left when terminated, so at the time he was clearly okay with that pay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHonestly, reading this over the poster, if it was indeed this ex-employee, showed his true hand at the end when he declared the intent of all this. He\u0027s (allegedly) an ex-employee with a vendetta who seeks only to smear Squad\u0027s name in the press and hurt their sales. I\u0027d venture to guess that he probably has had a difficult time finding employment post-Squad which has served to fuel his resentment and, as a result, has gone on this scorched earth campaign. The sad fact is that all he\u0027s really accomplished, if this is truly this guy, is to ruin much of his chances of working in the industry again. This is one of those things you simply do not do, you don\u0027t burn a former employer. Doing so leads potential future employers to worry about what you\u0027ll do if things don\u0027t work out with them and it generally makes you a bad risk, especially if you don\u0027t bring meaningful skills to the table.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI fail to see the relevance of any of this. If all employers treated all employees as badly as he suggests he\u0027s been treated, how would any of us ever professionally achieve anything? Regardless of his employment situation since, it doesn\u0027t make right any alleged prior abuses.
