(This could take MANY orbits.) Then play with the maneuver node system and try to get an intercept with a small nudge.

When you dock (or try to make an encounter with a planet) your goal is to wind up in the same place at the same time. What you have produced is a situation where you\u0027ll be in roughly the same place as Duna but always trailing behind it a bit. Just eyeballing it, it looks like Duna will eventually catch up to you, but it might take hundreds of game years before that happens. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour periapsis looks like it is touching Duna\u0027s orbit, more or less. Try putting a maneuver node there with a prograde burn. You should be able to add enough velocity to the burn to eventually get an encounter. I don\u0027t know how your ship is put together, so this might wind up being more delta-v than you\u0027ve got to spend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA less costly way to do it would be to make a small prograde burn at your periapsis (maybe 100-500 m/s) and then make an orbit of the sun. Duna should have changed position with respect to you by a noticeable amount in that time. Do laps of the sun and let Duna catch up to you. On the last lap (when it looks like Duna is going to pass you by on the next orbit) plan a retrograde burn at periapsis that is just large enough to get an encounter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Vanamonde said, this is going to take some time, but you get the old school experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SoldierHair","CreatedById":62167,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T18:56:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd now the sad news:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was planning to change the orbit , which i did.After a while i was like \u0022Wait , lets try to build a spaceplane again!*Presses the Space Center button* Wait , what the *press again* why am i not going back to space center.Ok , i can do the mission again , End Flight .I SAID END FLIGHT.Oh for ... *alt-f4*\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s pretty much it.When i went back into game the flight was no longer there.The ship\u0027s files are still there , i can try again , but still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is : now after every flight i must exit the game and reenter to get back to the Space Center.This happened after i installed the Soviet Parts mod.It\u0027s pretty much annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SoldierHair","CreatedById":62167,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T19:21:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFixed it after i reinstalled KSP.Tommorow Katyusha is going either to Duna or Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brians200","CreatedById":26572,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T19:21:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou are running out of memory.
