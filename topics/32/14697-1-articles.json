They did it fairly well, better then many fake maps.

The trick comes in looking beyond the \u0027hehe it looks like Africa\u0027 and seeing the greater picture. For example, albeit enlarged relative to Africa, Hispania exists. Europe seems to have been mostly removed, or rather moved elsewhere. (See - Ireland in southeast). Russia exists quite fully, Japan is half-formed and peeking out of the Asian landmass. India appears to have split off and downwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the northwest, Central America has been removed and North America\\\u0027s top half exploded into a super-continent.
