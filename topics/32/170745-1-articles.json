I made a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E science/liaison spaceplane for Duna. After sending it up with a recoverable, autonomous RAPIER booster and it was time to make my way to Duna, I discovered that I had completely forgotten to install a probe core, which made it a bit of a handful to fly to get to Duna with my crew consisting entirely of scientists and engineers. Doing an aerocapture to a target orbit with no \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E was a bit of a challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey did it though and once the rest of the gang arrived in LDO I transferred a pilot on board. On his first attempt at landing on Kosmodrome Aelita, he overshot, pulled an Immelmann turn, saw the ground approaching really fast, got himself upright, fired the hover jets at maximum power, and gently touched down exactly where he was supposed to. It no doubt looked incredibly impressive, but was actually abject panic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-02-26T09:58:49Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2018 09:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-26T10:47:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest was then sending an pack of tiny rovers to mun to land near abnormalities.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nFound out I had put the decoplers the wrong way, and had no probe core on them \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-26T11:32:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223304905\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022170745\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221519608805\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022184431\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ace in Space\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, Ace in Space said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nLand fuel lifter next to mining base.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGet distracted by gathering a surface sample and planting a flag.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTake off and dock with orbital station.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNotice failure to actually pick up fuel.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat?
