That\u0027s why sailplanes have long skinny wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFighter jets don\u0027t have long skinny wings because long skinny wings are horrible for supersonic flight -- wings don\u0027t work correctly when they have shockwaves forming on them. Luckily, the nose makes a conical shockwave that wings can hide behind. Past Mach 1, you want your wings swept backwards to stay within this cone. The higher the Mach number, the steeper the shock cone angle, so faster jets have more sweep (or longer noses).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t make swept wings too big, or they\u0027d be structurally weak and the center of lift would be too far back. So you add wing area with a delta wing instead. Delta wings have another nice property in that they can generate lift at very high angles of attack without stalling (lift is roughly proportional to angle of attack). This means that a delta-winged plane can land at slow speeds (lift is proportional to airspeed squared), as long it doesn\u0027t mind doing so with the nose 30 degrees above the horizon. But big enough long skinny wings could make just as much lift at 12 degrees angle of attack, and with less drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this is pretty simple, as evidenced in that it can be explained in 10 sentences.
