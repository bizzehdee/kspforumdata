What if we decided to make a holiday (here on the forums) just for KSP! And we could share what we did throughout the year! Whaddya think? I\u0027m thinking maybe June 24, because that\u0027s when it first came out, but we could also do April 27th, for KSP 1.0, which was the first \u0022real\u0022 KSP that we have today. Give me ideas for a date and tell the moderators about this!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
