a year ago, we learned that Squad intended to add some sort of stock communications relay system and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/116750-thoughts-on-stock-communication-system-in-ksp-11/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethere was a big discussion about it in this thread\u003C/a\u003E. \u00A0Now this feature has been delayed until at least 1.2, which itself won\u0027t come out for a while due to the need to further patch 1.1. \u00A0So basically, a lot of time has passed, and a fair amount more will pass before we see this, so a lot could have\u00A0changed. \u00A0I haven\u0027t heard much mention\u00A0of either the merits or the details of this feature in a while, so I\u0027d like to learn where we stand now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, although I\u0027ve been using either RT or AntennaRange in all my games for the past couple years, I wish Squad would make this an official mod like Asteroid Day instead of an unavoidable stock feature. \u00A0Or at least include an option to disable this feature entirely. \u00A0This is because previous attempts to make so-called \u0022realism\u0022 mods\u00A0stock have not made anybody happy. \u00A0I point to the continued existence of DRE and FAR despite stock now having reentry heating and quasi-\u0022realistic\u0022 aerodynamics. \u00A0Those who used DRE and FAR before 1.0 still use them now because\u00A0they think they\u0027re better than stock, and those who didn\u0027t use either mod didn\u0027t want the stock versions they\u0027re now stuck with anyway. \u00A0I foresee exactly the same thing happening with the communications feature. \u00A0Those who currently use RT or AR will keep using the mods\u00A0and those who don\u0027t want to be bothered with such things will be forced to anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is also the little matter that\u00A0implementing a stock communications network\u00A0requirement will likely break ALL existing saves. \u00A0It will certainly break those of everybody who doesn\u0027t currently have a network. \u00A0And it will probably break those who do have networks\u00A0because the stats of antennae they\u0027re currently using\u00A0will certainly change, and their models will probably change and no longer fit their vehicles (rather like what happened with wings and the Mk1 cockpit). \u00A0So once again, nobody will be happy. \u00A0In fact,\u00A0because I see game breakage as a near-certainty, I\u0027m already unhappy because I see no point in starting a serous 1.1.x game with the knowledge the communications system will destroy it in 1.2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut all the above is based on limited and old data. \u00A0What do we know about the impending stock system today?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Just
