If you put this on one end of the fuselage instead of using an inline port, you can hook a transfer tug to the spaceplane once in orbit and take it wherever. Then you don\u0027t need a refueling station in LKO. Putting the tug on the nose is probably best, so you can aerocapture at both Jool and Laythe using the tug as the heavy, shielded thing in front and the spaceplane\u0027s wings in the back pointing the right direction through the atmosphere. Once at Laythe, the spaceplane just needs enough fuel to deorbit and then, if you don\u0027t come down in the right place, fly however far to the designated LZ where it will be refueled via ISRU. Thus, you can send the spaceplane out with essentially empty tanks, making the transfer tug\u0027s job easier, and maybe top it up with a little leftover tug fuel as needed prior to descent.\n\nSpaceplanes are IMHO the best way to go for reusable Laythe landers, PROVIDED you give them good STOL and off-road capabilities and find a good LZ for them. Their advantage over conventional landers is that heat shields go away eventually and can\u0027t be replaced in the field.
