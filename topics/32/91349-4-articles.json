So if you give an upper limit of \u002B3y, you will start somewhere between day zero and 3 years from the base start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Randomized comets with orbital periods of anything from 3y to 300\u002B years, along with contracts to go do science near one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Biomes that slowly refill their science pool. Maybe the Kerbin Grasslands biome doesn\u0027t, but some of the more \u0022active\u0022 and \u0022dynamic\u0022 biomes on places like Eve or something equivalent to real-life Io might need to be visited multiple times in order to fully tap the value. You can\u0027t just get 99.9% of the science by batch firing four sets of experiments. Instead you might have to wait a minimum amount of time for it to recover after the first experiment before doing the second. And after being tapped out, maybe it recharges after 3-6 months (or 3-6 years).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Part cost rebalance, especially early on in the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Part differentiation. For example the 2x3 solar panel design should be sturdier then the 1x6 design. The one with the cover should be better in atmosphere then the one without the cover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Funding drive. Offer a way to trade in excess reputation or science points for funding, without having to complete one of the existing types of contracts. Right now it\u0027s possible to run out of funds early on if you have a few launch failures, with no way really to gain more funds. Being able to trade science points for funds might also give a reason to keep doing science missions in order to fund other personal side projects like putting up an orbital space station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Add a few more ship categories and icons (i.e. Debris, Probes, Rovers, etc.) to the Space Tracking Station / Map Mode. Suggestions would be: \u0022Satellites\u0022 (i.e. geo-sync sats), \u0022Depot\u0022 or \u0022Fueling\u0022, \u0022Construction Parts\u0022 (i.e. ships that you are working on assembling), \u0022Mothership\u0022 (a bigger then normal ship), \u0022Colony\u0022 (a big base).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Sub-folders in the Load menu for loading in ship/plane designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Give a way to associate a particular ship with the contracts that you are trying to fulfill with that ship. So if you have a dozen active contracts, you should only see orbits / icons that are associated with the ship that you are currently controlling. After tossing up (10) sats in low-Kerbin orbit the map around Kerbin starts to get really crowded and it gets difficult to figure out how to incline an orbit on a maneuver in order to hit the target orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeniter","CreatedById":78267,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-04T06:32:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EChristmas time!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerano","CreatedById":107460,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-04T07:03:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ECan we have a sneak peak?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/87213001/KSP/Random/Sneak%20Peak.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Sneak%20Peak.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hannu","CreatedById":60596,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-04T07:20:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TeXYGLT.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/TeXYGLT.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely fit to carry the 9001 coaches required for this train!
