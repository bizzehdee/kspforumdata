It\u0027s a refinery that also doubles as a fuel depot. Seven launches to get the five modules, the orbital fuel transport and the shuttle that brought spare parts in place. It was very funny to build because it was difficult to dock the tall modules using a rover, but I eventually did it. I call it the Khaleesi Daenerys Munar Base (it was a suggestion from a friend.).\n\n![18OCY4E.png](http://i.imgur.com/18OCY4E.png)\n\n![ki7eJnD.png](http://i.imgur.com/ki7eJnD.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-08T17:23:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2015 05:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sputnyk**"},{"CreatedByName":"Crown","CreatedById":18262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T05:25:42Z","Content":"Looks good.\n\nBut there\u0027s a thread where more people might see it: [Show off your awesome KSP pictures!](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24533-Show-off-your-awesome-KSP-pictures)! ;-)"},{"CreatedByName":"Sputnyk","CreatedById":149323,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T10:39:24Z","Content":"Thanks for the tip!

I am building a base on minmus with similar goals (refinery \u0026 science) - despite me being parked on the greater flats my main challenges are (9fps) lack of gravity, and stupid mistakes on my own part from putting the pieces together. \n\nBuilt a lil crane to put the station pieces together, runs out infernal robotics doesn\u0027t like docking / undocking payloads :/ \n\nMy plan went to crap. At first I thought my crane was broken, so I re-built it from scratch and tried again. Then i discovered its a mod limitation. \n\n![x6hOH3R.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/x6hOH3R.jpg)\n\nThats a pic of the lander i (didn\u0027t) use, all of the parts managed to land with their middle stage LOL\n\nI used the crane to detach the parts from their (non) landers and place them on the ground. Then I was able to connect some parts without infernal robotic bugs. \n\n![9X2BMp1.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9X2BMp1.jpg)\n\nI ran into problems, luckily I planned for this (50% of the time) I sent another lil rover to move the parts from underneath. Sadly non of my power segments have dock node underneath. \n\nWondering weather to skip this practice and get to Duna already!! I was ready to give it a rest when i realised I\u0027d have to redesign my power segments, but thats why Im here in the first place!"},{"CreatedByName":"Sputnyk","CreatedById":149323,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T21:21:58Z","Content":"Wow, impressive! Very clever workaround. I\u0027ve run into some problems too. The modules had a tendency to tip over and the were very hard to control because of the structural fuselage, causing a kind of asymmetrical trust, but I managed to correct this using KAS winches (and luckily the solar panels were only deployed after the connection to the main module. I\u0027ll see if I can build something more compact to send to Duna (or Ike, maybe?) and complete the contracts.\n\nEdit: I\u0027m working on reducing the part count to improve my FPS (around 10 approaching the base,15 on the surface) using KAS/KIS mod, I find it extremely helpful. And I can also bring spare parts (fuel cells, just remembered them in the last mission).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-09T21:27:40Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2015 09:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sputnyk**"},{"CreatedByName":"keeper","CreatedById":124530,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T22:47:30Z","Content":"Soon my main crane will attach itself to the lander and leave, taking about 150 parts away - but not until the new power segments arrive. They will feature an overwhelming amount of solar power at hopefully a very low part count. \n\nThe segments were launched in sets of four, with the quadthingimobobby. The miner, the battery, the science core \u0026 refineries were all launched seperate. \n\nI put a winch on the end of my cranes arm, but again forgot to bring any pieces for it - will pack some new parts to use on the next ship. \n\nIt seems Infernal robotics is OK with docking to new pieces moving around and undocking said pieces. The problem lies in picking something up and docking that new piece I picked up to another piece (e.g the station) and then when you undock the crane, all the joints on the crane (if moved) will start to pull themselves apart. \n\nFor next time a simple work around will be to put a docking node on the ass of my crane, not connected to any IR parts which will do the final dock. Hopefully that will be ok. \n\n![PieoTBQ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/PieoTBQ.jpg)\n\nWow, every time i tell myself \u0022TEST IT HERE FIRST\u0022 Then i think, naww its fool proof!
