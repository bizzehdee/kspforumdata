It\u0027s a refinery that also doubles as a fuel depot. Seven launches to get the five modules, the orbital fuel transport and the shuttle that brought spare parts in place. It was very funny to build because it was difficult to dock the tall modules using a rover, but I eventually did it. I call it the Khaleesi Daenerys Munar Base (it was a suggestion from a friend.).\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/18OCY4E.png\u0022 alt=\u002218OCY4E.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ki7eJnD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ki7eJnD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-08T17:23:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2015 05:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sputnyk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crown","CreatedById":18262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T05:25:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there\u0027s a thread where more people might see it: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24533-Show-off-your-awesome-KSP-pictures\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EShow off your awesome KSP pictures! \u003C/a\u003E! ;-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sputnyk","CreatedById":149323,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T10:39:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the tip!

Very clever workaround. I\u0027ve run into some problems too. The modules had a tendency to tip over and the were very hard to control because of the structural fuselage, causing a kind of asymmetrical trust, but I managed to correct this using KAS winches (and luckily the solar panels were only deployed after the connection to the main module. I\u0027ll see if I can build something more compact to send to Duna (or Ike, maybe?) and complete the contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I\u0027m working on reducing the part count to improve my FPS (around 10 approaching the base,15 on the surface) using KAS/KIS mod, I find it extremely helpful.

They will feature an overwhelming amount of solar power at hopefully a very low part count. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe segments were launched in sets of four, with the quadthingimobobby. The miner, the battery, the science core \u0026amp; refineries were all launched seperate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI put a winch on the end of my cranes arm, but again forgot to bring any pieces for it - will pack some new parts to use on the next ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems Infernal robotics is OK with docking to new pieces moving around and undocking said pieces. The problem lies in picking something up and docking that new piece I picked up to another piece (e.g the station) and then when you undock the crane, all the joints on the crane (if moved) will start to pull themselves apart. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor next time a simple work around will be to put a docking node on the ass of my crane, not connected to any IR parts which will do the final dock.
