A big drawback of that is that in the case of a crewed mission, I\u0027m actually launching two crewed spacecraft linked together. A LES would only save the crew from the upper stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI play on very hardcore custom difficulty, but I still have revert and quicksave enabled because of the ever present risk of bugs, which can and do wipe out my missions from time to time. Reverts allow me to try out simulated launch mishaps, where I deliberately cause a failure and then see if there\u0027s a way to save the crew. Even if I deliberately try to screw up the launch, both piloted spacecraft almost always survive. However, I can\u0027t land both craft safely while they\u0027re still linked. This wouldn\u0027t be a problem if I could somehow separate them and fly them down individually, after all, both spacecraft have a competent pilot at the controls. This is partially a drawback of KSP and partially a drawback of the way I design my launch vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had a number of real launch mishaps, caused by mistakes during the design of new launch vehicles (sooner or later you have to launch the thing and see if it works). I\u0027m currently trying to phase in a new heavy lifter, and it\u0027s given me some trouble keeping the thing on course during ascent as it drains fuel. So far, my mishaps have resulted in wildly sub-optimal ascents that have resulted in a number of successful aborts to orbit. Because of the difficulty settings I use, it takes me quite a while to earn back enough money to cover the cost of a failed heavy lift launch, so I play through the scenario long enough to confirm that all crew members successfully aborted to orbit and would have recovered safely to the KSC runway in due course had I not reloaded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could decide to be ultra hardcore and earn back enough money to cover the cost of a launch failure. This is completely achievable on the difficulty settings I use, and could be seen as a fitting punishment for failure. I use difficulty settings where completing a contract earns back enough funds to cover the cost of the launch, but only if my launch vehicle design is very efficient. I earn my money by launching extreme capability missions that can complete contract after contract from a single launch. There\u0027s no denying that playing KSP in it\u0027s current form on extreme difficulty is grindy, but it\u0027s not impossible. I\u0027m playing extreme custom difficulty to explore ways to overcome the engineering challenges it imposes. I could grind funds to rebuild after a successful abort to orbit, but doing so would be time spent for the sake of spending time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lhathron the Elf","CreatedById":118706,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-08T22:35:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bsalis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bsalis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe escape tower only adds weight, and you only need it when things go wrong anyhow.
