Another thing I did, since I was using the \u0022standalone\u0022 KSP is merge the Windows and Mac installs (since the executables are different) so I can play the same save games no matter whether I am in MacOS or Windows. That part has worked flawlessly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow about everyone else out there? Anyone else running multiple instances of KSP?
