The complexity of all those fuel pumps and the size of the pipes that would needed is the chief issue: the whole \u0027it would make the whole rocket rotate\u0027 argument doesn\u0027t hold water, however. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rotary movement of the fuel is stopped at some point while still in the rocket in order to move it in another direction, either inward or down. Changing the direction of the movement is considered an acceleration, even if the velocity doesn\u0027t change afterward, and this kind of situation is part of why it\u0027s still an acceleration. The force exerted by the moving fuel on the rocket as it changes direction would cancel out the rotary motion imparted by the pumps starting the fuel moving in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScott Manley did a vid near Gilly where he talks about this effect, while demonstrating an exploit that can be used to accelerate a craft without using fuel. It works because you can move the Center of Gravity of the craft to a different point in space by transferring fuel. In reality, the recoil from moving the fuel would start a motion in the opposite direction, which would be stopped when the fuel came to rest in the other tank. The result would be the craft sliding slightly in the opposite direction, in such a way that the center of gravity ends up at the same point it was at before you moved the fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-12T18:18:31Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2013 06:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anton P.

Rockets tend to be tall and skinny IRL because drag is mainly the result of cross-sectional area, so the narrower the rocket the less drag it\u0027ll encounter in the atmosphere. Asparagus expands the cross-sectional area rather substantially, rapidly reaching the point of diminishing returns. Throw in the added weight of the pumps and the complexity of managing fuel management and it ends up much less useful than in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -- Steve\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
