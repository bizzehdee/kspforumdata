Was there an unknown hurdle, or was it just a case of time/effort?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday I\u0027ve been testing some designs with a view to completing my first ever Eve surface return - as I type I\u0027m actually taking a break from the frustrations of CTD and HyperEdit (if I was even slightly more confident of success I\u0027d skip the HyperEdit part and just fly there... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E) but however. The first and only time I made a trip to Eve (not counting fly-bys) was long ago when I first built an orbit-capable nuke-powered spaceplane, and having refuelled it at my orbital station, needed somewhere to send it. Suffice to say the pilot, Thornberry, still lives alone in Thornberryland \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E.

It needs plenty of seats, for all those poor stranded kerbs who may never get another chance to go home, a docking port for refuelling in orbit, and a cargo bay for all the snacks and other useful stuff needed for such a long journey. Maybe even a rover or a tow-vehicle for helping position the vessel for eventual take-off, or a science lab. Anyway, the general idea is stuff in the bay is payload to the surface, so it isn\u0027t part of the ascent vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUp until my current design revision, I was working with Mammoth and Nerva combinations. On Kerbin this put me into a nice high orbit, but on Eve I just wasn\u0027t in space long enough to get up to orbital velocity once the oxidiser ran out. The new design ditched the Nervas for an extra Mammoth, and this looks extremely promising.

Launching an Eve rocket fully fueled from Kerbin takes waaaay more than an empty Eve rocket and an attached refinery. The launch vehicle will still be pretty hefty, but a whole heck of a lot less than the alternative. The ascent really isn\u0027t affected by whether the fuel was brought with or made on-sight. If it\u0027s an SSTO, it might have more of an effect on the design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T21:17:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELast design I noticed had about 80 parts, of which about 20 were airbrakes and about 10 more were a series of tapering parts for the nacelle noses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn SSTO for Eve can ascend and refuel from Kerbin, transfer to Eve and refuel from Gilly before descent. Yeh, it could take down an ISRU/drill in the cargo bay, but I\u0027d rather use that for a rover and/or lab. Either way the refinery/payload would get left behind. If the machine needs a disposable refinery to complete the mission, I don\u0027t really class that as an SSTO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETested ascent today from about 7000m altitude (borrowing Astrobond\u0027s launch site), ran out of fuel ~600m/s short of a 100km orbit.

I guess those who\u0027ve had a real go at Eve ascents before probably had a little giggle when I said it. I\u0027ve tried a lot of different things, but I have a sinking feeling that my non-thrusting mass is just too high. Which blows, because at the moment this feels real close to being really impressive! I guess I could try finding an even higher launch point, but the ship is so heavy that it takes a really long roll to get up to lifting speed, and finding mountain tops that big and flat is tough.

I\u0027m a relative newbie and unwilling to take the easy technobabble solution to problems, but i don\u0027t see why a version of the LV-N that can also use intake air would be beyond Kerbin technology. It would need a turbine compression stage to compress the intake air, and a power turbine in the exhaust stream to drive that. As a result, it would be subject to the same decline in thrust with speed and altitude as a turboramjet - the Rapier engine chills the intake air with the fuel stream before it enters the combustion chambers, which enables it to operate faster and higher, unfortunately a nuclear turboramjet won\u0027t have that. You could also swap the nozzle for an aerospike. The stock LV-N performs well in a vacuum, but suffers more thrust loss due to atmosphere than any other rocket - a factor of 6 or something crazy like that. Aerospikes are not quite as good in a vacuum, but perform a hell of a lot better at surface pressure. They are also much less draggy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, such an engine will not do much more than allow indefinite level flight at low altitude , due to low TWR , 1950s nuclear powered aircraft concepts still required jet engines to get off the runway.

Technologically, I don\u0027t see any reason why we couldn\u0027t build one now, but you could never use such a thing on earth due to the intensely radioactive exhaust.
