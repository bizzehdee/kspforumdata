Having one naut around each celestial in the kerbin system this leaves me exactly enough to get my station. Two Karmony modules keeps the part count down. Not enough parts for chutes and I doubt they would work anyway. \n\nYou never have as much fuel as you think, the lack of thrust in kerbins atmosphere took a toll on the fuel.\n\nWith RCS and fuel I managed to join Kerbins SOI but now its pretty much stuck in orbit about 25,000 km from kerbin. \n\nGot the VAB upgrade\n\n-Do I rescue the little buggers now, refuel the station and land it somewhere or go for the naut facility upgrade, lol?\n\n-Im thinking just rescue the pilots and leave the other guys there and ferry them on future missions.\n\nIf I plop a command module on the docking port can I use this craft for another mission?\n\nForgot to add, for some reason Karmony\u0027s don\u0027t store crew or EVA reports so I didn\u0027t get the solar \\* points.![:sealed:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-18T16:46:35Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2015 04:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666**\n  \nPS"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T16:48:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If I plop a command module on the docking port can I use this craft for another mission?\n\nYou can assume control of the craft, yes, but remember to dock your command module bottom-first to the target vessel or your nav-ball headings will be inverted.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-18T16:54:15Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2015 04:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T17:00:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You can assume control of the craft, yes, but remember to dock your command module bottom-first to the target vessel or your nav-ball headings will be inverted.\n\nOh-yeah, thanks."}]}
