In the simplest case - deorbit whenever you feel like it and fly through the atmosphere to line-up on approach. In the worst case - it all depends not only on how high your orbit, or its inclination, but where on that orbit you currently are and where its equitorial nodes (AN/DN) are \u0027around\u0027 the planet from KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"montyben101","CreatedById":74173,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-17T18:33:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWOO HOO Just landed the shuttle after docking with the station in its new 60 degree orbit.
