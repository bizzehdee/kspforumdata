You can destroy any ship in flight from the Tracking Station so all ships *must* have a self-destruct sequence. Kerbfleet\u0027s, for example, is \u0022Zero-Zero-Zero-Destruct-Zero\u0022. I have it on good authority that certain... other space programs have been trying to get rid of some errant probes for several years now, [but can\u0027t decrypt the boss\u0027s destruct code](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115759-Kerbal-Kountdown%21%21%21%21?p=1853883#post1853883). \n\nOf course if you\u0027re going to use this it makes sense to have a launch escape system on hotkey, and press that one *first*."},{"CreatedByName":"sumrex","CreatedById":103753,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T21:25:59Z","Content":"Nah they really need a Kerb spectator gallery...
