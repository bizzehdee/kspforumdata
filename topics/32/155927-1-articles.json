For example, if I installed SpaceY Heavy Lifters, I won\u0027t need KW Rocketry. Or vice versa. Sure, each one has some unique bits and bobs in it... but major parts fall into the same niches, which makes them feel redundant with one another. For me, the little bits and bobs where they differ would be what helps me decide which one to pick, not a reason to have both.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than that, my decision process can\u0027t be so easily put into words. I prefer my setups to feel \u003Cem\u003Econsistent\u003C/em\u003E... which is a difficult to define concept at best. It\u0027s very much about gut feeling. Sometimes its obvious: I wouldn\u0027t put KSP Interstellar and Near Future Technologies into the same install. They just make different decisions about gameplay style and mechanics. They \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E be used together, and I know people who do, but my gut feeling says \u0022it isn\u0027t consistent enough. Pick one and ditch the other\u0022. At other times, it\u0027s less clear-cut. For example, which life support mod do I run? Answer: the one that feels most similar to the rest of my installed parts and game mechanics. But how do I determine that, when none of said installed parts and mechanics deal with life support? After all, if I already had a LS mod, I wouldn\u0027t be installing another!

I think the only mod I\u0027ve used in every single career is \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E. For the first months I played I didn\u0027t even use that, but after I proved to myself that I \u003Cem\u003Ecould \u003C/em\u003Ecalculate DeltaV and other critical information, I gave up on the tediousness and installed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E as my first mod. Now, after 1000s of hours with KSP, my current career has around 80 mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-03T19:08:50Z\u0022 title=\u002202/03/2017 07:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 3, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by MalevolentNinja\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-03T18:28:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll try just about any mod, because why not?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy favorites are parts mods, because I like to be able to build vehicles with lots of variations.
