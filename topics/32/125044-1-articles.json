For example, the large gimbal range on the new Panther engine can induce yaw forces during roll maneuvers if you\u0027re not careful with the placement of your rudders, engines and ailerons.

Suppose you have one pair of control surfaces at the back doing pitch and roll. Full pitch up = both control surfaces move up to their maximum deflection. Full roll right = left control surface down, right control surface up. Full pitch up AND full roll left = left control surface stays still, right control surface goes full up. You can see that the pitch and roll will be less when combined than when used separately.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T16:43:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELocation on the plane matters. Roll will have the most effect inline with the CoM and out on the wing tips. Pitch will have the most effect far behind or far in front of the center of mass. Yaw of course needs to be on the vertical stabilizer. Make sure you right click each control surface and configure it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
