When a 32-bit application is large address aware, it can access up to 4 GiB on x64 operating systems and all memory that isn\u0027t used by the operating system and other applications on x86. 64-bit versions of Windows require no modifications to the operating system to benefit from this application; however, in 32-bit versions of Windows, you must increase the user memory setting. Instructions how to do this are in spoiler below. It is not advised to use this application if you have less than 3 GiB of RAM.\n\u003E This application may not work on older executables (predating 2000).\n\n[http://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/large-address-aware.112556/](http://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/large-address-aware.112556/)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I originally wrote this tool for a friend of mine who needed it. This very little tool patches x86 executables in order to let them have 4GB (instead of only 2) of virtual memory on x64 platforms. This tool comes very handy for applications which need a great amount of virtual memory like games, 3D renderization, multimedia etc. To gain these 2GB, you just have to use this tool to patch the executable (\\*.exe file) of the software you want to have these additional GBs of virtual memory. It can be used by clicking on it and choosing the file or through command line (e.g.: \u00224gb\\_patch file.exe\u0022). It automatically creates a backup copy of the original executable.\n\u003E Why things are this way on x64 is easy to explain. On x86 applications have 2GB of virtual memory out of 4GB (the other 2GB are reserved for the system). On x64 these two other GB can now be accessed by 32bit applications. In order to achieve this, a flag has to be set in the file\u0027s internal format. This is, of course, very easy for insiders who do it every day with the CFF Explorer. This tool was written because not everybody is an insider, and most probably a lot of people don\u0027t even know that this can be achieved. Even I wouldn\u0027t have written this tool if someone didn\u0027t explicitly ask me to.\n\n[http://www.ntcore.com/4gb_patch.php](http://www.ntcore.com/4gb_patch.php)"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T07:59:27Z","Content":"No. KSP can already access 4GB."},{"CreatedByName":"Xyphos","CreatedById":139010,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T08:14:15Z","Content":"KSP can already access 4gb, as it is run by a High-Level Managed programming language which handles the memory allocation and garbage collection.\n\nthe problem with KSP is the 4gb boundary itself. in order to break the 4gb limit, KSP needs to become natively 64bit.\n\nI\u0027m not sure as to why KSP isn\u0027t natively 64 bits, but I suspect it\u0027s because of Unity, which raises another question as to why Unity isn\u0027t 64bit"},{"CreatedByName":"Uml\u00FCx","CreatedById":69703,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T08:17:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not sure as to why KSP isn\u0027t natively 64 bits, but I suspect it\u0027s because on Unity...\n\nKSP uses Unity4 and the Windows x64 Unity build is and always was a disaster. thank god, squad is already working on porting it to Unity5, which should run definitely better (or so we hope at last)"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T08:17:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not sure as to why KSP isn\u0027t natively 64 bits, but I suspect it\u0027s because on Unity...\n\nUnity 4, primarily; seems to have issues with 64 bit that are hard to pinpoint and reproduce.
