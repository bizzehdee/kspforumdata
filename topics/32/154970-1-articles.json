I love this game. I played around 150 hours so far (in science mode) and I am not even out of the Kerbin, Mun and Minmus yet.

But there is one thing that I noticed in this game; It is way to easy to farm science points when you get access to the science processing lab.

Much of my current game though involves crew rotation every five months, making sure everyone sent to the Munar station gets their chance to walk on the Mun, etc. interspersed by bursts of timewarp to move everything along.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Science Lab fits perfectly with that. It doesn\u0027t feel like an exploit because the science I get from it is more or less what I\u0027d be getting from running the odd Minmus biome mission - I\u0027m not warping ahead years at a time, grabbing a huge science windfall and calling it done.\u00A0The lab just sits there in the background\u00A0 nicely\u00A0complementing \u00A0the science I\u0027m getting from my interplanetary jaunts. I don\u0027t need to science-mine Minmus (which I\u0027ve done before many times)\u00A0and I don\u0027t need to worry too much about getting every last scrap of science from the Mun biomes either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"netbumbler","CreatedById":146001,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-17T20:40:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use the lab as a role playing device as another living space for the Kerbals to retreat to on long voyages.\u00A0 I don\u0027t use it for science anymore because it is just too easy.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah and the Planetary Base Systems science lab looks really cool deployed what with the telescope and all...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
