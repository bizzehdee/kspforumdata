After 3 weeks of struggling with the unmodded game, everything suddenly seemed to flow like honey yesterday. It was wonderful! In one explosive day of can\\_do\\_no\\_wrong, all of the following suddenly happened:\n\nFor the first time, I got something from tier 6 unlocked. \n\nFor the first time, I got scientist Bob to circle Kerbin (solo).\n\nFor the first time, I not only landed on the Mun, but also made it home safely (talk about a science windfall, wow!).\n\nFor the first time, I designed and built a tanker.\n\nFor the first time, I got a tanker (with a full 1400 units of fuel, etc.) into orbit.\n\nFor the first time, I rescued a Kerbal from orbit. (never docked with anything outside of the tutorial before)\n\nFor the first time, I completed four contracts in one flight, where all 4 contracts required being in space. And then (same flight) I docked with my tanker and gave its second empty tank my spare fuel. (never did a fuel transfer before).\n\nWhat a breakthrough day! I\u0027m 53, and I don\u0027t recall feeling this way since I was 12 and was given a unicycle. For 3 weeks, I tried every\\_single\\_day to ride it, and never got farther than about 20 feet, so I finally put it away. 3 months later, I tried again, and on my first try went 50 feet, and on my second try I could ride the darned thing. The switch was suddenly flipped. Forty years later, this happens, where my progress in 1 day exceeds all progress from the last 3 weeks combined. The lights are on, baby! What an amazing game!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T01:33:34Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 01:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DarkGravity**"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T23:50:02Z","Content":"That is the beauty of KSP, something that few other games really give you, a real feeling of accomplishment."},{"CreatedByName":"DarkGravity","CreatedById":143383,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T00:08:54Z","Content":"Hardest game I\u0027ve ever played (that wasn\u0027t broken)."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T00:18:35Z","Content":"Congrats!
