I was trying to aerobrake from interplanetary velocity, but my periapsis was just a bit too low. When I realised that no amount of burning would get me back up, I figured, what the hell, let\u0027s see what happens. I transferred the remaining fuel from the nuclear engine to the lander\u0027s fuel tanks, and tried to bring it down normally. I hadn\u0027t added parachutes to the lander at that point, so all I had were my three 24-77s. I managed to bring my vertical velocity down, and then MechJeb told me I was below sea level, and the camera angled sharply upwards (which you can see in the second screenshot) and I touched down. I actually fired up the engines and got back above sea level, then touched down again, safely. I was utterly flabbergasted. I haven\u0027t tried taking Lowin on EVA yet (and I probably never will, I do plan on bringing a friend to try that at some point though), but even going back to the tracking station and loading it worked fine. It gets mach effects applied before physics are loaded, but it\u0027s completely normal otherwise, perfectly stable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spatzimaus","CreatedById":57215,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T04:15:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LeonG17\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LeonG17\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn the gas giants, if you survived the atmospheric pressure somehow, you would land in a liquid layer before reaching the solid core.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorrect, although referring to the liquid as a \u0022layer\u0022 is misleading, as it implies it\u0027s discrete from the atmosphere. It\u0027s not that there\u0027s an ocean underneath the atmosphere; it\u0027s that as you get far enough in, the pressure gets so high that the atmospheric gas becomes liquid. There\u0027s not a sudden, clear transition between the \u0022gas\u0022 area of the atmosphere and the \u0022liquid\u0022 area; it\u0027s a turbulent boundary where slight local differences in temperature and pressure can make the liquid area go quite a bit higher or lower. It\u0027s sort of like an ice cube in a glass of water; the water right next to the cube is right above the freezing temperature, and the ice just on the other side of the boundary is just below the freezing temperature. There\u0027s a similar setup in the Earth\u0027s molten interior; it\u0027s not that the molten rock acts like water, it\u0027s that the temperature and pressure are so high that the solid rock can flow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you were descending through a gas giant, as you approached the liquid area, you\u0027d be moving through gas that was so dense and so cold that it\u0027d act almost like a liquid; you might not even notice when you actually transition into the liquid itself. Of course, as we\u0027ve said, you\u0027d be crushed LONG before that point, so it\u0027s all academic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
