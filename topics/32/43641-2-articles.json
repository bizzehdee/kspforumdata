I took a look at circular orbits, the Mun, Minimus, and the near-Kerbin planets (Duna, Eve, and so on), and though \u0022bah, too easy. I promised myself the first planet I would land on would be amoung the hardest, and that I wouldn\u0027t cheat my way there, via (potentally unfair)mods or otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been fairly successfull in achieving this via determination, and the eternal mottos of \u0022needs more struts\u0022 and \u0022MOAR (BOOSTERS)\u0022. My first attempt was Moho, at least I think thats the name, the Mercury-equivelent. Nothing too special, I got a simple, small ion propelled probe into such a eliptical orbit that it intercepted nearly perpandicular to Moho\u0027s orbit and waited a few hundred orbits(over 2\u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BD\u00C5\u00BE) rl days for a near-intercept, then adjusted to directly intercept Moho. As I approached Moho at 14 km/s, I realized something. I knew Moho was a Mercury-equivelent, but I failed to realize(or remember) that Mercury lacked a atmosphere. And I certainly didn\u0027t see the haze of one on Moho. Seeing as I was planning to aerobrake and then parachute to land, this was a bit of a issue. And I realized this all about 5 seconds from landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy next attempt was more substantial, and I switched targets to the slower Eeloo, aka Pluto equivelent. This time, I built a monstrous craft(400\u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BD\u00C5\u00BE parts), dubbed Plutos, that was still unmanned and still used ion engines. This time though, it had eight of them. And carried 150k units of xenon gas, as well as a small detatchble ion-propelled probe. Needless to say, its Delta-V was more than sufficient. After nearly a week of constant thrusting, I successfully reached and orbited Eeloo. -reached a letter limit, sorry, will continue in another post-\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GraviTykillz","CreatedById":60694,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-24T02:12:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Egetting to minmus for the first time! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/613893641229071554/3CEF913B4340276F7E91DDD7A467DC5969827483/\u0022 alt=\u00223CEF913B4340276F7E91DDD7A467DC5969827483\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand Realizing i put the landing legs on backwards.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"buggy","CreatedById":10412,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-24T03:01:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EContinuing on my last post, I reached and orbited Eeloo sucessfully. At that distance from the sun, the detachable probe could maintain thrust at about 1/4 max, and it was intended to land with its ion engine. I correctly assumed that the gravity of Eeloo is tiny compared to Kerban. I failed to realize it was not so weak that a ion engine with half a ton of fuel and probe above it could have a twr greater than 1 at quarter-thrust. By the time I realized this, I was no longer able to deaccellerate at max sustainable thrust and it was too late to recircularize my orbit, and my last quicksave was about 2 days of thrusting behind. Thus another failed mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy next attempt was also to Eeloo, with a better designed Plutos V.2.

However the total number of parts were in the 700s, and combined with the over-doubled mass but same 8 ion engines, and greatly increased lag due to said 700\u002B parts, any actual attempts at a mission would take far too long. Not to mention the initial launch failed to reach Kerban escape velocity, and the lack of room for the (internal) crew modules greatly complicated rescue attempts. Thus Plutos design was deemed to be flawed by its very nature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy latest design, a incomplete and unlaunched nuclear-propelled monstrosity called Nuclos, is currently massing in at 800\u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BD\u00C5\u00BE tons with a soon to be reduced part count of 500. The original design had 36 nuclear engines and over 1600 tons, and a part count of nearly 1000. The current design has a mere 20 nuclear engines. It carries a few dozen crew members and has 2 3-seater rovers that use a (soon to be reusable) skycrane system to land, like Plutos V.2\u0027s rover. It also has several orbit-only ion-propelled probes, but the primary lander is a stationary, 4 seat heavy duty lander. -letter limit-\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadpangod3","CreatedById":58339,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-24T03:15:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbin rejected my Sputnik probe \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow it happened:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: design tiny probe to launch just barely over 70 km to get money in mission controller to pay for construction of a space station\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: launch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: realize I forgot parachutes on the srbs and go back to vab\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: relaunch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: float over kafrica above 105 km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6: imagine kerbal news team at ksc In control room being excited over this (since its the first flight in a new save)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7 retract solar panels before rendering the atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8: engage parachutes before they can even open\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9: watch re-entry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10: \u0022MAH PARACHUTES ARE ON FIRE!!!!!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11: float to the ground slowly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12: get bored\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13: physics warp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E14: physics warp to parachutes opening\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E15: *KABOOM*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E16: get rejected by kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E17: get the rest of the ship destroyed and the probe core launched through the atmosphere getting super sonic effects\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E18: start falling again\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E19: \u0022AAAAAAAHHHHHH MADAY!!!!!!!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E20: *poof*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER.I.P.

I was on a direct ballistic intercept with Kerbin, so, I dump my cruise stage and just have the 3 man capsule left. Well, thats when it got bad. I was coming in like there was no tomorrow and for those poor slobs on that thing, there was no tomorrow. See, I kinda came in way way too fast and failed to notice a HUGE mountain coming up at me. I tend to wait until I am about 2km off the ground before I deploy chutes. Well, that mountain was high, I was fast, the chutes too slow. Suffice it to say, they hit HARD.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"buggy","CreatedById":10412,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-24T04:09:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E-continued-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also finally relented a little and decided to use a couple mods. I figured I might as well do someething once I got there, so I installed Kethane and ISP Mapsat, but I\u0027m not going to actually use any of them untill I land on Eeloo. My heavy lander has a onboard large refinery, two heavy scanners, a 32 ton (when full) Kethane tank, and 2 large drills. Since I have to be on the ground to use the drills, I by definition can\u0027t use them untill I land. I also installed both ISP and small Kethane sensors on the probes, as well as several large sensors and ISP sensors on the primary ship. Also on the primary ship is over 100 tons of Kethane storage, as well as 8 large refineries and numerous power generators.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually getting all that into orbit is not gonna be easy, getting it to escape velocity even less so.

I was moving in for a rendezvous between my Mk-I capsule (with none other than Jeb Kerman at the helm) and a docking probe I launched previously, and everybody knows how tricky unmodded dockings can be sometimes! I drifted too far past the docking port so I overcompensated a bit and decided I would completely fly around and try again, but as I was passing I saw that one of my control surfaces was going to nick the probe... so I pressed the completely wrong RCS thrust button and... slammed into the probe, sending it spinning out of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut wait, there\u0027s more!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a panicked attempt to kill my capsule\u0027s rotation, I freaked out and tried pressing frenzied combinations of thrusters, which culminated with me accidentally PRESSING THE SPACEBAR. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo...
