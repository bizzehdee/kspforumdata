When I say problems I mean things like \u0022How can I make a flight on the SLIMMEST of margins and still make it home\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find I come up with ideas at the worst possible times. I will be watching a TV show (I record all mine because of what happens) and suddenly I have an idea for a new space tug... or I will think of a way to make a better launch vehicle and I have to go and try it... It happens when I\u0027m reading, when I am getting something to eat (heaven help me if I am eating a hot meal because I have to force myself to finish it before heading back to KSP) etc, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s almost like an addiction... No... It IS an addiction. I just love the freedom in this game.

In general I get bored with video games in a hurry, especially the point and shoot ones. KSP is the first game that has ever grabbed my imagination and my brain. I am constantly being challenged to learn outside the game to be able to play more efficiently within it. Design. Build. Fail. Redesign and try again. When I finally succeed it seems bigger than just a game. Then there is the visual beauty that at times is nearly breathtaking. I have often experienced the feeling I am actually exploring an alien world.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TimePeriod","CreatedById":74336,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T20:59:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI hardly play KSP anymore, thou the community keeps my interest.

I think Kerbal probably has the same kind of attraction, a wide range of components and no really strict rules as to how you put them together, but strict limits to what each can do and handle. Combine that with a pretty strict set of rules with regards to physics, and you\u0027ve got a perfect environment to keep challenging your wild designs against.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComparing it to spore, a game I was super hyped about when it game out but gave up after not long after unlocking the UFO, it allowed you to combine all sorts of components in imaginative ways with little constriction, but the lack of interesting possibilities and restrictions with those components it just lacked an interesting challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, that and the fact that I don\u0027t know any other game that has thought me so much about the physics of planets and space travel, as in I\u0027d had the courses at school and new about the laws of gravity and the make-up of the solar system, but Kerbal gave me an intuitive understanding of the surprisign way they play out (such as that getting to orbit is hard, but Jool is only slightly more difficult than getting to the Mun).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vermil","CreatedById":122726,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T17:14:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I originally got KSP, I started a sandbox game (career mode didn\u0027t exist then, I think) and fooled around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t accomplish much and didn\u0027t get much wiser.

Get a Kerbal into orbit. Visit a moon. Land on a moon... And achieving each goal gave me a tremendous kick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last driving goal was land (and return) Kerbals on Laythe. It took a long time achieving that. I\u0027ve spent months, literally months, developing the rocket ship. At times, having to change and rebuild, test again, I was thoroughly tired of it all, frustrated, not really enjoying it, but still driven by the big goal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now I don\u0027t have any such big goal any longer. There\u0027s nothing really attractive on the radar. I\u0027m tentatively planning for Eve, sort of. But I\u0027m not really driven anymore. So while I\u0027ve gone back to enjoying playing, I don\u0027t know how long it will last. I\u0027m hoping for some additions and changes to the Kerbol solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I\u0027ll try career mode. Don\u0027t think so though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
