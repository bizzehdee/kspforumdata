Well... Long story short, the nose of the aircraft was insufficiently strutted, so the nose wobbled all over the place during flight. I thought the whole concept of a wiggly-nosed spacecraft was absurd, but the best part was the landing: When I tried to brake, the landing gear, which was placed on the wobbly nose, caused the nose to bend almost 40 degrees towards the ground.
