This is concerning; there is obviously no need to progress in technology, but there\u0027s no particular reason to stop us collecting science points and data (simply to add to a never declining total), and while we\u0027re there there is absolutely no reason to throw such an immersion-breaking message at us. The least that could be done would be to give us the flavour text; finding out what the mystery goo does on the surface of Eeloo is a deserved payoff to getting there in sandbox as much as in career mode, and increases the sense that despite having all parts unlocked we are actually doing something...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Karriz","CreatedById":58036,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T19:19:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, at least seeing the experiment result would be cool, even if science points are useless in sandbox.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceSphereOfDeath","CreatedById":69754,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T19:20:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree, at least let players take soil samples, or at least a message like: \u0022science BOX cannot work! it\u0027s filled with SAND\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T19:22:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PwnedDuck\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PwnedDuck\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Efinding out what the mystery goo does on the surface of Eeloo is a deserved payoff to getting there in sandbox as much as in career mode\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept in sandbox you can build a 3000 part nuclear-power monstrosity with mechjeb and get to eeloo with your eyes closed, while once cash is implemented in addition to science, getting there in campaign mode will feel like quite an accomplishment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T19:23:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with OP ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eeven with no tech tree to fill, the scientific experiments are interesting enough to be included in Sandbox\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WafflesToo","CreatedById":71736,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T19:38:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI disagree w the OP.
