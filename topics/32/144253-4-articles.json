It was simple, go to minimus and fill up, then go to orbit and rendezvous with any craft going interplanetary (which I would plan to be virtually empty by that point). The amount of extra delta-v you can save adds up pretty fast, and when you factor in the extra launch cost of the fuels it doesn\u0027t take many uses for a converter to be worth it. I always found my designs were larger than other people\u0027s but I think that\u0027s just cause I wanted to spend less time landing it and sending it back up. If you are worried about cost, pay attention to contracts, some get ore on minimus or the mun contracts only require you to get back to orbit of kerbin, making a quick jaunt over to the Mun to pick up some ore before going back a profitable venture. It\u0027s entirely possible for a refueler to become debt negative just on these contracts alone.

The only issue I had was with inflatable fuel compartments, not sure if they\u0027re stock, don\u0027t use these if you can avoid it or if you must use them do so sparingly and with lots of room. When inflating since changes are processed at moment of returning to the craft it caused so many collisions that would dislodge stuff.

As it is, I never send manned craft where I intend to justmake a short stop on the surface to refuel, and then be on my way.
