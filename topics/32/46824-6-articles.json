My landing calculations are the only finite-thrust maneuver calculations I\u0027ve seen anyone do around here, besides the optimal atmospheric ascent pseudospectral code that alterbaron got working for one example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, name a specific maneuver and types of constraints and we can get to formulating the mathematical statement and solution. For capture you could calculate a finite burn that either maintains constant periapsis or points retrograde and therefore changes periapsis as it goes, and look at how capture delta-V depends on initial orbital energy and periapsis, gravitational parameter of the body, initial TWR, specific impulse, burn start time before periapsis, and final apoapsis at burn end.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-04T05:05:04Z\u0022 title=\u002210/04/2013 05:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tavert\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"loknar","CreatedById":77750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T10:17:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell..
