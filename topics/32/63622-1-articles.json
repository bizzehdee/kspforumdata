For example, the data scale on the Atmospheric Analysis is 10 and the base data is 20, so transmitting that back to Kerbin would come out to 20 * 10 = 200Mbits. Maximum value is how high a return you can get in the long run from performing a particular experiment multiple times. (For example, the first Materials Study in Kerbin orbit returns 25 science; the next returns 4 science, the next after that returns 0.8, and so on). It gets kind of complicated with transmissions and the like, but that\u0027s the gist of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T20:11:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIntresting but you might want to add filters for some impossible situations.
