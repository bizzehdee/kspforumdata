KSP does good in that it clips (to an extent at least) graphics that aren\u0027t actually visible. There\u0027s a few problems with this (move the sun to the edge of the screen to see what I mean) but it\u0027s a good balance.\n\nV-Sync is a zero resource consuming improvement... but it requires you to have an FPS faster than your monitor can display it; turning it on otherwise causes FPS to drop as it only passes frame data at some multiple (I think it\u0027s multiples of 15).\n\nAnti-Aliasing may have a bug if you turn it off, but it effectively renders the same scene twice, with a minor variation in the camera location. This allows it to blend the two (or xn) images to remove the \u0022aliasing\u0022 around edges, often caused when the model data is larger than the screen resolution.\n\nTexture Quality is memory consuming, but minimal cpu / gpu consuming improvement. Textures only matter when going into the GPU, but processing them isn\u0027t too intensive.\n\nScreen Resolution is actually a bigger deal than people realize, especially with how many pixel shaders the game uses, and the high DPI monitors of late, going to lower resolutions can drastically improve your framerate.\n\nFallback shaders likely is something like a Shader 2.0 implementation, for older cards. (Only use if you have problems, not a speed enhancement and likely will produce bugs)\n\nTerrain Scatters is said to be bugged, 1.0 is said to have fixed problems with them... idk.\n\nShadow / Point Light deal with the shaders some how.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T22:31:13Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 10:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fel**"},{"CreatedByName":"KatzOhki","CreatedById":73492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T22:12:12Z","Content":"I believe there\u0027s an \u0022ultra low graphics\u0022 texture pack out there somewhere if you search for it."},{"CreatedByName":"Wingman703","CreatedById":137567,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T23:18:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The biggest improvement is actually to NOT look down.
