I don\u0027t know what the game was like several years ago as I\u0027ve only had it since just before 1.0 was released, but I can say with confidence that the more places there are to explore, the easier it is to keep an interest in the game as there\u0027s constantly new places to go and new things to test out on different worlds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso pretty much a requirement if you\u0027re going to be sending multiple simultaneous missions is Kerbal Alarm Clock which, in case you don\u0027t know, allows you to set alarms for various events (maneuvers, transfer windows, etc).
