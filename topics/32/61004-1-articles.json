I forget the name, but I remember it had the common \u0022Kerbal [number]\u0022 arrangement. I would like to know: It\u0027s a nice design, so why did it go away? In fact, a number of the Squad-built ships available in the demo are missing from the full game\u0027s list. If anyone has a download for a (preferably 0.23 compatible) version of this ship, please don\u0027t hesitate to speak up! Also don\u0027t hesitate to speak if you know just why it was removed.\\\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Both of the ships from the demo are now available on Curse (I myself posted them there).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.curse.com/shareables/kerbal/220931-ye-olde-stocke-crafte\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.curse.com/shareables/kerbal/220931-ye-olde-stocke-crafte\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-20T00:41:45Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2014 12:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by zxczxczbfg\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASI Director","CreatedById":64746,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T04:14:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s because of the large gap between versions: I think that .19 was a save breaker because everything changed so maybe the layout of the .craft files did?
