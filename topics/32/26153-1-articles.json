You create a large asparagus stack of rockets, and then use struts to hold the payload on top regardless of its shape. This can be done purely with stock parts; before the wipe, there were shots of people making truly ridiculous lifts using dozens of Mainsails on orange tanks. But, if your station has a high part count, it\u0027s MUCH easier if you use mods, most notably KW Rocketry; its 3.75m tanks and engines greatly reduce the number of parts you need to get a given capability, without being any more efficient mass-wise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my own 300-ton station being lifted on my medium-sized booster stack. (My largest stack can lift 500\u002B tons, but that\u0027d just be silly for a station.) I\u0027ve used this to lift four stations into Kerbin orbit; it\u0027s capable of a 200km orbit, while still having enough fuel to de-orbit the final stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5rQfsl1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225rQfsl1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s 13 3.75m stacks. The outer 12 use the Griffon XX engines from KW, the inner one uses the engine from the Jool V mod. (I liked how it looked better.) There were a lot of struts connecting the outer stacks to the station, to keep it stable during the Max Q period, but at the point pictured there was no longer much stress, so it was okay to separate them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs long as your station is going to be symmetrical, this method works just fine. Or at least, it will work fine until they add a better aerodynamics model, where all of those cross-struts will add much more drag, but that\u0027s nothing a few fairings or nose cones can\u0027t fix.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flixxbeatz","CreatedById":29991,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T16:07:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpaceshipFood\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SpaceshipFood\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow can you get giant space stations into orbit without splitting it into parts or using hack gravity?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy having a powerful computer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t ask me why - it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Ecommon sense\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blackstar","CreatedById":61238,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T16:12:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spatzimaus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spatzimaus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou create a large asparagus stack of rockets, and then use struts to hold the payload on top regardless of its shape.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like to build a flat platform out of 2x2 panels at the top of my rocket, then put irregular shaped payloads on top of that (keeping the center of mass balanced) and use struts to hold it in in place.
