Then I realised that I didn\u0027t actually recover 100% science from each area. Now a half of me wants to go back and get collect the last scrapes of science points while the other half of me is too lazy to do so. What about you guys? and what do you think I should do? Get 100% science or just forget about the small percentage left over?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T06:50:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI MUsT HAVE ALL OF IT\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T06:59:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell seeing as science currently has no real value once the tech tree is filled out, I don\u0027t tend to worry about it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Linear","CreatedById":26619,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T07:11:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter a couple of hours its just a sandbox game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Kerman","CreatedById":166398,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T07:18:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI hate to admit it, but all I care about is money these days. You can\u0027t collect science without funds. I have every piece of scientific data gathering equipment unlucked, and I get every bit of science I can, and physically take it back to Kerbin if it isn\u0027t 100% worth transmitting; but at the end of the day, I won\u0027t be launching any rockets if there\u0027s moths flying out of my pockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey that rhymed...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T12:39:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s lots of science to be had around Kerbin, Mun and Minmus; don\u0027t sweat it.
