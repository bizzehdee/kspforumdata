This gave me fits and I kept flipping rockets because I kept expecting them to behave the same when they did not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I swapped the W and S keys around and controlling rockets is now a hundred times simpler as the pitch/yaw keys now behave the same in relation to the navball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I do think this would make controlling a plane type ship harder as this makes W pull the nose up, not push down, but for flying rockets I feel this is the way to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich makes me interested in what control schemes people are using.

I have however switched K and I around for RCS linear control. And similarly to your change moving around (docking) became much easier. (up/left key presses meaning up/left movement on navbal). Funny thing that both RCS \u0022modes\u0022 (defaults and Up/Down reversed) were used on space shuttle depending on input device. Controlling attitude was always in \u0022plane\u0022 mode though, with up/forward meaning nose down.
