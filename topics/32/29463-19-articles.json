After several failed attempts at landing a rescue nearby I finally crash-landed a rover near enough to get it to them so they could scout a better landing site. That took forever but finally I found some ground that if not flat was at least flatter than the massive crater peaks all around the crash site. After many quickloads I finally managed to get a lander in there without tipping it over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo after finally managing to get my crew off the mun and back to kerbin I had a lot of extra fuel and decided to burn it on my way into the atmosphere, and the 4 nukes were slowing me down a lot more than I expected. It looked like I might actually be able to land the whole thing on kerbin without separating the crew module for a parachute landing. I though I was going to make it until I got to about 1000 meters so I decided to abort the vertical landing and pop the crew out, but for some reason the parachutes never activated and after all that work all 3 kerbals were killed at the moment they finally returned to kerbal soil.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the bright side, I got a really cool photo of the descent to kerbin (for science!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/I0Mkwnw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022I0Mkwnw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASI Director","CreatedById":64746,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T20:40:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Subbota\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Subbota\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E-snip\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/I0Mkwnw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022I0Mkwnw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy would you EVA the crew?
