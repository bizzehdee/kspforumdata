It\u0027s cooler that way, for one thing. Being able to trade out the resources of any tank to whatever you want will cause an identification problem when looking at a ship (your own or someone else\u0027s). I should be able to see someones lander and immediately recognize it\u0027s missing RCS tanks or that a rover carries Xenon and therefore is ion-powered. This applies to resource ratios as well. If you\u0027ve brought an orange tank\u0027s oxidizer capacity to zero and made it part of a space station, you (or someone else in multiplayer or loading it into their persistant file or viewing a screenshot) can\u0027t tell from looking at it that they won\u0027t be able to get or store oxidizer in it upon docking. It\u0027s a simple reason, but that puts me in the camp of not wanting to arbitrarily allow fuels to go into whichever tanks or change capacity ratios.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpinion - Decreasing your oxidizer to zero in order to increase your liquid fuel to fill the remaining space seems unnecessary. If you need more liquid fuel than a tank can carry, why not go with a larger tank or use an additional one? Sure it seems like there is wasted space in the tank but you\u0027ve still lost the dead weight of the oxidizer which is generally more significant than the added dry mass of the larger/extra tank. It\u0027s possible this extra dry mass accumulates as you scale up, but is this much different than our other engineering concerns? Just like anything else there\u0027s a tradeoff using a tank designed for Liquid fuel/Oxidizer for only one of the two. This may birth the need for some new tanks with specialized roles, which may be considered bloating the parts list, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a bad trade.

Batteries, for instance, are implemented the same way as tanks, and nobody is suggesing we have the ability to trade electric charge for something else. That said, I wouldn\u0027t be wholly against the idea of choosing what kind of fuel is being stored. The nuclear engine has been discussed specifically in this regard. We\u0027ve happily been using the Liquid/Oxidizer tanks for those since they\u0027ve been introduced, so that\u0027s a good example of a container that could hold liquid fuel OR nuclear fuel.

A selection of resources available and an automatic determination of the maximum capacity based on density plus the ratio slider that has been mentioned would pretty much do the trick. The argument I make is really not about the difficulty of implementation, but how much clicking is required to navigate the new features and how much the player may need to keep track of in the situation where any fuel tank could literally contain any resource and the only way to know what is to right-click and check.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust to be clear, I\u0027m not incapable of being convinced one way or the other.

If tweakables can\u0027t be used to increase the amount of liquid fuel in a tank, just to reduce the oxidizer, thats a nerf to atomic engines because it means we have less than half the reaction mass that we have from the same tanks now, but all the size and dry mass. The dry mass may not sound like much, but if you look at some of the number crunching that\u0027s been done concerning how much delta-v you can get out of a given engine, the dry mass plays a very large role in the max delta-v you can get out of any particular engine in a single stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, the solutions to this would be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) to leave everything as it is.
