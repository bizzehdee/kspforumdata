Those of us who\u0027ve been around for a while - since, say, at least 0.25 - are kind of still in the alpha expectations stage. We\u0027ve grown used to the way Squad handles its development cycles. We don\u0027t exactly \u003Cem\u003Elike\u003C/em\u003E that Squad releases seriously buggy software - see comments above - but we\u0027re used to it. Somewhat.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCompare: if a new expansion to WoW comes out and it makes the game unplayable to even 1% of their playerbase, that\u0027s an all-hands-on-deck nobody-goes-home-until-this-gets-fixed emergency. In this way, Squad \u003Cem\u003Eappears\u003C/em\u003E still to be behaving like a indie game studio with a playable alpha.

So people around here who are old hands generally fall into two camps: the \u0027I told you so,\u0027 camp, (of which I\u0027m often one), and the, \u0027Stop ragging on Squad all the time,\u0027 camp. It\u0027s almost an automatic reaction at this point. It\u0027s no even that the first crowd thinks Squad can\u0027t do things right or the second thinks they can\u0027t do things wrong. It\u0027s just almost habitual at this point. (And for reasons. I\u0027m not calling anyone irrational here.)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EI\u0027ll say a couple things in Squad\u0027s defense. First, a large part of the botch is Flying Tiger\u0027s fault, not (directly) Squad\u0027s. Now, I don\u0027t know how legally or otherwise this works out. Maybe in order to get KSP onto consoles, they had to give Flying Tiger a lot more legal responsibility than they want to let on. Maybe not; maybe Flying Tiger is effectively just a sweatshop subcontractor. I don\u0027t know. What I do know is that this does \u003Cu\u003Epartially\u003Cem\u003E \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003Eabsolve them, but there\u0027s the quite reasonable objection that, hey, maybe they should have gone with someone more reputable than a group of guys whose product line looks like \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.flyingtigerentertainment.com/products.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESecondly, to my understanding, a large part of the problem with pushing fixes out in a timely manner (and indeed, with release in the first place) has to do with the way the consoles regulate their available content. The whole console release in Europe thing is mind-boggling to me; maybe there\u0027s a similar, smaller problem going on here. If Squad were Ubisoft, I\u0027d think they should have this ironed out and know the process, but when it\u0027s the first time you\u0027ve done something, sometimes it\u0027s hard to know what you don\u0027t know until you trip over it.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EFinally, for all we know maybe Squad is as frustrated about this as you are. They\u0027re obviously trying to help. They\u0027re just as obviously not getting it resolved in the seriously drop-everything-and-stay-awake manner this might call for. That might not be their fault, in the moment. A little patience might go a long way. Hopefully.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EStill, again, I think you\u0027re ultimately right here.
