KSP still has the occasional random crash to desktop. I don\u0027t think this is the cause. Although, anti-virus\u0027s have been known to cause conflicts with KSP in the past. I\u0027m pretty sure the problems are related to poor memory management in Unity 5, at least from what I\u0027ve read.

The error-checking is its own entity and not the greatest in the world, most likely to only go so far to find the culprit. \u00A0Think of it as a lazy and corrupt cop who is just as happy to arrest an innocent citizen just because they were in the neighborhood of a suspected drug dealer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaking sure your drivers are up to date is a big help, as well as not running anything in the background that is not essential to your current gameplay. \u00A0CCleaner is a big help to getting useless junk out of the way that can also contribute to issues.\u00A0However, run it manually and do not leave it running in the background, as it, too, can contribute to issues. It\u0027s not Norton Anti-virus bad but it is a bit of a memory hog.\u00A0You can also use it to see if anything\u0027s getting loaded at startup that shouldn\u0027t be. \u00A0Never know when something you installed decided it needed to be run at start without your say-so. Or that something even installed without your say-so. \u00A0Browser toolbars, for one. Get rid of those.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s pretty much the extent that I can think of to help prevent problems. \u00A0If these help, then at least it can help you enjoy your KSP experience until we get something more stable. Hate to say it, but stuff like this is to be expected with the upgrade to 64-bit. It\u0027s going to be like working with a wider brush that is likely to pick up more pests along the way. \u00A0Stay patient, friends.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-15T05:30:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy personal experience has been that I initially suffered from the same sort of crashes others have reported, VAB crashes, staging crashes, and other random CTD\u0027s near constantly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen suddenly the game just started working longer and longer and longer, and now I only crash with the moving parts in the VAB (as Alshain hinted at).
