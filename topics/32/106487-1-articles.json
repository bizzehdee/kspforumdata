I\u0027m in the Tracking Center screen time warping to the intercept. Just before she enters Jool SOI I click the fly the ship button. In the midst of it switching to/loading the ship I press \u0027M\u0027 to bring up the orbital map. The ship never loads, and all I see are the sun and stars (and HUD of course). so then, I press ESC and head back to the Space Center. Now, back at Kerbin, the terrain didn\u0027t load and I can see the solar system where I should be seeing land and ocean, I\u0027m pretty sure the buildings loaded (can\u0027t fully recall. its late, and I\u0027m getting tired). Anyways, I quit the game, and load it back up. Only now Valentina is missing. No ship in tracking station, she just...disappeared. It really sucks cause I pride my Space Program on not losing the main Kerbals, and secondly, Jool is a long trip. le sigh. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else had this happen to them yet? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny chance I could load some previous quicksave or something to resurrect her? I\u0027m really not keen on restarting my career over this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty bummed and gonna call it a night. Thanks for any input.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T04:24:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like you ran into some form of kraken......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could try loading from a previous quicksave.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MadChris48","CreatedById":112853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T11:24:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022smjjames\u0022 data-cite=\u0022smjjames\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESounds like you ran into some form of kraken......\u003Cp\u003EYou could try loading from a previous quicksave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried that , but I think after I exited and restarted the game the quicksave I had was lost.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T11:28:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBack up your persistence file.
