When I deploy the fairing, it just tangles in the rocket and I cannot free it. I\u0027ve tried violent rolling and jiggling with the RCS and with the main engine but I can\u0027t get them to just go away and leave my ship in peace.\n\nWarp (which usually makes the fairing parts vanish) will not work in this instance (it thinks I\u0027m flying over terrain). How the hell do I get out of this mess? Can it be fixed by editing the save file? I\u0027ve had a look but I can\u0027t see how to delete the parts."},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T16:14:50Z","Content":"If it thinks you\u0027re flying over terrain then you should be able to exit the scene (hit escape, click on space center) and it will return you to the last viable save point for that craft, though this will only be useful if that point happens to be at launch. I would make a named save first before trying it though, or backup your current persistent file. \n\nI only had this happen once (and it was very similar, except it was the very tip of the fairing that got stuck between two solar panels. The game then kept telling me I was traveling over the terrain when I tried to warp or leave) but there was nothing I could do to get rid of it without reverting."},{"CreatedByName":"wossname","CreatedById":118005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T16:25:21Z","Content":"Desperate measures...\n\nTurned off SAS (it was going crazy because of the forces caused by the fairing fragments), and turned on RCS and began rolling REALLY fast. I mean 4x physical warp holding \u0022Q\u0022 key for about a minute or so! Gradually the fairing parts shook loose. Killed phys warp and then used normal warp to kill the roll and hit quicksave.\n\nNote to self and other players: for Pete Kerman\u0027s sake, test your fairing deployment on the LAUNCHPAD as a simulation flight before you go to space!\n\nDon\u0027t let your asparagus stages \u0022cage in\u0022 the segments of your fairings. The 1.25m fairings are 180 degree sized, where the 2.5m ones are 120 degree sized, you need to ensure that your asparagus stages are not going to get in the way of these parts. I suspect that I can make this work simply by rotating my fairing by 90 degrees in the VAB.\n\nI actually raised this as a bug in the support forum weeks ago but it was apparently ignored."},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T18:45:15Z","Content":"One of the very real non-aesthetic problems with confetti fairings.

Of course it\u0027s going to go badly.\n\nyeah, it\u0027s a bug, even if the craft design prevents a clean fairing sep, it shouldn\u0027t break the UI (it thinks you\u0027re moving over terrain -\u003E breaks timewarp and also it removes your orbital path from map mode, and it does horrible things if you try to go EVA to fix it). That\u0027s not intentional behaviour.\n\n(also, I\u0027ve seen a chicken lay an egg without any shell, also, at the point of lay it\u0027s still an undeveloped blastula so that really ain\u0027t ever going to happen /ex-farmer-anecdote)\n\nOP, Claw has now added a fix for this *bug* in his [stock bug fix modules](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285-0-25-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules)\n\nInstalling that may solve your problems straight up, but I\u0027m not sure how it will function if the problem has already occurred, worth a try though.\n\nMy other solution to this is to go into 4x physics warp (it will still let you do that) and then spin the craft along it\u0027s length, that usually dislodges it.\n\nHere\u0027s the support thread about this particular issue - [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118019-Stuck-fairings-break-orbit-in-map-mode-and-prevent-timewarp](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118019-Stuck-fairings-break-orbit-in-map-mode-and-prevent-timewarp)"}]}
