So I stuck a probodobodyne(make sure you pronounce every syllable) inside a cargo bay for a net weight of .29t. Gradually I\u0027ve added more to it. Put my solar panels in it so they don\u0027t overheat on takeoff and a few other components. Then crammed it with fuel tanks.  **It actually holds more fuel than the short fuselage of the same size.** Of course weight wise those tanks are same efficiency as a fuselage, but not having an extra fuselage saves on drag and keeps me from making the plane longer, which is a problem for this particular SSTO.\n\nUsually there\u0027s also a few science instruments, an antenna, and more batteries where space allows, but overheating bug has caused me to get rid of a lot of physicsless parts.\n\nNote I did not offset any tanks(just solar panels), and although they clip a little on the inside, they don\u0027t clip to the outside.\n\nNow that I\u0027ve unlocked the MK2 Drone Core that I looked forward to, I\u0027m considering it will not be an improvement. Consider if I get rid of the cargo bay, and replace it with a drone core and a fuselage. I save .09t going from cargo bay\u002Bprodo core to drone core. Now I\u0027m holding slightly less fuel, it\u0027s ever so slightly longer(the width of drone core), and I have no place for other random amenities shielded from heating.\n\nNot complaining nor do I think it\u0027s anything especially clever, just thought it was kind of funny what ridiculous mess I ended up with.\n\n![9F60F7538817D132DCFBAEE115CE186673B2B20C](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/445078956044465665/9F60F7538817D132DCFBAEE115CE186673B2B20C/)"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T02:51:02Z","Content":"I put a command seat and a probe core inside, plus other stuff like you, save weight on a cockpit for micro ssto,\u0022s."},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T03:08:02Z","Content":"I don\u0027t stuff em that full, but I do usually stuff em with science stuff, sometimes put mono tanks in there if I am too lazy to hide them on the outside, or RTGs and extra reaction wheels."},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T03:10:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I put a command seat and a probe core inside, plus other stuff like you, save weight on a cockpit for micro ssto,\u0022s.\n\nThat\u0027s actually pretty clever.

I do use it for the solar panels though.... I know it doesn\u0027t really matter, but I just don\u0027t think it looks aerodynamic to have the OX-Stats on the outside of a plane travelling faster than the speed of sound... they should be torn at some stage of leaving or re-entering the atmosphere.
