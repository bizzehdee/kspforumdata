Meant for a lot of the small stuff that was previously radially attached (batteries, science instruments, etc.) but can now be placed in these things so it doesn\u0027t burn up on reentry.\n\nI have a suspicion that they were inspired by the Universial Storage mod."},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T00:53:28Z","Content":"Hello everyone and here\u0027s the Squadcast Summary for this week!\n\nSorry for spelling mistakes, I\u0027m a terrible transcriber. I try and clarify what is an actual quote from Max (if it\u0027s wrapped in \u0022quotation marks\u0022, it\u0027s the best transcript of an official Squad member you\u0027ll find on the web), and what is a summary from myself as I\u0027m aware I switch between the two with 0 notice. When I say \u0027Squad\u0027, I mean \u0027the relevant people who are currently developing the game\u0027. \n\nAs always, this is just a transcript of an off the cuff vlog of a non-native english speaker - **some details may change or be entirely incorrect**.\n\n**Hearthstone****Squadcast Summary for 2015-04-18** - [**Watch it here!**](http://www.twitch.tv/ksptv/v/4105675)\n\nLet\u0027s just un-mute and hello and welcome! \n\nSo about the failure state for a 1.0 career mode - **if you run low on funds, you are offered a solution like a loan** - massive hit in rep for some funds. It\u0027s not something you can do more than once or twice though - \u0022in general, a couple times will mean you\u0027ll be b-b-b-b-b-boned\u0022 (I\u0027m guessing the rep hit is massive).\n\nSomething about a countdown.. I personally am very confused by.. hey, 10 new 1.0 pictures!\n\nContract system is changed - **pre-determined initial contracts will no longer be dependent on the previous one being completed** - once you\u0027ve launched your first vessel, the game will auto-payout (no need to even accept) contracts such as Reach Xm or Escape The Atmosphere as soon as you yourself reach that. Reach space on your first launch? Have all the rewards for the Reach Xm and ETA as well.\n\nThumbnails for saved crafts in the editors are a thing.\n\nNew delta-v maps will obviously need to be made due to the new atmospheres (but these will be unpredictable.. obviously).\n\nWith a good GPU, you may see some improvements in 1.0, but really, if you\u0027re chugging, it\u0027s likely other bottlenecks like the CPU.\n\nThe Round-8 \u0022Lifesaver\u0022 tank... Squad were astounded at the community feedback for the change - \u0022what are people saying? Are we making a bad call? But they also think we need a bigger xenon tank.. so por que no los dos!\u0022 **The ROUND-8 will stay an LFO tank** (and be re-balanced)! And Squad are adding a new large xenon tank! Hooray! (stay tuned!)\n\nWhy no procedural parts? Squad feels it removes the lego feel and gameplay restraints - fuel tank this big, engine this bug, boom done, Squad like to see the solutions people come up with fixed sizes of things.\n\n**New aerodynamics is fully configurable** - adding a cfg that can be edited as you, as a player, desire. Too hard or easy? Change it!\n\n**Loading times - much improved. Like seriously**. If a completely stock 0.90 game will load in 40 seconds or so, 1.0 loads in 12s. DDS and optimisations ftw.\n\nPicture time! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) (thanks to /u/Iamsodarncool and /u/Roverdude\\_KSP for the pics)\n\nNew large xenon tank!

Limited but massive amounts of Ore on a \u0027roid- Class E will last you quite a while (Ore can be converted to whatever propellant you want).
