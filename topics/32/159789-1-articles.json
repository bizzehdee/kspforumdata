Once the aircraft is attached to the capsule again the sudden coupling will cause unexpected results mostly crashes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo i went back to the drawing board and created a new game in sandbox mode so i could use every single feature the TCA has to offer and also so i could get the couplings. \u00A0I imported my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003Evtol\u003C/abbr\u003E lifter aircraft and put a mock capsule on the runway. \u00A0This time i hovered over the capsule and dropped the winch line down. \u00A0TCA kept the vehicle fairly stable as i switched out of the craft and selected my Kerala. \u00A0With \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E installed i grabbed the winch connector and plugged it into the port on the top of the capsule. \u00A0The second it was plugged in the capsule started smoking and fire effects (probably a mod) and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003Evtol\u003C/abbr\u003E aircraft went hard into the ground again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntried setting the aircraft on the runways and connecting using the ports. \u00A0That way it would be like trying to start a swing load. Same thing with the effects the smoke and fire on the capsule. \u00A0The aircraft did not do anything though. \u00A0I thought it was good until i switched back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003Evtol\u003C/abbr\u003E and tried to take off. \u00A0It seemed like it was solidly attached and the aircraft pulled hard to one side and crashed. \u00A0I made sure that it had slack on the winch lines but made no difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone have a good way of connecting to a ground object while hovering over it to retrieve it. \u00A0I would prefer to use a winch and not a solid connected magnet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni have seen people in the video take off with sling loads but have yet to get it to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny and all help is appreciated =.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JohnnyPanzer","CreatedById":142801,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-26T14:15:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow about a heavy\u00A0seaplane with pontoons on stilts and a magnet\u00A0on it\u0027s belly?
