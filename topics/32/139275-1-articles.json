It all went downhill from there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKnowing that dv would be tight, the ion tug was launched to ferry the lander down into a lower circular orbit. After over half an hour of burning, the lander\u0027s orbit was still highly elliptical. In the form of 47 tons of Tylo lander the little ion tug had finally met it\u0027s match. So that plan was scratched, instead of reducing the apoapsis down into a low circular orbit, we\u0027d shave the periapsis down to around 20km, come in very fast and very low, and perform a full thrust horizontal suicide burn to land. On the night side. Without landing lights. With razor thin fuel margins. What could possibly go wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nFirst attempt wasn\u0027t too bad. Fire both the ascent nukes and descent skipper at full thrust at 1 minute prior to 20km periapsis. This timing turned out to be bang on *perfect*, bringing me down to about 100m/s at 1000m from the surface. Slight gravity misjudgement led to my final descent accelerating far quicker than thought. Bob died.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSecond attempt: Going ok! 7m/s descent just 300m to go - and then the skipper ran out of fuel; nukes were insufficient to hold aloft the full mass \u0026amp; I wasn\u0027t quick enough to undock the descent stage before we hit the ground at 40m/s. Bob survived. The ship didn\u0027t.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThird attempt: Disabled docking port crossfeed midway through the burn to ensure skipper had enough fuel. In final seconds of landing I couldn\u0027t quite find balance point of thrust in time. Most of the craft survived. The important bits, however, did not.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFourth attempt: Textbook. Apart from the landing. Misjudged last moment before contact (landing lights would have been really helpful) \u0026amp; didn\u0027t kill thrust in time. Toppled over.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFifth attempt: As per the fourth. Being on the night side was really hurting. Toyed with idea of orbiting till periapsis is in daylight. Got increasingly worried about lander design - SAS is insufficiently strong to keep the lander upright if some rather shallow angles or lateral forces are present on contact.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSixth \u0026amp; seventh attempt: As per the fourth and fifth. Decided to orbit a few months till daylight and make next attempts where seeing the ground is possible. Discovered that orbiting my way into daylight was not an option. Seems my elliptical orbit is aligned with the sun, such that the periapsis is always in the dark...\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEighth attempt: Experimented with timing of suicide burn. Was not a successful experiment.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this stage I took a second quicksave in the final moments of an otherwise successful burn, allowing for repeated attempts at the troublesome final landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nFifteenth attempt: LANDED! 380 units of fuel left, allowing for a full ascent stage and 20 units of fuel left in the descent to give a teensy initial boost.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThis is why we hate Tylo.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience and flag planting was undertaken with haste, the quicker to be off the cursed moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake off wasn\u0027t exactly a walk in the park either. Undocked the spent descent stage a couple of seconds into flight as it ran out, then pointed at 45 degrees and hoped it would be plain sailing from there on. Gravity had other plans as she dragged my now puny 1.2TWR into a hillside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThis is another reason why we hate Tylo.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually however, a 70km circular orbit was achieved. The ion tug headed back to the mothership to refuel before travelling back down to rendezvous with our spent lander, now shorn of it\u0027s Tylo descent stage fat I hoped the journey back up to the mothership wouldn\u0027t be too onerous. I was wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was quite biblically wrong. Spent a good 90 minutes initiating 30 or so separate burns to bring the lander up to the mothership. That little ion tug did just about OK at Laythe and Vall, but here it\u0027s woeful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThis is also why we hate Tylo.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually however I reached the mothership. And as Tylo\u0027s final \u0022screw you\u0022 I realised I\u0027d made a mothership design error - the mothership, now sans Tylo descent stage presented no docking ports which wouldn\u0027t foul my lander\u0027s engines. So had to split the lander once more into it\u0027s component modules, docking the core cabin at the front, and the lander engines/legs at the rear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDeparture\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sooner the better. Glancing at xenon fuel reserves I realised I\u0027d now burnt through 4346 units of xenon gas. At the 0.48/s burn rate of my single ion engine that\u0027s 9000 seconds spent operating that engine - TWO AND A HALF HOURS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n99dv burn to escape Tylo without bothering to line up a firm encounter - close enough would be fine, just get me off this rock! Once escaped a further 78dv, followed by another 5dv burn set up an encounter with Pol. We\u0027re headed to Pol next because Bop requires a large inclination change - if we visit that last we\u0027ll only need to make that inclination burn once rather than twice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dafni","CreatedById":149636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-08T12:55:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnot necessarily the hardest I ever did, but definitely took the most thinking. did it just the other day. it looks neat on the map too!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003Eone single launch. 2 rings of equally spaced satellites, 3 on each orbit\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/a5nbalp.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022a5nbalp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow","CreatedById":65767,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-08T13:20:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReturn manned mission to Eve. \u00A0Took a lot of trial probe flights to finally come up with a craft that I felt comfortable sending a manned mission in, with a better than even chance of being able to get them back again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-08T19:00:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hardest single thing was landing on and returning from Eve with a Kerbal.
