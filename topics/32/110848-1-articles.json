Quite a few people were opposed of the idea then, so I\u0027m wondering if this is still the case. Do you play with Camera Wobble enabled?\n\nI do, it\u0027s on for both internal and external view. It makes selecting smaller parts a bit harder when in atmospheric flight, but other than that I find it quite nice.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T02:22:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 02:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rthsom**"},{"CreatedByName":"mythbusters844","CreatedById":72313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T01:39:24Z","Content":"I find the external wobble extremely nauseating.

I agree that it gets a bit nauseating when there\u0027s only a little bit of motion - they need to add some sort of cutoff system, so that the wobble only activates when you know it\u0027s going to really *shake* and not just tilt back and forth"},{"CreatedByName":"Hotaru","CreatedById":135669,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T01:52:18Z","Content":"I voted internal only, actually I have it turned up to 200% for internal and down to 25% for external.
