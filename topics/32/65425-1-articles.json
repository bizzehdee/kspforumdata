Be aware I\u0027m running KSP Interstelar which adds some new science experiments.

I think every part with a control-from-here point has a trip logger. According to a post by Harv in some thread that I don\u0027t remember, the game takes whichever trip logger has the highest score and uses that one when giving science points after recovering a craft (but I think all trip loggers are maintained separately, so you can undock parts of a craft and end up with different recovery values). How much value each situation has on each planet I don\u0027t know. You can probably find out with a plugin using the CelestialBodyScienceParams class.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Glenathan","CreatedById":105296,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T14:35:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you ever finish this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
