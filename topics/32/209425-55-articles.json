If they can\u0027t stock the cards due to bad supply they will keep the prices up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a second hand 280x, 3 months old when I got it for 60% of a price of new. Especially when mining people sell cards they tend to drop the second hand price a lot. I got mine from a gamer who didn\u0027t like CF or some such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI imagine now people will be getting rid of older GPUs maybe some of the 770s and 780s will see second hand dirt cheap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if money is rare that is something to look for, for people who upgrade to Maxwell from the previous generation of top tier GPUs (770, 780, 280x, 290, 290x) and buy one cheap, or even two for the price of one 970 or 980.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough it\u0027s pointless to upgrade to Maxwell if one has 290, 290x, 780, 780Ti, Titan, ... The performance gain compared to 980 is negligible. Mostly I think people who hold 2 or more generations old GPUs (early Kepler GK104 680 = 770 and older) will now upgrade with all the hype they made up around Maxwell so far, until AMD kicks in with their release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENvidia lacks free sync so far, which is a standard agreed upon, Nvidia gave into it and will support it, although it\u0027s a question when since even all features marketed with Maxwell are not yet available so they are kind of selling a rabbit in bag, you buy something but who knows what really. They are slow with updating drivers. Nvidia has Gsync but it\u0027s proprietary to Nvidia and not open to others I think and wasn\u0027t standardized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.vesa.org/news/vesa-adds-adaptive-sync-to-popular-displayport-video-standard/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFree sync is adaptive sync that is VESA and displayport standard now\u003C/a\u003E, which should make it much easier and worthwhile for monitor makers to adopt instead of proprietary Gsync which has so far been limited to a couple of monitors not even worth buying.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-22T09:16:14Z\u0022 title=\u002209/22/2014 09:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by JackCY\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-22T10:09:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think either nVidia or AMD support Adaptive Sync yet.
