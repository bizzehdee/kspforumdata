First: when this issue was encountered it was post launch, while in orbit. The vessel saw normal heating during launch. Second: I conducted further experiments to confirm this is happening right out of the gate. Please see the posts 8 slots up above you and 12 slots above you. I direct your attention to the following key facts: The refusal to deploy is happening moment AFTER LAUNCH. This is NOT a heating issue, nor trigger by accident. This is a genuine issue. I have supplied to arsonide as per his request a stock parts only shuttle that is displaying this same issue. There is something amiss here, and its not user error.
