IIRC, KSP is Large Address Aware, meaning it can access up to about 3.5GB maximum. That would require a 64bit OS to fully exploit, since normally, you can only allocate 3GB to applications at most. If you have 4GB and a 64bit OS, then that\u0027s about how good it can get with memory right now. More memory is nice if you\u0027re running stuff in the background, but unless the OS takes up more than 0.5GB (Vista and 7 can do that, 8 is better about it), it won\u0027t be a significant improvement over just closing everything (unless you\u0027re on Steam, then it hogs a some memory, too).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blackstar","CreatedById":61238,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-25T16:27:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MR4Y\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MR4Y\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo, they can\u0027t, unless they are Large Address Aware(which is not something you can simply turn on).
