Not sure why, it did the insertion burn and orbit circularisation burns without spinning (tried resetting trim etc, didn\u0027t make a difference). After locking the gimbles on the two engines, and limiting thrust to about 30% I was able to bring her in (rcs could keep it on retrograde marker then). Unfortunately it came in a little hard, and too much sideways momentum (and slopped ground), it toppled over and broke 3 of the 4 solar panels. Ended with 12m/s dv and about a third of the mono prop.

I proceeded with my plans to do a crew transfer at the New Horizons space station, sending Valentina and Bill up along with Cerya (a tourist) and three newly hired scientists aboard a Raven 7 spaceplane. Got as far as orbital insertion before I had to call it a night, though I was delighted to find my ascending node with the station coincided with the apoapsis and I was able to do both insertion and plane alignment as a single burn. The Raven has a tendency to guzzle gas on the way up leaving little left for orbital ops, so this was a fortunate occurrence indeed. The plan now is to let the plane and station orbit around Kerbin a few times to close up some distance, then make a final small burn for rendezvous and docking. Once the plane has docked with the station, Val will offload Bill and the passengers and pick up a group of four tourists whose itineraries are complete to take them back down to KSC. I did manage to collect on an orbital station contract through the Raven\u0027s launch; replaced it with a contract to do some surface scans on Mun.
