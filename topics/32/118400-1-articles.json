It\u0027s a simple app with informations about planets, moons and Kerbol in versions 1.0.x. I think it\u0027s important because the [Amagi 82\u0027s app](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/82203-Kerbal-Space-App-for-Android!) is very old. The design is simple, I\u0027m terrible programator and I\u0027m programing in AppInventor. It will be finished in one week. I will take here a link on Google Play and in the app, I will take a link hither.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Orbital Characteristics\n- Physical Characteristics\n- Atmosphere Characteristics\n- List of biomes\n- Biomes Images\n- Atmosphere graphs\n- All these features for free\n\nFuture features:\n\n- A kerbonaut\u0027s section\n- The Science Tree\n- Desription of some favourite mods (MechJeb, Remote Tech, Kerbal Engineer Redux...)\n- Delta-V calculator\n- Parachute calculator\n- And some tutorials...\n\nBye for now.\n\nApp coming soon."},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T17:27:16Z","Content":"That\u0027s a great plan, I\u0027ll be sure to download the mod when it\u0027s ready"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T20:42:35Z","Content":"Hmm..
