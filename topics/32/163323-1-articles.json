However the last news I can find regarding this was in may. Any updates on that? Maybe there is a link I haven\u0027t found yet that you could show me?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease and thank you!

For the best place on these forums for information regarding the console versions and their current progress check out the last few weeks/months of KSP Weekly posts in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/forum/66-the-daily-kerbal/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EThe Daily Kerbal\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0section and/or the\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/forum/11-announcements/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EAnnouncements\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0section.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy summary according to those posts would be that Squad feels good about the progress being made by Blitzworks (the company now responsible for the console port work and one that seems far more reputable than the former port company), and Squad has outside QA help which should improve the development time and quality of the port. But check the first post in the KSP Weekly for the official word from Squad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Super Arial Ace","CreatedById":179875,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-16T22:18:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI appreicate\u00A0the information.
