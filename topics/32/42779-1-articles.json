If this happens often, try uninstalling and reinstalling your mods one at a time to see which ones are causing the problems. (If) it\u0027s the mod causing it and not just the game, make a post in the modification\u0027s thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T22:09:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewow! they said they were going to try and speed up transitions from VAB to launch pad but I never expected that! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a more serious note, I\u0027ve never seen that exact issue, but I\u0027ve had other odd things like the launch pad area being shown in map mode, never been able to reproduce it thou.
