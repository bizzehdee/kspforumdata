Paid DLC. This is never a good move by any game developer, I don\u0027t care who\u00A0you are. I have recently been hearing that KSP will now have paid DLC. Are these rumors true? See if you talk to the average guy on the street who hasn\u0027t played KSP, they usually are of the opinion that the game is overpriced. Now you and I know that the 40 bucks you pay will give you thousands of hours of enjoyment, but they dont, so they see it as overpriced. Many people I convinced to play KSP balked when they heard the price. And its not like 40 bucks is all that much, but they still balked, even though I mentioned the thousands of hours most get out of it. Why. Just why.\u00A0Now if I was a potential customer under the misguided impression KSP was slightly over-priced, and then I heard that paid DLC was a thing, that would be an instant turn off for me, because\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eevery single game\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0with piad DLC added\u00A0went down the same road: The devs had a good game maybe with some free DLC from the community, that did well, then it got sold to another company. They wanted to make more money, so they added some paid DLC, originally as just plain add ons, but nobody really bought them because the free DLC plus the stock game worked just fine. Or even just plain stock. Then the devs realized that to get people to buy this, they had to put something in that made the paid DLC better than the free stuff. There\u00A0are two ways to do this. One more drastic way is to take from stock and put in paid DLC, and the other was to put some new element or bug fix in paid DLC that players simply could not do without. So in essence, they had to force the players to buy paid DLC because the community free stuff was better. Paid DLC does not have its own market, so it must take from somewhere to make one. There must be demand for something to sell. Basic\u00A0economics. Paid DLC isn\u0027t something that is naturally desirable, so they must make players want or need it.\u00A0Both roads are a very bad turn, and it always marks the beginning of the end for the game. There\u0027s a good reason for this too. If\u00A0you start doing that, entirely aside from whether it is a money grab move or not (even though I cant see how it wouldn\u0027t be, but I\u0027m giving KSP a lot of slack) the community sees it that way and resists. Once your devs are fighting the community, that is death to the game. And eventually it ends up where stock is basically so awful that the game is unplayable without paid DLC. If it\u0027s worth paying for, it\u0027s worth adding to the stock game. There can be official DLC, and I see that is the case,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ebut it must be free of charge.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EIf not, you are falling down a very slippery slope that will be the end of the game. So I suppose I\u0027m looking for reassurance that my favorite game is not going down the drain by putting out paid DLC. If it is, I will be forced to grab the versions I can, and hunker down and stop getting new updates. The DLC may have great content. I\u0027m not arguing that. What I am saying is it cannot cost a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Esingle penny\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0because then we risk falling off this edge. That is not a risk we can take. This community is amazing but every time the dev team changes or a major change is made, then there\u0027s always the people who cry: \u0022This is the death of KSP!\u0022 Take the devs leaving. Hooooooo boy that caused a ruckus. And that wasnt the worst one. Just a recent one. But if we go down the road of paid DLC, that will really be the beginning of the end for KSP. We may be a while in dying cause KSP has a fiercely loyal community which is amazing, but the end is inevitable if you go down that road. Because for a game to make a steady profit, new people\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emust\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0buy it. Paid DLC is a fast way (one of the fastest ways)\u00A0to turn off any potential customers, no matter how awesome the game. And the community already there doesnt exactly want to pay for the new DLC either.\u00A0So as well as asking for reassurance, I am also pleading with our devs to either never go down that road or if they have already started, then to pull out while they still can. Because once you commit to that road, it is very hard to go back, because then your reputation is ruined. Then paid DLC becomes just about the only way you can make a profit any more. Then that stops. KSP has a lot of life in it. Please\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eplease\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0do not ruin it by putting paid DLC in the works. That is death. Game devs in general shouldn\u0027t make DLC really, they are kinda supposed to, you know, develop the game. But we can make slack for it like if some stuff wasnt quite polished enough to make the actual game then having it as DLC is cool. But paid DLC is just a bad idea all around.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EPlease tell me my favorite game isn\u0027t going down this route.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003ESincerely,\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EMycroft, CEO of CMAU Incorporated\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-08T15:40:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf by rumours you mean that Squad made an official announcement about it, then yes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn case you didn\u0027t know there are also \u0022rumours\u0022 that the KSP IP was bought by Take-Two.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-08T15:44:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor reference:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/157802-ksp-making-history/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/161355-ksp-acquired-by-take-two-interactive/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nascarlaser1","CreatedById":166190,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-08T15:54:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts not all that bad.
