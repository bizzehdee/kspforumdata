Each. Of course things are scaled down a bit here in comparison, but the lifting thrust on the Saturn-V at the pad was in the ballpark of 33,500 KN. To get that with Mainsails, you need at least 22 of them. Like I said, I know we\u0027re scaled down, but it\u0027s worth taking into consideration.\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Unless you\u0027re talking about the new 2.5m engine pairs specifically... yeah, if they replace mainsails altogether, that might be a bit OP.

On the SLS, NASA is using RS-25s (SSMEs) because they had them left over from the Space Shuttle program, and it would be cheaper to use those instead of developing new ones. NASA also has a very good understanding of how they work, so that\u0027s why they\u0027re using them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, that was sort of off topic. But the point is, instead of using ultra powerful engines like the F-1, NASA is opting to use RS-25s, which are not as powerful, each has 1859 Kn of thrust as the surface. And they\u0027re only using 4, thus allowing the boosters to aid until enough fuel drains. Anyways, my little science talk over. I like how with the KSP community we can discuss these sorts of things. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Giggleplex777\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Giggleplex777\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt should at least be blue. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the best option might be to color the mainsails with this new engine effect, and either blue or clear for the new engine.
