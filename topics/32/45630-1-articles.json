However, Successes require several things. This game is all about pre-requisites:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--The Cards--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER1 - Fuel, Parts, and Crew: Combine these 3 to place a Launch card.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER2 - Launch, Orbital Maneuvers and Transfer: Combine these three to add one Success.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER3 - Success: Grants 1 point to the player placing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETroubles: Cancels out 1 of your opponent\u0027s cards. Can only be used on Launch, Orbital Maneuvers or Transfers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Method of Play--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting the game, each player gets 7 random R1, a set of R2, and 4 Success cards. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECards can be traded with other players. Especially useful for R1 \u0026amp; Transfer cards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETroubles are applied immediately after your opponent places their R2 card(s).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first person to get all 4 R3 cards placed wins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Wagers--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWagers can be added (normally in the form of video games or extra snacks) fairly simply. Every time a player places a Launch or a Transfer, they can add at least 1 item to the wager pool. The person who wins the game gets the entire wager pool.
