They tend to hold up well on smaller craft but once you go tall they wobble like crazy. IRL we have big fuel tanks that are structurally strong from the inside, in KSP on the other hand we have to reinforce it ourselves with many a struts (which = high part count which= lag sadly). Is there anyway to tweak the CFG to make them stronger? Is it something that will be tweaked in upcoming versions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T05:31:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can counteract it to some degree with struts and structural parts as it is (and by building properly symmetrically).

The Unity engine connects objects at single points only, so if you have things that are big enough and you apply enough force to them, things are going to wobble. There\u0027s nothing that Squad can do about it, except what they\u0027ve already done: give us a strut part to reinforce things with.

They get physics just like any other part.

Stick some struts on to a stack separator, then some other part. Go out into orbit and detach that stack separator, the struts will fly away with some velocity.

This game is sooo much fun and has so much potential but the engine is just keeping it back. For me at least. Full 64 bit and multicore support is a must, as we all as better graphic card support. Idk if they are, but if they want to add more solar systems you can visit you will need a better game engine that can support that along with bigger ships and more travel variety.
