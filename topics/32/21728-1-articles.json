Orbiter\u0027s MFDs give a lot of information too, but I have read comments from a number of regulars on these forums that they can\u0027t get into Orbiter they way they\u0027ve gotten into KSP. I think that is because Orbiter is a space simulation, while vanilla KSP is more of a physics sandbox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it is great that mods like Protractor, Kerbal Engineer and MechJeb exist for people that want to use them, but including their functionality in the vanilla game would only alienate those who don\u0027t want to use them. The way it is right now, we\u0027ve got the best of both worlds.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Qumefox","CreatedById":43197,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-10T19:34:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t agree. The future information readouts and automation that get added to the game will most likely not be integrated permanently in the UI, say, like the altimeter, etc. My guess is they\u0027ll end up like our current mods.. They\u0027ll be modules you can add to the craft that provides them. If you don\u0027t like them, you don\u0027t have to add those parts to your ships.. Said modules will also mostly likely NOT be available early in the game.

Completing campaign missions/goals rewards you with larger budgets/unlocked technologies, etc. This mode should emphasise efficiency and doing things right, and reward the player for being as efficient as possible.. For instance; Unused budget for this mission will roll over to the next one.. and any ship parts, staging or otherwise, that are returned to the surface of kerbin intact, are able to be reused for future missions without having to rebuy them, or at least, can reuse them for a greatly discounted refurbishment cost.

That or using one of the online calculators. So in the long run it comes down to a) holding objects up against big expensive LCD monitors to measure angles repeated times, plugging numbers into a spreadsheet, and using said data do do your burns... Or using a mod that takes the place of holding objects against expensive monitors, and the afore mentioned spreadsheet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your \u0027planning\u0027 somehow manages to skip the whole \u0027holding things against your monitor\u0027 stage, then i\u0027m all ears.
