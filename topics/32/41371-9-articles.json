It\u0027s a good idea, but putting it in practice poses a few challenges.\u003Cp\u003EHow do we rate the science value of your missions? What even defines a mission in the first place? These things are actually pretty hazy in terms of how the game deals with them, so coming up with a nice, solid way of doing science is a deceptively tough task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do believe I\u0027ve worked out a good solution now:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game won\u0027t award you any science automatically. That would be artificial and generally meaningless, but worse still, it would require us to make arbitrary decisions about the science value of this or that action. That\u0027s a bad road to go down. Instead, we can let you \u0027do science\u0027 as part of your missions, and get your science points for yourself. Here\u0027s how:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe already have a few science sensor parts, which apart from a context menu readout, are largely decorative. We can put those to some use now, along with a couple other scientific parts we\u0027re going to add. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is that science parts work as one-shot experiments. That is, they\u0027re activated by action group or as part of the staging sequence, and once deployed, they to their thing. This is essentially deploying the experiment to gather data. This data isn\u0027t science yet though, because you need to get it to your resident experts over at R\u0026amp;D to crunch the numbers and make some sense out of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo do that, you can recover the experiments (or whatever is left of them). That will convert the data you gathered into scientific knowledge, provided you don\u0027t already have it. This is done by us storing where each experiment was run and what it was, and using that \u0027source\u0027 as a key to a multiplier value, which starts at 100% and gets progressively lower the more data on the same subject you gather. The more you spam the same type of experiment in the same place, the less science you\u0027ll get for the data it generates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if we\u0027ve learned anything this far, it\u0027s that recovery is by no means guaranteed. So here\u0027s where the antennas and comm dishes finally get a purpose. Once available, you can use comms equipment to transmit science data back down and gain science immediately. Of course, you can\u0027t expect to get as much knowledge for the same experiment data if you beam it back as if you had recovered it hands-on. How efficient the data-for-science rate is depends largely on the quality of the antenna being used, as does its power requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe possibilities for what the science-gathering parts can be then are pretty huge. They could be anything from experiment canisters filled with some mystery goo, a camera array, a mass spectrometer, anything really. Functionally it all works the same way, and better yet, it works \u003Cem\u003Ewith \u003C/em\u003Ethe game rather than over it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s about it in a very tightly packed nutshell. I\u0027m pretty happy with this idea now, it should fit any style of playing. You could focus on running as many different experiments as possible in Kerbin\u0027s lower atmosphere, or rush into discovering the different properties of Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 across the farthest reaches of the solar system, and hopefully any point in between as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDisclaimer: Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 is not really a planned feature (yet).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI previously assumed that career mode would revolve around completing specific missions like orbiting a satellite or landing on the Mun with the option to repeat them in some way for smaller gains, \u003Cstrong\u003Ebut what you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve described sounds much better\u003C/strong\u003E. It seems easier to create a wide range of goals and much more balanced for allowing sandbox like pursuit of the players own goals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I understand what you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re proposing it is to have instruments that each \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153collect\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 a specific science \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153resource\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2, with instruments some having a limited use count before they are worn out. The resources are not infinite but also get used up in the process. Cities XL has a resource system like this \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 you need things like water and oil and each map has an overlay showing which parts of the map have it (in KSP it would be hidden). When you place a water tower it takes a circular bite out of the overlay, so you can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t just place water towers side by side. From the technical side it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s just a 1 bit map of yes/no values, and placed structures mark a point and radius where the resource is already collected. Attempting to collect anything either on a grid section marked 0 in the map, or within the radius of a previously \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153mined\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 point fails. Better instruments might take a larger bite. I assume this would work even in the planetary nature of Kerbal \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 each planet, moon and the sun has a map for each type of science resource they contain. Either the map or the instrument has altitude parameters \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 you need to be right on the surface to collect rocks, while others require a certain altitude range, like between 70km and 100km to gather from a magnetic anomaly map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce a resource is \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153collected\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 you aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t instantly turning it into science. Instead there are path(s) by which an entity can convert units of one resource into units of another resource, until eventually you reach the Kerbal Space Center where the R\u0026amp;D building has the conversions to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Science\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2.

So the little antenna we have right now might be perfect for sending back just about anything from Kerbin orbit, but on Duna the distance factor would dramatically increase the time to transmit just 1x resource back to KSC. For this you would want a larger Duna base station with a big transmitting antenna. Your little rover transmits the information resources to the base station (short distance so the antenna is still fast), and then the powerful base station antenna sends it back to KSC. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe antenna efficiency becomes really important if there are practical limits on just how slow you can send, preventing the exploit of just time warping. The realistic but computationally harder approach is that transmissions require line of sight to the receiver (parts and other small scale objects don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t block LoS, just planets), and each resource unit can only be transmitted in full. That means that if the efficiency has dropped to the point that it takes 5 minutes to send 1x resource then you must have a LoS window of at least 5 minutes to send it. If LoS is broken the transfer has to start over again. A probe on the dark side of the Mun would need an orbiting relay to send information back to KSC, and a probe on Duna must transmit fast enough to complete at least one transfer before Kerbin rotates out of view.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T01:24:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Skyrunner27\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Skyrunner27\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis would suck the fun from the game.

Since recovery is going to be worth less than com reportings experiments, I\u0027d suggest that for a mission you have the ability to both \u0022com back\u0022 experiment data to earn research points AND be able to return the mission and recover it for the rest of the points you would have been able to get if you had just launched the mission normally and recovered it. This provides a bit of a safety net for missions. So if I launch my Apollo mission to the Mun, land with some instruments I can beam back my experiment data to get half credit and then return the mission to get the rest of the credit, but if I lose the mission in the process of returning it, I still got half credit for beaming the information back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other \u0022lastly\u0022 not, I don\u0027t think money is going to make it in to this one. Harv made it sound like that wasn\u0027t super likely for this release, though it sounds like they are going to work some of the mechanics in to the back end so that KSP is a bit more ready for money in career mode. Earning money and using it sounds like that is another big dynamic which might be better off waiting for .23 instead of .22. Though maybe this is in part where resource collection is going to come in. Either in part to earn money, or maybe at least make missions less expensive by producing resources that would allow you to better re-use parts (IE you can refuel your interplanetary tug in Mun orbit from your mining/refining base and fuel station rather than returning to Kerbin, and then having to spend money on building a rocket to ferry fuel up to your tug).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HarvesteR","CreatedById":4,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T15:08:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lazarus1024\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lazarus1024\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt sounds like there will be no time component.

[snip] \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you mean a time component referring to requiring some time to elapse to research a new tech node, then no, that\u0027s something you can work around by simply having a ship at the pad to wait it out. These time constraints usually only work for real-time games, where time management is big. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, as for the experiments themselves, some experiments could require a running time. Like you said, some gravity measurement in Kerbin orbit could be picking up data over the course of several orbits. But then we get into the \u0022you can jsut time warp\u0022 issue, so I think such mechanics have to be worked in carefully. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cool thing about this is that it doesn\u0027t really matter much as far as the science is concerned. This becomes a front-end feature, something that the experiment module itself worries about. It\u0027s up to how each experiment works then. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the money, you are correct. A budget implementation is something we\u0027re only planning for later, so it\u0027s not going to be on this update. But in keeping with our ways of always keeping the game at a playable state, the R\u0026amp;D system is able to function without it, as a standalone mechanic. Hence the whole science thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoney does come into R\u0026amp;D eventually, but it\u0027s much too soon to be talking about that right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rdb78","CreatedById":73195,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T15:26:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would love a landing radar that told you the incline of the surface below the spacecraft.
