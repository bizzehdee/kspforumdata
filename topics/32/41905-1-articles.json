It\u0027s not strictly neccessary, because you can end up with a ToD on a live Kerbal without editing anything if they were killed on a flight that got reverted. For some reason it doesn\u0027t reset their ToD when you revert.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the other stats, Brave and Dumb are Courage and Stupidity respectively (though I\u0027m still pretty sure that Stupidity is backwards, because Bill\u0027s is high and Bob\u0027s is low, but I guess I could be wrong.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBadS...say it out loud.

It at least used to give the same IDX number to people on different flights, and I never could figure out how it kept track of who was on what flight. I\u0027m slightly curious as to if they changed the way this one works a bit in 0.21 to make the new assignment system work, but I really have no clue.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-10T16:12:38Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2013 04:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
