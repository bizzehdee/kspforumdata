Why much around in 1.0.2 when 1.0.4 has a better (if also sometimes harsher) heat model, somewhat fewer bugs, and new parts to play with? Start stock if you must and add your mods as they become available. But in general, a lot of 1.0 and 1.0.2 mods work in 1.0.4. Use at your own risk, but the main changes there were to aero and heat, so if the mod doesn\u0027t touch those subjects (which mostly but not always means it doesn\u0027t have parts), you should be OK.

Games are meant to be fun, so once you find a place that is fun, stick to it. If the game updates, but you don\u0027t feel comfortable upgrading yet, just sit it out and wait until you feel you actually want to update yourself. If you\u0027re running the game on steam, make sure you have a backup copy of the KSP folder of your favorite version and turn off automatic updates. For reference: the pathway you want for the KSP folder (using a steam install) is program files/steam/steamapps/common/Kerbalspaceprogram (or possibly KSP, I\u0027m not too sure about the exact folder name and I\u0027m not on my gaming PC right now).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, here\u0027s something someone on \u0022teh internets\u0022 once taught me to do in cases like this.
