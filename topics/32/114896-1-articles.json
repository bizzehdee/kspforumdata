Its TODAY I\u0027m talking about.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nI got married on February 10th, and being Dutch (living in NZ since before time began) I got into an online relationship with a woman in Holland (OK, in case my wife sees this post, Nederland, because Holland, she tells me, is only a province of Nederland) and on 24th of January, she arrived for a holiday but we hit it off so well, we put caution to the wind and got married, and we both do not regret that move. \n\nBUT... since then, its been a fight and a half to get her status her approved so she can stay here... no wonder most people give up and go home. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nSo, that drastically cut into my KSP playing time, not only to I need to devote time to Rianne (my wife) but also to the fight with the immigration people.\n\nON TOP OF THAT.... we moved to a larger house. I should be happy, I have a larger computer room (Man cave) and also a workshop outside but....\n\nThe man cave is only half set up and I have computers everywhere (I used to be a computer tech) ... so THAT also cuts into my KSP time....\n\nand then... while we have moved in, there is still a heap of stuff outside that needs to go to the rubbish dump... and the weather (winter here) hasn\u0027t been kind, recent flooding here is proof of that) so THAT is on my mind.... it cuts into my KSP playing time...\n\nAnd the recent 1.0.3 and 1.0.4 version updates SCARED me so much that for a time, I stopped playing KSP altogther in case my persistence file malfunctioned... I need not have worried, mostly... it seems to still work...\n\nBut the mods... argghhh... what works and what doesn\u0027t? They APPEAR to all work... that fear cut into my playing time too.... ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nAnd now.... after all that, I cannot seem to want to load KSP and get Valentina off the Mun. I\u0027m scared the mods wont work or the new changes will kill Valentina as she re-enters the atmosphere... you may not care, or think this is trivial, but its a personal challenge for me to keep them alive.\n\nAnd that depresses me...\n\nI have not loaded KSP for days now.... I think I need a group hug, or maybe some counselling... \n\n Maybe if I say that if I get one hundred hugs, or posts of encouragement ... I\u0027ll load the game. But I won\u0027t.\n\nAnyone ever had a situation like this, what snapped you out of the depression... ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-02T22:47:24Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2015 10:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by kiwi1960**"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T22:50:28Z","Content":"Take a break.

I will have a stretch of not playing Kerbal for a week or two, just because I am busy or because my career game is at a bit of a sticky or boring point. I also find that I am less inclined to play Kerbal when I am drunk (or really, really stoned... being normal-stoned makes KSP pretty awesome though) or tired. I don\u0027t have the enthusiasm I need for a sandbox/project game. My favorite, most productive, and most enjoyable moments playing KSP have been early in the morning. Nothing like 7am on a Saturday, drinking tons of coffee and launching all kinds of interesting vehicles. For whatever reason that is when I am in the optimal Kerballing mindset.\n\nYou might have your own peak mental state for playing KSP.

Why much around in 1.0.2 when 1.0.4 has a better (if also sometimes harsher) heat model, somewhat fewer bugs, and new parts to play with? Start stock if you must and add your mods as they become available. But in general, a lot of 1.0 and 1.0.2 mods work in 1.0.4. Use at your own risk, but the main changes there were to aero and heat, so if the mod doesn\u0027t touch those subjects (which mostly but not always means it doesn\u0027t have parts), you should be OK. If it\u0027s flight instrumentation needing engine stats and such, however, you need a current version."},{"CreatedByName":"kiwi1960","CreatedById":81697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T02:06:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well, congrats on the marriage.

Stress can pile up and change what you consider rewarding and fun. KSP is, at it\u0027s heart, a very challenging game that requires a lot of skill and forethought. If recent events in your life have demanded much of those same skills then even *thinking* of planning a mars mission seems like a job instead of a game.\n\nMy advice? Take your wife and go on a long walk somewhere. Unwind... clear your head for a few days. Wait until your mind craves the challenge again then come back. The best part is you can hang around the forum until that point, maybe someone will post a craft or story that will inspire you and everything will click back in place.\n\nIn the end, this is just a video game... and if there is one thing this game teaches us it is that there is a huge, amazing universe out there beyond our little computers.

There is more to life than computer games and KSP. Devote extra time to your spouse do things together and don\u0027t let those pesky immigration people get to you, the final victory over them will be more satisfying. I am also taking a long break from computer games (have not played KSP since it hit 0.90) and concentrate on other real life things, for me the most important thing the last 2 months is my final preparation for a mountain marathon at the end of July, fun fact physical activity and especially running can lower depression levels, as mentioned go for a walk at a park and if possible a daily excursion at nature will boost your morale and your mood. You can also read a book, it will take your mind of from things for while. The most important thing right now is not to let depression get any worse, close any TV you have and don\u0027t listen to any news, they can hit you real bad, an alternative is to start a garden (even better if it is a vegetable garden the feeling of satisfaction will take away the depression).

I\u0027ve been hesitant to start up KSP myself because of the recent amount of updates. Personally, I would suggest the following: take one version of KSP, get it up to speed with your favorite mods and stick with said version until you want to upgrade to the newest one. Games are meant to be fun, so once you find a place that is fun, stick to it. If the game updates, but you don\u0027t feel comfortable upgrading yet, just sit it out and wait until you feel you actually want to update yourself. If you\u0027re running the game on steam, make sure you have a backup copy of the KSP folder of your favorite version and turn off automatic updates. For reference: the pathway you want for the KSP folder (using a steam install) is program files/steam/steamapps/common/Kerbalspaceprogram (or possibly KSP, I\u0027m not too sure about the exact folder name and I\u0027m not on my gaming PC right now).\n\nFinally, here\u0027s something someone on \u0022teh internets\u0022 once taught me to do in cases like this.
