Not too bad, except that that particular module was put in place by a tug, so it had no RCS or in fact no probe core or other means of control. The only way to stick the station back together was to try and dock my Minmus lander to it (which wasn\u0027t blessed with RCS either) and use the lander as a makeshift tug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI confess to giving up on this one and reloading.
