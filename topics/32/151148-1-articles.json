The throttle only goes up to half way and I think it\u0027s because the linux kernel is sending a range of [-Min, \u002BMax] instead of [0, Max]. I\u0027ve never been able to fix this, and although this isn\u0027t the main topic of this post,\u00A0I\u0027d be interested to know if anybody has successfully got this working (please no suggestions unless you\u0027ve confirmed that it actually works on GNU/Linux -\u00A0I\u0027ve tried pretty much everything you could suggest right down to considering compiling a custom kernel).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was wondering if anybody has any suggestions for a better joystick that they can confirm does work on GNU/Linux and gives the full range of throttle.

A calibration program like jstest or jstest-gtk will show that the reported values are about what you\u0027d expect, in the range 32765 to -32765 (the values are inverse, with the highest being at the bottom of the dial). The fun part happens when KSP starts up. If you launch it in a terminal, you\u0027ll see it initialising controllers, \u003Cem\u003Eand remapping values\u003C/em\u003E. With the throttle all the way at the bottom of the dial, my KSP install logs this when I start it:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\nImporting game controller configs\n/dev/input/js0: driver version: 2.1.0 (20100)\n/dev/input/js0: fd 4, buttons 12, axes 6, name Logitech Logitech Extreme 3D\n/dev/input/js0: axis  0: raw      0, mapped 0.000000\n/dev/input/js0: axis  1: raw      0, mapped 0.000000\n/dev/input/js0: axis  2: raw      0, mapped 0.000000\n/dev/input/js0: axis  3: raw  32767, mapped 0.000000\n/dev/input/js0: axis  4: raw      0, mapped 0.000000\n/dev/input/js0: axis  5: raw      0, mapped 0.000000\n\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAxis 3 is the throttle, and its value of 32767 is being remapped by the game to be 0.
