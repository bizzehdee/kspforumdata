Getting a basic career mode up and running seems to be the current focus. Those missions will probably entail what has been in real-life. So they\u0027ll be about getting into orbit, docking, landing on the Mun/Minmus and sending probes to the various planets. Such a set of missions requires a few things. First the Kerbal Knowledge Base needs to be expanded on. That means removing the planets from the map screen and have them (as they\u0027ve talked about) and adding parts that will let us discover and analyze them. More sensors, telescopes, that sort of stuff. In line with this is the ability to do more stuff while on new moons/planets. Analyzing rocks, collecting soil samples, etc. I can\u0027t imagine that they\u0027d implement basic career mode and not focus on letting us do more while landed on other planets/moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMining and resources won\u0027t come in 0.22. They allow missions beyond what we in real-life have done, so that stuff and their accompanying missions makes a lot more sense when career mode and basic exploration missions have been added. Tweakables will have arrived by the time we get resources, but it might be something we already see earlier as it\u0027d be damn handy to have and it might be separate enough from resources to get included.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pulstar","CreatedById":57193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T16:16:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ll possibly see some rudimentary mission generation and reward system since the progress tracker is working. Maybe the basics of space program economy like a budget, kerbals costing money to hire along with buying parts (hey rockomax and probodyne need to make money somehow!). In career mode of course, sandbox will remain unchanged. That\u0027s at least what I expect since with the progress tracker up it makes sense to make a system utilizing it next. Would be nice if the kerbal knowledge base, which is a bit underwhelming now, started listing how close you got and when to all the celestial objects using data the progress tracker dumps into the persistence file.
