Simply said due to Jool gravity and the gravity from other moons, Laythe is stretched and becomes a bit egg shape. This forms cracks along the crust and creates friction underground. In turn this creates heat which I stops the oceans from freezing over. This same process can be seen on moons o biting Satan and Jupiter. On the moon there are a lot of ring shape and semi ring shape continents. This could be signs of past volcanism.

That element is not particularly common in our own Solar System - well at least not enough to fill up entire seas. Perhaps the solar nebula that world condensed out of had quite a different materials allotment than ours did.

I am very ignorant regarding the actual physics and math involved, but I feel that it would be possible for the Kerbal planets to form if the required energy of nuclear fusion is lower, perhaps by virtue of a stronger strong force or a weaker electromagnetic force, or some combination of the two. The idea of the planets being made partly of superheavy elements has been thrown around a lot, and I think that a greater abundance of heavy elements would help explain the small size of both terrestrial and gaseous worlds... and perhaps to some extent the odd color of Jool\u0027s atmosphere, and Eve\u0027s oceans.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-08T08:06:47Z\u0022 title=\u002210/08/2012 08:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 8, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Accelerando\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
