During development, patch timing has an impact on mod release pacing and career achievements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is simply a plan, when 0.22 is released, to say \u0022We\u0027re not even attempting to coordinate for a 0.23 release in the next 10 weeks, after that there will not be any predefined release date, but we will be on the path towards a release\u0022. It seems like it would mitigate the issue with rigid release dates that can be missed and piss off the community, versus releases which go out on schedule with bugs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T14:10:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot a bad idea it seems\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Carthaginian","CreatedById":40635,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T14:12:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey have said this ain\u0027t gonna happen so many times!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only reason they did let us know that today was release was to see just how much traffic their servers could handle. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robje","CreatedById":59484,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T14:13:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think all of us should just be patient\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hugix","CreatedById":55379,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T14:14:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe only release date known is that every time someone asks when a new version will come out the release date is being hold back 1 day.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T14:14:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eits a rock and a hard place,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eno one solution keeps more than a minority of people happy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T14:16:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EClosing this thread. This is pretty much a suggestion for giving release dates, maybe not to the day but at least to the week. Players who follow development do get updates surrounding it every now and then. The KSP Weekly often talks about progress and when the new update is going into its final stage before release (experimentals) this is announced as well. Whether or not to announce release dates and anything surrounding them is the sole responsibility of Squad. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
