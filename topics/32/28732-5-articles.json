If I smash a lander into the mun, I personally want to see debris strewn across the landscape. Why should all my landing legs and struts explode into a fireball? Something like a monopropellant pod would smash open and leak, but remain intact (and perhaps be recoverable as scrap). Also, when something actually explodes or becomes extremely damaged, it should release generic \u0027debris\u0027 that can be impacted or cause further impacts. For example, if my large RCS tank explodes, it sends a few pieces of \u0027debris\u0027 randomly out, that have a decent chance of hitting other parts of the ship and causing more damage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we actually got a decent damage model, where I can smash things into the ground and see all kinds of twisted pieces of my ship left, some maybe intact, some not, I would do nothing but smash **** into the Mun.
