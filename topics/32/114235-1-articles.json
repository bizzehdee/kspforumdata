However, in terms of career progression, I don\u0027t understand how it can be used effectively. To be able to build it in the first place you need quite a bit of science, pretty much all of which will come from LKO and maybe Munar experiments. So when it comes time to put a station with a science lab up there as part of a contract, you might as well use it to generate more science, but to generate science it requires experiments, all of which you\u0027ve exhausted researching the thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I to believe they expect us at that stage to bring back experiments from Minmus and beyond and deposit them at the station?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I think it would be nice to get contracts to send experiments to the station that add to the science generation.

Started my Duna mission, gathered science, left the MPL there and started an EVE mission. By the time my EVE lab arrived, I could harvest the Duna installation twice. That 1000 science transmited was helpful, but not too much to make further research moot. So MPLs are cool when doing multiple interplanetary missions, or when I\u0027m interested in one enough to timewarp there instead of doing other stuff while an expedition arrives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course one can just do excessive timewarping to unlock the tree and make funds from sci, but at this point it\u0027s easier to just play sandbox.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T17:42:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 05:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Evanitis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T14:48:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Evanitis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Evanitis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMany in this thread seems to forget that science-gain has a difficulty-slider.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is also true.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I agree that the MLP might come a little bit late in the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aragosnat","CreatedById":60487,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T16:26:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do agree that the lab does come a bit late as well as used as a Fund generator so one does not have to accept to many contracts that make no sense to do.
