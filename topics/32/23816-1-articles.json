I ALWAYS kill a crew on one of these three flights (typically the high/high abort), and I can\u0027t help but feel sorry for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefor, I decided to make an unmanned \u0022Mass simulator\u0022 akin to what was just launched by the Antares on it\u0027s first flight: something with the same weight, drag, and control authority as a regular command pod, but without the capacity for crew. I\u0027m using a Rockomax adaptor for the 3-seat, and a nosecone adaptor for the 1-seat pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there anyone interested in having a copy of these after I complete testing?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xionis","CreatedById":59696,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T05:45:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPsh, Kerbals don\u0027t die, they just uh... experience a permanent reassignment to elsewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThatBum","CreatedById":57405,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T06:18:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERemember: KIA is Kebal Is Alright.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry using MechJeb on the craft and view the acceleration in M/s squared.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you oppose MechJeb, or want to feel more science-y, try \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/graphotron-2000/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGraphotron\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpsterMan","CreatedById":32671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T06:23:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot to burst your bubble, but there is an old mod that has Mass Simulators.

In fact, if I forget to use Kerbal Crew Manifest to load up the pods, I fly unmanned launches by accident. Nice because I\u0027m testing the exact ship I\u0027m flying, no chance that swapping out the command pods will mess up the staging, etc. Plus, if I just happen to mess up, which I never do, and run out of fuel while rendezvousing a manned ascent craft with an unmanned but fueled orbital module, I can take control of the unmanned orbital module and do the rendezvous that way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Splode","CreatedById":57337,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T11:05:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just make my kerbals walk the plank.
