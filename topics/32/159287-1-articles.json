However, I don\u0027t believe that the game shines in\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0aspect- after all, the parts are quite limited, and when you assemble a rocket it doesn\u0027t\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Efeel\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0like a rocket per-se, more like a non-complex object: a fuel tank seems to be a simple cylinder that you put on an engine, an engine seems like a plain old nozzle that you snap onto a fuel tank, you don\u0027t have to straighten each part perfectly and inspect hundreds of components,\u00A0the complexity of avionics is not conveyed properly in the game, a fuel tank seems like a single part that cannot snap, shear, wear away, etc,\u00A0the list goes on... Of course, a lot of this is plainly unachievable in the game, but hey, that doesn\u0027t mean that the feeling of simplicity disappears. Nevertheless, this paragraph is not a request for change, just a thought on why KSP can be quite unappealing at times. The devs made an astounding job of compensating for the game\u0027s otherwise unfixable atmospheric flaws, and they really do deserve a standing ovation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere do I think this game truly shines? It is a painting canvas: with a small base of stock parts in the beginning, anyone who knows how to mod and model can create a tidal wave of\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eanything he frickin\u0027 wants\u003C/em\u003E. This is what this game is about now, and it is one of the next steps in gaming: this is a true sandbox, a game where you can use whatever you want to create anything you want- from boats to rockets to cars to tanks, ad infinitum. I believe that after all these years of improvements, changes, et al, this is the ultimate goal that the game achieved. It is this goal that we should strive towards, because in the end a game is about\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Efun\u003C/em\u003E, not about whether it focuses on space or boats, not about mechjeb or manual control, and not about losing its original meaning. This game has made it so far because it was addicting, it was enjoyable and satisfying, and it is becoming even more so with every released version, simply because of the amount of opportunities that appear with every update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Matuchkin","CreatedById":135127,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-16T17:25:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that if this seems like a ramble, that is because I was extremely rushed when writing this.

I kind of believe otherwise- when you think of KSP, you think of Sandbox mode. 99% of the creations in the Spacecraft Exchange are created for Sandbox.

Add to that the fact that anyone who knows how to mod can add\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eliterally\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0anything to the game, and KSP becomes mostly a sandbox.
