Also, you can use RCS to help the turns, but activate them only when you really need them, as they consume it\\\u0027s fuel quite fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the ship is really heavy, then you should be patient and do really slow turns, because if the turn picks up speed, you\\\u0027ll have a hard and frustrating time controlling the ship again. Small taps of the direction keys help me a lot with heavy ships. SAS helps a lot also...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-26T10:15:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome or all of the engines in any stage should be the gimbal type (ie. directional thrust). In the atmosphere, controllable fins (eg. AV-R8 Winglet) also help steer (IMO really only good for first stage).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also recommend always having an ASAS module on any serious craft. Note that to steer you should have SAS turned off, then have it on when you want to hold a direction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"flaillomanz","CreatedById":8088,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-26T10:18:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need \u003Cem\u003Emore thrust.\u003C/em\u003E 8)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-26T16:57:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat does your ship look like?
