I understand that Sandbox is always being updated when career mode gets updated even though Career gets more features than sandbox. But isn\u0027t that the way it should be? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Anyway, I\u0027ve started 3 career games since it was introduced but my latest one is the one that I got the farthest in but I usually stop playing and start a Sandbox. I Just like the RPG pliability especially when I use Crew Manifest to give my Kerbals rank, and Final Frontier to give them Ribbons. But i still do probe incursions and would still like R\u0026amp;D to be open at least the Archives, and see the witty science notes when i do science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E That being said I would love to hear your take on this debate and see what you guys play the most.
