If you are going to do this kind of thing, there are several things to keep in mind:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) This is a BUG REPORT. Those go in the BUG REPORT sub-forum, under Development and Support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) If this is indeed a bug report, and not a fail attempt at trolling, then you need to give more detail. Such as how to recreate this bug, exactly what this bug does, screenshots, output logs, etcetera. Otherwise this is useless, and people will just see this and think it\u0027s a troll, and ignore it. Which turns out badly for you, because you don\u0027t get help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Kraken is widely misused. This is most likely not a kraken, just a crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Please, Please, PLEASE read the rules and such threads before you post these threads. There is a thread in the earlier mentioned Development and Support Sub-Form that explains all of what I have just said.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
