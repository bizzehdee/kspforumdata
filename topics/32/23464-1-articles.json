Will we be getting a fix for this random node collapse, self deletion and general glitchyness. When I am trying to set up a burn it takes 10x the time it should take due to these problems. It would be nice to have a numeric system rather than this imprecise node dragging method. It\u0027s one reason why MechJeb is used so much I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently I\u0027m trying to get to Duna again and for some reason the normal methods aren\u0027t working. I burn at the right time at the right ejection angle and still miss by 8 million metres. When I go to use the nodes to refine the course the intercept point bounces all over the place like it doesn\u0027t have a clue where I will end up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T05:54:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure it will be fixed eventually (it needs to be), but in the meantime to prevent you from pulling out all your hair, I highly recommend the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/maneuver-node-improvement/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EManeuver Node Improvement mod\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen a couple people mention this mod in YouTube videos, but they seem to have missed one of its most important features: Pressing the \u0022o\u0022 key will open a maneuver node back up after it just collapsed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, I love the ease with which you can switch conic draw modes on the fly with this mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T05:56:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Maneuver Node Improvement mod (mentioned above) and the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/haystack/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHaystack mod\u003C/a\u003E (which helps you select the ship you WANT as your target) have saved me from lots of frustration.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T12:54:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, I use Haystack after it was pointed out to me.
