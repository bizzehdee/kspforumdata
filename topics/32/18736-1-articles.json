I did a test with them, and it was performing the Munar injection burns at different altitudes around Kerbin. I was wondering if the higher speed of a lower orbit would work better, or if a higher altitude that I already expended more energy to reach would be better. Turns out, the SRBs (which burn the same amount of time every time, thus making for a perfect test) brought my Ap higher when I was in a lower orbit.
