I share your hope, I really do, but I\u0027m not *entirely* sure about this one. It really depends on how far up they separate and more importantly: what speed and angle you\u0027re going/accellerating at. When I was experimenting with RATO (Rocket Assisted Take-Off) on my spaceplanes, I was already able to recover the boosters from under the wings with the current physics bubble by setting the chutes to open at 50m above ground, but it\u0027s a different matter entirely when using rockets.\u003Cp\u003EIf you use the larges SRB\u0027s currently available in stock, you\u0027re likely to ditch them somewhere around the 10km mark (assuming a regular ascent profile) and you\u0027ll be going pretty fast when you do, probably over 200m/s. The booster will fall to the ground, but you\u0027ll probably be accelarating away from it faster than it is falling. Add to that the fact that its travel time to the gorund is amplified by the thicker atmoshpere and the chutes, and you\u0027ll find that they\u0027ll likely leave physics bubble before they hit the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, there\u0027s a LOT of balance changes in the works.
