Through all of that, you will certainly have enough science to max the tree, and can probably get most of what you need in a few launches to the Mun / Minmus. If you really push it as quickly as you can you should be able to get all the rocketry, docking and grappling nodes in ~10 days of game time, which will give you plenty of time to figure out a game plan for that asteroid.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sporkafife","CreatedById":38208,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-12T20:04:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like a challenge to me \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E I did try an Impactor method once, but it didn\u0027t really change the orbit at all.
