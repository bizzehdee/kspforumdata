Back in 0.90 I had created a nice orbital Minmus base with a core that was a Class-C asteroid. I would tug up fuel from Kerbin and use that to refuel a lander that was going down to the surface base, visit various biomes or complete various mission on Minmus. The base had a lab for resetting the science instruments on the lander and several docking ports for docking other vessels. Worked pretty well and was a lot of fun. Now with resource mining this sounds like an even better idea. Since I could mine and refine the ore right on the asteroid for use. I assume the amount of ore is somewhat proportional to the asteroids mass? Is there a percentage range of ore you can expect from an asteroid? What does the various scanners return when you scan an asteroid?"},{"CreatedByName":"Prepper-Jack","CreatedById":143834,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T18:53:31Z","Content":"I had thought asteroids had a 90% ore rating, or thereabouts. They can be more quickly mined, therefore, than other bodies - but unlike other bodies, they can be depleted."},{"CreatedByName":"vicwarrior","CreatedById":120410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T19:01:16Z","Content":"From what ive heard, not quite enough to make it worth your while to tug into LKO to set up a refueling outpost as very littloe ore will be left after the fuel you use to get it there.

(Don\u0027t haul the whole thing back, just wait for \u0027good\u0027 ones with favourable orbits you can dash out, milk dry, and return the fuel to a useful orbit while you leave the bulk of the asteroid mass on its original path?)\n\nOr how effective can you make areobreak captures?"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T21:21:16Z","Content":"All of it. ;P"},{"CreatedByName":"TerminalV","CreatedById":97731,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T21:42:20Z","Content":"Thanks, that helps alot! ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nNo one has any experience mining asteroids yet?"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T21:46:34Z","Content":"I\u0027m en route to a C, and I really hope it has enough ore because otherwise that crew won\u0027t be coming home any time soon ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"TerminalV","CreatedById":97731,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T21:57:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m en route to a C, and I really hope it has enough ore because otherwise that crew won\u0027t be coming home any time soon ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nUpdate us, I will be interested in hearing how it works out.\n\nI found the following thread that seems to give a mixed message as some think it worth the effort and other think its not.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119433-Asteroid-Mining](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119433-Asteroid-Mining)"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T23:30:12Z","Content":"They seem to have plenty of fuel, enough that you can use the ore from them to fuel the astro-tug that brings them back to LKO and still have quite a lot of resources left in the asteroid.\n\nI\u0027ve not tried doing any scans with the resources scanning gear.\n\nI\u0027ve mostly been fetching class C\u0027s back to LKO and my astro-tug is totally self sufficient doing that. \n\nThe Class C\u0027s I\u0027ve brought back have on average about 25 tons of resources left to mine That\u0027s after they\u0027ve provided all the fuel to bring them back to orbit (and enter orbit without aero-braking) and refuelled the tug to go off on it\u0027s next mission.
