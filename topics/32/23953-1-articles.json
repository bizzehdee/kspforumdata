This is supposed to make it easier for you to correct against CoM shifting, particularly if you place multiple sets of linear thrusters and then activate/deactivate them as your CoM changes. ie: Change the length of the \u0022lever\u0022 you are using.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T04:49:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you losing control because of thruster placement, or because ASAS goes berserk with the RCS and gets into a continual spasm of over-corrections?
