The mathematical expression of this comes out in Tsiolkovsky\u0027s rocket equation:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E = Ve * ln(mw/md) = Gm * Isp * ln(mw/md).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E is delta-V, or your craft\u0027s capacity to change its speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVe is exhaust velocity. This is equal to Gm * Isp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGm is Earth\u0027s surface gravitational acceleration, about 9.81 m/sec^2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIsp is specific impulse. Why we list specific impulse instead of exhaust velocity largely comes down to historical reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nln is just the natural logarithm operator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmw is the stage\u0027s \u0022wet\u0022 mass.

Specific impulse is dictated by the engine. Adding more fuel helps... up to a limit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off, fuel tanks are not massless. In KSP, fuel tank wet/dry ratios are about 9:1 IIRC. That means the cap on your ln(mw/md) term per stage would be ln(9/1) = 2.197, and that\u0027s if your ship is nothing but fuel tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, thrust. A ship that is all fuel tanks has no engine to propel itself. To get a rocket off Kerbin, you need a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E (Thrust to Weight Ratio) of \u0026gt; 1.0, preferably around 1.4. Even in space, if your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is 0.01, you will get awfully bored maneuvering.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis brings us to Newton\u0027s Second Law of Motion: an object at rest tends to stay at rest unless acted upon by an external force. The mathematical expression becomes F = ma; force (in Newtons) is equal to mass (in kilograms) times acceleration (in m/sec^2). For rocketry, it is convenient to rearrange this to a = F/m; acceleration is force divided by mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGravitational acceleration at Kerbin\u0027s/Earth\u0027s surface is about 9.81 m/sec^2. Thus, to reach a target of 1.4 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, your rocket must accelerate at 1.4 * 9.81 m/sec^2 = 13.734 m/sec^2. This means that at launch, for every kilogram of rocket, you need 13.734 N of thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince masses in KSP are measured in tons (1000 kg), and thrusts in kilonewtons (1000 N), you would thus need 13.734 kN of thrust per ton of rocket. Convenient how SI units work, eh?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis, generally speaking, leads to the following design choices in rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor launch vehicles, you often choose engines which produce a lot of thrust per kilogram, and which don\u0027t lose too much specific impulse at sea level. Having a very high sea-level Isp isn\u0027t too important: the bigger factor is just reducing the number of expensive first-stage engines onboard while still reaching ~1.4 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E at launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor orbital maneuvers, you often choose engines with a high specific impulse, so as to efficiently use your fuel, and reduce the overall mass, so the rest of your rocket can be lighter. Thrust is often not hugely important unless landing on a moon/planet; I\u0027ve worked with as low as 0.07 Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxwellsDemon","CreatedById":147660,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-05T14:40:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFunny how often Tsiolkovsky\u0027s name comes up.\u00A0 \u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0(Amazing man.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a similar vein, I\u0027m reminded of the problem of how much water to carry into a desert.\u00A0 With horses, which need more water, you need more horses to carry more water for more horses... with camels, it\u0027s the same thing, only not quite so many as the horses.\u00A0 \u00A0So, a camel has a higher Isp, so to speak.\u00A0 \u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0 Being a bit goofy, but it does somewhat illustrate the point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-05T14:59:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E is fuel efficiency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThrust is acceleration power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-05T15:37:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223286019\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022170501\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221517824159\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182201\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Juanlu16\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Juanlu16 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA:What\u2019s the difference between \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E and trust and what uses each one has?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs folks have observed:\u00A0 Isp is fuel \u003Cstrong\u003Eefficiency:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 higher Isp means you get more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E for the same amount of fuel.\u00A0 Thrust is how much \u003Cstrong\u003Epower\u003C/strong\u003E it has, i.e. how fast it can accelerate.\u00A0 By analogy with automobiles:\u00A0 an engine with really high thrust is like a sports car;
