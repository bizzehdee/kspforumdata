You might be fine, but it is a perfect recipe to inherit any and all existing problems. Doing a fresh installation is only slightly more work (at worst) and enables you to update everything and eliminate active and dormant problems at the same time. Not to mention that your system will probably be a little faster too, with all excess processes eliminated.

As for cards in that range, just do some research. It isn\u0027t as simple as get the best performing card possible, because then you have to worry about heat output (and therefore the card\u0027s cooler) and how much power it needs. I do think you\u0027d want to upgrade your PSU, but once you figure out what graphics card you want, check around to see what level of PSU people have used with a similar setup to yours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally have a MSI Radeon R9 270 (which is ~$200, I got it on sale for $180), which I haven\u0027t had for very long and works well, but that doesn\u0027t mean it would be right for you. Also, an important point is that all cards with the same GPU (for example, an R9 270) are not equal. Some come pre-overclocked (which is only a bonus if you don\u0027t want to fiddle with that kind of thing by yourself, usually they just cost a bit more), and some companies have better coolers than others. Also some versions have larger amounts of RAM and different memory buses (ex. 128 bit or 256 bit -- more helps speed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook at sites like Tom\u0027s Hardware and PC Gamer Magazine for reviews, and to figure out the best card for that price range.
