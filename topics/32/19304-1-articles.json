I\u0027ve just started to fly aircraft, rather than space launch vehicles.

However, I seem to reach much faster speeds. I assume this is due to the thinner atmosphere reducing drag. Is this a a measure of thrust to fuel consumption?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs atmosphere thickness in layers? I recall seeing that in a discussion on an earlier version, so I assume drag is a step-function. \u0022Efficiency\u0022 as displayed when you right click the engine seems to be a linear function, so my current theory is the best altitude is probably just above the transition from one thickness to another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Other factors I assume will help performance in this challenge... I presume you want to arrive at the North Pole with zero fuel, since excess would be dry weight.

Which means that you want to go as fast as possible at full throttle, regardless of efficiency and altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for design ideas, I\u0027d suggest these:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart with only two engines. More engines suffer from diminishing returns, since you double fuel consumption but only increase velocity by a factor of 1.4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse more wing than you think. That helps in keeping a low angle of attack at cruise, which makes designing the engine attach angle easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAngle the engines so that they are horizontal in cruise. Any thrust pointing down doesn\u0027t increase speed, and the wings should be keeping the plane up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith good design, you should be able to make it to the North Pole on ~6 Mk2 fuselage tanks and at ~450 - 500 m/s. Climb fast up to ~8k-10k, then reduce your climb rate and make sure that your engines don\u0027t asphyxiate up there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps, good luck with your design!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
