I\u0027ve had ships that have bent and broken for no apparent reason... ships that have begun spinning so fast that the solar panels fly off. So could it be possible to make a mod that lists the various stresses acting on the rocket or spaceplane to find where we need to add more support or change things around to reduce the stress levels?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know this really should be in the mod section but I just wanted a discussion on whether it would be possible and whether it is actually worth it... or even if someone has already done something like this and is hidden away on Spaceport.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, telemetry like this is what makes rocket science fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chainedlupine","CreatedById":57775,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T00:16:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my mod design idea that I\u0027ve had for a month or so:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EFlight telemetry\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mod is a radial part that you install upon the upper-most stage of your rocket.

Another option for the telemetry would be to send it off to another computer.

There must be a way around this but I haven\u0027t looked at it yet. I\u0027m still building and designing the hardware. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve just started to put together a PCB prototyping line so that I can stop having to make rats nests when using such things as seven segment displays. Up to now by flight sim cockpits have been made using the ratsnest method but it wastes a lot of time (and a lot of wire). Having modular PCB\u0027s means I can use them on multiple projects. If I get a design I am really happy with I can get the thing done professionally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then we come to the stress factors... All aircraft have a pair of indicators which are called... Master Warn and Master Alarm. Apollo had Master Alarm but not Master Warn.
