I landed a mun base for them to at least work in (and can now probably send a rocket to bring them back now that I\u0026#39;ve updated my launch pad). But the base was 30km away from their pod so they had to EVA across the mun to it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat I found was they were good for a single bounce at any speed. After that, it seemed their impact tolerance dropped seriously. My first kerbonaut sailed into the ground at my base at upwards of 200m/s and slide a few KM along the surface without a scratch. She got up, turned around and did another jump back only to turn into a dust on impact the second time. Ditto for another later that bounced but stayed up right enough for me to fire some more RCS boosts. Dust when he hit the second time.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T04:51:38Z","Content":"\nIt\u0026#39;s not invincibility, it\u0026#39;s the \u0022BadS\u0022 trait.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNo seriously!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022BadS\u0022, when set to \u0022true\u0022 in a Kerbal\u0026#39;s stats, provides a chance that it will survive any given fall that would kill a \u0022regular\u0022 Kerbal.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, I\u0026#39;ve been told, and seem to have confirmed through experimentation, that Kerbals have much better survival rates when landing on their helmets.
