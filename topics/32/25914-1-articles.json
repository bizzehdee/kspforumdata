In one case, I had to have my Kerbonaut transfer from his usual vessel to a spaceplane to land on a planet, take off, and get back into his original ship; if I hadn\u0027t been able to control the now-pilotless main vessel, it would have made things much harder.

We\u0027ve orbited several of the system\u0027s celestial bodies, actually landed robotic probes on Mars, we\u0027ve got a probe that has left the solar system by most definitions, and yet, ask anyone what NASA\u0027s biggest achievement has been, and they\u0027ll tell you it was the moon landing. We had done flybys of Mars, and the soviets had even had failed attempts at sending landers to Mars before we landed on the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I look back on my missions, the manned missions just stick out more. Heck, my mothership to Jool had a crew of 12, even though I never had more than two of them outside the mothership at a time, and in fact could have flown the whole mission unmanned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think one factor that affects this that isn\u0027t present, at least not yet, in KSP\u0027s manned missions is that a manned mission can do more science in an hour than a probe can do in a week, in most cases. An astronaut doesn\u0027t need to wait for hours while ground control figures out the best way to walk around an obstacle to pick up a desired rock. From what I read, typical rover mission travel distances are messured in meters per day, and it\u0027s not a big number, because many movements have to be planned out and checked for anything that could go wrong. An astronaut is also more likely to be able to do something that wasn\u0027t forseen in the original mission plan. See an interesting rock and you want to see what\u0027s inside it? If you\u0027re lucky, a rover\u0027s manipulator arm might be able to deal with that. An astronaut could easiy find out, and if noone thought of sending a hammer, they can improvise by grabbing a bigger rock (though probably after checking to make sure there are no sharp edges to tear their suit on).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERovers are getting better at autonomy, but they\u0027ve still got a long way to go to catch up with the autonomy of an astronaut in a space suit, let alone an ordinary human without one.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-07T21:15:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2013 09:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Eric S\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dr_jt","CreatedById":58149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T21:16:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConsider Kerbals\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-06T13:26:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2013 01:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by dr_jt\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T21:23:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou ask why, I ask Why not?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mufasa","CreatedById":61422,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T21:24:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou would do that? starve the kerbals of the chance to land on other planets? to experience space?
