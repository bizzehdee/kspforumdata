You can also (in moments when you leave the ground in an uncontrolled tumble) hit space to switch to docking (rotation mode) and now WASD will give you pitch and yaw control so you can re-align your self\u00A0and then hit space again to return to \u003Cs\u003Edocking\u003C/s\u003E driving mode. \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe other advantage is that if you have rear facing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters for a boost then holding down shift will fire those (and ctrl for any forward facing thrusters). \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aragosnat","CreatedById":60487,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-02T17:58:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen making your rover.
