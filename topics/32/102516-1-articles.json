So much of it must be superfluous!\u0022. Things such as more than one science lab, meteoroid shields, or even just simple structural elements for the sake of aethetics. All of these add a crapton of weight which severely cuts down on your delta-V. And being an engineer, I can\u0027t help but cringe a bit at such inefficiency.\n\nThen again, when I build purely for efficiency, all my ships start to look alike and basically are all butt-ugly. So I personally tend to go for a bit of middle gound: I design for efficiency first, then I\u0027ll add some bits here and there or re-organize the design a little to beautify it a little.\n\nLately I\u0027ve tried my hand at designs that prioritize aesthetics over almost everything else, but I found that I absolutely suck at it ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Osprey","CreatedById":93933,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T10:58:09Z","Content":"The trick is to find synergy between the two.\n\nMy science Mun-lander had to incorporate a materials bay, goo tank and such, but also have enough fuel to decelerate from orbit, land neatly, and return the crew pod to Kerbin \u002B collected science, and as many light-weight science instruments as I could afford to add in weight to the capsule from the lander for recovered monetary cost on return (rather than leaving expensive gear on the Mun).\n\nThe end result was a materials bay main body, with rotated tanks on the sides for weight balance and to look a bit more integral and a little less wide/wobbly. It proved both efficient as the fuel was just enough for each task/stage, with little excess, and I\u0027d kept it looking contained and I think rather nice (Will share photos when I am able to access my screenshots from home). Incidentally though, my plan for any with excess fuel remaining is to build an automated rover with a KLAW, and go and collect any excess fuel dribbles left in these to fill up storage tanks on a Mun-base once I eventually set up a permanent station on the surface.

These of themselves are often what I want to do rather than what is the most efficient. For example if I\u0027m making a Mun lander I might decide that it\u0027s going to have a two-Kerbal orbiter and a one-Kerbal separate lander *a la* Apollo, and that the lander will be RCS-powered.\n\nThen within those goals and constraints I\u0027ll try and build reasonably efficiently while still having an eye to looks. I won\u0027t add loads of extra mass or parts for fashion but neither will I take the absolutely most efficient choice if I consider it ugly. Prime example is using a 48-7S in a 1.25m stack looks ugly so I\u0027ll often use the 909 instead.\n\nWhen I have planned on building something pretty often it comes out looking like it hit every branch on the ugly tree anyway.
