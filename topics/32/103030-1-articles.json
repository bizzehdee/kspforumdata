AFAIK, when playing with deadly reentry (like me), you want to keep the cockpit prograde. Not because of the cockpit itself, but because bad things happen to wings when you don\u0027t. You want to go prograde until ideally 300 m/s speed, then you can start leveling off. Of the ground is too close, try earlier, but you risk overheating of wings.\n\nAnd maybe it\u0027s not my place to say, but this thread belongs in \u0022gameplay questions and tutorials \u0022.\n\nBes"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T11:13:14Z","Content":"First of all, those thermal tiles don\u0027t matter. It\u0027s a texture (I don\u0027t want to miss them, bcause roleplaying). \n\nWhen it comes to reentry with actual heat you want to stay in the upper atmosphere for as long as possible so your velocity decreases significantly so you don\u0027t get too much heat in the lower atmosphere (that\u0027s the part where the most heating takes place anyway). If you want to slow down effectively you need to generate lift to lose some speed high up in the air. Thats when plane like vessels (mk2 belongs over here) get interesting as they can easily generate a lot of lift so they generally have a slower reentry with less heat. But that only works if your orientation is right (nose forward, slightly upwards). \n\nCapsules/pods work differently but can also use theire flat belly to generate lift and therefore reduce heat, however thise vessels can take a lot more heat before it gets dangerous. Those use different forms of protection\n\nBtw 0.90 version of KSP doesn\u0027t have any reentry heat mechanics, so this isn\u0027t important atm. If you use the deadly reentry mod that kind of stuff gets more important."},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T12:55:55Z","Content":"This is a good question considering that 1.0 will most likely feature reentry heating. The Mk2 and Mk3 parts don\u0027t appear to have any thermal protection systems at present. If the whole part is heat resistant, then we would be able to perform reentry upside down, which would just look silly. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"LABHOUSE","CreatedById":107761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T13:59:23Z","Content":"It will feature re entry heat, max had a tweet mentioning it."},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonik","CreatedById":79705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T14:15:58Z","Content":"Presumably it will be of the form that it will be negligible to the integrity of the spacecraft except for specifically marked instances (looking at you lander pods) or returning from beyond the depth of Kerbin\u0027s gravity well."},{"CreatedByName":"LABHOUSE","CreatedById":107761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T14:24:34Z","Content":"Well he said it cremated jeb..."},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonik","CreatedById":79705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T17:39:20Z","Content":"I\u0027m pretty sure I heard somewhere that it won\u0027t be anything to worry about unless returning from beyond the moon, or on an absurd trajectory. I\u0027m assuming that most people de-orbit shallow already rather then pointing at the ground and accelerating so it shouldn\u0027t be of much concern in that respect. For everyone else it will be a quick learning experience."}]}
