People like planes because they are very accessible, easy to test and easy to get the hang of. Rockets on the other hand are hard to fly, require a lot of tricky testing and huge amounts of time and effort to make. So we are bound to see more planes than rockets. Once the newbies get the hang of spaceflight we will see more of them. I agree, there are too few complex interplanetary designs for the reasons I stated above.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei can make a rocket that gets a 100t capital ship to dres in 5 minutes tops and works every time. Meanwhile I spent 3 days making a airplane that could get to laythe, land, and come back with 0 refueling/IRSU, and had 2 tons of weapons payload, docking abilities, and full RCS systems. Please just PLEASE do not tell me rockets are difficult. Even your most basic plane is harder to make as it actually requires some mass balancing to not be flippy (whereas on 90% of conventional rockets slap a few fins on bottom and ur never gonna have this issue). I admit, 1.0 and the recent updates have made rockets more of a challenge to get into space (no more up to 10km and 45 degree pitch climbs), but its not exactly hard to do a basic rocket. Advanced rockets, asparagus, pure SRB ships that go to mun, ect, are tough, but so are spaceplanes in general as you cant just slap a rapier on a airplane frame and assume itll get to LKO (heat management gotta protect the utility parts, balancing CoG matters way more when going to space, need more fuel, oxy, ect, and much tougher climb profiles).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHeck, what about just \u0022jets in space?\u0022\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejets are fine as they are, the only thing id like to see is either some prtopellors and make them drain alot of power so you have issues with power management unless u drag insane amounts of batteries with u, or some thermal jet/rrocket that is similar efficiency to jets, and wotrks on duna/eve/other planets. Aside from propellors that have properly low thrust and are beyind worthless at anything but very low altitudes and speeds, i think any infinite dV engine is a bad idea for gameplay as it makes fuel become pointless and takes away ever bit of challenge (IRSU has already made grand tour SSTOs possible lol, something that would have never worked before).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022theend3r\u0022 data-cite=\u0022theend3r\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt takes a long time (2 years at least) but you get bored with the KSP rockets sooner or later and rovers are... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Space)planes on the other hand offer so many possibilities and such complexity and joy if they work that they can keep me playing long after I\u0027d have stopped if they weren\u0027t included.
