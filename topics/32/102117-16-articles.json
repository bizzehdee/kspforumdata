Basically looking at the current feature list we need to look at our work in general and consider working on polish, bugfixing and balance in certain areas of the game instead of some of the new features we\u0027re working in. Going specific instead of going wide. We don\u0027t plan on stopping work at 1.0 at all, so we\u0027re maybe better off leaving some stuff for 1.1 and getting to work on the specifics of what can make the existing stuff in the game truly shine.\n\u003E We\u0027ve decided that the next release will be 1.0 because it accomplishes the goals we\u0027ve set up with the development of KSP from the very beginning, my question to you is whether you\u0027d prefer we try and add more features, or focus more on things like the aero overhaul, bugfixing and balance?\n\nYou\u0027re not giving nearly enough information to make an informed decision in our feedback. You\u0027ve got nearly 40 pages of people trying to guess what features your talking about and how it matters to them, interspersed with some panic over the number \u00221.0\u0022.\n\nIf this is all I get to go on, then I say slap a 1.0 sticker on it, clean up every single bug you can find in what you\u0027ve got done now, and release it ASAP. That way I can stop reading the panic posts, and get a new version of the game to play with less bugs and whatever new things are ready."},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T18:44:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You\u0027re not giving nearly enough information to make an informed decision in our feedback.

Head over to the add-on forum and there is content enough for a lifetime. The reason I haven\u0027t played is because the game **can\u0027t handle** **all the content** in is current state. I.e. although there is content available, it cannot be used anyway.\n\nI\u0027d say focus on stability, and creating the proper foundation for add-on creators to create even more content. Then let the wonders of co-creation (read Vargo and Lusch 2004, 2006, 2008) and crowd development take care of the rest. \n\nThis game has always thrived on the user-created content, although the creators may not have noticed, and is probably the reason most people ended up playing this in the first place. At least, for me, if it weren\u0027t for Scott Manley I would not have even known its existence. There is a reason games like Skyrim is still being widely played today, four years after, and still having tons of content being created (e.g. mods, youtube videos etc.). VHS pushed out Betamax for the same reason. Smart-phone app market library is endless for the same reason. Linux, as a desktop environment, is still alive and usable. Minecraft. And also the reason people even want to buy a Raspberry Pi. The list of examples is endless.\n\nKSP is a sandbox game, a \u0022Lego\u0022 game if you like, and should be treated as such in every aspect - Which indecently coincidences perfectly with modern marketing theory and techniques.\n\nYou cannot build a house on poor foundation, and if you do you better not have people (players) living inside it.
