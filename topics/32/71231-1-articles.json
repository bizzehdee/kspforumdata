Here\u0027s what happened to me...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy friend comes to me and asks me to dock 2 spacecraft together, in Minmus orbit. That was bad enough, as you \u003Cem\u003Edefinitely\u003C/em\u003E don\u0027t need to do Minmus Apollo-style, but to each his own, I suppose. I decided I\u0027d play along. The lander was almost out of electricity for the reaction wheels (about 12 units), so I disabled them and used solely RCS power to rotate. So, I set up a rendezvous, and waited. Then the \u003Cem\u003Efun\u003C/em\u003E started happening: I realized that the lander only had 2 RCS ports, on opposite sides. So IJKL translations, and most rotation was eliminated. \u0022Hmm,\u0022 I said. Then I was like, \u0022Aha! I\u0027ll just use the orbital craft\u0027s RCS and dock to the lander!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGuess what.

I got really close, then it got complicated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I only had 2 out of 3 axes for RCS, I thought I would just rotate the craft 90 degrees to thrust in the missing direction. But I was moving too fast. So I did it \u003Cem\u003E\u0022Gravity\u0022\u003C/em\u003E style: Last-second burst of RCS in a carefully planned direction. The docking ports bumped, reoriented, and... YES! Docked!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for more trickyness: getting all of the precious science home. Set up a return burn, executed, final periapsis: 20,000 Meters.

So... I thought I\u0027d do the same thing I did when I screwed up a Duna mission: Separate the CSM\u0027s capsule, still attached to the lander, to land on Kerbin. Executed, decoupled, reset parachutes to sets of 2 at 300 meter intervals. 800 meters, first \u0027chutes deployed. 500 meters, next set.
