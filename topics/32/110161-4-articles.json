At the very least, I generally have at least two or three choices for most situations. Poodle, Terrier, 48-7S cluster, or radial 24-77s for a medium lander? Twin-Boar, Mainsail with boosters, or T30/T45 cluster for a mid-game lifter? Picking the most efficient option often gains me only a few dozen m/sec of delta-v on a ship with several hundred or thousand, so I often end up picking an engine based on other considerations--looks, TWR, configuration, cost, landing-gear clearance, whatever. \n\u003E That said, I do think the current balancing could do with some tweaking for consistency. Why, for instance, does the Ant have 73% less ISP in atmo while the Spider--basically a radial Ant in other regards--has only 10% less?\n\u003E \n\u003E Out of curiosity, what actually IS realistic in this situation? I\u0027ve always thought of the Terrier as an analog for the Apollo LM engines--would those really have been 75% less efficient in atmo? I know some engines are optimized for atmo and some for vacuum, but is the difference really that big? I\u0027d have guessed more like 25%.\n\nThe difference between Isp at sea level and vacuum depends on the nozzle (the ratio between the throat and the exit) and the combustion pressure.\n\nWith all else the same, an engine that has a high combustion pressure (like 3000 psi) might only lose 20% of its Isp at sea level, while one that has a lower combustion pressure (like 1000 psi) might lose more than half of its Isp at sea level. The Lunar Module descent engine had a combustion pressure of only 100 psi. It probably would have had an Isp of essentially zero at sea level."},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T07:21:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Welcome to vacuum-specific engines. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) On manufacturer sites you often don\u0027t even get a sea level isp listed for an engine designed for space use.\n\nI completely understand vacuum specific engines should perform badly at sea level. As you improve the vacuum Isp, you make the sea level Isp worse. \n\nVacuum Isp goes higher, sea level Isp goes lower. Raise the sea level Isp, lowerthe vacuum Isp (exception: aerospikes) - which is why the sea level focused engines have less variation in Isp.\n\nI am completely on board with having low Isps at sea level.\n\nI\u0027m just wondering \u0022how low?\u0022 it should be.\n\nHow bad should they be?\n\nWould it really be so bad if the Poodle\u0027s sea level Isp was 160 instead of 85?\n\nIt would still be losing over 50% of its thrust at sea level.\n\nTBH, I\u0027m not clear on the math to determine thrust loss on these engines. Are we assuming certain expansion ratios and chamber pressures for these engines?\n\nMaybe in a break from absolute realism, but for gameplay purposes, we could set a \u0022baseline Isp\u0022 for liquid engines.\n\nLets call it 300.\n\nWant 10 more vacuum Isp? you get an engine with 290/310 sea level/vacuum Isp\n\nWant 50 more vacuum Isp? you get an engine with 250/350 sea level/vacuum Isp\n\nAlthough... that may make vacuum engines too potent...\n\nA 2x multiplier to lost atmo Isp?\n\n300 baseline:\n\nWant 10 more vacuum Isp? you get an engine with 280/310 sea level/vacuum Isp\n\nWant 50 more vacuum Isp? you get an engine with 200/350 sea level/vacuum Isp\n\nAs it is now, it seems a bit inconsistent with the sea level losses vs vacuum gains.\n\nConsider the LV-T30 vs LV-T45:\n\n280/300 vs 270/320\n\nThe LV-T45 gains 20 vacuum Isp, for the loss of only 10 sea level Isp- gains 2x as much vacuum Isp as lost sea level Isp\n\nThen we see the LV-909... it gains 45 vacuum Isp, and loses..... 195 sea level Isp. It gain 0.23x as much vacuum Isp as lost sea level Isp.\n\nI never used them as an ascent engine pre 1.0, so it doesn\u0027t really affect me... I\u0027m completely fine with lower thrust at sea level, and this getting more severe as the engine gets optimized for vacuum operations.\n\nI just wonder if the specific numbers should be tweaked."},{"CreatedByName":"FlowerChild","CreatedById":74289,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T07:26:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Would it really be so bad if the Poodle\u0027s sea level Isp was 160 instead of 85?\n\u003E \n\u003E It would still be losing over 50% of its thrust at sea level.\n\nI think it would, and this largely comes down to an issue with the size of Kerbin. Yes, it loses 50% of its thrust at sea level, but atmospheric pressure drops off so quickly due to the lack of depth to the atmosphere relative to earth, that it would rapidly become quite efficient.\n\nAlready, with the thin shallow atmosphere in 1.0, I find that mid-stage engines like the Skipper and LV-T45 have pretty much lost all relevance, because you just don\u0027t spend enough time in atmosphere thick enough to be significant for them to really come into play. If in-vacuum engines were better in atmosphere, this problem would become even worse and you could get away with extremely short first stages followed immediately by in-vacuum engines.\n\nI\u0027ve been doing a lot of tweaking of the engine values for my mod, and while I initially balked at the extremely low in-atmo ISP of vacuum engines, the more I worked with the numbers, the more that aspect made sense to me.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T07:32:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 07:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FlowerChild**"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T07:54:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m just wondering \u0022how low?\u0022 it should be.\n\nIMO the isps should reflect reality, given that we\u0027re playing a rocket simulator and reality is the only reference we have. LiquidFuel/Oxidizer is roughly analogous to Aerozine 50 (not Kerosene as I have previously claimed) and dinitrogen tetroxide, and the isps line up with that pretty well. About the only place where this breaks down is with the LV-N (and be glad we\u0027re not modelling cryogenic hydrogen, SSTOs would look like a Pregnant Guppy) and with the jet engines, but we\u0027re talking stock KSP here.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Would it really be so bad if the Poodle\u0027s sea level Isp was 160 instead of 85?\n\nWould you use it in atmosphere if its isp were 160 instead of 85? I mean, it probably wouldn\u0027t be a bad thing at all but why does it matter if you\u0027ve got so little to gain, the engine ends up being just as useless for atmosphere work as before. You go to Laythe and you bring jet engines (well, most people do), you go to Duna and the atmosphere is already pretty thin, you go to Eve and you\u0027re bringing an enormous lander anyway, and on Kerbin you\u0027re mainly just trying to get into space. So what would raising the isp for so little gain do?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Consider the LV-T30 vs LV-T45:\n\u003E 280/300 vs 270/320\n\nThe LV-T30 is quite clearly a low atmosphere booster engine with a nozzle optimized for getting your rocket off the pad. The LV-T45 sports a much wider isp range which places it more solidly in a general lifter category; you could just as easily use it as a lifting engine or as an upper stage engine. If you\u0027re going for efficiency, the 30s are great for sub 13km work while the 45s get you out of the second atmosphere band into thin air where your upper-stage and vacuum engines can take over.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Already, with the thin shallow atmosphere in 1.0, I find that mid-stage engines like the Skipper and LV-T45 have pretty much lost all relevance, because you just don\u0027t spend enough time in atmosphere thick enough to be significant for them to really come into play.\n\nI find the Skipper and LV-T45 highly relevant in conjunction with SRMs to help them into the second atmosphere band where they really shine.

Don\u0027t get me wrong, I\u0027m certainly not pining for old aero or what have you, but I do think the new has brought a number of other issues to the surface that essentially boil down to Kerbin being tiny.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T08:10:45Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 08:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FlowerChild**"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T08:36:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E No, that\u0027s not how it works.

The variation in engine performance faces the engineer with choices that matter in the final performance of the design. Creativity in this sense is about finding a way to make something work within design constraints created by greater variability in stats. The desire here is to keep the significant variability that we now have in engine performance.\n\nMy playstyle places an extremely low value on aesthetics. I want to build *stuff that works*.

I know some engines are optimized for atmo and some for vacuum, but is the difference really that big? I\u0027d have guessed more like 25%.\n\nThe Apollo Descent Propulsion System had a chamber pressure of 100 psia, had an expansion ratio of 47.5:1, and ran on a 1.594 mixture ratio of N2O4 to Aerozine 50 (50% UDMH, 50% Hydrazine). Pop those numbers into [Rocket Propulsion Analysis Lite](http://www.propulsion-analysis.com/downloads.htm) using the default efficiency coefficients and you get a vacuum Isp of 316 s. That\u0027s only a couple percent better than real life, so so far so good. The predicted sea level Isp is... **-925 s**.\n\nWhat\u0027s going on here? Well, there are two components to thrust. First is the momentum thrust, massflow \\* exhaust velocity. Equal and opposite reaction, etc. The second is the pressure thrust, (exit pressure - ambient pressure) \\* exit area. (These terms are actually inversely proportional, and max thrust (greatest Isp) is when the pressure thrust is zero.)\n\nIn a vacuum the flow expands to fill the entire nozzle, and the nozzle exit pressure of the Descent Propulsion System is only 0.01 bar. If the flow expanded to fill the whole nozzle at sea level, the pressure thrust would overwhelm the momentum thrust term, leading to negative thrust. Literally the naive prediction is that the rocket engine becomes a gigantic vacuum cleaner that sucks itself backwards... by blowing in the same direction.\n\nObviously, this doesn\u0027t actually happen. The flow separates from the nozzle, like the flow over a wing separates near stall. The result is the effective exit area is much lower, but a lot of the energy of the propellent goes into turbulence in the nozzle. This is **bad**, by the way. The flow is unstable and the thrust goes off in random directions. It might even shake the nozzle to pieces and cause an explosion, or burn a hole in the nozzle wall and cause an explosion. RPA Lite includes a simple flow separation predictor, but this case is a bit too extreme. It still predicts a sea level Isp of -95 s.\n\nSo how much thrust would the Descent Propulsion System produce at sea level? Very little. It might not even light off. At 5 km it might have an Isp of 60 s or thereabouts. Compare that to 308-311 s in vacuum.\n\nI really like the new engines, by the way.

In the second stage the rocket\u0027s just following prograde, and rarely needs to steer at all.\n\nIf you\u0027re using just 1.25 m parts you can do things pseudo-Soyuz style with an LVT-30 core surrounded by LVT-45 strap-ons. An LVT-45 sustainer surrounded by LVT-30 boosters looks worse, has no roll control, and doesn\u0027t have much directional control.\n\nIt\u0027s hard for me to find any real use for a powerful non-gimballing rocket engine at all, but it\u0027s worst as a first-stage lifter engine.
