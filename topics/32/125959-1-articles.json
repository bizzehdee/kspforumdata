You have to take advantage of the fact your upper stage engine, (be it the Terrier, Poodle, Skipper, Rhino, or something else), typically gets far more efficient high atmosphere thrust than your lower stage engine. This means more delta V and less fuel tanks, and since the upper stage engines are a lot cheaper (relatively speaking), it usually means reduced cost over a single stage LFO with SRB\u0026#39;s (assuming you dispose of everything). Just make sure the first stage \u002B SRBs gets you to 30-40km.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-20T06:27:51Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2015 06:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luis","CreatedById":55075,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T07:25:04Z","Content":"\nNot meant as snark, but delta V is expressed as a velocity in metres per second (m/s), not metres per second squared (m/s^2).
