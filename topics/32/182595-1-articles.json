Oh, and that 4.5 ton Moho mission I did a while back, that was pretty nifty too. On the other hand, I\u0027m not very good with aircraft. Or rather, I\u0027m good by most people\u0027 standards, but not unusually good, and I hardly every build them since I just don\u0027t enjoy it, so...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough, I\u0027m with those that say that it\u0027s difficult to put skill in KSP on a scale, since there are so few limits on what you can do. I\u0027m pretty good at single-launch, non-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E mega-missions (request use of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E and my planning falls apart faster than a rocket without struts), and at hardcore career stuff. But I\u0027m only decent with aircraft, SSTOs, and rovers, I have little patience for infrastructure-building (I don\u0027t do surface bases or space stations), and I know nothing about the more interesting abuses of the KSP physics engine (stock joints, propellers, etc.). Oh, and as I mentioned, I couldn\u0027t plan a mission around \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E if I tried. Which means that, by some standards, I\u0027m pretty good, but by others I\u0027m either average or incompetent. And that\u0027s okay. Pigeonholing is unhelpful, and I\u0027m generally not huge about trying to \u0022rank\u0022 KSP players on some kind of scale. We tend to specialize too much for such things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GRS","CreatedById":179502,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-04T10:48:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUmm...well...okay, maybe try suggesting some criterias and i\u0027ll write them, i know it might be stupid...well...i often do stupid KSP stuff, like a vertical re-entry, or ZX-ing all the way down even in Tylo, moreover, this is a discussion thread...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PHO3NIX_F1RE","CreatedById":131024,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-04T23:42:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think I\u0027d fit well into \u0027upper\u0027 Intermediate, a level 2.5, if you like.
