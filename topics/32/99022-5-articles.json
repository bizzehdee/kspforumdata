HOWEVER! considering that many things die down after a while does not mean that it is officially dying, in other words, if KSP 1.0 comes out with something completely new, then people will be posting more about it, and creating more mods, so therefore no activity. So if we take this to a global scale, as Vsauce once said, we will never stop creating ideas. However, many ideas are derived from others, so this means that the \u0022MOAR MODS\u0022 thing will occur, and therefore more posts each day. Also, if SQUAD created a commercial for KSP to air on TV, the popularity of the game would most likely rise, possibly about 10-60%, if not more.

While your computer can show fancy graphics in simple games by throwing a lot of GPU cores to the task, it doesn\u0027t have the right kind of hardware to run KSP well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome tasks are inherently easier to parallelize than others. If you can split the task into multiple independent subtasks, each of them can be executed in parallel without interfering with the other subtasks. For example, KSP could spawn a new physics bubble for anything entering an atmosphere, and these bubbles could be simulated on separate CPU cores. Even the GPU, despite its poor single-core performance, could help with simple ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParallelization becomes harder, when the subtasks have mutual dependencies, which require locks, syncronization, and other nasty things. The more the subtasks depend on each other, the less benefit you get from using multiple parallel threads. Simulating the forces affecting a 1000-part ship in KSP is a good example of problems like that. If the ship has a linear structure (e.g. a single stack without any struts), you can probably split it into multiple submodules that are mostly independent of each other, and simulate them in several threads without too much syncronization overhead. More complex ships (e.g. an Eve lander with 9 pairs of boosters and struts and fuel lines everywhere) are harder to split into submodules with only a few connections between the modules, so multi-threaded physics might not help with them at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sof","CreatedById":65663,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-14T18:54:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is between releases\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, it is a single player game.

I just started playing 0.90 when the mods started stabilizing around it and frankly, I was having the same level of fun with 0.24.2 with a very well-balanced set of mods. So I think the game has reached a point of \u0022homeostasis\u0022 to a certain extent.

more unstable with each release and with all the new features being talked about for 1.0 I\u0027m worried that it\u0027s going to use so much resources that modding will become essentially impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(please nobody start on the Unity 5 will fix everything, there are half a dozen things squad could do right now to minimize CPU and memory load and they\u0027ve shown they just aren\u0027t interested)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this is exactly why it makes no sense to move out of beta anytime soon. It would make sense to optimize it first and even do the unity 5 port before going to 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is bad enough that it is unstable on release, but these changes will most likely create new bugs and break save games and mods as well. With a 1.0 release you dont really expect that save games and mods keep breaking with new patches.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T18:06:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA load on demand system needs to be implemented asap.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
