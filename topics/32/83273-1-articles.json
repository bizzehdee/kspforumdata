I have been playing in the contract career mode since 0.24 came out. Managed to get hooked onto a Class-C asteroid and put in in a fairly circular orbit at an altitude just outside of Mun but inclined a bit over 45 degrees. I did an EVA and transmitted that science back. I did a second EVA and kept that sample on my space craft. That\u0027s where I left it. I still have a lot of fuel left but probably not enough parachutes to try to land it. Is there anything else I can do with it that would be useful or get me some more science points from it? How bad would it be if I sent it crashing into Kerbin or Mun? Any and all suggestions on what I could do with it would be greatly appreciated.
