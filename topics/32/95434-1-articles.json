For radials you can attach a couple girder segments at various angles. They not only reduce the distance the part flys but also absorb the impact protecting the more valuable part. you wont get a popup for the recovery but you still get the roots back if you recover it. 2 or 3 girders should be enough to keep the decoupler on the launchpad for full recovery.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T05:36:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust put the decouplers on backwards...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Damien_The_Unbeliever","CreatedById":129715,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T05:37:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can get the radial attached to a single craft as well with some creative construction:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EStart the craft with, say, a fuel tank\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdd the radial decoupler to it\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdd another fuel tank to the far side of the decoupler\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdd a pod on top of this second fuel tank\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERe-root the craft to the pod\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDelete the first fuel tank\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EProfit?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T05:59:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022merendel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022merendel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou wont get a popup for the recovery but you still get the roots back if you recover it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, I didn\u0027t know that!
