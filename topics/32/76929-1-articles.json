It happens. I love KSP and often take breaks to other games on a regular. But I also have 2 installs of KSP on my computer to meet all my KSP wants with mods. But I still load up Planetside2, or Xenonauts or even Skyrim on occassions. I am waiting for a few MMOs right now, but the last two that have come out have sucked and so I am glad I spent the money on KSP and not those games. Granted my girlfriend HATES SQUAD and KSP with a passion, only because I spend more time in KSP then talking with her some days. LOL\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
