Lots of good stuff to keep me coming back in particular are the \u0022place Satellite @ XXXX location\u0022. My question which might turn into a suggestion is, can you grade the accuracy of the orbit? For instance, I have to put a SAT in a Equatorial orbit at 15 Mm. If I am at 14.98, I still satisfy the contact but I think it would awesome if at the completion it gave you a percent on how accurate your overall placement was. And if that is possible maybe modifying the contractual reward off of accuracy. Thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-21T05:34:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat makes sense.
