However, you have 2 things you can do about that. First of course is to take contracts for stuff you\u0027re going to be doing anyway, such as to plant a flag on Mun or wharever. The other is to combine multiple contracts that require the same general parameters (like 1-star rescues from LKO) into 1 mission. The 1st contract in the group you might break more or less even on, but doing several others while you\u0027re in the neighborhood doesn\u0027t increase the cost of the rocket that much, so by doing 3 or 4 such contracts per trip, you can make a fair amount of money. Otherwise, the only contracts that tend to pay well by themselves are for satellites, stations, and surface bases. And the satellites can be stacked as well so, by building a slightly bigger probe, you can use the same probe for several such missions because each only requires the probe to be there for 10 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETourists don\u0027t pay much money but they do pay rep, which is useful to get more lucractive contracts later.

If you want to make science via contracts, get DMagic Orbital Science, which creates lucrative science contracts in terms of both cash and science. Plus, you get a bunch of new experiment parts so your normal trips to Mun/Minmus can collect way more science per trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also play with the difficulty sliders at the start of a game. I personally think the game begins once the tech tree is done so I like to increase the science rewards to 200% to reduce grindy, repetitive, and expensive Mun trips.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T23:40:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the mission I just flew:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI took a contract to rescue a kerbal in Kerbin orbit, and another to rescue a kerbal in Minmus orbit.
