Subtracting the cost of the actual ship that\u0027s not a lot of profit. Even a cheap ship that can break 70,000 is going to cost more than 10k prolly.\n\nTest basic jet engine in flight? Sure sounds easy enough...oh wait it has to be above 13,000 ft at over 400 m/s. I couldn\u0027t even achieve 400 m/s in a flat dive at full power from 13,000 feet with 3 of the basic \u0022weasely\u0022 engines. So what am I supposed to do? Attach them to a rocket and just turn them on for a sec? That doesn\u0027t sound like very much fun.\n\nObserve some random point in flight below 17k? Sounds easy enough...or it would be if it wasn\u0027t half way around the world so it takes 20 mins of 4x speed watching my plane fly in a straight line.\n\nIs it just me or are they hardly ever worth doing? Especially in the early game. Am I missing something? They don\u0027t seem fun or especially profitable.

The plane example you made can be done on a rocket. Just place said part on your nose lauch craft. Perfect example of doing it with a tourist contract like you also mentioned.\n\nAlso throw in text x part at launch helps reduce the cost even more if you can get them to pop up.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T20:40:22Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 08:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aragosnat**"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T20:37:51Z","Content":"Tourist contracts a best viewed as ride-alongs.

Especially in the early game. Am I missing something? They don\u0027t seem fun or especially profitable. Thanks in advance for any light you could shine on the matter.\n\nMost contracts these days aren\u0027t very profitable when taken as stand-alone things. However, you have 2 things you can do about that. First of course is to take contracts for stuff you\u0027re going to be doing anyway, such as to plant a flag on Mun or wharever. The other is to combine multiple contracts that require the same general parameters (like 1-star rescues from LKO) into 1 mission. The 1st contract in the group you might break more or less even on, but doing several others while you\u0027re in the neighborhood doesn\u0027t increase the cost of the rocket that much, so by doing 3 or 4 such contracts per trip, you can make a fair amount of money. Otherwise, the only contracts that tend to pay well by themselves are for satellites, stations, and surface bases. And the satellites can be stacked as well so, by building a slightly bigger probe, you can use the same probe for several such missions because each only requires the probe to be there for 10 seconds.\n\nTourists don\u0027t pay much money but they do pay rep, which is useful to get more lucractive contracts later. Rescues pay both rep and money so it\u0027s a good idea to do a few of these.\n\nHowever, 1.x stripped most of science out of contracts, which IMHO is bad. If you want to make science via contracts, get DMagic Orbital Science, which creates lucrative science contracts in terms of both cash and science. Plus, you get a bunch of new experiment parts so your normal trips to Mun/Minmus can collect way more science per trip.\n\nYou can also play with the difficulty sliders at the start of a game. I personally think the game begins once the tech tree is done so I like to increase the science rewards to 200% to reduce grindy, repetitive, and expensive Mun trips."},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T23:40:58Z","Content":"Here\u0027s the mission I just flew:\n\nI took a contract to rescue a kerbal in Kerbin orbit, and another to rescue a kerbal in Minmus orbit. I had a contract to gather science from the Minmus surface. And I picked up a contact for two tourists (one to kerbin sub-orbit and one to kerbin orbit).\n\nI had six places available on my ship, and I only took one kerbonaut. I also took the two tourists. Then I launched into the Minmus plane and flew there. I rescued the sap in orbit. I landed, got some science, planted some flags, etc. Left Minmus and changed orbital planes while I was way out there, where it is cheaper. Then I dropped into low Kerbin orbit and rescued the other sap. Finally I landed. I got two rescues (one from Minmus, which pays pretty well), picked up two new kerbals for free, got free money from the tourists (who only paid for low Kerbin space - if they had actually had Minmus contracts I would have done even better), got the free money from that Minmus surface science contract, and cleared out a Minmus biome for science points.\n\n(I also had an orbital collision making my last rescue! Fortunately it only destroyed part of a stage I was just about to jettison anyway.)\n\nWhen I landed I had more money than when I started, more science, more reputation, and more kerbals in the astronaut pool.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T23:44:28Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 11:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mikegarrison**"},{"CreatedByName":"uglyduckling81","CreatedById":129740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T00:50:05Z","Content":"I run contract packs, Remote tech contracts etc. I\u0027ve only done one tourist mission so far but I incorporated it in with a Kerbal rescue mission from LKO. 4 Capsules on top of each other, 1 Pilot, 2 passengers, 1 spare for the rescue.
