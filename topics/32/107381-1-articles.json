In this case it even applies. You need struts to transmit the landing forces around and keep it together, since the mk3 joints are very week as r4pt0r said above.

Use struts between them to help. Also those big landing wheels are cool but I don\u0027t think they have any suspension whatsoever and landings can be hard which seems a bit daft considering they are supposed to be used fro larger heaver craft. You can always connect the big wheels to I-beam pieces as they flex under load and give a suspension like effect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WWEdeadman","CreatedById":105591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T10:25:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a fix for that in the stock bug fixes plugin. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285-0-25-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285-0-25-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sets the joint strength higher, essentially.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MissStabby","CreatedById":31168,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T11:18:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice to know it wasn\u0027t just my landing skills failing like crazy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts weird that the big landing wheels dont have any suspension, i would expect those giant telescopic pistons to cushion the huge weight of the large crafts they are putting on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a lot of clearance and room for travel with these new big landing gears.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike here at the 3:50 mark:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/4i-BEt4BIpg?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T11:22:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 11:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MissStabby\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SelectHalfling0","CreatedById":105051,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T11:19:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry Kerbal Joint Reinforcement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApart from preventing some Kraken Attacks, it helps to keep your larger creations together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
