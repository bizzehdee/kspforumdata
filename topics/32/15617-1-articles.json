Unfortunately, SAS modules don\\\u0027t stay activated while your not flying the vehicle so the ships just ended up spinning next to each other like derpy little Kerbals do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was surprisingly easier than I predicted. I had spend hours with a nervousness in me just going over trajectories and orbital mechanics and confusing myself. Turns out, once you get close, and \u0027close\u0027 can be very far away, RCS can take control and the entire mission is a breeze.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did this with no mods and lots of patience. There was one weird glitch though, and it put the nail in the coffin for my docking idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically my lander legs got messed up and some were up and some were down, and every time I would press \u0027G\u0027 they would just swap. :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeres some screen caps!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://screenshot27.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot27.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://screenshot28.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot28.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://screenshot29.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot29.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://screenshot30.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot30.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://screenshot31.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot31.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-29T23:18:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you try right-clicking to activate one of the leg sets separately? If you placed them in the VAB as 2 sets (4-symmetry twice) that might get the one set to match with the other. If you placed them as one set in 8-symmetry, I got nothing. \u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
