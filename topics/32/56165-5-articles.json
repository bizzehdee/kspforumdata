I personally think that the ability to play with your friends and collaborate on missions will be more fun than a sit-and-wait-while-we-mine-generic-strings-of-numbers kind of adventure.\u003Cp\u003E^^\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople need to stop saying, \u0022Well, there is a mod for that, so Squad doesn\u0027t have to make it.\u0022 If that was true, there\u0027s a whole host of things that wouldn\u0027t be in the base game, like docking, ion drives, spaceplane parts, fairings, landing gear, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the thread, a functioning resource system is pretty important. Remember, the campaign is supposed to be tycoon like, with a budget system and whatnot. Does that mean players should be forced to ship and land a several thousand ton mining base to Eeloo? No. Would a small base capable of refueling and resupplying ships for the long haul out to the future outer planets be useful? Very much so. Building said base in the outer planets would be even more useful, rather than waiting years for tanker ships to make the Hohmann transfer out there. If your budget is not infinite, it might make sense to have a mining and resource system, all depending on what your mission is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of this points to the undeveloped campaign. Once the campaign starts getting fleshed out, we will see whether mining would be a good addition to the game or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T22:08:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nholzric\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nholzric\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt sounds to me like a primary reason we all want a resource system is to extend the playability of KSP past its current end-game lull. I think it\u0027s reasonable to assume that while a resource system could be great, even with one there will still be an end-game lull - it\u0027ll just be a little further out. There are several ways to push the lull further out: new content (like planets), dynamic content (like procedurally generated environment), new dynamics (like resources or an economy), and multiplayer. The fellow I was responding to said he would like random events but not multiplayer and it occurred to me those two could go together really well.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s more than just stuff to do after the end of the tech tree. There could be contracts to fill, or new technologies to unlock. Let\u0027s say that we eventually get other star systems, but you need a special kind of engine to get to it. In sandbox mode you could just build a rocket with the engine attached and fly off there, but in career mode you\u0027d need to fly to some hard to reach planet, mine a resource that\u0027s found only there, build the engine (or fuel it up) on site, and then be on your way... Think if it not as a feature unto itself, but a feature that unlocks a myriad of other features, or another level on the logical progression of difficulty as \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nholzric\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nholzric\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m with you though about multiplayer, very skeptical. I am much more excited about new content or dynamics than about multiplayer. I am worried it will break performance and I don\u0027t see how it can be fun. (which doesn\u0027t mean it won\u0027t be fun, I just mean I just can\u0027t see it) But KSP can already stand on it\u0027s own merits, that\u0027s not a reason to skip multiplayer. And many games are predicated on players interacting, your and my problem is KSP does so well as a single player we don\u0027t want to risk breaking that.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, this is my problem with multiplayer as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dwight_js","CreatedById":83255,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T22:16:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think resources are much more than just something to do after the end of the tech tree. Implemented properly, the career mode economy will necessitate the gathering and processing of resources. Real-world space travel has the problem of fuel - the further you want to go, the more you have to carry, the heavier you get, and you can\u0027t travel as far. Generating fuel at your destination becomes very important if you want to come home from anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe economy should also drive resource gathering. Setting foot on all the planets is fine and dandy, but that requires you to spend money. I don\u0027t think that even the general Kerball population has an endless appetite for funding missions to just visit places. I want to finance my space-empire with the extraction of exotic and useful minerals and stuff!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blspblackdeath","CreatedById":20067,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T22:20:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can understand the focus on new players from SQUAD. It is important to get new players to the game. But they have a big fanbase which is playing the game for over a year and more now.

And in my opinion the \u0022old\u0022 players aren\u0027t considered enough. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to confess, I was sligtly disappointed by the scienceupdate too. Because I thought it would benefit the endgame more instead of only introduce starters into the game mechanics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is good to make a game starter friendly, but you should not forget the initially targeted audience of your game. A standard Call of Duty player will never get into this game, just because it is too complex.
