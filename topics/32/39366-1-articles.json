Try removing the flaps at the ends of your main wing. Also strutting down the wings greatly reduces the wobble and improves stability. Further more, most craft are unstable out of their designed cruise altitude/speed. If those two radial intakes are the only intakes onboard, you will flame out long before your wing surface will loose most of its effectiveness. You can safely reduce the wing area without loosing ceiling altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bogpad","CreatedById":70927,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T12:03:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe plane might be shaking, but it seems Jeb is more than pleased with it, so why change anything!?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"El wonso","CreatedById":37011,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T12:06:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI designed that plane for sharp turns and high Gs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Torham234","CreatedById":58574,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T12:40:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022krl.krl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022krl.krl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI designed that plane for sharp turns and high Gs.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn that case your wing surface is totally over the top.
