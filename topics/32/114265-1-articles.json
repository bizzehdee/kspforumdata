Because heat is only supposed to move from hotter areas to colder areas. So, if heat from the air is getting into the ship, this means the air is hotter than the ship. Therefore, the ship should not be able to dump heat back into the air through the radiators. They would instead pump even more heat into the ship and make the situation worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHIS IS BROKEN.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlowerChild","CreatedById":74289,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T04:23:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGiven that it was completely UNrealistic to have LV-Ns heat up in the first place, the jibberjabber demanding radiators for them was totally misguided.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly if you believe that realism is a game design goal onto itself, which at least some of us don\u0027t believe to be the case.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T04:36:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FlowerChild\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FlowerChild\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOnly if you believe that realism is a game design goal onto itself, which at least some of us don\u0027t believe to be the case.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, I\u0027m totally in the camp of NOT desiring \u0022realism\u0022 in KSP, in the sense of defining \u0022realism\u0022 to mean \u0022just like Earth\u0022.
