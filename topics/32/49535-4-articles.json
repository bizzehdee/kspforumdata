Its a whimsical \u0027space tycoon\u0027 game - I always compare it to the Bullfrog games like Theme Hospital in tone and \u0027audience\u0027 and its an audience that isn\u0027t too well served even in the golden age of the Indie Game. They made a wise choice to go the physics sim route, because it makes for deep deep gameplay, which is what a lot of us \u0022nerds\u0022 like about it (and being able to mod all the cool things we like on top of it.) But they have ALWAYS designed the interface and difficulty to fit that \u0027whimsical space tycoon\u0027 game and not ItsJustLikeOrbiter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the complaining about the silly science text and the funny animations and all of that should stop - its a ridiculous thing to get bent out of shape about, and if you\u0027re looking that hard for something to beef about, maybe you need to examine \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027ll have tutorials and other example scenarios eventually, but in the middle of a programming sprint to add huge features to the game is not the time to be stop and make documentation. Furthermore, the science tree has a VERY specific function in that it implements the graduated ganeplay that almost ANY game features today - the first levels are easier and less complex, and as you progress you unlock more things. Tech trees are just the first layer of that, with several more to come, and it makes absolutely no sense to throw a fit about it, or declare that Squad doesn\u0027t care about the hardcare because they dared to add a graduated gameplay system to the lowest levels of the game. They HAD to do it because their audience is exploding, and the CURRENT DESIGN was not working, with new players being dropped into 100\u002B parts and having to figure it all out. Unlocking parts will teach them how to play 100 times better than any slideshow tutorial ever will.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want a long, complex career mode too. I am with you there. Anyone who plays more than a few months will. It will come - imagine difficulty settings and other systems like unlocking prototype parts and then buying enough stock to builld you ships, taking jobs to make money and managing your budget and resources. There is a long way to go. Its our job to tell them what parts we like or don\u0027t, and what we want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat we cannot and MUST NOT do is be negative and complain and start posts like this accusing Squad of abusing you or ignoring you. Don\u0027t attack other types of players as \u0022ruining the game.\u0022 Be postiive, or at the very least CONSTRUCTIVE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you aren\u0027t, you\u0027re the enemy of all things good, and somewhere a cute puppy is sitting in a corner crying.
