This mission was a roaring success, and a pleasant surprise to boot. With some help from the orbital mechanic tool (the app, no mods), I was able to successfully navigate to Mun, land, and return without glancing at the map once.\n\nGeneral mission overview:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Liftoff took me a couple of tries to get down properly, lots of pilot errors. Jettisoned first stage at 10km. It took me several attempts to actually get a stable orbit I felt I could deal with, and my actual trip to the Mun was a \u0027Well, this isn\\\u0027t quite what I\\\u0027d like, but hell, why not?\u0027 Second stage jettisoned at 80km, still re-entered atmosphere.\n\u003E \n\u003E I WAY overshot my target orbit of 75km and ended up settling into a rather round orbit at ~147km. From there, I waited until the Mun cleared the horizon of Kerbin, and started my hohmann transfer. Hohman transfer completed with about 50% of the fuel left in my third stage, things are looking good. \n\u003E \n\u003E I get into a direct descent pattern over the Mun, I have no idea which part of Mun I\\\u0027m over, from eyeballing it, it looks like I\\\u0027m on the side Kerbin-up. I\\\u0027m at about 1000m/s at 1000km, I start braking at 100km, following my speed=altitude/1000 rule.\n\u003E \n\u003E From what I can see, it looks like I\\\u0027m descending directly over a rather steep valley, I nudge it over onto some nicer looking terrain. 4km up, I still have about 30% fuel left in my third stage. I do one last braking burn, then jettison the third stage.\n\u003E \n\u003E Landing SUCCESS!\n\u003E \n\u003E ![cm6Yd.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/cm6Yd.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Kerbin is almost directly overhead, still trying to decide what to do, decide to do a one orbit \\\u0027round and then return back to Kerbin the same way I got here: wait for earth to clear the horizon, and accelerate to \\\u0027escape velocity.\\\u0027 I plug in the numbers and accelerate just enough to clear Mun\\\u0027s gravity well.\n\u003E \n\u003E Back in orbit around Kerbin, doing about 700m/s and am 10000km up, not quite sure what the orbit looks like. I decide to wait for the Pe to roll around. I\\\u0027m about 5000km up, and doing about 950m/s. Set the hohmann transfer in for a 30km Pe, we\\\u0027re gonna do another direct descent. I\\\u0027ve got slivers of fuel left in the tank, and my craft needs to do a powered descend. Whoo boy.\n\u003E \n\u003E I come back into Kerbin HOT, screaming through the upper layer of the atmosphere at about 3000m/s, finally slow down to 2km/s when I hit the middle layer and finally start slowing down, parachute deploys. \n\u003E \n\u003E I\\\u0027m coming in nice and easy over the middle of the giant ocean, 300m up, the parachute finally decides to open. I come in on a nice powered descent, braking last minute and hitting the water a little hard. Craft is destroyed, crew is alive.\n\u003E \n\u003E MET: ~7h\n\nWhat I\\\u0027ve learned: I could save a lot of fuel by waiting until a little later to do my Mun escape orbit, I think it\\\u0027d save me fuel doing the descent into Kerbin. I need to tweak the fuel a little bit; not so much fuel in the third stage, more fuel in the lander.\n\nI\\\u0027m probably overly proud of this mission, but I\\\u0027m very impressed with both the craft and myself. Here\\\u0027s the proud vessel that led me there, the Opul 1.\n\n![H5kWG.png](http://i.imgur.com/H5kWG.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-03T04:57:14Z","Content":"I think you have every reason to be proud of this accomplishment.\n\nI was thinking not long ago about doing the same sort of mission.

A good approach means the marker will slowly move away from -90\u00C2\u00B0 as you come around, eventually crossing the horizon at perigee... (retro-burn here).

What I mean is, how can you tell if you\\\u0027re coming in for a low perigee or an impact, and how do you know which way to correct for that?\n\nThe orbital tool was this one here:\n\n[http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=562.0](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=562.0)\n\nOrbital insertion went something like this:\n\nOnce I was at about 40km, I started looking for my \u0027goal\u0027 speed and altitude. Since I need a speed of 2286 m/s to orbit at 75km, I started accelerating to 2286 m/s as soon as I could. You know you\\\u0027ve reached your Ap when the vertical ascent meter starts to come back down to zero you\\\u0027re at your Ap. I\\\u0027d plugin that altitude into the round orbit calculator. If I wasn\\\u0027t going fast enough to maintain a round orbit at that altitude, I accelerated to the speed I needed for a round altitude.\n\nGranted, this led to a pretty severe overshoot and I ended up settling into an orbit twice as high as my goal. For the munar insertion, I followed the hohmann transfer for going from my current altitude at ~150km to the mun\\\u0027s orbital altitude of 11400km. Once I reached the goal speed, I time accelerated until my altitude snapped from Kerbin-relative to Mun-relative.\n\nAs for the how-did-I know-I-would-hit-the-mun-part, I didn\\\u0027t. I just killed off all my horizontal speed till I was falling straight down.\n\nThe trickiest part was figuring out when to escape the mun\\\u0027s orbit and when to decelerate for kerbin. And honestly, I made an educated guess. \n\nThis page here helped quite a bit: [http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/~kerbalsp/wiki/index.php?title=Mun](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/~kerbalsp/wiki/index.php?title=Mun)\n\nSince I know the mun\\\u0027s SOI is 2430km, I did a hohmann transfer from my orbital altitude of 75km (like I said, I overshot quite a bit) up to 2430km. As soon as I saw my altitude snap over to Kerbin-relative, I knew I made it.\n\nAt that point, I was descending, but still going pretty fast. At this point, I made probably the most fuel-expensive part of the mission: I decided to wait and see where my perogee was. As soon as I reached the perogee, I then plugged in the numbers to do a hohmann transfer from 5000km down to 30km, and made that my target speed.\n\nShould I make a how-to video?"},{"CreatedByName":"Max Grant","CreatedById":3166,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-04T01:38:02Z","Content":"Oh, darn!

(If kerbin is straight overhead in the sky at your landing spot, that means burn east.)\n\nYou also need to launch with more speed so you get 500m/s at the edge of the SOI (2400km) altitude.

It\\\u0027s actually quite thrilling to fly totally seat of the pants. I had a rough idea of the kind of numbers I would need, so I did the whole run by feel. 3 attempts total:\n\nThe first attempt looked good until I skimmed into lunar terrain... that little lander engine was too little too late once I noticed my orbit insertion was going to be sub-surface.\n\nSecond attempt, I had a good efficient launch with a bit of a low orbit. I was mostly circular around 75k, but then misjudged the velocity I\\\u0027d need for lunar transfer. I was aiming for 3000m/s which might be fine from 120-150k altitude, but a lot of that speed bleeds off coming up from a low orbit... I ended up in a long elliptical orbit to about 6000km. I was a bit surprised at first when I noticed I was no longer climbing, so I peeked at the map to see how far off I was (it was a failed pass anyway). Ok, maybe just get these guys home then: I made a short burn to drop my periapsis down from 75k into the atmosphere, thinking I would just come back for a landing. However, once I was in the atmosphere I could see my speed was still too high and I would skim off. At 45km my descent levelled out and my speed dropped to 2300-ish. This is too perfect! I still had plenty of fuel, and I could circularize this and make another run! I managed to get the aerobraking pass circularized around 100k, waited for the mun to come around again, and then screwed up the burn again: still too slow! I left the crew in elliptical orbit as a souvenir of a failed but really fun double-attempt.\n\nSuccessful mission spoilers below.\n\nFinal attempt: good on launch but I was too slow to accelerate into orbit: I missed the apogee and dropped back into the atmosphere a bit. Still, I saved it and set up a slow climb up from 63km. At moonrise I was nearly level around 75km, and accelerated to 3150m/s. I reached the lunar gravity going a bit fast so I made a bit of retro-burn so I wouldn\\\u0027t just pass by. I watched my altitude drop until about 720km where it levelled out. I took a wild guess: retrograde burn, 160m/s sounds good. Honestly this was such a lucky guess that I couldn\\\u0027t believe it... I just checked the numbers in Orbit Mechanic and I was dead on! This would bring me in to a low perigee at 3 km above the surface: perfect! I still had my second stage with some fuel for slowing down, and when I burned it up, I was sitting 3km up, in level flight, going 65m/s. Couldn\\\u0027t have done it any better.\n\nHere\\\u0027s how I actually checked if that approach from 720km was sane as I was coming in: when you\\\u0027re in an elliptical orbit, the prograde/retrograde markers oscillate up and down in a sine wave: at apogee/perigee they are on the horizon, and at the ascending/descending nodes (half way between apogee/perigee at the steepest descent or climb), the markers reach the furthest away from the horizon. Let\\\u0027s say it oscillates between 40 degrees above the horizon and 40 degrees below the horizon... like a sine wave, it slows down as it reaches the highest and lowest points, and it passes through the horizon quickest. I knew I had to get from my horizon at 720km altitude to my low horizon somewhere near the surface. This means the prograde marker would dive down to some angle, pause there, and start returning to the horizon as I approach perigee. I watched that marker as it dipped. I could see it pause at -40 degrees, and I checked my altitude once I confirmed that it slowly started returning: the altitude was 350km, so I knew I was close since this is half-way between 720km and zero. This is harder to do when the approach is not so steep since the movements are smaller... If you want precision instead of seat-of-the-pants flying, use a calculator!\n\nMy lander had full fuel at touchdown because of that perfect approach... Return trip: I knew Kerbin was just over the horizon from my landing spot and I was near the equator, so the direction I needed to go was straight up (perpendicular from the Mun-Kerbin line, aka the horizon). With 2 full tanks of fuel, I could just burn straight up instead of doing the more efficient method of orbiting before transferring off. I accelerated to 900m/s, which left me about 60m/s Kerbin-relative speed after leaving mun gravity (actually it was too much the other way, I was coming back retrograde). This set me up for a really steep descent, Ideally I would\\\u0027ve liked to decelerate in the high atmosphere rather than coming straight down... oh well, still landed by parachute.\n\nFun!
