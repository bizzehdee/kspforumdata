With refuelling on the runway I once did a Minmas run, followed by Gilly, followed by Ike. \n\nCurrently in 1.0 my SSTO can carry a small payload into orbit and return. I can see maybe a Mun orbit and return but that would be about max.\n\nSo changes were in order.\n\nCurrently I am having great success with a modified system (not SSTO). Basically I am strapping wings and jets on a rocket and doing most of the launch that way with a breakaway rocket after I drain off the last of the fuel in the wings.\n\nEven with a small 2 jet 1 rocket setup I am easily and cheaply lifting 3,500 DV plus a bit of payload in LKO. For me this is great because it makes Duna, Ike, Dres, Gilly return missions cheaper than my conventional Mun orbit missions were all on small rocket designs.\n\nAnybody else having good luck with hybrids?"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T15:55:41Z","Content":"Nah, I just do pure SSTO.\n\nBut they might be kind of hard to get the design right without revert flight (unless you just do it in sandbox, and then move the craft file to your career game).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I can see maybe a Mun orbit and return but that would be about max.\n\nIn mun Orbit\n\n![11000540_10103582135358853_5504031967368108229_o.jpg](https://scontent-mxp1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xft1/t31.0-8/s720x720/11000540_10103582135358853_5504031967368108229_o.jpg)\n\nResearch\u002Bfuel depot docking\n\n![11200937_10103576797765433_1885330676085241530_o.jpg](https://scontent-mxp1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/t31.0-8/s720x720/11200937_10103576797765433_1885330676085241530_o.jpg)\n\nEarly version, lacking sufficient thrust to get a large payload to orbit:\n\n![10646759_10103582135378813_6584161724900092956_n.jpg?oh=9e803b4dcce19749829321935f596542\u0026oe=55F831D9](https://scontent-mxp1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10646759_10103582135378813_6584161724900092956_n.jpg?oh=9e803b4dcce19749829321935f596542\u0026oe=55F831D9)\n\nRemedied: \n\n\u002B 4 more turbos (66.7% more airbreathing thrust than the previous iteration)\n\n\u002B 1 LV-T45 (38.5% more rocket thrust than previous version)\n\n![11051972_10103582138552453_2244033946117548209_n.jpg?oh=231b1f58a863b1525f9b5d315b987216\u0026oe=55C835A9](https://scontent-mxp1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/11051972_10103582138552453_2244033946117548209_n.jpg?oh=231b1f58a863b1525f9b5d315b987216\u0026oe=55C835A9)\n\nI have a tanker SSTO for refuels, including over half an orange tank at Mun orbit, and an even larger SSTO at the dimension and mass limits of the lvl2 runway - but no pics at the moment\n\nI experimented with doing a 2 stage craft, with a jet stage going suborbital, with some fuel to return to the runway, and then a 2nd stage for orbital insertion, that would then be recoverable.... but...
