I think that even when I use the keyboard shortcut (\u0022through ships\u0022), it causes the failure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor two days, more by intuition than by code knowledge foundation, I no longer use the \u0022Switch to\u0022, and I carry out the cumbersome task of going to \u0022Tracking Station\u0022 and from there selecting another ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems that this avoids conflict and so far, with the procedure described, the Kal-1000 tracks have not been erased.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nLuck!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
