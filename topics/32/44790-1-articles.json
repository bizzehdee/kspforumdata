Also the Mun and other places felt more gamey, more Kerbal. Also the lack of advanced things led people to come up with crazy (and very Kerbal) solutions such as the landing-leg-hugger docking style.

The first phase is fun at first and then it gets old because it always ends in the same ... EXPLOSIONS! I am not saying explosions are boring but they get old if it is every rocket launch, so you then decide to learn some basics and start going places and after a few days of going places you get things down and it becomes instinctual almost, that also gets boring after a while though because there is nothing new for you.

This was true back in the older versions, and its true now. Even before a lot of parts were added, once you get to the point where you almost never crash a ship anymore, the game doesn\u0027t feel quite as comical as it does when you start playing. Hell back when I couldn\u0027t get off the launch pad the game was all about having a laugh, but once I started actually being able to do things it took on a much more serious tone. Now its not about seeing how big a fireball I can make, or how many Kerbal\u0027s I can kill.... its about trying to NOT kill them. That makes it almost a completely different game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the flip side, the feel of the game itself has changed a bit over the last year. As new features were added, and the old placeholder parts/buildings/terrain were replaced with more realistic looking ones the game has taken on a more realistic feel. It still has its off the deep end charm, but its a much more believable space flight simulator then it use to be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I love the direction the game is headed in. I never liked the community created idea that the Kerbals were terrible engineers and that KSP should look more like an episode of Junkyard Wars then an actual space sim game. I don\u0027t want the space port to look like a broken down trailer park, or my rocket to look like something assembled from stuff found in a dumpster. The best choice the devs have made IMO so far with KSP is to tune out the \u0022lolz so Kerbal\u0022 section of the community and instead shoot for a more realistic art style for the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Meltro","CreatedById":78609,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T05:35:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AlamoVampire\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AlamoVampire\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think rotorwashed has it on the nose.

Back in the days of 0.8x there were no such things as landing legs, nor was there any place to go to in order to land! Orbiting and going home were all you could expect. Kerbin\u0027s terrain was a crude placeholder - a basic sphere with minimal contours that didn\u0027t rotate (so one side was perma-day and the other perma-night) and landing on the night side was inevitable, bug-induced death! With absolutely minimal content we were forced to focus on kludging ships together, using fins for legs and whooping it up if we managed a decent sub-orbital hop and got back to the right side of the planet in one piece. Not to mention there were no game saves or time-warp, so every mission lasted only as long as a game session. And there were only three Kerbals. (Not to mention: C7 had yet to put the \u0022aero-\u0022 into \u0022aerospace\u0022! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo put it in a nutshell - the game was so basic and tiny it fitted in a nutshell!

The game still challenges the player to learn about rocketry and aviation in a way no other game does, even though it wraps it up in a much wider range of auxiliary game mechanics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the \u0022feel\u0022 of the game... Personally, I have to admit I hardly ever look at my Kerbals during flights these days, so the charm has (for me) faded. It came back in buckets when Dan Rosas added so many new animations and all those cute groundcrew, but after a while I started to forget to pay attention to them and get back to the core game - making rockets and sending them places.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat will never get old.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-04T03:04:14Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2013 03:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by softweir\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"erkha343","CreatedById":1957,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T20:35:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI always hoped that ksp would eventually be more Orbiter and less ksp 0.8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow it is turning out, neither early ksp or complicated Orbiter, some kind of middle ground, I like it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
