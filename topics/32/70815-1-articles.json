I don\u0027t tend to add lifting stages and suchlike to the sub-assembly list so either I modify a previous rocket or rebuild it from scratch with a similar design. Any flaws in the design which make it inefficient are usually copied over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if I leave the game for a few days and return planning a new mission I \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E need to rebuild the lifter but I won\u0027t remember how I built it.
