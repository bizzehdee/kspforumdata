Like, the wiki lists the mass of the largest 3.75m heatshield to be 2.8 tons, while a T-400 fuel tank is at 2.2 tons. As a rough guestimate, let\u0027s consider those roughly equal (or throw in another T-100 tank on top to even things out more), and I really can\u0027t think of many vessels that would be big enough to warrant a 3.75m heatshield, yet wouldn\u0027t weigh enough that they could produce 2000 m/s deltaV off a T-400.\n\u003E The way I\u0027m looking at things, you\u0027d have to transport that mass to Jool either way to make use of it, so it essentially all comes down to what is heavier: the fuel required for an equivalent burn or the shield for the aerobrake.\n\nAnother option would be to not have a heat shield and just barely capture with fuel, then aerobrake, just skimming the atmosphere very slightly and reduce your Ap very gradually with many aero brakes, like NASA does.\n\nIIRC they either plan to or recently did a mission with a craft that reduced it\u0060s Ap through around 800 aerobrake manoeuvrers...\n\nThis is what I did with Jool and FAR in recent KSP versions. Capture with fuel, then lots of aerobrakes until my Ap was right for intercepting something larger like Laythe or Tylo and using a gravity assist to mostly circularise. Relatively low Dv needed to get a fairly satisfactory orbit around Jool. Took a while though."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T14:17:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Another option would be to not have a heat shield and just barely capture with fuel, then aerobrake, just skimming the atmosphere very slightly and reduce your Ap very gradually with many aero brakes, like NASA does.\n\nBut NASA has a different problem than we do in KSP, which is that they have an order of magnitude more energy to deal with. With the much lower speeds in KSP, we shouldn\u0027t have to do hundreds of passes. Besides, that doesn\u0027t sound like fun gameplay watching that play out over however many real hours instead of getting on what the actual mission you built the ship for. Not to mention the months of gametime added to travel time, which would complicate life support (especially if you had no way to predict how long this would all take), and the difficulty of doing this with more than 1 ship at a time."},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T14:18:45Z","Content":"Return from the Mun was fine.

If the whole game isn\u0027t designed for this all you get is a pocket of enhanced realism surrounded by a game not designed to deal with that. I wouldn\u0027t even care that aerobraking/aerocapture doesn\u0027t work if the game was designed in a way so that you don\u0027t need it and still had a fun experience.\n\nIf I could easily plot gravity assist trajectories and launch windows for my flights and the physics were scaled down so that I wouldn\u0027t need hundreds of aerocapture passes I\u0027d be fine. Currently I can do none of this in stock. I could do this with mods (it would still be more hassle than it\u0027s worth though) but with mods I get no support from Squad whatsoever when bugs happen.\n\nSo I now have a modified aerodynamic model and heat physics and basically no tools in the stock game that help me deal with those changes. Don\u0027t even get me started on the fact that those changes haven\u0027t really been communicated to all players in a meaningful way.\n\nSo what I have:\n\n- new scaling for engines\n\n- new scaling of the aerodynamic models\n\n- more realistic heat physics\n\n- still the same crappy maneuver node system\n\n- still the same patched conics approximation with a maximum of three conical patches\n\n- still no advanced trajectory planning and plotting\n\n- still no launch window calculator\n\n- still a time warp and physics timewarp system that can\u0027t even deal with \u0027normal\u0027 physics without choking some of the time.\n\nSo the only thing the new system gives a normal player is even more headaches than before.
