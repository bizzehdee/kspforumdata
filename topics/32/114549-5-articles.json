Like, the wiki lists the mass of the largest 3.75m heatshield to be 2.8 tons, while a T-400 fuel tank is at 2.2 tons. As a rough guestimate, let\u0027s consider those roughly equal (or throw in another T-100 tank on top to even things out more), and I really can\u0027t think of many vessels that would be big enough to warrant a 3.75m heatshield, yet wouldn\u0027t weigh enough that they could produce 2000 m/s deltaV off a T-400.\u003Cp\u003EThe way I\u0027m looking at things, you\u0027d have to transport that mass to Jool either way to make use of it, so it essentially all comes down to what is heavier: the fuel required for an equivalent burn or the shield for the aerobrake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option would be to not have a heat shield and just barely capture with fuel, then aerobrake, just skimming the atmosphere very slightly and reduce your Ap very gradually with many aero brakes, like NASA does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIIRC they either plan to or recently did a mission with a craft that reduced it\u0060s Ap through around 800 aerobrake manoeuvrers...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what I did with Jool and FAR in recent KSP versions.
