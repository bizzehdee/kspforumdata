Then rumours of a new version filters through and you begin to arc back towards the planet... \n\nThen you hear about all more wonderful things that have appeared... x64... upgradable buildings and numerous other new features and you speed up and get hooked all over again.\n\nGod... sometimes I hate Squad lol....

Previously I was developing my hardware meters but the mod that enabled them hasn\u0027t been updated to 0.90 yet (Telemachus is awesome) so I can concentrate on the game itself and not keep getting sidetracked while developing.\n\nAnyone else feel that it\u0027s the Kerbals that turn what could have been a sterile sim into something fun and enjoyable? I find that crashing and yet saving the stranded survivors is what makes up 90% of my play lol.... REEEEEEEEEEESCCCCCCCCCCCUUUUUUEEEEE MISSSSSSSSHION.

This was still abandoned last I heard, but I could be wrong. \n\nWelcome back Mr NeoMorph!\n\nI have to agree about the Kerbals. To me, career mode is a grindy set of tasks to complete, but taking these little green guys on a journey of discovery is still good fun.
