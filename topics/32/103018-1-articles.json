So what is your favorite to do?\n\nFor me, it would be building and editing. It feels very fascinating to imagine the big picture to your rocket, then putting all the calculations, physics and engineering together to create a glamorous pride of the fleet. It\u0027s just that you use your creativity and imagination to get where you want to go.\n\nWhat about you guys?"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T05:28:08Z","Content":"Building bases and stations.
