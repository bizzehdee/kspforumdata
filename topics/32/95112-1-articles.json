Reason i dont use it is cause it looks weird with no actual cities on the planet (looks great in orbit, but rather bad when your low-mid level flying and see no real buildings). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also reccomend getting HyperEdit, not for its cheat aspects, but for the ability to say move stuff somewhere u want for scenarios. I mostly use it instead of MJ\u0027s automation. I fly 1-3 craft somewhere, and if im assembling a base or whatnot, ill Hedit the rest of the ships into place to save time and cut down on in my opinion boring repetitive tasks (like launching 10\u002B of the exact same craft to laythe when im resupplying a carrier).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR/NEAR aerodynamics (well my custom version of NEAR/FAR which ditches every single feature but drag based on profile instead of mass and the new less soupy atmosphere). Stock aerodynamics are really really bad, they work, but thats more or less all they do. If you want to build realistic planes, realistic rockets, and have a more real life feel to craft (ive played alot of flight sims before this game, so the stock ksp flight modeling is kinda crap), get one of these mods (FAR is the more realistic, but if you just want a taste of better aerodynamics NEAR will work better, doesnt have all the features FAR has and is easier to work with).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9 aerospace (ive always preferred planes even for space stuff, so well the pack worked well for me over the years. Recently i stopped using it, as the stuff that i really liked were the larger fuselages, which are now at least made partially redundant with the addition of MK-2 and MK-3 parts to stock. If you want more aircraft parts, go ahead and add it, but if you are like me and are satisfied with the stuff the devs added, it might be best to save on precious RAM and get something that doesnt load a crapton of textures/parts that happen to be rather high-res.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheres one more mod i used to use but cant find it anymore, it made it possible to modify a craft file and make all jets flame out at the same time. If i can remember or find this mod again, id so be using this on many SSTO builds i make.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you like combat get BDArmory, its the only half decent and somewhat balanced weapons mod out there. I know weapons are only for a small subset of the community, but if you like to shoot stuff, that mod is nice (i use it here and there, although i have to say its actually aloty of fun to fight with stock weapons, torpedoes, kinetic missiles, ibeam rockets, ect)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, its not really possible to answer the OP\u0027s question, do whatever you like. If you want to play online, you are limited to pretty much stock parts with all the popular servers supporting most .dll mods, but new custom mod parts do not work there at all. If you mostly play single-player, then if there is a feature you think would be nice to have, by all means add it. Provided you dont hit KSP 32bit memory wall (dont have too too many mods at once), you can keep adding mods as you see fit, and if you dislike one mod or another, just remove it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"J.Random","CreatedById":63332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T18:36:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t act like a mindless drone.
