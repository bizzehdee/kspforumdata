I don\u0027t feel like shelling out for another probe core just for SAS, so I probably will try flying it without it. Lets see how it goes.\n\nEdit: made it to space and orbit, but ran out of fuel before reaching target due to waay to many correction. Ok, fine, *Bill*. You are getting a probe to assist you with flying. Gonna have to figure out the logistics though...remote tech would require the probe to have an antenna and it will cost something...\n\nHave you ever tried flying without SAS? How did it go? How well were you at flying without SAS?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-21T09:17:19Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2015 09:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RainDreamer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T08:03:21Z","Content":"It can be done; I\u0027ve sent SASless ships to the Mun and back.\n\nSpin stabilisation helps a great deal; angled tailfins in atmosphere, torque wheels in space."},{"CreatedByName":"bakanando","CreatedById":126310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T08:25:44Z","Content":"If you are going to be flying around other ships I\u0027d recommend having a probe, even if it was a pilot.

I use FAR, so by taking aerodynamics into consideration when constructing, launch wasn\u0027t that much of an ordeal. With some canards, and a slight tilt after clearing the pad, the gravity turn pretty much happens by itself. My transfer and upper stage were fairly small, so they were easy to orient in the proper direction, with very short burns to achieve the desired orbit changes. Landing on the surface of the mun was a bit tedious, but not that hard if done carefully. During reentry, no SAS was needed, as my heat shield (Yes, deadly reentry) made it bottom heavy, and of course when it came to parachutes, they were mounted on top."},{"CreatedByName":"ghpstage","CreatedById":129622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T11:04:32Z","Content":"I only play stock, but fly without SAS regularly.\n\nI\u0027ve done plenty of manned missions to and from the Mun and Minmus, and I have an ambitious, manned Duna round trip on the go (that cost less than 15K!) that I really ought to finish.\n\nI\u0027ve done one way unmanned landings on everything bar Moho, Dres and Eeloo, and all in sub 18ton, budget launches. I have had quite a few probe losses in total, but 90%\u002B have been Tylo and Moho attempts. A lot have been launch failures due to the rocket I built flying like a randomly shaped brick, but Tylo\u0027s surface is even scarier without SAS!\n\nThe only orbital rendezvous I have done have been Kerbal rescues. I probably wouldn\u0027t attempt docking without (until I got really bored), but I would think that a satellite rendezvous for engineering purposes, where you don\u0027t dock and don\u0027t require a long EVA would be quite reasonable given patience and practice.\n\nI\u0027m not a user of spin stabilisation. I find with fine controls I can get the turns to very nearly stop very near to where I want while in space, where you have plenty of time, and for me at least, spinning in the atmosphere is an exercise in failure generation.\n\nBiggest tip I can give is to make sure you know if fine control is on or off off before you start a manoeuvre, as past experience has shown me that not knowing will often lead to a lot of fuel being wasted, and during take off or landings, can easily lead to explosions.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-21T11:37:40Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2015 11:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ghpstage**"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T11:20:42Z","Content":"Atmo only, most of my turboprops fly better without SAS because the vibrations of the engine confuses it.
