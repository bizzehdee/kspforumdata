There\u0027s a physical limit to how fine the detail is allowed to become before the printer can no longer precisely reproduce it, but other than that, all bets are off.\n\nBut if your model is large and contains a large amount of material, then you a.) need to pay for that material and b.) need to pay more for the printing run - because the printer may have to spend an entire run just making your one large model as opposed to making 10 smaller models side-by-side in one run.
