PSUs do degrade a bit over the years and may stop being able to output the rated wattage. If you\u0027re already virtually maxed out on your power supply you have no room for upgrading or even overclocking. Power supplies aren\u0027t at their most efficient so close to 100% load. And they might also be somewhat noisier than a higher-rated supply subject to the same power draw.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand I don\u0027t want overkill. A 1000 Watt supply to run a ~500 Watt build is a waste of money and it may well be heavier and bulkier than you need. It also might be less efficient because supplies aren\u0027t at their most efficient at very light loads either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you genuinely did have a 512 Watt build, then a 650-750 W supply would seem about right I think.
