Its not as efficient and has limitations, but its sure nice to be able to finally have infinite range vessels under 15t. Just made a SSTO that has ~3000 dV in LKO, 2t payload (missiles ofc), and weighs 20t on the pad. Before i could always get 7000dV with same payload, but do you knwo how unpractical and unpleasant it was to fly around with a 40t fighter jet, yeah it could go almost anywhere and back without fuel, but bloody long burns and painful to fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe IRSU is also neat as its so light ~2t for it and all needed equipment to use it) is more then doable on virtually every vessel from small and compact to medium and large (although super massives still benefit from the large one).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T04:57:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ivDLO67.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ivDLO67.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI defy physics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Trann","CreatedById":83801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T05:14:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEvery new release makes me want to start a new game from the beginning.
