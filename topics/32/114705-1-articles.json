Squad said they would think about multiplayer after the game is released and the game is two months released now. It is time to get multiplayer to destroy your friend\u0027s spaceship to steal its fuel or dock with it to gain fuel peacefully. There is so much moar good things KSP will be if multiplayer is added. Your friends will help you get science or money. You will make grand ships together. Remember just about every game that had multiplayer released after single player doubling its copies sold number?\n\u003E say no. But the truth is the truth in the end. And the truth is KSP multiplayer will make the world of KSP hate free and full of encouragement which has gone missing. This will cause squad get so much sales they will just have to worry about making KSP the best and most successful video game in the ***WORLD*** please people support this for this is the feature that KSP is just asking for and it will be greater than ever in the eyes of all. Scott Manley, ronin pawn and Jedediah Kerman will all think the game is twice as good. This is the move that will astonish and please all.\n\nSorry mate but that\u0027s a terrible idea.

I\u0027m not sure its possible to be honest.

Maybe you would because youre a good person. Would your friend youre dogfighting with land and wait? Maybe he would too. Maybe he wouldnt. Those are planes. Easy enough.\n\nBut one of your friends is launching a rocket. Would you land your rocket so your friend would go to Eeloo? Maybe your interplanetary friend can wait.. In empty, boring space. Waiting for planes to land, rockets to orbit and rovers to stop.\n\nEdit: But those are simple! What if youre on aerobrake/lithobrake trajectory while your friend is interplanetary? Well you can stop warping with requests (otherwise it would be so.. messy.) And request a slower warp so you can wait until youre close enough to reach the \u0022fun\u0022 part like landing. While your friend is still waiting in empty space, warping slowly with you.\n\nThen you request to stop warping and maybe your friend was a bad person/got tired of waiting/went to get snacks so he can wait more. Of course the warp doesnt stop, and you hit the ground at 10x warp.\n\nAnd quicksave/quickload system..\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T01:07:53Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 01:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Feradose**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T01:09:51Z","Content":"As the OP seems to have withdrawn his original comment, this thread is no longer serving a purpose, and will be closed now."}]}
