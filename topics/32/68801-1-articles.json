I\u0027ve been reading on the forum that many think that the new ARM engines are very powerful. If it is so, then how is it possible that I get about the same delta-v budget (around 10000) for an asparagus-staged rocket with 2 rings of stages (18\u002B1 engines altogether) made of old LV-N parts, and for an asparagus-staged rocket with the same topology built entirely of the new parts? Why isn\u0027t the new rocket \u0022better\u0022 (higher delta-v), when it should be vastly more powerful?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWanted to address this because nobody else really has. This is a concept that goes very much into the advanced construction school, and I ran afoul of it when trying to build a really large rocket once. No matter what I tried, I couldn\u0027t get a meaningful amount of extra dV compared to much smaller rockets. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72984-practical-dV-ceiling-for-rockets\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere is the thread I made on the subject\u003C/a\u003E, it contains many good answers and links to similar discussions or related resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, any given single rocket stage has a practical limit on how much delta-V it can provide. I say \u0022practical\u0022 because, while the theoretical delta-V is probably infinite, there is a point at which returns begin to diminish at a rapid pace. This results in having to add gigantic amounts of mass for any sort of meaningful dV increase, which in turn results in you running out of thrust to lift the rocket. For a ship assembled and fueled in orbit, liftoff thrust is obviously not important, but you still have to deal with the greatly diminishing returns. This starts to kick in at a certain payload fraction - in other words, the larger your current stage is in comparison to what is on top of it, the less efficient it becomes. This is independent of engine technology (but obviously better engines will achieve a higher total dV).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means that for example SSTO rockets are a terrible idea from an efficiency standpoint. Rather than trying to maximize the dV of a single stage, it is far better to have a multi-staged rocket. In the real world, Earth orbit is traditionally achieved with two stages; there were three-stage designs that did afford additional efficiency gains, but these gains were small enough that opting for the simpler two-stage design with less points of failure is generally referred. The Saturn V on the other hand was a three-stage rocket, because anything less than three stages would have been inefficient for the dV required to perform a translunar injection. And then it also had the Apollo spacecraft itself which was technically a fourth stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe distilled relevance for KSP gameplay is this: your rocket is not getting that much more dV out of the new, giant NASA parts than your old rocket did because you\u0027ve in all likelyhood run headfirst into that diminishing returns scenario. You probably have one stage with a really large amount of dV, and other stages which have comparatively less. For example, if you have one stage with 6000 dV, one with 2000 dV and one with 1000 dV, that\u0027s a really inefficient setup. If you instead had three stages with 3000 dV each, the whole rocket still has exactly the same total dV - but it would be a whole lot smaller and lighter. Conversely, sticking with the 6k-2k-1k example, if you wanted to increase the total dV of that rocket, it would be catastrophically inefficient to try and do it in the first stage. You would get a much, much higher benefit if you increased the second and third stages. Only small amounts of extra mass there would result in much more total dV. Of course, then your first stage may run out of TWR if it is already at the limit. In that scenario, removing 1000 dV from the first stage might allow you to add 2000 dV to the second, and another 2000 to the third stage. In my case, I was able to turn a 22,500 dV rocket into a 26,500 dV rocket with identical TWR purely by evening out the dV amounts between the individual stages - despite being limited in that regard by individual stage TWR and couldn\u0027t get it fully even.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you now think that the highest efficiency is achieved with a huge amount of stages, that\u0027s only partially true. That works so long as your rocket mass is dominated by fuel, but in KSP, rocket parts - especially engines - have unrealistically high amounts of dry mass. If you make hundreds of tiny stages with tiny dV budgets, your rocket\u0027s total fuel/mass ratio drops off and you get less dV again because you\u0027re simply not carrying as much fuel as you could.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately it depends on what your mission profile is. Most missions in stock KSP require only moderate amounts of dV, so you hardly ever run into these construction limits, and you\u0027ll be fine with a rocket that only has 2 or 3 stages in a fairly inefficient mass distribution. But if you ever have a scenario where you need more, and somehow can\u0027t manage to get it - then you might want to even out your stages and add another one or two to the mix.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nemoricus","CreatedById":4141,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T11:06:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vidboi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vidboi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe [new] tanks themselves have the same wet/dry mass ratio as the older tank\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis part isn\u0027t true.
