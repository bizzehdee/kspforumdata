Here, you can see one of the two crewed vessels - Sarnus 2A - doing a rather short flyby around Ike. Most people say Ike is a jerk who botches your Duna aerobrake route.

I thought it would be ludicruously hard to leave it in a flat, mostly-circular orbit around Duna, but it actually behaved itself. It contains a fairly big stash of fuel(well, as long as you don\u0027t use it to refuel a Whackjob-type vessel), space for 13 Kerbals(consisting of three Hitchhikers and one cupola), two long-range antennaes and a whopping 16 docking ports(14 normal-size, 4 junior-size, plus one obstructed senior-size). You must be thinking, that must\u0027ve been sent to orbit by a monster of a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Kl9vXpC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Kl9vXpC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd indeed, I had to split it in two launches to be able to get it to even Kerbin orbit, breaking my \u0022one-launch\u0022 policy, sadly. Alas, the Senior docking ports vehemently refused to dock for whatever reason(do decouplers damage docking ports?), so once again I had to HyperEdit the whole station into the orbit the two modules previously were. Hey, stop looking at me that way, I launched both of them legitimately, did the rendezvous and got them within docking range. It\u0027s not cheating if the game decides to glitch out!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, in order to tow that station around, I used a tug powered by four Jumbo-64 tanks with mainsails underneath each, with a central X200-16 fuel tank(which pumps fuel into the radial ones with fuel lines). I used Mainsails because I expected the station to be really hard to push, but turns out the Mainsails were really overpowered. I thought I\u0027d be better off with Skippers or even Poodles, but little did I know that these Mainsails came to help me later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter getting the station into Medium Duna Orbit, the boosters were mostly only there to cover five of the station\u0027s docking ports and to create more lag(of which the station\u0027s already guilty of causing some). I decided to yank it out of the station, but I realized that, in my rush to get the station to Duna, I forgot to add any type of solar panel or batteries to the boosters despite attaching excessive ammounts of reaction wheels to it, leaving me with rapidly-decreasing 30 units of eletricity at \u003Cem\u003Emost\u003C/em\u003E. I\u0027d normally leave the booster in orbit, but it could be a danger to the station and to docking vessels. I had to land it. Fortunately, on my side I had not one, but \u003Cem\u003Efour\u003C/em\u003E energy-producing Mainsails, and around 2k m/s of Delta-V to burn. So I had to engage on a little game of retro-burning myself into a completely vertical, fuel-inneficient way of descent into Duna\u0027s surface, and occasionally burn retrograde to refill my energy meter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeedless to say, it was really tense(and annoying, but mostly tense).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CgXNz8w.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CgXNz8w.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing was... less than perfect, since I ran out of energy just as I was about to make touchdown.

But apparently, you cannot warp faster than 10x under 60km. Really? Note to self: Make Sarnus 2B arrive in an orbit \u003Cem\u003Eabove\u003C/em\u003E 60km. Nevertheless, I proceeded to rendezvous and dock with the new station. I expected rendezvous to be incredibly hard, like it always was, but it was actually \u003Cem\u003Ereally easy\u003C/em\u003E! I guess I\u0027m just getting better at KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDocking\u003C/em\u003E, on the other hand, was hell. I almost crashed into the station twice - first, when I was matching velocity, I couldn\u0027t see the station\u0027s marker for some reason, so I didn\u0027t know where it was, and it took me by surprise when it arrived and approached fast, and I had Nuclear Engines, thus thrust was kinda weak(Anmund and Jonfal were flipping their hairs out, yet the pilot, Dancott, was just stoic. That\u0027s some Jebediah-level badassery there!) - second, when I was matching myself with one of the docking ports, my ship was performing sluggishly, and I almost wiped out the station\u0027s solar panels as I tried to figure if I needed to burn prograde or retrograde to stand still relative to the station - but, after a lot of tense moments, I managed to dock. Good think I got rid of the boosters, since the rear docking port was the easiest to attach the ship to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor some reason, whereas most people imagine a \u003Cem\u003E\u0022click!\u0022\u003C/em\u003E sound when docking, I imagine a \u003Cem\u003E\u0022pluck.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E one instead. I guess I\u0027m just different.

I thought it would be ludicruously hard to leave it in a flat, mostly-circular orbit around Duna, but it actually behaved itself. It contains a fairly big stash of fuel(well, as long as you don\u0027t use it to refuel a Whackjob-type vessel), space for 13 Kerbals(consisting of three Hitchhikers and one cupola), two long-range antennaes and a whopping 16 docking ports(14 normal-size, 4 junior-size, plus one obstructed senior-size).

Alas, the Senior docking ports vehemently refused to dock for whatever reason(do decouplers damage docking ports?), so once again I had to HyperEdit the whole station into the orbit the two modules previously were. Hey, stop looking at me that way, I launched both of them legitimately, did the rendezvous and got them within docking range. It\u0027s not cheating if the game decides to glitch out!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, in order to tow that station around, I used a tug powered by four Jumbo-64 tanks with mainsails underneath each, with a central X200-16 fuel tank(which pumps fuel into the radial ones with fuel lines). I used Mainsails because I expected the station to be really hard to push, but turns out the Mainsails were really overpowered. I thought I\u0027d be better off with Skippers or even Poodles, but little did I know that these Mainsails came to help me later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter getting the station into Medium Duna Orbit, the boosters were mostly only there to cover five of the station\u0027s docking ports and to create more lag(of which the station\u0027s already guilty of causing some). I decided to yank it out of the station, but I realized that, in my rush to get the station to Duna, I forgot to add any type of solar panel or batteries to the boosters despite attaching excessive ammounts of reaction wheels to it, leaving me with rapidly-decreasing 30 units of eletricity at \u003Cem\u003Emost\u003C/em\u003E. I\u0027d normally leave the booster in orbit, but it could be a danger to the station and to docking vessels. I had to land it. Fortunately, on my side I had not one, but \u003Cem\u003Efour\u003C/em\u003E energy-producing Mainsails, and around 2k m/s of Delta-V to burn. So I had to engage on a little game of retro-burning myself into a completely vertical, fuel-inneficient way of descent into Duna\u0027s surface, and occasionally burn retrograde to refill my energy meter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeedless to say, it was really tense(and annoying, but mostly tense).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CgXNz8w.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/CgXNz8w.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing was... less than perfect, since I ran out of energy just as I was about to make touchdown.

Nevertheless, I proceeded to rendezvous and dock with the new station. I expected rendezvous to be incredibly hard, like it always was, but it was actually \u003Cem\u003Ereally easy\u003C/em\u003E!

That\u0027s some Jebediah-level badassery there!) - second, when I was matching myself with one of the docking ports, my ship was performing sluggishly, and I almost wiped out the station\u0027s solar panels as I tried to figure if I needed to burn prograde or retrograde to stand still relative to the station - but, after a lot of tense moments, I managed to dock. Good think I got rid of the boosters, since the rear docking port was the easiest to attach the ship to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor some reason, whereas most people imagine a \u003Cem\u003E\u0022click!\u0022\u003C/em\u003E sound when docking, I imagine a \u003Cem\u003E\u0022pluck.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E one instead.
