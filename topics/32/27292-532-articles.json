However, upon landing Jeb noticed that he was not the one who was supposed to be flying this craft, and that apart from the real pilot, two other Kerbals that were supposed to man the station were not there. Apparently there was a crew mixup, and Jeb found himself alone on a lonely mint rock.....for the next year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile on Kerbin, a mission was set in motion to bring the missing crew to the Minmus base, and at the same time deploy an orbital station around Minmus as part of a contract as well. As part of another contract that required a satellite in Minmus orbit, the station also contained a probe core to be able to be operated remotely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis whole mission completely failed in both its objectives. The station was not built according to specifications, was running low on fuel and being piloted by the probe core, and not the Kerbal (as the hitchhiker compartment has no control function, and there was no other manned control module), had coverage issues as it was naturally only at that moment noticed that the network of communication satellites around Kerbin had drifted completely out of their geostationary orbits and were all over the place. Due to these reasons it was decided to crash the station into Minmus, while the Kerbonaut made a risky descent with his jetpack. Upon touching down safely he embarked on flying over almost a quarter of Minmus\u0027s circle to the landed base...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Um69FMf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Um69FMf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...and had a rough, barely survivable landing due to running out of jetpack fuel - he overshot the base and tumbled along Minmus\u0027 surface for a kilometer, then had to walk that distance back to the base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, after a harrowing journey, the closest thing to home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HDy9hRk.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HDy9hRk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other part of the launched ship - the part with the three Kerbals meant to crew the base, has a problem where the pod applied torque to the right (of the navball, regardless of orientation, possibly a bug), and this malfunction made it impossible to land the pod on Minmus safely. It was decided to abort the mission, and struggling with the controls the pilot managed to send the pod back to Kerbin where they landed safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn entirely new and improved craft was built to repeat this ill-fated mission, and this time ended up being a complete success. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first ever space station - the cozy Minmus Orbital Lab \u0026amp; Aux Relay (as of yet lacking the lab part, but getting one attached soon):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HKieTNh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HKieTNh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the Minmus Polar Habitat got its crew, plus one extra Kerbal that fell from the sky on his own. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/m9v99Ym.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022m9v99Ym.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tower separated from the base to bring Jeb home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SxTxSOG.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SxTxSOG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PSNMmHZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PSNMmHZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb finally got to go home, and landed on Kerbin\u0027s south pole to do some further tests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lEoBlBc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lEoBlBc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for the tedious taks of bringing order to my not so geostationary satellite network. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TeddyDD","CreatedById":28806,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-18T01:42:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EToday I installed KSP on my Linux Mint and I\u0027m really happy that my mod heavy install works like a charm \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Performance is also better than in Windows version. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now I can finally start preparations to my great post Apollo \u0022Ares\u0022 Kerbin \u0026gt; Eve \u0026gt; Duna mission \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-18T01:55:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TeddyDD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TeddyDD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EToday I installed KSP on my Linux Mint and I\u0027m really happy that my mod heavy install works like a charm \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Performance is also better than in Windows version. \u003Cp\u003ESo now I can finally start preparations to my great post Apollo \u0022Ares\u0022 Kerbin \u0026gt; Eve \u0026gt; Duna mission \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022voyage\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see that!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
