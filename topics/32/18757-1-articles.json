When placing wings on an aircraft, for example delta wings, do i put one on each side, or can i make longer wings to add more lift? Because no matter how i design my aircraft, they always pitch forwards in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fuzzy Dunlop","CreatedById":27329,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-06T22:14:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf your planes are pitching foward it means the centre of lift is behind the centre of mass. You could put your wings futher foward or move heavy stuff futher back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbow","CreatedById":37863,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-06T22:18:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust keep moving the winds slightly forward or backwards until it feels more balanced. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe in 0.17 there\u0027s going to be a feature to help see the centre of gravity.
