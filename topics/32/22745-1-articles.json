I added it to my station, but cant seem to lock on it. Anyone know if this is a special use port or had any problems with it as well? It is not a stock port, It came from a download called Kerbal SP Stations. Appreciate any help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img809.imageshack.us/img809/2186/4182013111631pm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224182013111631pm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
