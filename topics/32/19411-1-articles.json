I have two ways to do this and one of them is very boring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The \u0022boring way\u0022: Use the docking mod to get a single piece of scrap out there, say, a decoupler. Achieve a failing orbit, jettison the scrap, then achieve a stable orbit again. Watch scrap fall in, then decide course of action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The \u0022hilarious way\u0022: Ironically, this way is actually more fuel efficient, to a degree. Send small, unmanned ship to Jool orbit with a simple rocket docked to it (A small fuel tank and engine, one man capsule). Make second huge ship with large, powerful lander. Dock with the lander ship, move a kerbal into small ship. Disconnect the small lander from the ship and plunge it strait into the atmosphere. If lander meets a solid, landable surface, prepare main ship to land. If it simply explodes, record alittude and begin to lower orbit until one is dangerously close to the lowest levels, to check the effects of the atmosphere on a larger ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd no, there is no easier way to do this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny other way is not kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Trebuchet-Launch","CreatedById":29863,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-16T02:20:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am going with the \u0022boring way\u0022, except I plan to detach a backwards-firing engine from a proper orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-16T02:42:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could go with third option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The sadistic way\u0022: send smallest manned rocket to Jool and order him to land, sit back and watch the results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience takes sacrifices, preferably someone Else\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptRobau","CreatedById":41695,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-16T07:34:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJool has been confirmed to have no landable surface (at least not without making indestructable parts, but when you land it\u0027ll probably glitch). Also, once your inside Jool\u0027s atmosphere wouldn\u0027t it be really hard to control your altitude and live?

I think Neptune has the fastest, with winds over 1000mph. Do you we\u0027ll be finding similar winds on Jool? If so, I guess it would make the idea of using a parachute somewhat more \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Edifficult\u003C/span\u003E fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we have turbulent winds (meaning varying pressures), do you think there may be places where the pressures and temperatures of the gas coincide in a way that allows for bands/belts of liquid to exist? This would probably be excruciating to model, but I\u0027d love to find small, floating seas flying around in Jool\u0027s atmosphere, or just thin bands of liquid circling the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, my plan for Jool is going to be pretty boring. I\u0027ll likely go in for a descent that is as fast and shallow as possible. Or maybe I\u0027ll set up an orbit, and gradually lower the orbital radius whilst trying to pick up speed, just to get an idea of the numbers I\u0027m expecting to need when I properly explore the whole system. If I find that winds rip the ship apart, I might send another probe into one of the poles with a parachute; just for a calmer, more smooshy death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll send in one of my less favourable Kerbals though. For kicks. Joerim has let me down a few times recently, so err...sorry little guy.
