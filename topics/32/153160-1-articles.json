I searched for Kerbal Space Program. In the top 6 I found 2 apps promoting there the KSP app for mobile. \u00A0One had 1 star \u00A0but the one I was interested in was the one named Space Program Kerbal Edition. It has 80\u002B reviews with 4 out of 5 stars. First 10 reviews loved the game. I was about to buy it for $1.99 then noticed in one of the photos the mechjeb icon in a screenshot. Looking closer there screen shots of the pc\u00A0version of the game. Looking lower on the review list I see people saying the same thing, it\u0027s a fake KSP and a scam.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wanted to ask does squad know about this and are they doing something to stop it or have the apps removed. This gives a fantastic game\u00A0a bad name. Even more so to people that have no idea about the real game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you to Squad and Mod makers for there hard work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDark\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-07T20:15:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome aboard, and thank you for reporting that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s being discussed in another thread here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/152282-where-to-report-bootleg-ksp-versions/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTl;dr: Squad is aware of it and are handling it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll close up this thread.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
