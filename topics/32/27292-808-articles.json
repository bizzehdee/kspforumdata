My calculations for the craft\u0026#39;s desired wing loading said \u0022make the damn thing longer\u0022, so I stretched it out to 29 meters in length and was able to put on a set of crooked arrow wings that gave it a 0.5 t/m[sup]2[/sup] wing loading, and did a test run. Plane flew reasonably well; I hadn\u0026#39;t put on any main wing surfaces so I had the elevators on double duty for the test. Got her going a bit too fast in the 10-14k regime; she ultimately cooked herself. Tonight if I find time I\u0026#39;ll try to add finishing touches to the plane and see how she handles a test flight.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter that (thirty minutes all told) I went back to my career save. With the [I]Albatross II[/I] not ready for deployment yet, I opted to send a [I]Vulture[/I] refueling plane to Kerbinport. Take off was serendipitous - I managed to get a 1.6 kilometer rendezvous with the station prior to the plane\u0026#39;s normal circularization burn (i.e. before the plane reached apoapsis), so I circularized and killed my relative velocity to the station at the same time. First time I\u0026#39;ve ever pulled that off - and I probably couldn\u0026#39;t plan to do that again. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/u5ZqOyy.png[/img][/center]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI was able to dock up immediately, and transferred sufficient fuel to refuel the tanks of [I]Enola Gay[/I] and [I]Project Peacock[/I] both docked at the station. [I]Enola Gay[/I] departed for Mun with Cerxie at the helm and tourists Neillong, Eldorf and Arissa aboard; she arrives in another day or so. Excess fuel was drained from the [I]Vulture[/I] into the station\u0026#39;s holding tank and the plane was sent back down to Kerbin, successfully landing at KSC with no issues.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith a crew to service on its way and with Munport still not full of fuel, I decided to send Theogel and Verise back to the Munar surface to pick up an additional load of ore for fuel processing. Landing near the Munar mining rig was successful (with no real issues for once) and their [I]Wildcat[/I] lander was completely refueled from stores still on the surface. The game crashed on me as I was sending Verise out to unhook the Wildcat\u0026#39;s winch from the mining rig, so I\u0026#39;ll have to wait until tonight to see if that has set me back any at all. Tonight will be the last time I know for sure I\u0026#39;ll be able to play KSP for the foreseeable future, so y\u0026#39;all know I\u0026#39;m wanting to wrap up a few things if I can...\n"},{"CreatedByName":"McKerbin","CreatedById":83197,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T14:54:04Z","Content":"\n*Slight* miss-calculation with Sepratron placement...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/pxAQoST.png?1[/IMG]\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Workable Goblin","CreatedById":153289,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T15:27:21Z","Content":"\nI did my first aerial circumnavigation of Kerbin the other night.

At one point I was literally a few meters away from the ground at a few hundred meters per second, but fortunately I managed to pull up in time. After that, I took over the approach myself and flew straight in to the runway, though I approached too fast (I had forgotten to put airbrakes on) and overran. I was barely able to stop before I went in the water.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIs anyone else a little frustrated that there\u0026#39;s no explicit indication of when you\u0026#39;ve touched down in game, not even something like tire squeal?
