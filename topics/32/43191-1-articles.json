Discarded stages around Kerbin, an entire crewed fracking rover that failed a Duna intercept, four kerbals on it, can\u0027t thrust on the landing rockets without the whole thing going crazy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, my Munbase supply/crew exchange design tends to use the transfer stage as a door knocker. It runs out of fuel and gets jettisoned during the final retrograde burn before landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt amuses the hell out of me to imagine the situation in the bases. Silence, silence, WHAM KABOOM, silence, silence, THUD.
