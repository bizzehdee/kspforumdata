However, asides the green skin, I can see a disturbing parallel between Kerbals and the Orks of the Warhammer 40K universe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee, Orks are widely renowned to be thick as two short planks. Brutal, nasty and downright proud of it too. However...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...they are also possibly the most powerful psykers in existance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe phrase that a million Games Workshop geeks will tell you about orks is that \u0022red ones go faster\u0022. Actually in Orkish it would be something like \u0022RED WUNS GO FASTA\u0022, but the effect is the same. And, as far as ork technology goes, if you paint a vehicle red, it really will go faster. Why?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, the orks have seen the Blood Marines, with their red uniforms and vehicles whizzing all over the place. For some reason, that association stuck, so if an ork wants to build something fast, he paints it red. It works because, well, as mentioned, orks are the most powerful psykers in existance and don\u0027t even know it. Red ones go faster because they will them to go faster, and therefore \u003Cem\u003Ethey go faster\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompare and contrast this with the Kerbals, who are successfully managing to explore the outer reaches of the Kerbol system with buckets of bolts, stolen swimming pool frames and junk found at the side of the road.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre Kerbals actually incredibly powerful, reality-warping psykers who can bang a few tubes and some explosives together and say \u0022that\u0027s a rocket\u0022, and thus will it to be so?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T13:28:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think they work abit like Evolution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust slap on parts and see if it works\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T13:35:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdd that Orks breed like fungi which would explain the apparent immortality of kerbals and you have me sold on the relation.
