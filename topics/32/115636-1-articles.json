Think about it like this, no human has ever traveled farther fr om the earth than the far side low lunar orbit of the apollo missions, a week away from earth.

A Mars mission to a returnable mienos would take 2 or more years, you prolly could do a venus flyby in less time but such a mission is pointless. A mars landing mission proper assuming that fuel could be synthesis on Mars would take a decade. A ceres mission might take 5 years, but current rockets lack the effeciency to execute a direct hohmann transferi, landing, and direct hohmann return. So realistically we are prolly talking abou a 15 to 20 year mission with of Pe-gravity boost on Mars and earth to to get there and back. This mission is currently not poosible for biological reasons. The currently propsed mars missions are all suicide missions.
