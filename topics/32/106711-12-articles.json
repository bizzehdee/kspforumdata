As before, the sensible way to take an SSTO interplanetary is to refuel it in LKO before heading off. This is no great hardship; if you can build an interplanetary SSTO, you shouldn\u0027t have any trouble building an SSTO tanker to establish an orbital fuel supply at negligible cost. A nuke SSTO refuelled in LKO can easily hold 4,000m/s \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV; design one to maximise tank capacity and it shouldn\u0027t be hard to hit 6,000m/s or more.\n\nSSTO still works just fine.

You can\u0027t make orbit with less than 0.5 TWR, and then only if your atmospheric climb is perfect and you leave the air at least at 1,200m/s with a high climb rate (300m/s or higher). And when you go very low TWR, you will waste a huge portion of your delta-v to gravity drag losses anyhow.\n\nUsing RAPIERs in LFO mode a tiny bit at the beginning of the push to orbit (400m/s would be more than enough to push your ap outside of the atmosphere and give you time to get orbital speed out of the nukes) will probably allow you much *lower nuclear TWR*, which in turn will allow *higher fuel fractions* in orbit, and thus *greater delta-V*. I\u0027d be surprised if a LFO-only design breaks 2km/s by much, just because they can\u0027t get enough fuel up... (the italics are meant to give emphasis to the critical numbers to look at).\n\nAs to interplanetary travel and SSTOs, the sensible-er solution is to go out with a proper IP ship, that was itself carried to orbit inside one or more SSTOs, those are my two cents. Wings are worthless when you are going to and airless planet!
