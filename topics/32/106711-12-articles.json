You can\u0027t make orbit with less than 0.5 TWR, and then only if your atmospheric climb is perfect and you leave the air at least at 1,200m/s with a high climb rate (300m/s or higher). And when you go very low TWR, you will waste a huge portion of your delta-v to gravity drag losses anyhow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing RAPIERs in LFO mode a tiny bit at the beginning of the push to orbit (400m/s would be more than enough to push your ap outside of the atmosphere and give you time to get orbital speed out of the nukes) will probably allow you much \u003Cem\u003Elower nuclear TWR\u003C/em\u003E, which in turn will allow \u003Cem\u003Ehigher fuel fractions\u003C/em\u003E in orbit, and thus \u003Cem\u003Egreater delta-V\u003C/em\u003E.
