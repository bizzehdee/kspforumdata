I stopped playing when I got to Minmus and everything further just looked like a linear progression of more parts, more docking, more fuel and more time acceleration to me. Which is boring to me. Why would I invest 100 times the effort just to go somewhere for science I don\u0027t need? Anyway I\u0027ve played 0.9 now. Several things are obvious to me, good and bad:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ethe good\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do like the additional progression options. Upgrading your different buildings seems like a really nice addition. I think the skill system is a sweet idea. This is rather short because I mostly like the potential these systems offer. Balancing is still off by a long shot but it\u0027s easier to tweak numbers than comming up with whole new game systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ethe things I don\u0027t like:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started on normal and find it super hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No maneuver nodes is a really hard limitation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI saw some pages earlier that \u0022You just have to learn the basic rocketry formulas.\u0022 and \u0022Just burn prograde when the moon rises.\u0022 and I feel justified to ask, is this even still a game? Is KSP a flight sim now? I mean yeah, learning about space and rocketry is cool but having to learn it as a basic requirement just seems off to me. Also, it\u0027s not like the guys at ...Space Agency didn\u0027t plan their missions. I\u0027m sure that a lot of calculations and course plotting went into each and every single mission ever. KSP currently offers nothing like that. Right now I feel like the target audience is supposed to be people who know the formulas and plotting software already and just play KSP because their new kernel is compiling or their new drone parts haven\u0027t arrived yet. Which is fine btw. I just feel left out. It\u0027s not a learning curve I\u0027d take on if I wanted to have fun anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- There is a very hard mismatch between the contracts you get and the parts you have available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m supposed to get someone to survey kerbin but have to do it with rockets instead of planes because... they\u0027re in the third (proper) science tier? How am I supposed to rendevous with a lost Kerbal without maneuver planning or at least target setting so I can measure my relative velocity? Imo you have to rethink the unlock progression, right now it makes no sense to me. There is also the fact that often you need to progress somewhere for a single part only very far down the unlock tree. It makes sense to have a progression for fueltanks, engines, science equipment etc. but why are docking ports, fuel transfer lines, and basic wings so hard to get? Or just wheels? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe contracts don\u0027t make sense in some cases. The easy ones are just not worth the investment anymore. If you can only take two contracts and your rocket costs 4000 or 5000 monies already, you\u0027re not going to take the one that gives you 2000 total. Also somehow \u0022splashed down\u0022 is somehow still a location to reach? It is it\u0027s own challenge to build ships in flight sim that destroys parts that fully submerge but I feel like that\u0027s something that could be left to sandbox mode. It certainly doesn\u0027t make sense for a space agency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the building upgrade limitations don\u0027t make much sense\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy is the mission control building limiting contract \u003Cem\u003Eamount\u003C/em\u003E but not \u003Cem\u003Escope\u003C/em\u003E? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy is the tracking center limiting my \u003Cem\u003Emath\u003C/em\u003E and not my... well... tracking? Upgrades could just scale down errors and make better estimates possible instead of unlocking the abillity to make any estimates at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe R\u0026amp;D lab should modify how effectively you can use certain experiments, not put a hard limit on how much science I can get or spend. If I get my 1000 science by going everywhere on kerbin by foot with a thermometer, that should be my decision, as opposed to deducting a comets composition by looking at it\u0027s trail or something else you\u0027d actually need a lab for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ethings that disappoint:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new build options aren\u0027t really that great.

I somehow set a thrust limiter that was holding up my rocket without realizing it. At any rate - at least to contribute here it all seems pretty interesting so far.
