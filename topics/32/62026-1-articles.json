It\u0027s not cheating, because you can do that math for yourself if you\u0027re good enough at it, but it\u0027s handy to have the computer do it for you as you tweak the design. Once you know that your vehicle has, say, 8000 m/s of capability, you just look at the chart that says how much is needed to get to the various places. Add in an emergency reserve, say 10%, and there\u0027s never a question of whether you\u0027ll have enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, all of my vessels can be refueled on-site as needed. I\u0027ve got fuel depots scattered all over the system, for when I want to go somewhere with a small vessel, plus several landed rovers carrying emergency fuel supplies for stranded vessels. For instance, I went to Laythe with a medium (23 tons) spaceplane that was nearly dry upon reaching that moon. It partially refueled in orbit, landed, took off, fully refueled again, then had just enough fuel to come home. If I\u0027d had less fuel, I\u0027d just have stopped a few more places along the way (like Minmus, Duna, and Pol). Of course, my latest spaceplane (34 tons) can go all the way to Laythe and back without refueling, but that\u0027s admittedly kind of overkill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, there\u0027s the Kethane mod. Use that, and it becomes trivial to make designs that can refuel themselves, no depots needed. I did a Grand Tour back in 0.18-0.19 this way, with my ~50-ton lander refueling itself at every stop. It takes a lot of work, since landing on specific spots to drill is a lot harder than the usual \u0022aim for a smooth area\u0022 method, but it\u0027s definitely not stock gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randox","CreatedById":18034,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T08:21:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESort of I suppose. I don\u0027t send unmanned missions first unless an unmanned mission is the point. I am familiar enough with data lookup and some of the calculations that I can be pretty certain that a ship can do something like return to orbit, and in cases where I am not certain (such as my upcoming flight test on Duna), I have a contingency plan laid out, and everything I need will be in the Duna system with me in the event a manned mission might become stranded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy biggest problem are design oversight and building flaws.
