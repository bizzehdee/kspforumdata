When I made it I was so proud of it, it might not be a looker but it was the first manned satellite I ever launched. However because of a weak system at the time, resupply missions became a real pain at 7FPS. I also knew it was going to be an FPS killer, but I intended to take off multiple parts like the side mounted \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E tanks, additional lighting and thrusters used for docking the bits of station together to help reduce part count.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the decision was made to abandon and de-orbit. The tug used to move it out of Polar orbit is still attached, it also contains the Quartermaster, Medic and Technician, the last three Kerbals running the station. With some carefully planned decoupling of the station, most of it burnt up. Only the command section survived re-entry and splashed down in the ocean where it promptly sent itself to oblivion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdmittedly there was no loss of life.
