I\u0027ve only been dabbling in KSP for the past few days after getting it months ago. I\u0027m not skilled enough to successfully pull off an orbit, even after four revisions of my ship\u0027s design, but I have had magnificent failures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first try, I forgot to separate the stages, so my parachute activated at launch. You can guess where that led to. But, since I had Jebediah on board, who everyone thinks is awesome, I decided to bail out. Among all the explosions and freed solid boosters, Jeb leapt out of the spacecraft and fell to the ground, bouncing and narrowly avoiding the destruction. He was unharmed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn my third try, I forgot to add radial decouplers to my tall boosters, so they were dragging me down. I decided to try an EVA report while my course was set to peak at about 30 km and then fall again. Jeb fell off of the capsule. He caught onto one of the still-burning tall booster, dragging it off course. The G-forces pinned him there for a few seconds, but when the ship started spiraling, he was flung off. He recovered, and used his jet pack to fly back to the ship, and, luckily, he managed to hold onto the spiraling capsule long enough to get back in. He detached the boosters, sending them off into space, and burned retrograde to slow his descent, and survived, landing in the middle of the ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am now a believer in Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShare your experiences!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T16:34:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA few minutes ago I was launching a rescue mission to save someone in orbit.

A large Mun base that would land itself prefabricated on the moon and then drive around to reposition itself. With the help of Kethane it may have even been able to perform a rolling take off spaceplane style an return to Kerbin. Disaster (read: girlfriend aggro) struck as it ended up descending a bit too early on it\u0027s approach to the large flat area I selected. It clipped the top of a mountain range and lost two of its 3 habitation modules, killing all 12 kerbalnauts aboard. After bouncing off the ground and back up into the sky (Would it still be \u0022sky\u0022 on the moon?) it lost a wing and yet another hab module that bounced a few times before finally exploding, killing another 6 brave crewmen. The 3 remaining pilots managed to set it down...roughly. It sat there on the mun broken into 4 pieces with a trail of debris stretching back nearly 2k to the top of the mountain. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA rescue mission was launched, which ended up failing thanks to a physics bug that cause it to glitch through the ground and then rocket back into space. This brings the death toll up to 19. The second rescue vessel managed to retrieve the 3 survivors of the initial mission, but sadly its parachutes were ripped away in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere killing them in addition to the three rescue craft operators; in the end the original mission had no survivors. The death toll now stood at 25. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ended up launching another Mun mission that was a much more mundane and and quite a bit less...deadly. The new base launched a two man rover team, which thanks to the kerbal attachment system now carried a mini autonomous rover with it. They were dispatched to look at the derelict and plant a flag at it\u0027s resting place. I stupidly used the mini rover to explore the the debris in more detail and eventually ended up driving into its open cargo bay (after trying to ramp myself over the robotic arm for 10 minutes) which somehow caused both the mini rover AND the cargo bay to explode. Which sent a flat structural panel flying and almost ended up destroying the manned rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENever went back there again. Part of me almost thinks the place was haunted by 25 Kerbalnauts who never made it home.

I ejected the smaller tanks that were attached to the pylons around the main fuel tank to try and free the main lander. Right at the same time, it ran out of power.
