When reloading the most recent quicksave, the plane was on the exact opposite side of the planet from where it should have been, with respect to KSC, as well as having zero velocity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI reloaded a previous save to avoid that problem, but I\u0027m curious what the nature of the bug could be. Did something about the coordinate system change?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
