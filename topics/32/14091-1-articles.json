But all I have to do is take off, keep Q held down, and it\\\u0027ll remain airborne indefinitely even without fuel. Depending on how careful you are, you can even make it gain height! This began as a lark, but I wonder how far it could be taken... is it possible to build one that remains stable? Is it possible to build one that gains height consistently? Is it possible to build one that is even \u003Cem\u003Esomewhat\u003C/em\u003E steerable, even though it must spin constantly?
