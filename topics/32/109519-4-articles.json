I am a huge KSP fanatic, and I have played for a long time before the most recent updated to 1.0 and the realism overhaul. First of all, you knew you were playing a video game that has been in alpha/beta for years now and knew that it could significantly change. For that reason alone, you shouldn\u0027t be so upset and biased against the 1.0 update. Secondly, Squad has talked for months about updating the core gameplay in this fashion to KSP, including change the functionality of ISP on engines, the atmosphere, re-entry and more. For that reason alone, personally I stopped playing KSP for three months and forced myself to literally \u0022forget\u0022 how to play the game because I knew things would be very different when I would come back....\n\nThat is what I recommend to you, OP. Do not quit KSP, especially if you find it fun and it makes you happy. Instead, **embrace what Squad has done and** **relearn** **the game**. What I recommend you do is do what I do. Start a brand new career mode with contracts and virtually no parts unlocked. From the very beginning you can get the feel for the new atmosphere by building small, rudimentary rockets. Start off small with experimental rockets and work your way back up to interstellar glory one rocket at a time. You will learn that launching rockets is not as simple as what you are thinking and is much different than what you used to be able to do. \n\nTurning your rocket at an angle is now much different, depending on the mass, velocity, and general aerodynamics of your rocket things are much different now. You must learn to crawl before you can walk. Haven\u0027t you ever built a model rocket and flew it? They don\u0027t fly straight. That is how KSP is. You have to use aerodynamic fins and have a proper center of mass for your rocket to fly. For example, if your center of mass is near the bottom of the ship, the rocket can get lopsided easily and flip over in flight. \n\nIf you relearn the game from the beginning you will understand the new aerodynamics more and more. Personally I think it was fun and invigorating to start the game over as an amateur again. Instead of being a master-level pilot that can visit the worlds of Jool and other planetary bodies I now struggled just to get off of Kerbin again. Seriously, relearn the game and have fun with it, you should enjoy learning and being new at the game again because it only happens once."},{"CreatedByName":"Landge","CreatedById":57671,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T05:48:11Z","Content":"Pffft farings.

I did a 90 degree pitch maneuver at transsonic speeds after turning off SAS and capsule torque and it still tried to pitch back prograde as soon as I stopped trying to steer. And yes, this was after the top tank had drained, so the center of gravity issue was about as bad as it\u0027s gonna get while you\u0027re low enough in the atmosphere for it to matter. The only ways I finally managed to get it to flip was by either deliberately mounting the fins too high or just removing them. I think you\u0027re going to have to provide more details in order for us to have any chance of reproducing this (us as in forum readers, I\u0027m not any kind of official representative).\n\u003E To be honest, both of those rockets had more control surface area than the rocket you described, considerably more in the case of the V-2/A-4.

Pretty much everything I have put up so far has been fine, and until now I had not really understood what the fuss was about. I decided I wanted to put a space station up as a single launch rather than sending it up a few bits at a time and constructing it in orbit.\n\nThe launch stage is a mainsail, and the upper stage is a poodle. Inside the equipment bay is a probe core and some batteries so that I can send it up unmanned.\n\n![goZLRJk.png](http://i.imgur.com/goZLRJk.png)\n\nThis thing went crazy wobbling about when it hit around 8 km at around 160 m/s. The first thing I did was to disable all the reaction wheels, using only the winglets and the engine gimbal for control. This reduced the wobble a fair amount, and it did flip out a few times, but I managed to get it into orbit, though it was 5 degrees off and needed some re-positioning up there.\n\nI then figured I\u0027d attempt to make it more rigid, so I put a bunch of structural girders on radial decouplers and strutted up the main structure. That would sort out the wobbles, but not the aerodynamic problems. I figured the root cause of the aerodynamic problems was that those AV-R8 winglets were just not up to the job of keeping such a large rocket under control I therefore replaced them with Structural Wing A and Elevon 1 for control, to give it better stability. The result was this\n\n![CRMhCUl.png](http://i.imgur.com/CRMhCUl.png)\n\nThe result was not pretty, but it went into orbit like a dream. I did my usual roll over 5 degrees at between 50 and 100 m/s, and fly it up with SAS off, controlling the ascent with the engine throttle.\n\nIn addition to the old KSP rules of \u0022if it moves when it shouldn\u0027t, add more struts\u0022 and \u0022if it doesn\u0027t move when it should, add more boosters\u0022, I think we need a new rule: \u0022if it points the wrong way, add more fins\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"little square dot","CreatedById":42920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T14:28:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E But they don\u0027t have to and people should really stop suggesting that.\n\nAfter giving 1.02 the ol\u0027 college try for the past few hours, I would have to agree.

Avoid excessively bottom-heavy designs. To steal someone\u0027s analogy, flying a bottom-heavy rocket is like trying to throw a dart backwards.\n\n2. Watch acceleration/speed carefully in the lower atmosphere. It\u0027s certainly not the MOAR BOOSTERS free-for-all that it used to be. Too much speed \u002B too much atmosphere = tons of drag on the nose and a very unstable rocket. Flipping often ensues. The terminal velocity ballpark is a good place to be.\n\n3. Use nose cones at the top, fins/winglets at the base, and restrict the number of radially-attached components used.
