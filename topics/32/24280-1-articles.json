For those of you who miss the KerbalSP stream and can\u0027t deal with it I have a temporary fix, I and many others have twitch channels, and we live stream KSP and many other games(DUH! that\u0027s what twitch.tv is for!), Oh but stop by my channel first \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.twitch.tv/ravis788\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.twitch.tv/ravis788\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OtherDalfite","CreatedById":8317,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-27T03:22:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe main reason there hasn\u0027t been a stream is often because most of the changes being made to KSP are behind the scenes, code stuff. I\u0027m sure the vast majority of the community would get bored listening to that. And you can\u0027t really show off code if it isn\u0027t finished. That, and I\u0027m sure the dev and community team has been busy catering to the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ravis788","CreatedById":37158,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T16:01:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E...thats why more ppl should stream, that was my point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
