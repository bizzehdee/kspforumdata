Docking position achieved, fresh food and clean underwear for all crew!\n\n![docking.jpg](http://i184.photobucket.com/albums/x61/ot0_m0t0/docking.jpg)\n\n![docking2.jpg](http://i184.photobucket.com/albums/x61/ot0_m0t0/docking2.jpg)\n\n![randevous1.jpg](http://i184.photobucket.com/albums/x61/ot0_m0t0/randevous1.jpg)\n\nEdit: jeah the robotics parts are modified for more bending, or extending of parts because originaly it took 9 or more hinges and that would lag the game too much."},{"CreatedByName":"koberko","CreatedById":6137,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-02T22:31:04Z","Content":"Damn you otO\\_moto!
