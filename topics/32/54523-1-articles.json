I loaded up my saved game but the kettle started to go off so I left to tend to it. One of my cats was sitting on my desk watching me. When the cat heard me in the kitchen he came running to beg for food. I think he may have run across my keyboard and hit F9 loading that old quick save which I made when I added the KAS mod earlier this month. He must have also hit the \u0022Windows\u0022 key which is why it was sitting on the desktop and not in KSP. Which made it look like a crash of some type. When I properly exited the game it saved that old quick save as the current save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I don\u0027t think it is a KSP problem like I first thought.
