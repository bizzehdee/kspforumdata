Forcing the player to play pure stock is like forcing the player to use mods. All of those who preach we shouldn\u0027t use MechJeb, how would you feel if they announced MechJeb is required to play career mode? Well that\u0027s how I would feel to learn I can\u0027t use mods for career. Everyone plays the game differently. I\u0027ve said it in other threads, and I\u0027ll say it here too. I find the flying part of the game boring. What I love the most is building awesome stuff, and seeing it work. And I can say I\u0027m having just as much fun as any of you is. My piloting skills are okay, but far from being awesome. When I build something, I wanna know what it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E capable of. And this is why I use MechJeb most of the time. Getting to visit other worlds with the rockets I conceived thrills me beyond imagination. If I had to do it all by hand, I\u0027d get really bored honestly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t want to use mods in career because you think only stock parts should belong there, why would you force everyone else to do like you? Letting people play the game as \u003Cstrong\u003Ethey\u003C/strong\u003E want to play it is the key to me. If someone wants to start career with an Orion drive, then good for him, it\u0027s not affecting my career mode in any single way and I couldn\u0027t care less.

This way, mods will have a logical progression pattern set by the modder so that parts unlock at different steps through the career, preventing your game to be overpowered from the beginning. This could also find itself in the cfg file of the part, so everyone could modify it according to what \u003Cstrong\u003Ethey\u003C/strong\u003E want and on how \u003Cstrong\u003Ethey\u003C/strong\u003E want to play the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SleepyWacKo","CreatedById":72826,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-11T20:26:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022OtherDalfite\u0022 data-cite=\u0022OtherDalfite\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E You shouldn\u0027t need an autopilot to enjoy the game.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewho are you to tell someone how they should or should not enjoy a game? maybe you shouldn\u0027t need manual control to enjoy the game?.

The devs aren\u0027t developing with the focus of making mod compatible in every way. They\u0027re developing the game to make it work as they plan it to. It\u0027s then the job of the modding community to accommodate to the work of the devs and the game\u0027s format. When Career comes out, it might indeed have a different save format than sandbox.
