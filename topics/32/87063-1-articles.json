I gave myself plenty of fuel in the transfer stage, got to Duna and even got some science from around Ike on the way. Landed on Duna, took off, re-docked with the transfer stage, got back to Kerbin... everything was fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m coming in to land back on Kerbin. The transfer stage has a lot of fuel left, but I eject it because I don\u0027t need it. I\u0027ve got some fuel in my lander, and of course the chutes will take care of most of it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here I am in the terminal phase. Nothing left to do but deploy the chutes. No problem. I glance at the chute icons as I hit Space to stage. Hmm, that\u0027s weird. They\u0027re red. Red... red... what does that mean? Oh, that means they\u0027ve.... \u003Cem\u003Ealready been deployed.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat? I didn\u0027t deploy them, except... back on Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EI forgot to repack my chutes after I left Duna. \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am now about 7,000 meters above Kerbin\u0027s hard surface with no chutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first thing to do of course is panic. I\u0027m playing career mode on Hard... there is no revert, no quicksave... the only thing I can do is land under power and hope I don\u0027t screw it up. Thankfully I had transferred some fuel out of the transfer stage into the lander... I always like to have a little extra, mostly for braking, but some just in case. This is the \u0022just in case\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wobbled a lot, but some how, miraculously, stuck the landing under power with no chutes, and didn\u0027t even break a landing gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHard mode is fun... it\u0027s scary situations like this that make it great. Whatever God rules over Kerbin, he was watching out for me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1CinOFW.png\u0022 alt=\u00221CinOFW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T09:59:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Kraken is Kerbin\u0027s god.
