I feel like a little bit of a community outsider, as I was new to the game at the end of last year, but over the last month I\u0027ve been trying to update some of the Wiki\u0027s most lacking pages, hear and there.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter seeing an edit to the \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Mobile_Processing_Lab_MPL-LG-2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMobile Processing Lab page\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E (by\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003E@EsterbanLB), I realised how wrong/outdated much of the info there was, so set about rewriting or adding it. I\u0027d appreciate any suggestions of major things I\u0027ve overlooked, or mistaken. One part I made from scratch is the engineer level research \u003C/span\u003Erates table (as shown below). I just made careful observations, so I\u0027m a little wary that it might not be \u003Cem\u003Eperfectly\u003C/em\u003E accurate to 3 significant figures, and I certainly don\u0027t have a nice neat equation to explain the numbers, either:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022i1goiX7.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://imgur.com/i1goiX7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve made major edits to a bunch of other pages, including the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Experiment_Storage_Unit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eexperiment storage unit\u003C/a\u003E, all the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Radiator\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eradiators\u003C/a\u003E, and have also been trying to resolve all the thermal behaviours of the drills and convertors (wondering about heat management at different engineer levels, etc, as \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/157787-how-are-thermal-mechanics-modified-by-engineer-level-trying-to-pin-it-down-for-wiki-particularly-drills-asteroid-harvesting/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EI asked about here\u003C/a\u003E). But I thought the MPL was a fair place to start trying to solicit some sanity checks, for a start. I hope I\u0027ve not bulked out the test tooo much, but this part has a particularly large number of features and nuances.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
