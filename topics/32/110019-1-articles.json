The following craft needs to enter a shallow dive to 10km once it gets to 13.5km in order to build up enough speed to punch through the sound barrier. Once it gets going about 475m/s it\u0027s like a bat out of hell, though...\n![3QdgJt5.png](http://i.imgur.com/3QdgJt5.png)\n\nE: OP, it\u0027s Enhanced Navball.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T01:10:35Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 01:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by regex**"},{"CreatedByName":"NikkyD","CreatedById":97466,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T23:45:44Z","Content":"Rapier with 1 ram intake should give you at least 1400 m/s at a bit over 20.000m.\n\nOfc it depends on the rest of the plane how much you can achieve."},{"CreatedByName":"Sufficient Anonymity","CreatedById":57923,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T23:52:57Z","Content":"Yeah, to follow on from regex on this one, they\u0027re not bugged - they are different, though that\u0027s rather to be expected, with the different aerodynamic model and a change in how jet engines work.\n\nDue to the interaction between volume of air passing through and thrust, it\u0027s possible to get stuck at around 400m/s if you just have Rapiers. But you never *just* have Rapiers - you\u0027ve always got gravity, and if you get stuck in a bit of a rut when accelerating, a bit of a dive then pitch up works wonders.\n\nLike regex, I climb hard (45 degrees plus, depending on the craft) to around 10km, then level out, possibly putting in a little descent at around the 12km mark.
