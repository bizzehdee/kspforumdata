Ships that are only moderately heavy can no longer be supported by the heavy-duty landing legs, and will end up leaning or squished down sitting on their engines. Any designs you had that used surface docking sitting on these legs will no longer work because the ship can end up at any height or angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPLUS, if you open up an old save file, all the landing legs on all your ships will appear in closed state, so your bases and landers will fall to the ground and possibly topple over and break when you focus on them. And the landing legs may be insufficiently strong to lift them back up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorkarounds for the lack of leg strength include putting truss or girder segments under your ships to protect your engines and get a fixed height once your retract your legs (great...we get to add even more parts to our ships). Or you can mess with the config file...but if I wanted to play with modded parts, I\u0027d be doing that already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the shock absorbing feature, but I really wish the legs were stiffer (so my engines won\u0027t get crunched) AND that the hydraulics would push the legs back out to maximum extension after landing so we could know what height they\u0027ll end up at.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TMS","CreatedById":57134,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T17:11:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should be able to force the shocks into a fully-extended and locked position.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T17:16:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s going to require design changes for most of us.

A kerbal could walk under it before. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me, the biggest issue is with imported saves. The new landing legs use a \u0022LadingLegModule\u0022 element in persistence files that doesn\u0027t exist in older vessels, but is generated when the ship loads. If you have bases that are being destroyed by retracted legs, you /might/ be able to copy and paste that element in. Tedious, a bit.
