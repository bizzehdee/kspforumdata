The first step is always to calculate maximum depth, calculate minimum depth (negative since above water), calculate depth at center of displacement, then calculate submerged portion lerping between max depth to CoD to min depth. Then, if the sine curve is used (default: true), feed that number into a sine function to get a nice curved, rather than linear, result (think of a cylinder hitting the water side-on, at first submerged volume increases slowly, then fast, then slowly again).\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T11:15:16Z","Content":"\nThis is very useful information for my mod, thanks Nathan!

I\u0026#39;ve tried every angle and speed on several different types of floats, but the water firmly grabbed all of them, albeit to slightly varying degrees. I came closest to a normal-ish water landing using wings as pontoons, oriented vertically, tips-down. The knife-edge approach worked ok, but I still came to a full stop within 30 metres or so of landing (at 75m/s). It also looked a bit ridiculous. Unfortunately it seems they forgot about surface tension when constructing the new model. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe strange thing is that there are stock seaplanes now, but even they don\u0026#39;t handle particularly well on the water.

I\u0026#39;m confident it\u0026#39;ll be fine-tuned eventually, but in the meantime I\u0026#39;m not really diggin\u0026#39; it. I had no problems ditching in the water with the old model, and far more success with floatplanes...not that I\u0026#39;m suggesting we should go back, but it just grinds my gear a little bit when I find myself having to work around new systems. Given that KSP is predominantly a game about flying things, one would think that a new buoyancy model would be a bit more geared toward aircraft that play on the water.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"little square dot","CreatedById":42920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T19:27:16Z","Content":"\nGood gravy...

I was advised to come in faster, but quite honestly it doesn\u0026#39;t seem to make a difference. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;ve tried all manner of approach speeds, from ludicrous to stalling as I contact the water, and it\u0026#39;s always the same result. SPLAT! \u0022We\u0026#39;re somehow OK!\u0022 \u003Cbr\u003E\nThe plane lands intact, although I\u0026#39;m not quite sure how it remains in one piece considering that the entire landing covers about 10-20m of water, if that. Sadly it\u0026#39;s about the furthest thing from realistic landing physics, and while the old buoyancy model was just plain weird and took forever to figure out, the landing physics were a million times better, so long as your aircraft was equipped to land on the water. The old water seemed to have plenty of surface tension, perhaps too much actually, but I was able ride out the first half of my landings on the backs of my pontoons, gliding across the surface and gradually settling down in a reasonably realistic manner that was quite satisfying.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe new water seems to lack surface tension, making it incredibly awkward to land on in any sort of a half-way smooth manner, and on the flip-side it\u0026#39;s far too forgiving with aircraft. I mean, I shouldn\u0026#39;t be able to touch the water at or above 100m/s for starters, and if my aircraft decelerates from 70m/s to 0 over a distance of 10m, I should probably to be doing a front-flip...and if I do a front-flip, my aircraft should probably be damaged. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote]\u003Cbr\u003E\nSeaplanes touchdown at about half the speed of what you described.

The aft end of the pontoons make contact first, and the surface tension allows you to skim along with your nose slightly raised until you\u0026#39;ve bled off the lion\u0026#39;s share of your speed. The plane doesn\u0026#39;t come to rest on the entire pontoon until you\u0026#39;re taxiing, essentially. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn KSP on the other hand, your pontoons immediately catch once you touch the water, and it\u0026#39;s simply not possible to ride out any portion of the landing on the backs of your floats. Well, it hasn\u0026#39;t been for me anyway, and I\u0026#39;ve seen quite a few videos of people having similarly sloppy landings.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, seaplanes can\u0026#39;t reasonably be considered a floating object until they cease generating lift and settle onto the water...which doesn\u0026#39;t really happen until the landing is all-but complete. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0026#39;s all about that surface tension my good man.

But that would make problems in-flight. My recollection is that the Apollo CM used an offset CoM to slightly angle the heat-shield during re-entry, allowing a roll to steer the capsule. Up until CM/SM separation, a slightly offset SM CoM could compensate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut which direction should you move the CoM or center of buoyancy in?.
