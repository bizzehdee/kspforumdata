The parts are all very well-balanced, stat-wise; they\u0027re not any more efficient or powerful than existing stock parts. Basically, each size category will have three options: a high-efficiency, low-thrust engine for orbital work, a low-efficiency, high-thrust engine for launches, and a workhorse that falls in-between. The stock rockets basically fall into that third group, so at first it might appear that the KW parts (especially the high-thrust sets) are too good, but you\u0027ll quickly realize that having high thrust doesn\u0027t mean much when you run out of fuel too soon. The KW 3.75m tanks are absolutely essential for heavy-lift designs (including space stations), not because they\u0027re inherently better, but because it keeps your part count low enough that the game engine doesn\u0027t choke; each large tank can replace three or four of the stock oranges. And it\u0027s really nice to have more SRB options than just the two stock types.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
