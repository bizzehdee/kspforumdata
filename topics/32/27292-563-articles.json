The electronics include a Karbonite resource scanner, a ScanSat SAR (hi-res terrain) mapper, a ScanSat Multispectral (biome\u002Banomaly) sensor, and a thermometer for completing science missions. The Gilly variant includes a gravity sensor as well, since the thermometer limit there is too low for safe orbits, but the rest of them all use the same basic design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best part is that it fits inside a half-length Mk2 cargo bay when stowed, so I can launch it with my light (10-ton) Dinky Weasel-class spaceplane.

This trip to Minmus was without using the ion engines, but with the xenon tanks still filled. I mainly wanted to see if I\u0027d forgotten anything in the design, like the time I forgot to install batteries on the fifth generation of the design.
