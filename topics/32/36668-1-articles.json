Its mission was to rendezvous with my Space Station over Duna (13 Kerbals), get the crew of the station off and land at Duna Base Alpha; their permanent home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe redesign I did for it (which I hoped would work) was have the main engine (a Mainsail) pop off with a decoupler, including the Docking Port, when MechJeb\u0027s Landing Autopilot spun me around for my atmosphere entering breaking burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing with MechJeb went OK. But then when I popped all parachutes at 110m/s which I normally do for my Rover/Lander combos on Duna (and works no problem), the rocket seemed heavier on one side and light on the other, even though I had parachutes to hopefully balance the landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to disengage Landing Autopilot and land it myself, since it failed twice to do it automatically.
