They are beautiful parts that will fit nicely within the game. However, I feel as though the wings and control surfaces that we have now are a little too small for large/long-range spaceplane configurations using mk3 parts. Using the wings we have now, it seems that a truly large number of parts are need to produce a really good amount of lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally like using spaceplanes for long range heavy lifting on Kerbin, and having a high part count can be a pain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone else feel this way?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
