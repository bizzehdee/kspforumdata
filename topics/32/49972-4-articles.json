Which means that even the perfectly normal and acceptable large center stack with two narrow solid boosters gets penalized.\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to use aerodynamics to kill asparagus staging (it probably won\u0027t, but it could probably kill the multi-layer asparagus abuse), then model aerodynamics to do so, don\u0027t hack up something because you don\u0027t like it. It reminds me of the old Star Trek roleplaying game, where they actually had rules for dual-wielding weapons that didn\u0027t restrict the rules to melee weapons, they just said \u0022Sulu would never consider using two phasers at the same time.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMass that a 7 stack 3.75m asparagus cluster wouldn\u0027t notice would be enough to ground my little Mun lander that only uses fuel lines to suck fuel from radially mounted tanks because without them, it would be too tall to land safely. Having different fuel lines (with differing masses) for different fuel flow amounts is just adding complexity to the game that would affect most designs just to stomp on one class of design, but at least it would have fewer negative consequences other than the complexity itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s really these kinds of unintended consequences that you have to watch out for with ideas of how to limit asparagus staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I think of wild aspargus use its stuff like my 16 stage Jool lander who is totally unrealistic. The three stage 6\u002B1 mainsail default will thrive well, you will probably need to switch to the radial separator without spacing and use more seperatrons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you say lots of legitimate use of fuel lines. We also use fuel lines between tanks to regulate fuel drain. An jet fighter on an long range bombing mission might carry 3 drop tanks and first drop the outer tanks and then the center one, however this is done with switching the tanks to drain fuel from. In KSP we would have to draw fuel lines from outer tanks to central and then to plane unless you want to transfer fuel manually who is very hard during takeoff and landing at least unless you let mechjeb do the flying. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy standard Mun lander to do science missions to Mun has two drop tanks who take it from LKO to deorbit burn. Yes I could have uses an transfer stage but I save 0.5 ton on using the 909 in the lander. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for using two pistols at the same time, it don\u0027t work in real life at least not outside an circus show.

The shuttle was described as the most complicated machine man ever has designed, so naturally many things can go wrong. The Soyuz is dead simple. Just short of point and fire actually. Its a good work horse that has redundancy. So it is no surprise that Soyuz 5 survived a disastrous fall from space while the shuttle lost some wing tiles and disintegrated (I know it isnt right to downplay it, but I am describing the complexity of the Space Shuttle right now) I would rather have a sturdy and reliable workhorse of a craft then something that has a million and one ways to fail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t get me wrong, I have full faith in the engineers working at and for NASA.
