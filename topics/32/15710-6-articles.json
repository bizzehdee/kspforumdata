However let me warn you of a mistake most people make when they attempt this method: Many people assume altitude is the same thing as orbital radius. However its not. in order for you to derive orbital radius from altitude, you must add the planets/star\u0027s radius to the altitude to get orbital radius. After you convert it to orbital radius, you then can multiply the number by .63 or 1.59. (you\u0027ll understand that multiplying part once you read the guide) Remember that once your done multiplying, you need to convert it back to altitude so subtract the product by the planet/star\u0027s radius to finally get your starting altitude.
