I may be wrong on many accounts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as I can tell those PNGs may be uncompressed. I may be wrong though. You can compress a PNG but don\u0027t have to. Loading lots of images that are compressed takes more CPU cycles than loading uncompressed images. This is true for anything including graphics programs such a Photoshop. JPG compression is very efficient and compressed JPGs are the fastest to decompress but they have compression artifacts that makes them unsuitable for texturing and game graphics. PNG also uses something called lossless compression which preserves the quality of the original image. So even if compressed, PNG would still be a better choice when quality is desired. JPGs use lossy compression that degrade the image.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and the big one: PNG supports transparency while JPG does not. One more reason to use it for computer game graphics. This and quality is probably why the are the choice for game graphics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce an image is decompressed and loaded to RAM it takes the same amount of RAM whether it was originally compressed or uncompressed before as a file on the disk. So changing image file format will not save any RAM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then video cards (GPU) use texture compression when textures are loaded to their VRAM which I know next to nothing about. Textures are loaded to video card\u0027s VRAM not the host computer RAM and things like GUI graphics, loading screens are loaded to computer RAM. Textures are many and larger than misc game graphics so there is no need to worry about game graphics. .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth textures and game graphics are not necessarily loaded to VRAM and RAM for the duration of the game either. Unused textures and graphics are flushed when used infrequently. The game does that depending on available GPU VRAM. That\u0027s why video cards with more VRAM are often faster because there is less texture loading and unloading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there is the DDS compressed texture format which is decompressed by the GPU, not CPU. This makes decompression faster as there is less data to read from the hard drive and video cards (GPU) are a lot more faster at decompressing this type of file than the CPU as the format was specifically deigned to be decompressed by the GPU. DDS is proprietary Microsoft file format for Direct X textures. You wont use DDS for things like GUI graphics, it is specifically designed for textures and GPU decompression. Compression process lends itself to massive multi-threading. CPUs are poor at compression because they have fewer cores than GPUs that may have thousands of cores. Even though Hz by Hz a GPU may be slower than a CPU, the massive number of cores make GPUs monsters of compression and decompression.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can\u0027t replace PNGs with DDS then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, I believe games and mods reference graphic files based on their name. If they can\u0027t find a samplefile.png bad things will happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bottom line is that there is more risk in messing with game graphics that there are chances of any performance gain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-28T16:23:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223229608\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022168001\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221511822902\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022176735\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jesusthebird\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 hours ago, Jesusthebird said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni downloaded \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E and noticed they use a PNG image file. guessing its for the GUI or toolbar icon. anyways, im wondering if KSP automatically knows how to treat all image file formats?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, what \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/170602-kerbital/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022170602\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/170602-kerbital/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Kerbital\u003C/a\u003E said above, with respect to .dds files being better for in-game textures than .png files are.\u00A0 As for GUI graphics like toolbar buttons...
