They said literally: We have a million lines of code to get to the moon, and when we are there we\u0027ll have a million lines more.\u0022 I also like the comparison Neil DeGrasse Tyson made between the Soyuz and the Space Shuttle. The shuttle was described as the most complicated machine man ever has designed, so naturally many things can go wrong. The Soyuz is dead simple. Just short of point and fire actually. Its a good work horse that has redundancy. So it is no surprise that Soyuz 5 survived a disastrous fall from space while the shuttle lost some wing tiles and disintegrated (I know it isnt right to downplay it, but I am describing the complexity of the Space Shuttle right now) I would rather have a sturdy and reliable workhorse of a craft then something that has a million and one ways to fail.\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t get me wrong, I have full faith in the engineers working at and for NASA.

However, in order to build up angular momentum in the rocket, you would need to eject the spent fuel out the side a bit. A good nozzle is designed instead to have the spent fuel all go straight out the back, since anything else wastes propellent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may have been breif but you were hardly consise. Outside of a vague description of an experiment involving effectively pendulum weights revolving around a common axsii; lacking conditions for the actual experiment or any published results. I fav to see how that link supports your statement. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m seeing is two parts if a system; a storage tank and the liquid inside. The storage tank is suspended and free to move. A pump is applying force on the liquid to rotate it in a clockwise direction inside the tank. This pump just be attached to the tank. IAW Newton\u0027s third law, if the pump is applying N force on the fluid the fluid must apply -N force on the pump forcing the tank to rotate in a counter-clockwise direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I\u0027m mistaken I will gladly accept correction, but I will not accept being insulted and told, \u0022because I / person said so\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-29T22:24:06Z\u0022 title=\u002210/29/2013 10:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by WafflesToo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nao","CreatedById":23462,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T22:43:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E...and then the high speed liquid hits a bend in a tube that tells it to move downward toward combustion chamber, we get back all the rotational momentum and we even get some thrust out of the moving fluid!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WafflesToo","CreatedById":71736,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T23:32:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nao\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nao\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...and then the high speed liquid hits a bend in a tube that tells it to move downward toward combustion chamber, we get back all the rotational momentum and we even get some thrust out of the moving fluid!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that is the piece I was missing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe funny bit is I came to that conclusion this morning and if you hadn\u0027t been rude about it I would\u0027ve recanted at about 9am my time. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nao","CreatedById":23462,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T23:54:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGlad to help. I guess in real rockets there are some things that may make the rocket spin, like the bell nozzle cooling exhaust or something like drains etc. The newest Falcon 9 did suffer uncontrollable rotation problem when returning to earth...
