So the polar Mohols are just the marks left where the lathe spindles penetrated. But the Kods got pretty much everything wrong with Moho so among other changes, they switched to metal for the other planets. This meant they had to reverse the layout where the bar stock met the lathe. They machined the pyramids into the ends of the bar stock and used lathe arbors that would grip them.
