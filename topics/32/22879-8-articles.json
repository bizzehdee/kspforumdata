Essentially, from what I can tell, if squad is lax about people sharing paid versions, then someone does a very large pirating scheme, which squad (or any sensible company) would want to stop, they will have a much more difficult time in court, because the pirate-er can claim that squad has not enforced their trademark/copyright (or something like that).
