Suborbital flights.\n\n\u002B Quick flight to destination\n\n\u002B Less demanding to landing site.\n\n- More expensive, expendable rockets, less refund on recovery.\n\n- Less precise.\n\n- Can\u0027t visit many places in one launch.\n\nWhat would you suggest? \n\nPlease, share your experience.\n\nP.S.

Make a two-seater jet with all the science equipment you got, take Jeb and Bob (a scientist) and start collecting science biome by biome. Works like a charm.\n\nEdit: so use the scientist to reset the instruments when landed, works much more efficiently than by dropping disposable science pods (though that sounds kinda cool).\n\nEdit2: also remember that you can drive jets just fine, which is especially good when visiting all KSC biomes. \n\nHowever, to reach the badlands and pole biomes by early-career jet is not really feasible: it takes ages to fly there. So for these ones you could build a rocket, maybe even one with a small jet strapped on top. But to be honest I have not bothered for the few science points that this would net me. Much better by then to fly to the mun or minmus."},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T14:29:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 3.
