First off, this is a really good game when played stock. What makes it a superduperliciously great game, is the modding community. All them mods is what makes this game shine. When the developers implement features that previously have been provided by mods, I have rather high expectations - because I think the game is so good. This especially happens when they implement stuff that previously has been provided by great mods, like FAR and DRE. Personally, I cannot fathom why you would want to play this game stock, when it is so much better with mods. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nHaving said that, I\u0027d like to point out that I really prefer when the developers implement stuff, even though it might have been implemented well in a mod. Mods are still bolt-ons, even though some of them are very pretty bolt-ons.\n\nSecondly, this is the 1.0 release. The game is supposed to be finished.
