The one that recognizes that the reader (in this case player) is equally important to the writer (Developer) in making meaning (and fun) out of a text (game). Or in simpler terms: there is no reason why \u0022The game is suppose to be played this way\u0022 is an inherently superior, or inferior, stance to \u0022the game is actually played this way.\u0022 \n\nI personally find that the very nature of sand-box gaming is that the ultimate judgement of the game tips to the second one: The developers create things with their specific uses in mind and then get to sit back and be amazed at what the community does with it. There are times and limits where change is required though. If one of the main appeals of a game is a realistic rocketry simulator then things which flagrantly break rocketry as we know it should likely be corrected. If it is impossible to model ion engines correctly and still make them fun then they likely shouldn\u0027t have made it into the game. Now that they are in the game though it would be very bad business to take them out.\n\nFrom what I\u0027ve read about Ions - the problem isn\u0027t so much with the thrust as with the comparatively tiny EC needs for generating that force. VASMIR and other theoretical engines run mostly into power generation and requirement difficulties. In that way Ions could just be a near future technology that Kerbals got to before us. It doesn\u0027t break my immersion in the game and it allows many people to have fun. The changes to their use so they aren\u0027t the ultimate win engine makes game-play more carried and therefore more fun (but I would like to see a stock propeller for EC atmospheric flight).\n\nAnyway, that is my two roots on the matter."},{"CreatedByName":"OddFunction","CreatedById":143805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T00:23:40Z","Content":"I can\u0027t be the only one who thinks the term \u0027narrow minded\u0027 being thrown around in a debate about video-game ion engines is hilarious, can I?...\n\n\\*Meets a wall of silence\\*"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T00:24:19Z","Content":"This discussion inspired me to rebuild my old Mun lander from 0.23.5.\n\n![ion_mun_3.jpeg](http://jltsiren.kapsi.fi/ksp/1.0/ion_mun_3.jpeg)\n\nSix ion engines, one big xenon tank, and enough fuel to land twice, rendezvousing with the mothership in between.
