I haven\u0027t been playing Kerbal Space Program recently due to a lack of interest and time, as well as various tech problems, but now that I have time and there is 64 bit, I can get back into playing it. The only problem remaining is interest, and probably \u0022noobishness\u0022 too. So, how should I get started again?
