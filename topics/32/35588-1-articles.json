(Atlas and Titan, as used in Mercury and Gemini, didn\u0027t use a roll program--I\u0027m not certain they even had roll control--and thus the launch sites had to be \u0022aimed\u0022 in the direction they were to be launched--there was a small crossrange capability, but not much, maybe a couple of degrees. This was because they were done to quickly get reliable ballistic missiles into service; later ICBMs had the same roll control as purpose-designed space launchers, because it meant that the orientation of the launch site wouldn\u0027t restrict targeting or tell the enemy what the missile\u0027s target was.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for direct-insertion orbital launches is, as said, most rockets are not equipped with restart capability, to save on complexity. However, if your upper stage is hypergolic, then you\u0027ll almost certainly *not* use the direct-insertion trajectory, as it\u0027s less efficient than a boost-coast-circularize trajectory, and with hypergols, you just need to be able to keep the tanks pressurized, apply ullage thrust (usually with tiny solids or RCS jets), and reopen the propellant valves to restart the engine. Indeed, the Space Shuttle used exactly that technique to reach orbit. (Originally, it actually launched on a half-rev suborbital trajectory, then did an injection burn of the OMS engines to raise apogee to the target altitude, then did a circularization burn, to make certain that the External Tank would come down where it was targeted. However, later missions, after they had a better idea of the ET\u0027s entry characteristics, launched directly to the target apogee, then did a single, slightly-longer circularization burn of the OMS engines, to get a bit more payload capacity, since the SSMEs had a much better specific impulse than the OMS engines.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the RSO, apparently the Russians don\u0027t put a destruct system on their boosters; their range safety package is merely an engine shutdown command so that it will fall in their designated impact zone--but even that is inhibited until T\u002B42 seconds, to try and make sure that the booster will not fall back onto the pad and thus require massive expense in rebuilding the launch site infrastructure. (As a side note, the shutdown command is incorporated into US range safety packages, too; arming the range safety package sends a shutdown command, and if that\u0027s enough to ensure that the vehicle will impact in the safe impact zone, the RSO may choose not to send the destruct command and instead let the vehicle fall intact, should it have something on board that would be more hazardous to have dispersed than allowed to impact intact.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T15:10:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter you clear the tower in KSP wouldn\u0027t it make sense to pitch east like 5 degrees?

Sometimes that ends with struggling to keep the rocket\u0027s nose pointed high enough against the horizontal relative wind. That\u0027s less of an issue if you maintain a good TWR and don\u0027t overdo the aerodynamic stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA perfect launch trajectory would include some immediate pitch, but the ideal angle is so tiny it\u0027s very hard to get it right by hand. Going straight up a few kilometers until the correct pitch angle is big enough to see costs almost nothing in delta-v, so most of us do it the slightly dumber and much easier way (though personally I find 10 km to be a bit much, 5 or 6 km is usually workable).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022\\\u0022 data-cite=\u0022\\\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E(Atlas and Titan, as used in Mercury and Gemini, didn\u0027t use a roll program--I\u0027m not certain they even had roll control--and thus the launch sites had to be \u0022aimed\u0022 in the direction they were to be launched...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost all guided rockets have roll control; even if there are no roll maneuvers it\u0027s necessary to prevent small aerodynamic or thrust asymmetries from inducing spin (just look at what happens in KSP with side mounted boosters and not enough struts).
