Just the way I prefer playing it.\n\nMods include:\n\nFAR, KAS, KIS, KOS, RT, KWR, MRS, KER, Alarm Clock, Procedural Fairings, SCANSat, SpaceY Lifters, Infernal Robotics\n\nThe biggest change for me so far is the rework of how engines work, with variable thrust and reworked Isp, throwing me back quite a bit working out the maths for the designs. Not complaining, mind you. It\u0027s a challenge but it was overcome once (pre-1.0.x) and can be overcome again. The rockets flipping over isn\u0027t much of an issue anymore, rather it\u0027s another layer of fun having to give the design more thought. A question though: Any documents you will recommend for figuring out the new maths concerning a realistic delta v calulation for launches as well as documents on good design principles?\n\nThe new maths also include how to work out the gravity turn (with FAR installed) for a particular design. Any suggestions on documents greatly appreciated.\n\nI guess that\u0027s it for now.\n\nOh, and how about you guys? Did it take long before you got back to it, launching without any major issues/worries?"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T14:17:47Z","Content":"FAR flies pretty much the same now than it flew before 1.0. Stock now flies pretty much like FAR flew before 1.0.\n\nThe one major difference that I found is that stock aerodynamics doesn\u0027t do well with low TWRs. My rockets simply don\u0027t fly straight up with less than ~1.5 initial TWR off the launchpad, no matter what. The exact same craft with more fuel in its tanks flies perfectly straight up with an initial TWR of 1.2 under FAR.\n\nBut for piloting, there should not be any practical difference between stock 1.0, FAR 1.0 and FAR 0.90. You put heavy things at the front, draggy things at the bottom, start your turn very early but turn only a little bit. Then switch SAS off and allow the rocket to tilt on its own, possibly reducing thethrottle if it tilts too slowly. You should be at no more than 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 by the time you pass 10km, but no less than 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. After you stage for the first time above 20km, turn SAS back on and finish the turn manually as required.\n\nHow soon you start the turn and how aggressively you turn depends on your vessel. The more initial TWR you have and the more aerodynamic your vessel is, the harder and sooner you need to turn. The less TWR and more unwieldly, the later and slower you turn.\n\nAlso similar to FAR in pre-1.0 is the amount of dV you need to orbit. It really depends a lot on your vehicle and your ascent path (even more now than ever before), but it\u0027s about 1000 m/s less for Kerbin as a rule of the thumb. So, aim for 3500 m/s to orbit. Your engines have less Isp but you need less dV, so the resulting vessel should be pretty much the same size and weight.\n\nAs for your final question: as a regular user of FAR, I had no problems adjusting to stock... except when 1.02 rolled around and I discovered that annoying low TWR issue. I\u0027ve since gone back to FAR because of it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T14:21:41Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 02:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"LN400","CreatedById":140595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T16:55:57Z","Content":"Thanks for the inputs.

For example, if KER bases the value off of the drag your vessel is experiencing, then there\u0027s a potential explanation: the \u0027sound barrier\u0027.\n\nThat term isn\u0027t just for kicks and giggles; going supersonic is actually really hard, because of a phenomenon called wave drag that starts in the transsonic regime. KSP never modeled wave drag in the past, but it does now with its new aerodynamic model. Wave drag will hit your vessel like a wall, clinging onto it, making every m/s further a struggle to achieve, and many early planes just couldn\u0027t do it. Hence, \u0027sound barrier\u0027. And then, after you manage to accelerate a bit further, it suddenly lets you go again. In fact, there\u0027s now less effective drag than even in the subsonic regime, and your vessel once more starts rushing forward.\n\nSo if you happen to be around 350 m/s between 8 km and 10 km, and drag experienced affects how KER computes and shows terminal velocity/atmospheric efficiency, then what you\u0027re seeing has nothing to do with altitude. It\u0027s just wave drag.\n\nEDIT: Curses, ninja\u0027d again!"},{"CreatedByName":"LN400","CreatedById":140595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T13:50:37Z","Content":"Thanks tons, guys, really appreciated.

Expecting it to stay perfectly immobile as it hovers up in the air is simply not viable. While gravity cancels out your upward thrust, there are no forces to counteract sideways \u0022slippage\u0022.

The same goes on with anything moving at speed insufficient for air drag/lift to start stabilizing it.\n\nThat\u0027s the explanation that logic dictates, but not actually a solution. Empirical evidence shows the following:\n\n1.) Build low-TWR craft in 1.00, launch it, it flies perfectly straight to 10km\n\n2.) Build same craft in 1.02, launch it, it significantly veers off course as early as 2-3 km up, even with fins present and SAS on\n\n3.) Install FAR onto 1.02, launch same craft again, it flies perfectly straight to 10km\n\nIf the cause for this issue was lack of stabilizing forces at low speed, then that means that something was changed in 1.02 that made rockets exceedingly unstable in comparison to other aerodynamic simulations available for comparison. There are clearly enough stabilizing forces available in the other situations. Why not in 1.02?\n\nSo, since I personally tend to favor low-TWR designs, I decided to switch to FAR, where those fly properly - much like in RL. But for someone who likes their rockets to leap off the pad like a bat out of hell (or an ESA rocket ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)), that would not be necessary, because those already behave properly in stock."},{"CreatedByName":"LN400","CreatedById":140595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T19:31:40Z","Content":"About aero modelling in stock vs FAR: I had to remove FAR for the sounding rockets. I\u0027ve read up on how the two mods don\u0027t play well together and I can personally vouch for that being the case. Stock, all fins work (balancing the rocket is another story entirely), in FAR, the fins don\u0027t seem to work very well, the small fin doesn\u0027t work at all. Another thing is, I\u0027ve read how people slant the fins for spin, to stabilize but here, in stock and in FAR alike, spins be it fast or slow do bugger all for stabilizing."}]}
