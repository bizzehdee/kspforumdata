They are put \u0022on rails\u0022 and their position is calculated from their orbital elements alone, which remain static. If you are in the atmosphere or throttled up, your orbit changes constantly because you accelarate. So there\u0027s no stable orbit to save the vessel to, or the result might be unexpected by the player. As in, if it allows you to switch vessels while burning your engines, people will start complaining that the inactive vessel doesn\u0027t continue the burn. Or that they switched back to a throttled up vessel when they forgot about that, and only notice it when they are already on an escape trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022about to crash\u0022 thing seem to need some improvement, but I guess the intention behind the design is that the save will not happen instantly and might take more than one timestep. So your craft might be saved partially assembled, partially disassembled. It would make a mess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems to all boil down to the fact that the game can only save and warp in a steady, well defined state.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lexif","CreatedById":65533,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-30T03:02:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo add to my previous post: I think there are only five ways to change the trajectory of your vessel. (Except for gravitation, which can be solved by direct calculations and doesn\u0027t require more complex physics.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-When you are in the atmosphere, its drag acts on you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-When you collide with another vessel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-When your own vessel disassembles, intentionally or not. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-When you are coliding or otherwise interacting with a planetary surface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Or by thrusting with an engine or RCS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly for those five events, the KSP engine requires the orientation of your vessel and the relative position of all its parts. For gravitational interaction, you only need the postion and velocity vector of your center of mass with current KSP physics. (No tidal forces.) I guess the \u0022about to crash\u0022 warning is related to a check that your trajectory is close to the possible surface of a planet. Consider that you might still crash into a mountain when you\u0027re on an upwards trajectory. You might have launched from a valley and could still crash into a nearby mountain while moving upwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Please correct me if I\u0027m wrong!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-30T03:14:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deadweasel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Deadweasel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou make a lot of sense here, except in one case to my mind:\u003Cp\u003EToday while moving a small dropship from point-to-point on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, I was slowly gaining altitude and moving laterally about 25m/s. Then I noticed the rover at my destination had gone dark, so I tried to switch to it real quick to turn the lights on, and was presented with the \u0022about to crash\u0022 message instead. Umm... I\u0027m on the upward arc of the flight in an airless environment. Bear in mind that the throttle WAS on at the time, but I got \u0022switch-blocked\u0022 because I was somehow \u0027about to crash\u0027 even though I was gaining altitude and nothing was in my lateral flight path. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was the event that got me thinking about other ways the game seems to be a bit irrational in how it decides YOU SHALL NOT PASS this time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you establish a low but long \u0022orbital arch\u0022, or did you just say \u0022okay I\u0027m going up.\u0022 Even without air, you\u0027re still going to fall back down (I also think the message is a bit dependent on altitude due to rails approximations).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore likely though, it is a safety feature; people probably don\u0027t realize how very little time they actually have before the ship starts to land, so it is better to prevent them from leaving the scene.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Cannot switch vessels while in atmosphere:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, likely a safety feature. if you get further than 2.5km away from that vessel, it\u0027ll get auto deleted.
