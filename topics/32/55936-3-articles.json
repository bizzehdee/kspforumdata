(Around 1:30 PM PST) the devs made a reference to a surprise and said we had to search for it but it\u0027s all over reddit so it shouldn\u0027t be hard. A viewer then posted a link to the Pcgamer article and they said with smiles that they couldn\u0027t say if that was the surprise or not wink wink. It may not be an official confirmation but it sure as hell confirmsit for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wheffle","CreatedById":74893,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T19:39:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FlamedSteak\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FlamedSteak\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI really hope they don\u0027t do multiplayer unless they have proven market rresearch it\u0027s going to directly translate to sales which will allow them to add other stuff.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d hate to see other features cut so 12 year olds can ram solid boosters with a probe core on top into other players space stations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is exactly \u003Cem\u003Ethe reason to have multiplayer.\u003C/em\u003E SRB jousting anyone?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI doubt they would make the game MMO\u0027ish, I was thinking it\u0027d be more like minecraft.

So... I say just render players at that location in all games and ignore the location of that planet/moon/thing. This means it might be day in my game and night in yours, and the planet might be in a different place in both our games. I\u0027m saying that just doesn\u0027t matter and I will show why I think so below. Lastly don\u0027t physically render players that are in any form of warp at all, maybe on the map if you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But that means I can\u0027t follow another player while they transfer burn\u0022 Nope, but unless your craft was identical you couldn\u0027t anyway.
