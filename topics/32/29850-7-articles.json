This is a game in development, with customers that have already paid for the game, and a general feature set that has already been publicly announced. If you want to keep stuff like merchandising, certain major developments like expansions or a detailed career mode layout, or the source code NDA, that\u0027s totally fine. All I\u0027m asking for is more transparency in a game development model that relies on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say you have to push resources back.

I still question why it\u0027s not the same version of the current retail and a much more (all things considered) stable version. That gives people all right to complain after playing the demo and deciding to buy the game. They weren\u0027t technically paying for the same game to begin with. That creates wrong expectations.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E \u003Cp\u003EYeah, I just got Ninjaed. I just disagree. I don\u0027t think it gives people little right to complain. 0.18.3 was built on a somewhat optimized build of a game that is in heavy development. When 0.20 came about there were big changes to the way the game works; that is why I suspect there are many bugs. When I bought the game 0.16 was around the corner. Remember that version had a pretty serious fuel bug that only required like 5 keystrokes to fix (I am exagerating, but it was a simple fix nonetheless) and yet we had to wait like 2-3 months for it to be fixed. I wasn\u0027t discouraged, I was annoyed or ashamed. I worked around it. I did everything full throttle and then later I installed the mod that fixed that issue. I was actually happy that I got to play with bigger parts and spaceplanes! I suspect it is similar to how people who play the demo now will feel. They go from a relatively stable but limited game, to a somewhat less stable but almost infinitely larger and more complex game. Is it annoying if it might be a little buggier yes. Would it suck if you are one of the few individuals who can\u0027t play the game OH YES. But C\u0027est la vie I say. I feel bad for them, but if the update worked for most people (as I suspect it did) and those issues are being worked on for 20.1 then I think it is a success.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RPharazon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RPharazon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI fully expect and understand that there will be bugs during alpha development. However, that \u0022just an alpha\u0022 argument loses a lot of its meaning when:\u003Cp\u003EThere are scheduled \u0027releases\u0027 instead of nightlies or stables.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESaid \u0027releases\u0027 have 1-2 weeks of testing by an apparently crack QA team supposedly hand-picked for bug-reporting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECustomers are kept in the dark about what exactly got fixed and detected by the QA team since the experimentals/internal bug tracker is kept secret and representatives (such as Skunky) tend to fly off the handle when said issues are brought up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnormous and apparently obvious bugs like the recent lander-can/cupola explosion issues, the lagtastic oceans, and mismatched terrain/ocean levels on Laythe were apparently glossed over in the QA periods, and then barely get acknowledged and are never mentioned until after they get fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransparency and just keeping people in the loop helps enormously. Stuff like Harv\u0027s recent \u0022we found what was making things explode, we\u0027re fixing it now\u0022 and \u0022the issue was fixed and was surprisingly easy once we found what was causing it\u0022 was well-handled.

There are some release schedules and such, and there is a test team, but as I am sure you are aware, this is because of the issues that used to happen before 0.15 came out in which people would get really antsy and disappointed when truly horrible atom bomb size bugs were released. Those are screened now. As far as the \u0022it\u0027s just an alpha argument\u0022, I am starting to think it is an oversimplification of what people mean. The point is that things are not only expected not to work, but expected to be fixed as well. The fact that Harv said, in effect, \u0022Yeh we gonna fix it\u0022 shows that they are working on the game.
