For one the graphic coding is going to need to be different. Next is what key does what, the keys have different names. They would also need some beta testers.(Unless they dual-boot Ubuntu onto their PCs even then, it helps to have beta testers. Linux support would take a while.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rich","CreatedById":17874,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-20T15:43:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HarvesteR\u0022 data-cite=\u0022HarvesteR\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m very happy that unity 4 will support Linux actually. A significant amount of KSP players are actually running it on Linux, using Wine. Having native Linux builds would be very cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really can\\\u0027t wait to see what Unity 4 looks like hands-on. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis addition to the unity platform is being discussed at the following link:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=14630.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=14630.0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
