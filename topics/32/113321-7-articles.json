BUT, the lander on other hand was pretty fine for the mun and minmus, but when i got to duna......\n\ni had 1200ish delta V to leave Duna and get back in orbit. under-engineered big time. I had to use monopropellant, i had to use ore, i had to pray to all god to make it to orbit. In the end it worked, but going that far with that little delta v was damn stupid...\n\nluckily, leaving from ike to kerbin wasn\u0027t too hard (takes what, 600 delta v?) and i managed to land it safely... but it was its first, and last trip for that lander."},{"CreatedByName":"SuperSecret","CreatedById":124519,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T19:33:01Z","Content":"I was planning to place a refueling station at Minmus, so I sent a probe to scan the surface for Ore.

I got into Duna orbit just fine, detached the smaller one, got the Ike lander into LIO, then landed the smaller one. This is when the trouble started.\n\nFirst thing I found was that neither of my landers had antennae, which was OK since I\u0027d be recovering them eventually, but a bit annoying. Then I found my larger lander only had two landing legs, and also had a radial monoprop tank covering half the science instruments. ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif) Definitely need to be more careful with the symmetry mode in the future...it also lacked any solar panels. Good thing NERVs generate lots of electricity...\n\nI did manage to set down the larger lander without using any legs, get most of the science I came for, and get it back to Kerbin OK though (it helped that the \u0022surface\u0022 temperature scans were actually altitude temperature scans, which saved a ton of fuel as I only really needed to land once). Bob\u0027s still stuck on Duna, waiting for a rescue mission, but was part of the original plan, anyway.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-12T07:38:43Z\u0022 title=\u002207/12/2015 07:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sidereus**"},{"CreatedByName":"mythic_fci","CreatedById":58577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T06:23:04Z","Content":"1.
