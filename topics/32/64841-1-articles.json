They can barely write let alone contemplate the concepts, dynamics and forces involved in playing this game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould probably not really have a clue what to do.. so I imagine they would randomly put a fail rocket together and it would fail.. there would be exceptions of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7-10: These players should be able to tinker around with it and actually have some fun, but I think most of them will still struggle to get any success (working rocket, safe landing, orbit, etc). That might cause some frustration which can be demotivating (or motivating for a minority), causing them to quit early.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese players would still have quite some fun making basic rockets and watching things go boom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10-12: I see this as the border between a bit too young and \u0027old enough\u0027. I think children this age will be better at learning, meaning they can climb that learning curve quicker. This group is probably also able to find information theirselves a little, vital to playing this game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese players would see the challenges and possibilities, motivating them to take the time to experiment and they would have a lot of fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13\u002B: If you are 13 or older you would (at the very least) be learning basic maths and physics in school meaning their brain is capable and trained better to learn these concepts. This group of players is old enough to be able to google(95% leads to a youtube video explaining things) and learn everything they need to know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese players (ranging from 13 to .. as long as you are sane) would be getting the most out of this, they see the challenges and possibilities and they have all the means to tackle them. This group can really put in hooooooooooours in this game and they\u0027ll love it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s just my rough estimate.. in the end, all players need to learn a bunch of stuff before they can play this game successfully. It wouldn\u0027t have mattered if I was 13, 25 (which I am) or 45. I had to look up a video about how on Earth I could get into an orbit, and how to rendez vouz, how to dock, how to do everything.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-04T12:41:10Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2014 12:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by sanoj688\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
