I\u0027m pretty new to the game so a lot of what I did here were firsts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission was to launch 3 kerbals to Mun, dock at my Mun-Station, land on Mun near a rover I previously launched, re-dock at Mun-Station to refuel, then return back to Kerbin! Simple right?!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, here is the ship ready for launch...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VPP0e1W.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VPP0e1W.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a steady trip and a quick alignment with my Mun-station, here is the slow and careful approach to docking..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/k7FDnWM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022k7FDnWM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving docked and refueled, I sent the ship down to the Mun\u0027s surface - aiming for my Mun rover. Initially I landed around 8km away, but a quick boost toward the rover saw me land under 1km away, then I switched to the rover to meet the two together. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/u5xDTYx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022u5xDTYx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it was time to leave the rover to continue... roving... and make way back to the station for last refuel before returning home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UiPIQx2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UiPIQx2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI felt a little sorry for the lonesome kerbal I had manning the Mun station, so decided to leave another kerbal with him to keep him company before returning the two other kerbals back home! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1kKanvs.png\u0022 alt=\u00221kKanvs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome back..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4mUfvoA.png\u0022 alt=\u00224mUfvoA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly, I\u0027m not too good at returning ships to kerbin, and ended up using a hell of a lot of fuel (seemed to just be going so damned fast the whole time!). Luckily when my parachutes deployed, the ships pod simply broke away, leaving the crew intact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/B2UszhJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B2UszhJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than the final landing, everything went smoothly. I\u0027m happy to say I had a complete round trip with a few stop offs, and didn\u0027t lose any crew, which is always a bonus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you enjoyed this as much as I did !\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kilmeister","CreatedById":65062,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T21:05:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had a similar landing on my first trip to Minmus last night. I didn\u0027t exactly have a nice reentry orbit... It was more of a smash-into-kerbin\u0027s-atmosphere kind of landing. Fortunately there\u0027s no risk of burning up in reentry as I hit Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere at a toasty 9000mph 80% angle. On the plus side I didn\u0027t need to use timewarping to get to chute deployment altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
