After a long time of not being able to get interplanetary encounters beyond getting lucky, I just sent an orbiter to Duna. Through the initial burn, and an adjustment when I was about midway there, I was able to get it down to about 5,072,000 meters. Still, when I got there, I had to burn off almost 1km/s delta-v, and I wanted to know if there\u0027s a better way. Should the encounter be from as far a possible, meaning slower speed and therefore less delta-v to burn off? Or try to get it in-atmosphere for an aerobraking maneuver?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s the latter, how? 5,072,000 was about as close as I could get it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"relicen","CreatedById":66077,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T23:47:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo get a really close encounter you may need to do adjustments on the way to your target.

The first two can be done anywhere, and are cheaper the further away you are. The other axis can only be fixed fully at an ascending or descending node:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom as far out as possible (i.e. once leaving kerbin SOI), try thrusting prograde and retrograde to get the encounter down to as low a value as possible.

Set your Duna periapsis to between 12,000 and 14,000m. This should aerocapture you into Duna orbit. Beware Ike encounters!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce aerocaptured, remember to burn prograde at apoapsis to raise your periapsis out of the atmosphere, otherwise you will end up landing, whether you like it or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe protractor mod is very helpful, because it will show your closest approach at any given point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T00:02:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI highly recommend using the protractor mod to plan your launch windows.

But realistically, your chances of getting the right height to aerobrake are not great (too low and you\u0027ll spiral in, too high and you won\u0027t get much of a slowdown and will just fly right back out of the SOI), so I only aerobrake once I\u0027m already in a stable orbit inside an SOI. Beyond that, there\u0027s not much difference; a far intercept requires less delta-V to decelerate into a circular orbit, but you\u0027ll then have to spend more velocity (almost exactly the amount you saved) getting that orbit down to a useful distance, unless you\u0027re trying to intercept one of the planet\u0027s moons or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn most non-aerobrake cases, what I\u0027ve done is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1\u0026gt; Aim for a very close intercept, as close as possible. I don\u0027t use mods to help calculate this, but it\u0027s not hard to get close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; Upon reaching periapsis after entering the SOI, decelerate until the apoapsis just barely stays inside the SOI, giving a very elongated orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3\u0026gt; Fast-forward to apoapsis, where your velocity will now be very low (less than if you\u0027d tried to circularize at that outer distance from the start). Do any major orbit orientation changes there, where it\u0027d take very little effort to shift from a polar orbit to an equatorial one. If you\u0027re trying to land on a body with an atmosphere, just burn retrograde a bit here to intersect the atmosphere; if it\u0027s airless, or you only want to orbit, then try to keep the periapsis barely above the surface/atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4\u0026gt; Fast-forward again to periapsis. Circularize as necessary by burning retrograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also use a little aerobraking in step 3 to save fuel in step 4; once you\u0027ve got that really elongated (but stable) orbit, lower the periapsis just inside the atmosphere. On each pass you\u0027ll lose a little orbital energy from the apoapsis, without having to worry about escaping if you don\u0027t brake enough.

(\u0022Above\u0022 and \u0022below\u0022 are defined using the right-hand rule, where up/north is the direction around which an orbit/object rotates in a counter-clockwise direction.) If you\u0027re trying to match an orbit, it\u0027s quite a bit easier (although often more fuel-consuming) to cancel out this inclination first by burning up/down at those locations, and then find the location on your now-coplanar orbit where a simple prograde/retrograde burn creates an intersection with the target. Besides being easier to plan, this also tends to minimize the amount of delta-V you\u0027ll need to expend at the target, which is important for objects with small spheres of influence (Moho, Gilly, etc.) when using low-thrust, high-efficiency engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
