For those of you who don\u0027t know what it is, it is a website that you can upload 3D models to, get them printed in a 3D printer, and then sent to you. I know a while ago someone else did this, but I was wondering if anyone had a (preferably) textured 3D model of a Kerbal. I\u0027m looking for a model of what they look like on EVA, with their white suits and EVA jetpacks, not what they look like in the cockpit, with their orange suits. One other thing is that there need to be 2 models. The Kerbal with his helmet, but without the visor, and one of just the visor alone, this is because the visor needs to be printed with a different material than the Kerbal, and the visor is going to have to be able to snap into the Kerbals helmet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that this is a hard task, but I\u0027m wondering if anyone out there has the time (and skill) to do this... because, well... you don\u0027t want to see my 3D modeling...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell thanks, bye.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
