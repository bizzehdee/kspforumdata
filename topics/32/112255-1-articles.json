This made me quickly bored.\n\nI downloaded the tutorials \u0022for beginners\u0022 and followed the instructions to fire the pre-designed rockets. This was boring, too.

It gets things done without you having to know how to do it. You can basicly ignore the hard and (initially) boring parts of the game.

The stock game is complex enough already.\n\nMy suggestion is to dabble a bit in career mode too. Yes, all those limitations make the game harder, but it\u0027s easier to learn the basics of construction and what the parts do when you only have a handful of them available.
