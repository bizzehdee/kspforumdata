The main power draws are the CPU and GPU. You add those together, providing numbers are given for separate components and not total system consumption. If they provided system consumption you need to look at idle and load power and do a bit of guestimating what each component does. After that you typically add about 10-30 watts for the motherboard and roughly 10 watts for every (fairly recent) HDD, a little less for SSD\u0027s. Add a handful of watts for every fan and other specific devices and you should be pretty much spot on. Please note that older components are a little less frugal, since the emphasis of development has been on power economy only for the past ~4 years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA much more rough indiciation is looking at TDP\u0027s, but since those can be, for various reasons, pretty inaccurate, the result is not highly accurate either (to say the least).
