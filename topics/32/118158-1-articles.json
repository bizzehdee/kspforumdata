The upper-mind and the lower trusses are actually connected to the engines that were rotated inside that tank. The fuel lines you can see run from that can to the trusses attached to the tanks. That\u0027s what lets the fuel flow freely to the engines from the tank stack you can put above it. And since the upper mid and lower trusses are on the engines, the upper and lower-mid trusses are attached to the tanks. The struts connect the trusses from the engines and the trusses from the tanks. That\u0027s what keeps the engines inside safely pointed DOWN, despite the hellacious amounts of thrust!\n\nI\u0027d rewrite it just for the forums special like but I\u0027m in a hurry to be ready for the office.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T00:07:32Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 12:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Whackjob**"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T00:09:27Z","Content":"Holy yikes!! ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T00:39:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Holy yikes!! ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nAnd this is what happens when Whackjob gets ahold of your mod."},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T01:15:12Z","Content":"NecroBones...what have you done..."},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T01:16:59Z","Content":"The whole \u0022blowing up in atmosphere\u0022 is clearly caused by going too fast, too low.
