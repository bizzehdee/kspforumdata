It is currently too easy to complete much (or even all) of science/career mode in a completely unrealistic short amount of time with the ability to chain launches right after each other; so easy that an experienced player like myself can complete the entire tech tree long before the first launch window for Duna or Eve opens. Time restrictions for launches can also improve the career mode experience by having players carefully choose there contracts and plan accordingly (of course, right now the contract deadlines are just too long). Also, if life support is added, it would add additional challenge to rescue or resupply missions (i.e., no magical ships that the player can craft in zero time to rescue a stranded Kerbal on the Mun).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis irritates me: \u0022a new player will just timewarp until it\u0027s done\u0022; well much of the game already relies on time warping, so I don\u0027t understand why this would be an issue. I love KSP and I applaud Squad\u0027s huge amount of effort in making and improving this wonderful game, but I wish they would drop this new player catering. Should the game have ways to help new players learn how to play? Yes, through guided tutorials. Should the non-tutorial portion of the game be dumbed down to allow new / incompetent players to play the game easier? No. I\u0027m sorry to sound conceited, but people will either have the ability to grasp the concepts required to play this game or not. New players that are capable of understanding these concepts will learn just like the most of us, while the others will not. I hope Squad will shift their focus more on improving the game for people that will play the game for 500\u002B hours and less for those that may play for a few hours or less and give-up because they will never be able to understand orbital mechanics.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-07T05:23:18Z\u0022 title=\u002202/07/2015 05:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sjohnson0684\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-07T05:05:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magnemoe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magnemoe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo as the construction time require some other changes too to work well and not be an stupid annoyance.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not saying it wouldn\u0027t require a bit of thought to implement.
