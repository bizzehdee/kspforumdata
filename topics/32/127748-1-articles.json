In my experience you\u0027re not going to get any more than 3t of payload to orbit from the level 1 pad and VAB.

EVA and docking ports are a big deal. A few versions ago I put a Kerbal on the Mun and brought him back using rockets in the 18/30 limit and no engine better than a 909, but that mission used four separate launches and relied heavily on rendezvous and EVA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
