Especially because solar panels lose their usefulness near Dres orbit, fuel cells consume priceless fuel (at least until one gets ISRU infrastructure in place), and RTG are a bit underwhelming considering their weight. A nuclear reactor would go a long way towards powering up our mines. Oh well, there are mods for that."},{"CreatedByName":"Wheffle","CreatedById":74893,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T16:35:24Z","Content":"A stock nuclear reactor would be so awesome. Wouldn\u0027t be too hard, they could just treat it as a huge RTG with tons of heat production.\n\nOh well. Until then, there\u0027s Near Future."}]}
