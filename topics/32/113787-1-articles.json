Especially because solar panels lose their usefulness near Dres orbit, fuel cells consume priceless fuel (at least until one gets ISRU infrastructure in place), and RTG are a bit underwhelming considering their weight. A nuclear reactor would go a long way towards powering up our mines. Oh well, there are mods for that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wheffle","CreatedById":74893,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T16:35:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA stock nuclear reactor would be so awesome.
