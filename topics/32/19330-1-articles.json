Here is why. In real life Mars is much like Duna that will come out in .17. so here is the chiz. You enter the atmosphere around 1500 ~ 2200 meters a second depending on how u do it. But since Duna\u0027s atmoshpere is thin it doesn\u0027t have enough atmoshpere to do the job... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo obviously you would use a parachute to slow you down even more. But it would be almost impossible to land safely around in my terms of 2 meters ~ 0.5 meters a second. Even if you have 100 parachutes on your space craft it wouldn\u0027t matter. you would always still be going around 150 meters ~ 110 meters a second also depending on how you do EDL. But if KSP .17 update doesn\u0027t exactly follow realism concepts, then it would be different or you would kill the little squishy Kerbal body\u0027s when the G\u0027s go sky high. But if the game does it would be impossible to land parachute only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the next step would be using rocket powered descent. But if you wanted to return the Kerbals back home i wouldn\u0027t try to use any of my fuel because its not that easy to get back. You need to make alot of adjustments to get back. The only way that i can comprehend is having a big ass lander.. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut still the math doesn\u0027t add up. ??? So how would you land and get back? Its a question we will all ask our self\u0027s when .17 comes out. Feel free to discuss this odd and almost rhetorical question. Does it have a answer. Or am i just stupid and late that i haven\u0027t seen the answer yet?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd What would the easiest planet to land on for you.

I would have a separate stage for powered descent and about 1km from the surface I would get rid of it and start using my lander\u0027s external fuel reserves. To take off hmm... I would use small SRB\u0027s to get off the surface then use more external tanks. The external tanks get me to about...150km orbit. From there I get rid of them then use the rest of my fuel. If I am able to use my HUGE lander (not likely) I would go to Ike on the way home. I would probably only be able to get high Kerbin orbit using the rest of my fuel and send a ship to get them back down to the surface.
