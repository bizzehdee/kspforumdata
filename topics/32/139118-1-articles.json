I don\u0027t have absurd designs, and work with angles of incidence on the wings to minimalize the AoA the craft has when flying. I did however notice that the way drag is calculated might not be realistic. It treats every object in the craft as solitary, even if they reside inside a fuselage. e.g., a reaction wheel (tiny) inside a fuselage (small) will generate significant drag. A better way to calculate drag is to use the surface area of the craft as a whole, not the aggregate of parts. The latter will have a significantly higher drag. Also, parts inside cargo bays STILL generate drag, which becomes most obvious when parts inside a cargo bay start overheating due to high speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-11T10:57:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222574799\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022139118\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462963453\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150794\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Adelaar\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 minutes ago, Adelaar said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, parts inside cargo bays STILL generate drag, which becomes most obvious when parts inside a cargo bay start overheating due to high speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat doesn\u0027t necessarily mean they are generating drag (I\u0027m not saying they are or aren\u0027t and won\u0027t without seeing decent evidence on a completely clean stock install). \u00A0Heat can be conducted to parts inside cargo bays but has problems radiating away and are protected from the extra atmospheric cooling by convection...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Adelaar","CreatedById":150794,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-11T11:32:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222574810\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022139118\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462964247\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002297386\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Padishar\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, Padishar said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat doesn\u0027t necessarily mean they are generating drag (I\u0027m not saying they are or aren\u0027t and won\u0027t without seeing decent evidence on a completely clean stock install). \u00A0Heat can be conducted to parts inside cargo bays but has problems radiating away and are protected from the extra atmospheric cooling by convection...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re absolutely correct.
