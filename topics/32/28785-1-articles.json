One of the first landers I sent to Minmus. I had been playing for a while, it was getting late, and after I put the lander in orbit around Minmus I decided to go to bed and would land the next day. When I reloaded my game and went back to my lander, the legs simply flew off. They had been previously deployed but I didn\u0027t even get to attempt a landing.

I run in to this on almost every run I have to Duna or farther. I would guess that there is some sort of memory leak on a very long single session that eventually hiccups the system. I\u0027ve been drifting a ship towards Duna, literally millions of KM from nothing, and with time compression on x1 I\u0027ve walked away from the computer to make dinner or something and come back to the ship trashed, torn apart somehow. Regular jumps to higher time compression seem to alleviate the issue as does jumping to the Command Center once an hour or so)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Now that I think about it, I remember having an issue where if I had landing legs deployed, but not landed that reloading the flight lost the legs every time too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Lego\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rage097","CreatedById":66193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T14:13:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe kraken was just out for stroll.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T14:34:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EClipping.
