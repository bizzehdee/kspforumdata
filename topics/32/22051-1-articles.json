Firstly when people say they have the files, is it the .mu they have, or a .dae. If its a .mu, I don\u0027t know if this can be imported into unity. Its its a .dae, its possible to get into unity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou import the model into unity, the same as you import part tools into unity. Its in C7\u0027s video tutorial. Yes, his unity looks different from how yours would, but it actually has all the same tabs.
