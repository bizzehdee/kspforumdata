This is because in vanilla, you don\u0027t need nosecones at all because the game pays only cursory attention to aerodynamics. Thus, nosecones do nothing but add useless weight, although they do improve the looks of your rocket. Note, however, that one of the things on Squad\u0027s to-do list is putting in realistic aerodynamics so expect this to change eventually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you want to do mods, there\u0027s one called Ferram Aerospace Research (FAR) that puts in a more realistic aerodynamic model. If you use this mod, then you really have to pay attention to streamlining and nosecones become practically a requirement. And then you often have to get rid of them once out of the atmosphere because they cover up the front end of the ship, where you often want to have a docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are several other mods (KW Rocketry, Nova Punch, and Procedural Fairings) that contain parts to build big, complex nose cones. These are for like surrounding an entire lumpy space probe or something, like in real life. These are great things if you use FAR but aren\u0027t necessary otherwise. But anyway, these fairings naturally have built-in separators to peel them off whatever they were covering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E-How do you have kerbals attach winches/fuel lines?
