I sent out a rescue ship but after so long of waiting for sunlight to hit the rescue spot I tried to land. I landed about 88km away from the rescue site. I luckily had installed 3 seats on my 2 rovers I took to the mun. After several quicksaves and loading back up again the furthest I\u0027d traveled from my original spot was 5km, the surface was just to hilly and I kept crashing. After careful consideration I decided to terminate the flight and return home with the 1 Kerbal aboard the rescue ship I had sent to save the other 3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoral of the story is, I don\u0027t like killing Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bigcheecho","CreatedById":68020,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T16:27:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI try to avoid it, but sometimes, you have to deal with the inevitable.

Somewhere, somehow, we screwed up. It could have been in design, build, or test. Whatever it was, we should have caught it. We were too gung ho about the schedule and we locked out all of the problems we saw each day in our work. Every element of the program was in trouble and so were we. The simulators were not working, Mission Control was behind in virtually every area, and the flight and test procedures changed daily. Nothing we did had any shelf life. Not one of us stood up and said, \u0027Dammit, stop!\u0027 I don\u0027t know what Thompson\u0027s committee will find as the cause, but I know what I find. We are the cause! We were not ready! We did not do our job. We were rolling the dice, hoping that things would come together by launch day, when in our hearts we knew it would take a miracle. We were pushing the schedule and betting that the Cape would slip before we did. From this day forward, Flight Control will be known by two words: \u0027Tough\u0027 and \u0027Competent.\u0027 Tough means we are forever accountable for what we do or what we fail to do. We will never again compromise our responsibilities. Every time we walk into Mission Control we will know what we stand for. Competent means we will never take anything for granted. We will never be found short in our knowledge and in our skills. Mission Control will be perfect. When you leave this meeting today you will go to your office and the first thing you will do there is to write \u0027Tough and Competent\u0027 on your blackboards. It will never be erased. Each day when you enter the room these words will remind you of the price paid by Grissom, White, and Chaffee.
