Now, here\u0027s my setup; I have a vehicle in free solar orbit with plenty of solar panels, so data transmission is effectively free and limitless. This is our \u0022research probe\u0022 setup.

On the other hand, by running repeated transmissions, you are effectively \u0022drilling the science-reservoir empty\u0022 for that particular area, so it could decidedly be seen as wasteful, so the return totals are a comparison for the potential that\u0027s lost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrew reports, of course, are at 100% return value, so you can and should run transmissions until you\u0027ve mined every area empty for those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConclusions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the materials bay, you should *really* consider multiple return missions if you can manage it, as just two returns is far more than you will *ever* get with transmissions. Run-dry transmissions for the materials bay ONLY for locations you don\u0027t feel like you can reasonably get return missions from. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMystery Goo is a bit better. Its 40% return rate means that it breaks even at only 4 transmissions, and not nearly as much is lost. A good candidate for any far-flung science probes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVA Reports are even better, very nearly breaking even at 3 transmissions.
