The sheer amount of forum content reminds me of the WoW forums in that there was just information overload in a given day making finding worthwhile content much harder. When people complain about our forums putting the dev\u0027s on a pedestal I just want to point at the giant marble obelisk, reaching so far into the sky you must squint to see Notch sitting atop it.
