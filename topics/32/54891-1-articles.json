I remember way back when I was playing stuff on my laptop. Call of Duty World at War went on sale on steam for a massively low price. I knew my computer could barely run it, but it was wicked cheap and the console versions were dying (both with low player base and rampant god-mode hackers) so I said, \u0022what the heck\u0022 and downloaded it.

Take Call of Duty: Ghosts for instance (a game that is horribly optimized, I won\u0027t even get into everything that is wrong with that game right now). The game had an inflated 6GB of RAM requirement. When people tried playing with 4GB, the game (NOT Steam) locked them out and would not let them run it. A hack came out within days that bypassed the lockout and people were able to run the game just fine (well, as fine as it can run anyway, because it doesn\u0027t run fine even on high end systems). It only uses 2GB of RAM, which is cutting it close seeing as Windows 7 also uses about 2GB, but at the end of the day, people with 4GB of RAM could play it, and they were unfairly locked out of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is possible that other games have done this.
