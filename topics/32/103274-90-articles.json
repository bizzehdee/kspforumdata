A mission to the Mun with the Mercury style capsule, Fl-400 fuel tanks, LVT-30\u0027s LVT-45\u0027s, decouplers, and winglets. Who needs an electrical system? Landing legs? Maneuver nodes? We\u0027re doing this old school. God I miss .13. First time I played KSP was the night before a Delta IV M\u002B (4,2) launch. I was down at the Cape with some friends. Who can believe that was a little over three years ago. Darn it squad you\u0027re making me nostalgic!\n\nI was thinking something along those lines too, replicating something from all those years ago. Flying to Jool with a tiny probe, in my case. Ah, .18, my Astronomy class had some good days planning flights to the Mun that year.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, Maxmaps tweeted this:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Off to bed. Busy day tomorrow. #KerbalCountdown turning into #KerbalLaunch\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So i would expect at least 12 hours till release. Maybe more.\n\nWell, What really does that make as far as difference. 1.0 is comming. 1.0 is comming very soon. In the greater picture, what is twelve hours to two?
