So, for example, the longer the duct, the cooler the fuel.\n\nCold fuel being consumed in the engine could then cool it down or reduce its heat output (just like real rockets) as long as the engine is active (so that there is actual fuel flow).\n\nThough this might not be necessary with 1.0.2, it could be a good thing to reintroduce more realistic heating, while having actual ways to manage it without adding any stock or modded parts to your rocket.\n\nI think it could be good thing to consider and that it could lead to interesting rocket designs to manage heat other than just an engine stacked to a tank, where the fuel would go directly from the tank to the engine without being cooled through the ducts."},{"CreatedByName":"Jason_25","CreatedById":55730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T15:35:25Z","Content":"This wouldn\u0027t work very well because of the 3 forms of heat transfer, only radiation usually works in space.

First of all, let\u0027s define heat: Heat is the vibration of atoms within a material. If something is hotter, then the atoms vibrate more. Space doesn\u0027t have any atoms to vibrate, so it doesn\u0027t have a temperature.\\*\n\nStuff can be cooled by two methods\\*\\*: Conduction and Radiation. Conduction is the transfer of heat by contact: When a hot thing is in contact with a cold thing, the atoms vibrating very energetically in the hot thing tend to smash into the atoms vibrating slowly in the cold thing. These collisions slow down the atoms in the hot thing and speed up the atoms in the cold thing. As a result, heat moves out of the hot thing and into the cold thing.\n\nRadiation is heat transfer without physical contact. When things get hot, they glow. This is obvious in things like lava and molten metal, but it\u0027s true of everything. Humans are hot enough to glow in infrared, which can be seen with special cameras. Energy is needed to make this glow happen, though. This energy comes from the heat of the object. Therefore, the heat of an object will gradually decrease as it is turned into light and escapes. This is how things cool in space, since there is no material to be in contact with.\n\nThis is why solar panels and wings make good radiators and fuel lines don\u0027t: They have much more surface area, which means much more area that can glow, which means more energy is able to escape as light\\*\\*\\*.\n\nAlso, it\u0027s already been mentioned, but nuclear engines need to be hot to run, and even if you feed it cold fuel, it\u0027s specifically designed to heat up fuel to ridiculous temperatures anyway, so it won\u0027t make much difference.\n\n\\*Technically, there\u0027s a little bit of dust and gas drifting through space, but it\u0027s little enough that it doesn\u0027t really matter.\n\n\\*\\*I think it\u0027s technically three. Convection, which is heat transfer by moving fluids, being the third. But I don\u0027t quite understand how this is different from conduction, so I\u0027m lumping it in with conduction.\n\n\\*\\*\\*There\u0027s also other factors, like the material they\u0027re made of, but I don\u0027t know much about this, so I\u0027ll just leave it at that."},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T18:52:56Z","Content":"@itstimaifool (and others)\n\nThank you for your reply\n\nI was just telling this as an idea I got spontaneously and I know that in space the only efficient way to cool is through radiation. What I said is not physically accurate as fuel ducts indeed have poor radiating area and would not cool fuel efficiently.\n\nFYI: conduction does not involve displacement of matter but collisions between the vibrating atoms themselves, that\u0027s why it is more efficient with solids. Convection on the other hand requires matter displacement: hotter particles move around amongst cooler ones and make the overall temperature homogeneous without really transmitting it to other particles, that\u0027s why it is more efficient in fluids (liquids or gases).\n\nAnd radiation depends on the area exposed, the emissivity of the material and (a LOT) on the temperature difference between the hotter and cooler materials."}]}
