The only way to have one set of mods in play for certain saved games and another set of mods in play for other saved games is to have a separate installation of KSP and the desired mods installed in their respective GameData folders (much like I have separate installations and mods for 1.0.5, 1.0.4, 1.0.3, 1.0.2, 1.0.1, 1.0,... you get the idea). Provided my assumptions are correction, this is a rather trivial workaround that\u0026#39;s easy enough to implement.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat I\u0026#39;m asking about is if there\u0026#39;s a method to have different mods for different saved games within a single installation? Or, more self-referentially, is there perhaps a mod that can enable/disable mods across saved games within a single installation? I suspect not, but there are many things I\u0026#39;m unaware of in this game and this may be yet another.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dralon Perfecto","CreatedById":145300,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T17:18:34Z","Content":"\nThat is how it works, yes, so all the saved games in an installation will use whatever mods are loaded by the game. Which is all the ones in GameData. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI wrote some scripts to delete mods from GameData and copy other mods from a library elsewhere, for different configurations. (Note that if a ship has mod parts on it, and those mods are unavailable, the ship gets deleted.) \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn the whole it is easier to have separate installs for different mod setups.
