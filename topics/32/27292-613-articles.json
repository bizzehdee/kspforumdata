From transfer to Mun to setting an aerobrake periapsis on return (and I did land. Poorly.), I burned an astounding 2400 dV with a prototype interplanetary ship. Even with aerobraking, I decided that that 600 remaining dV wasn\u0027t going to be enough to circularize and rendezvous with the crew return pod I sent up to retrieve Jebediah.

I was unable to pull out of the third tumble, forcing me to deploy the landing chute (radial drogue). While I was able to control the plane, I realized that it wasn\u0027t landable, still being unable to fly slow and level (she could fly much slower with the chute, but only while descending to pull the back end up). With nothing to lose, I decided to try spinning, the closest I could get to burning retrograde. My stable descent with the chute was 75 m/s, too fast to survive (but not by much), and by turning hard and taking advantage of the nose rise, and using a little thrust, was able to hold the plane in a sharp turn with the engines far enough from prograde to bring the speed down to 40-45 m/s. It was a pretty hard landing, but my pilot survived.
