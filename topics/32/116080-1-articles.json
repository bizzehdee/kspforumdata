A couple days back I made my first good SSTO, and I learned a lot out of it. First, your ascent profile. If kerbal engineer gives you \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00CB\u20201.00 TWR with your jet engines, you should do a shallow ascent profile with about 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA pitch until 10 kilometers. Be aware, Scott Manley forgot one important thing in his SSTO guide. After 10 kilometers, your TWR reaches about 1.20. This is where you should flatten out even more, into an 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA climb. Then, accelerate until your jets are losing thrust. You should be moving at \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00CB\u20201100 m/s at that time. As the thrust of a single jet reaches 175kn, turn on your rocket engines and start a climb. As your jets flame out, turn them off. Continue with a normal rocket climb and circularsie.

Trying to gain speed past terminal velocity means your fighting the atmosphere; wasting precious DeltaV. You can get away with this with turbojets because of their fuel efficiency, but when using rocket engines, every drop of fuel counts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
