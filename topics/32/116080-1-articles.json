A couple days back I made my first good SSTO, and I learned a lot out of it. First, your ascent profile. If kerbal engineer gives you \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00CB\u20201.00 TWR with your jet engines, you should do a shallow ascent profile with about 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA pitch until 10 kilometers. Be aware, Scott Manley forgot one important thing in his SSTO guide. After 10 kilometers, your TWR reaches about 1.20. This is where you should flatten out even more, into an 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA climb. Then, accelerate until your jets are losing thrust. You should be moving at \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00CB\u20201100 m/s at that time. As the thrust of a single jet reaches 175kn, turn on your rocket engines and start a climb. As your jets flame out, turn them off. Continue with a normal rocket climb and circularsie.

The turbojets are FAR FAR more efficient producing thrust and fuel efficiency. You\u0027ll want to squeeze as much thrust out of them as you can in the atmosphere, because nowhere else will you have a engine produce so much thrust for so little fuel. Having 2 Turbojets for every rocket engine is a good ratio to start with, but with heavier Spaceplanes, I\u0027ve had as many as 13 turbojets and just 2 Poodle engines.\n\nThink of the turbojets as the catapult that sends you into space, and the rocket engines merely there to help you limp into low orbit.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-16T22:18:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2015 10:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Edax**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bloody_looser","CreatedById":95664,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T22:22:29Z","Content":"1.0.2 SSTOs were like flying sausages without wings and with OP turbojets. 1.0.4 definitely made SSTOs better."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T22:27:08Z","Content":"SSTOs were definitely do-able in 1.02, and they\u0027re a shade easier in 1.04, but things have changed since .90 and the old rules no longer apply.\n\n Check this out:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118728-Slashy-s-1-02-Spaceplane-recipe](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118728-Slashy-s-1-02-Spaceplane-recipe)\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T22:30:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Think of the turbojets as the catapult that sends you into space, and the rocket engines merely there to help you limp into low orbit.\n\nWhat speed do you generally ignite the rockets at?

Trying to gain speed past terminal velocity means your fighting the atmosphere; wasting precious DeltaV. You can get away with this with turbojets because of their fuel efficiency, but when using rocket engines, every drop of fuel counts."}]}
