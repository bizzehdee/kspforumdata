It also has a drill and refinery on board. However, I would still need some resupply depots... So here\u0027s **my first question**: does that still constitute as a Grand Tour if I use up to eight small stations carrying ore for the vehicle to convert into fuel?\n\nCurrent plan would be:\n\nPlace 8 resupply depots around the system.\n\nLaunch probes to scan the planets/moons to locate optimal landing site (ore concentration).\n\nLaunch the GT vehicle proper (with some SRB help it can get into LKO by itself) and to the tour.\n\nNow for the dark part: I want to do a YouTube series about this (those of you who know me know that that\u0027s kind of my thing... See also my signature). Since I am gunning for an OPM GT, there are nine main planets I want to visit (Moho, Eve, Duna, Dres, Jool, Sarnus, Urlum, Neidon, Plock) besides Kerbin. Therefore I was thinking about styling the episode after the nine circles of Dante\u0027s Inferno as sort of an underlying theme.\n\nThe GT vehicle\u0027s name is \u0022Orpheus\u0022 (greek mythology: guy who went into the underworld and came back), the resupply stations would be called \u0022Eurydike\u0022 I to VIII, the Transfer vehicle to distribute those depots would be called \u0022Charon\u0022 and the scanner probes will be called \u0022Kerberos\u0022 I and II (one ion powered for the inner planets, one nuke powered for Jool (or mabe already Dres?) and beyond.\n\n**My second question** to you: since KSP and almost everything about it is rather lighthearted, would you think using those rather sinister themes (Inferno, Greek underworld, ...) are sort of counterproductive? Especially since I probably won\u0027t stay very serious throughout the series...\n\nAny other input about this idea you would like to share?

If a challenge requires no refueling, then it wouldn\u0027t count, but if you are doing it on you own you can decide. \n\nTo me, a Grand Tour would consist of a single ship; either a single launch or a singe vehicle assembled in orbit. Really you can decide to send parts of the ship to its destinations ahead of time or not.\n\nSince your craft has a drill and refinery it should be self sufficient, but you say otherwise. You will just have to live with the fact that you completed a Grand Tour with refueling.
