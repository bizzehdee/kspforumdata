This is when the exhaust is stationary. Such is not the case as the Oberth effect is uninterrupted at any increase of speed, well beyond the exhaust velocity.

Next, push the skateboard up to a bit of speed and throw the medicine ball off opposite the direction of travel. Doing this results in a bigger push of the you/skateboard system. Oberth effect. Visual/sensory difference in the push though might not be overly noticable as the difference in energy of the system isn\u0027t all that high as the velocities involved are relatively low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also no relation between Einstein\u0027s relativity theory and what is used as an example (Having to do something difficult and the time passes slow while it is pretty much faster when you are enjoying something) however examples from daily life makes it easier for people who are interested in science but they don\u0027t have the knowledge base for it. If we make it less scary for people than more people interested in science we get and more educated people we get in the future \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd by the way, I didn\u0027t understand medicine ball example since I don\u0027t know the meaning for it even though I looked up the dictionary.

Isn\u0027t the relative speed between the rocket and it\u0027s exhaust always the same?

I just don\u0027t see how the bullet/cannon example makes this any easier to explain. Does this have something to do with relativity, perhaps? The exhaust also gets heavier as it gets faster, and flinging someting heavier gives you more energy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-20T15:27:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t really need anything fancy to observe the Oberth Effect, as the Oberth Effect effectively states that it\u0027s easier to go faster when you\u0027re already moving fast. Even here on the ground, you can observe its effects quite frequently: consider how much longer it takes for a vehicle to go from a full stop to top speed than it does to go from halfway at top speed to top speed. Mind you, it\u0027s less obvious here on the surface of a planet since we have a number of factors (air resistance, surface friction, etc.) slowing us down.
