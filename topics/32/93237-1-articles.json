For rockets, the most common engines i use are the KR-2Ls (yeah we all know they are overpowered, great TWR and above average ISP). Also, outside of using part clipping (say moving engine body internally), nukes are in my opinion rather terrible looking. They are also unwieldy, and you will oftebn have trouble landing a nuke craft (either due to low TWR, or due to the long engine, provided you do not clip it internally).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENukes are the best interplanetary engine for most craft (until larger more powerful ions come out), but they are far from the best if you are looking for a specific relatively short range vehicle\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T02:53:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is both a minimum dV and payload mass requirement for nukes to be practical. Its not huge, but anything to Duna (and arguably Eve) and probes to anywhere don\u0027t meet this and thus nukes are mathematically inferior in such a role. There\u0027s also plenty of middle ground where nukes are mathematically superior in terms of dV provided, but other variables play in to make the choice less clear cut. Small to mid sized payloads (\u0026lt;40t) to Jool are a good example. Economically, the extra fuel cost of using a chemical engine is equal to or lesser than the extra cost of using a nuclear engine. On larger vehicles, such as a tug hauling an entire station out to Jool, nukes become progressively better options as the payload mass goes up. That said, at such massive scales, the cost increases by using nukes are going to be rather small considering the massive budget you have to be sitting on to make such a thing happen to begin with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T02:55:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you build correctly you can use Aerospikes or other high ISP non-nuke engines to do the job.
