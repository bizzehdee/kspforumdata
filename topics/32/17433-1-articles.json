I\u0027m beginning to think the ramscoops are a bit too much for this plane, and perhaps it\u0027s a fuselage segment too long?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engine bodies and intakes don\u0027t seem to do anything currently, just stick a turbo jet directly on the back of a fuel tank (any fuel tank, rockets and jet engines both use the same fuel at the moment). Likewise the Avionics and Advanced SAS do the same job with different tunings so it\u0027s a case of using one or the other. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou haven\u0027t said what problem you have with it. You\u0027ve got a very heavy back end and not much lift though so I\u0027d expect it to want to pitch up but with the large wagglers at the front you should be able to curb most of that for level flight (although turning may be unstable). Moving the wings back as far as possible would likely help with stability, or adding a second pair to the end of or behind the current pair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t see the rear wheels so if they\u0027re close together you might get it weaving on the runway a bit. Putting them at the edge of the wings would help (wasd and qe to rotate), but you might have to add a couple of braces to stop that heavy fuselage sagging if you do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know the details of the bug but I\u0027ve found with wide wheel placement veering is a very minor issue, most of my planes will get to the end of the runway without the controls being touched.
