Instead, when I am at periapsis, I make a retrograde burn (\u003Cem\u003Eor prograde, but it would make for a more expensive intercept\u003C/em\u003E). This changes my orbital time enough that I will meet the target body at periapsis at a later orbit. It can be the next orbit, or a few orbits in the future; generally you can pay less if you\u0027re willing to wait more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00220e1f2TJ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/0e1f2TJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe picture shows it. Yellow manuever, at periapsis, is the change to get the right orbital time. In this case it\u0027s a big burn because the target is a small moon with negligible oberth effect, so I lose nothing by burning in open space - and I avoid cosine losses. but it\u0027s normally a small adjustment manuever. purple is not a manuever (0 m/s), but it\u0027s there to get the game to see the intercept several orbits into the future. And finally red is the capture burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve done this extensively to reach all the moons of saturn. I\u0027ve done it in going from ceres to vesta\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022f3GFkmx.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/f3GFkmx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve done a slight modification in going to mercury. I\u0027ve done it when leaving Venus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis manuever is as expensive as a regular Hohmann transfer - give or take a small excess for the burn you make in interplanetary space, which is not as effective as burning near a planet. It takes longer, possibly multiple orbits. It has the advantage, though, that you can pick your planar nodes. When you have to make a transfer with high inclination, you can avoid a plane change if you make a hohmann transfer on the planar node; in that case you get to pay the plane change with the eject or capture burn, saving a lot of fuel by both oberth effect and combining two burn. But this hohmann transfer requires the right placement from you and the target body; you can\u0027t always count on the planets aligning for a hohmann transfer right when you\u0027re passing through the planar node. So you make this manuever instead, starting the hohmann manuever on the node, and then you syncronize to meet your target later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can also make this manuever when you are in an elliptic orbit, and you must burn at periapsis to leave cheaply, and you can\u0027t pick your direction. In this case, again, you leave when your ellipse is best aligned to save fuel, and you syncronize to meet your target later. Doing grand tours, I often find myself in an elliptic orbit, it\u0027s a lot cheaper to park the mothership like that than it is to circularize and then raise apoapsis again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027ve done this manuever a lot, possibly more than any other. Yet I don\u0027t know a name for it, I don\u0027t even know if it has a name. I checked if I could find names of orbital transfers, but I only find the bi-elliptic transfer, which is something entirely different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, do anyone know if this manuever has an official name?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kekkie","CreatedById":154787,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-15T18:23:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_phasing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_phasing\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis sounds like what you are doing - transferring to a more elliptical orbit so that you won\u0027t meet the target body, but adjusted so that when you come back around after an orbit or two, you can intercept.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-15T21:06:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhased orbit is a good description, more so than resonant orbit which is the other alternative I can think of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-15T23:43:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224155112\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208986\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221657909427\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154787\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kekkie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Kekkie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_phasing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_phasing\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis sounds like what you are doing - transferring to a more elliptical orbit so that you won\u0027t meet the target body, but adjusted so that when you come back around after an orbit or two, you can intercept.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt has a similarity, but it\u0027s not quite right, because orbital phasing entails changing your orbit, then going back to the original orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s actually a mix between orbital phasing and hohmann transfer.
