If you\u0027re not interested in overclocking get a cheaper non-K processor (which will have more features, too). You can probably get a board with onboard wifi so you don\u0027t need a separate card. I would also consider an aftermarket CPU cooler if planning to overclock, good air coolers can be had for about $30.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Discrete sound cards are unnecessary in 90%\u002B of cases, unless you have a very specific need for it you\u0027re likely paying for something you won\u0027t notice compared to onboard sound.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In the price bracket in which you\u0027re shopping you should really consider getting an SSD for OS/programs, either instead of or in addition to the conventional drive. Few upgrades make a computer seem snappier than an SSD. I built a machine a couple of months ago on a much smaller budget and was able to work a 256GB SSD into it, worth every penny.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing is that summer is months away, the landscape may change significantly in that time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T21:59:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E- Get a motherboard with the Z97 chipset for easier overclocking of that K-series chip.
