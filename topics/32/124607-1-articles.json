That puts the gate orbit at a radius of 1e7 m. Transfer window calculator verifies this. Know what else is fairly close to that radius? The Mun! (1.2e7 m). Better yet, a retrograde ejection will bring you back towards that optimal altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing this, your ejection burn only needs to add 580 m/s to Munar velocity. Under this plan, no leg (LKO -\u0026gt; Mun and Mun \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; Duna) needs more than 1300 km/s to complete. This allows greater mass fractions on a Duna transport. The Mun also allows for quicker rendevous because of the shorter orbit (vs the gate orbit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe obvious weakness is the requirements of Mun based fueling and the relative simplicity of Duna transfers, but it does seem like an interesting concept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: Duna (and possibly Eve) are the only compelling choices for a Munar way station. The higher your required infinite velocity, the smaller your gate orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-07T00:47:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat can certainly work. Mun orbit makes a decent fuelling stop for interplanetary vessels in general for the reasons you mention, and its shorter orbital period compared to Minmus reduces problems with timing for transfer windows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor further destinations than Eve and Duna you\u0027re better off departing Mun to get a low Kerbin Pe then burning there to eject. That will save about 600 m/s over a departure from LKO. It is also worth noting that even Mun\u0026gt;Jool direct actually requires a little less delta-V than LKO\u0026gt;Jool, it\u0027s just rather worse than Mun\u0026gt;LKO-Mun Transfer\u0026gt;Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-07T01:15:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor what it\u0027s worth, though, based on the edit dates of the Wikipedia \u0022Gate Orbit\u0022 article, I strongly suspect that the guy who wrote the sole document linked in the references for the article also wrote the Wikipedia article.
