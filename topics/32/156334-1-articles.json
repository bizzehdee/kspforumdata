When kerbin was a planetoid there was still mass that orbited it and it was the beginning of the mun. Soil analysis taught us that mun was not part of kerbin and not debris from cataclysmic collision. It is unique and different from kerbin. Stable, low orbit is a sign of natural satellite.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EAlthough minmus may be a remnant of collision due to inclination and eccentricity of orbit. It is made of ice, which is the same ice that was on kerbin hundreds of years ago. Also evidence of that is an unique and strange shape of its surface. There is a large crater on the surface of kerbin that could be the place where minmus started forming\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EKerbin was in ice age long time ago when sun was just a YY dwarf. We can see evidence of that in the ice caps and oxygen in the atmosphere. But when the sun staged and turned into yellow dwarf all the ice evaporated or turned into water. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003ELife on kerbin consist of trees, grass and kerbals. But kerbin is not so old and still suffers from radiation and instant asteroid collisions. But when the space around will calm down, more species will come , more trees will grow , more grass to rise. But for now kerbal community must protect the planet and don\u2019t let life go extinct\u2026\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EWe may find frozen bacteria or viruses deep inside minmus crust. They can be both cure and death to kerbals. All minmus surface samples must be carefully contained and never lost, sold or eaten by kerbanouts. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EAll 5 themes are for discussion.
