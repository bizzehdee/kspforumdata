Although it didn\\\u0027t look that good as you\\\u0027d think. In my opinion the current textures and the new terrain engine are much nicer. The palm trees looked cool, but they were just stock trees for the unity engine used as a placeholder, and they were only present near the VAB. However I have to admit, that the Mun texture was better back then.
