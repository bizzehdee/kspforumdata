I\u0027ve officially come full circle now.\n\nI\u0027m stuck in a rut where I\u0027m \u0027playing\u0027 KSP but not really. I\u0027ve been doing a lot of work bug reporting and balance testing for Nertea\u0027s Mk4 system, currently in its 2.0 prerelease, but I haven\u0027t really been doing anything in-game. I don\u0027t have my beloved Near Future Propulsion due to it being unfit for duty in 1.0.4, and I don\u0027t want to revert back to 1.0.2 (too draggy even though I prefer the jet engine efficiency).\n\nI\u0027d like to play with Outer Planets Mod to give me some new targets, but don\u0027t for the above reason (no electric engines = PITA).\n\nBasically I\u0027m stuck waiting for several mods to get their 1.0.4 versions out (which is looking to be a while on the NFP/NFE/HC package), and, to top it off, my go-to Space Engineers server is a graveyard right now as we await the planets update (we\u0027ve decided on a wipe for planets).\n\nKSP\u0027s performance is getting worse for me (I have a monster of a rig but the CPU is 8-core and KSP doesnt like that), and I\u0027m running out of ideas to reinvigorate the experience.\n\nI\u0027ve launched a whole torus station, so stupifying craft has its check in the box. I\u0027ve properly colonized Laythe (base, space station, Joolian mining operations to boot) . . . twice. Only other \u0027mainstream\u0027 mega-challenge I have left is a grand tour, and stock mining left a good bit to be desired in the context of self-refueling motherships. I thought about adding mods (hell, I\u0027m now thinking about an OPM grand tour), but ultimately I need a swift kick in the pants or I\u0027m not gonna get through this burnout any time soon.\n\n-Sierra."},{"CreatedByName":"TicTacToe!","CreatedById":44675,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T22:43:27Z","Content":"I think the route with the greatest efficacy for burnouts has always been to just shelf the game for a little while.

So just can it for however long you need to, I usually dive into some books (Silmarillion atm) but whatever tickles your fancy really.\n\nBtw, I\u0027m curios why you say NFP/NFE isn\u0027t working...

I just came back to it but again, I\u0027m only really dabbling (I was playing seriously for about 2 weeks then 1.0.3 destroyed Heat Control and that was the end of my serious KSP\u0027ing).

My Skylab station around Kerbin, and my Minmus base that I decided not to land, cause I knew from experience from the lost save, that it was badly engineered, and would always run out of power during Minmus\u0027s nights. My solution was to launch tiny probes that were all batteries and solar panels, with a docking port, and land it on TOP of the base to dock it... and then do it AGAIN when I STILL didn\u0027t have enough solar to charge the batteries. Long story short, the base was starting to look like a rocket on the pad... It was getting TALL.... So I made it a station.\n\nAlso been working on a Mun base, with an ascent stage. No need to keep my pilot on the ground, and someone needs to carry all that science home.\n\nStill...\n\nI plan to use Kerbal Space Program as an excuse to learn to program Arduinos. I even have a ***REAL*** FDAI (Flight Director/Attitude Indicator... aka, the navball) out of an F-4 Phantom simulator! ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T10:36:05Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 10:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by richfiles**"},{"CreatedByName":"stevehead","CreatedById":137745,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T14:52:04Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been stuck in a rut too with the game for some time, although mine is more a combination of frustration and real life. Pre-1.0, I could play the game hours at a time and enjoy every bit of it, despite having an occasional bug to deal with. But now it seems that no matter what combination of mods (even going for almost pure-stock setup a few times), I always get hit by some game breaking/limiting bug 30 min. to an hour into playing and I have to spend time troubleshooting and narrowing down the problem to which mod (often, it turns out to be a stock bug like randomly overheating parts or the launch clamp bug). I get frustrated, run out of time, and shelve the game for a few days and come back to experience the same problem, and the routine has become quite old for me.\n\nIt\u0027s been a good number of days or so since I\u0027ve fired up KSP, but I keep getting that itch to play it. I\u0027ve tried playing other games lately, but I get bored with them quickly and wish to be playing KSP instead... but I hold off because of the frustrations I\u0027ve had recently. Sadly, I need something like KSP to keep my mind off of real life. My mother was diagnosed with a very rare form of cancer back in May, and I\u0027m afraid to say that the situation will not have a happy ending. I spend a lot of time caring for her, and a lot of time just being with her, along with other day-to-day things and obligations I have. But I do need the occasional \u0022me time\u0022 to ease off my mind for an hour or two, and KSP had been my go to thing for just that. I guess the stress of real life has been too much for me to handle additional stress from a video game, yet I have not found anything else to fill that \u0022me time\u0022 void without wanting to be playing KSP."}]}
