It gave me a random unrelated idea. What about a reusable ship for eve to save space.(it\u0027s not totally reusalbe. But resuable from the missions perspective.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis may be similar to some other attempts in logic but i don\u0027t think it\u0027s the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. First launch section is designed to launch from Kerbal, seperate and fly itself to Eve. It has mining equipment(for refueling on Eve) and fuel sectioned off for it\u0027s own transfer burn from kerbin to Eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Any other sections have the same design(if needed) except the mining equipment and all travel to Eve separately after launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. After each parts get to even it reconnects as on large vessel.(or as many parts are needed connect.) This is presuming they can travel on less fuel getting to Eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. It lands on Eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Carry out missions and relaunch as one massive vessel shedding parts as needed to get into orbit and get the small capsule to Kerbin with any science pods if possible. If not the rest is sent back via satelite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt should be designed to shed whatever it needs for takeoff with whatever less mass from dropping off stuff as possible on Eve ascent. The difference makes it launchable from kerbin then with less parts Eve. One \u0022Stage\u0022 meant to get everything off Kerbin. The rest designed to get off Eve with only the needed parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically trying to save fuel by making each part carry itself and lessen total fuel for the return trip. but still having anything like breakaway empty pods or other equipment to get off eve... Or is it just as good to make one large ship to Eve and do the same thing. I\u0027m assuming the thrust needed for eve may make this pointless though as the extra mass would be near pointless... Or could you use this to make it so the ship can save a little fuel by minimizing the initial ascent off kerbin and get each pert into orbit and minimize an even take off later? (AKA seperate at 20k and fly both/multiple sections up to orbit and reconnect them in orbit or at desitination.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this is not usefull for Eve is it usefull in any other cases in the game. Or are there logical cases where it could be useful but not in this game? Is there a case where you can launch with lots of empty tanks or anything odd from Kerbil and fill them on even to get off the planet in the end(not and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003Essto\u003C/abbr\u003E though.).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would try this but I have an issue with the game or my computer atm and I haven\u0027t fixed it yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: not sure if this makes any sense. But is there any use for taking apart your rocket(possibley moving them around seperately) and putting it back together for missions? Especially since we have mining now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI imagine this would come out like a normal Eve mission craft though. although thinking about it would this be better for zero atmosphere destination like tylo or other places. Maybe as a resuable multipart rocket for travelling multiple planets in one go. Maybe if you combined the idea with lots of ore storage tanks... Which sounds alot like a normal mission craft for the mun... Still. 8)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-12T22:09:17Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2017 10:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegolius13","CreatedById":165625,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-13T01:30:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenerally you do not save fuel by launching a rocket in parts. \u00A0 More likely it takes more fuel and money to split up, since larger enines tend to be more efficient. \u00A0 Also, \u00A0if you launch in pieces you have to double up on probe cores, etc. \u00A0The major exception would be a ship that\u0027s very bad aerodynamically when assembled, \u00A0like a cross shaped space station.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is feasible\u00A0to launch with empty tanks and refuel in space. \u00A0 Alternatively, \u00A0you can launch with the upper stage tracks full and use them with detachable launch engines. \u00A0 Then refill in space.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt could be useful to seperate and land a mining module to refuel. \u00A0 Especially if you intend to make multiple trips up and down to a planet or moon to mine. \u00A0 But you can still do this, even if you launch the ship in one piece.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have never tried refueling on Eve.\u00A0 It should be possible, \u00A0but it\u0027s pretty hard to get stuff down to the surface intact. \u00A0 It would be quite difficult to get heavy and draggy\u00A0mining equipment back off the surface. \u00A0 Very hard to get anything more off the surface than a simple capsule. \u00A0It\u0027s likely easier to refuel on the Mun, Minmus or Gilly, where you can reuse the mining equipment.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-13T10:39:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222919804\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022154902\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221484271052\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022165625\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aegolius13\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, Aegolius13 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is feasible\u00A0to launch with empty tanks and refuel in space. \u00A0 Alternatively, \u00A0you can launch with the upper stage tracks full and use them with detachable launch engines. \u00A0 Then refill in space.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe simple approach is to have first stage with disposable boosters (SRBs), and second stage to reach orbit and refuel there, with moderate thrust high ISp engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have never tried refueling on Eve.\u00A0 It should be possible, \u00A0but it\u0027s pretty hard to get stuff down to the surface intact. \u00A0 It would be quite difficult to get heavy and draggy\u00A0mining equipment back off the surface. \u00A0 Very hard to get anything more off the surface than a simple capsule. \u00A0It\u0027s likely easier to refuel on the Mun, Minmus or Gilly, where you can reuse the mining equipment.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding on Eve is quite easy if you\u0027re not too picky about the landing spot.

Atmospheric flight is quite easy with electric props or nuclear jets (not stock unfortunately) so your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E platform may be on an airplane meant to travel Eve to your ship\u0027s landing spot. The real difficulty begins on ascent from anywhere below 7000m. You need really mighty boosters which you need to lose around 10-15km when you can start using somewhat more efficient engines. And you won\u0027t go far beyond low Eve orbit regardless - it\u0027s good to have another refueling craft there, say, picking fuel from Gilly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
