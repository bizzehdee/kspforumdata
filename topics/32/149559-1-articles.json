Declining also weights the system pretty heavily, so removing a few contracts will help greatly. Unfortunately some of the better contracts don\u0027t show up until a little later in career mode so declining early contracts may not be as helpful as you think, but it does help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-09T17:04:12Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2016 05:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by regex\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-09T20:26:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*sigh*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t believe decline penalty is still a thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-09T22:07:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough the perfectionist in me\u00A0finds the decline penalty irritating, I\u0027m just gonna throw this out there:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a game play balancing tactic it\u0027s actually not so bad, if the player is declining lot\u0027s of contracts they are obviously having a hard time finding something they can/want to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs their reputation lowers, the contracts offered will become easier and easier, until they find something they feel comfortable\u00A0with, accept it, complete it, and begin to move back up the system\u0027s ladder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-09T22:50:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222794584\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022149559\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221476028449\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022169970\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zpike\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, Zpike said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes reputation actually effect anything?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt determines how many two- and three-star contracts will be open (on offer or active)\u00A0 at any given time.
