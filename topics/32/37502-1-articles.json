Probably not worth it for stuff on the moons of Kerbin but I have a save with some space planes landed on Laythe and mothballing them in orbit then bringing the pilots home in a transport (with a quick weekend party at the Mun memorial in remembrance naturally) might be a worthwhile mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gerryrbd","CreatedById":66061,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-17T23:16:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell i keep hoping that when the update goes live, we can copy our (\u0022de-manned\u0022) ships in persistent.sfs and paste them into a newly generated save game...

Plus, the terrain resolution is far too low to do them like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I think a better solution there would be to do crater objects that we place, like bullet holes in shooting games.
