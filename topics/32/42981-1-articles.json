In the case of Apollo, that purpose was nothing but a photo-op to prove we could, if we went to great trouble and expense, put a few people on the moon for a very short time. So to me, skipping the technicalities of what is and isn\u0027t an \u0022Apollo-style\u0022 mission in real life, \u0022Apollo-style\u0022 means \u0022nothing but a photo-op\u0022. IOW, you get there, you land, you hop out, you plant a flag, you take a screenshot, then you hop back in and come home. Maybe you have an itty bitty rover, too, which you drive a short distance before you either wreck it or get bored with it, and take another screenshot or 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, such a mission is quite an accomplishment when you\u0027re 1st starting, At this point in your KSP life, your purpose is simply to prove to yourself that you can design, build, and fly a rocket capable of just getting there and back. IOW, the journey itself is the purpose, not what you do when you get there. But after you do this once or twice, you realize that if you treat the other planets the same way, KSP will soon become boring, because you\u0027re not doing anything new. Sure, you need a bigger rocket to go further away, you need different landers for different worlds, but that\u0027s the only real difference. You\u0027re still basically doing nothing but getting to LKO, making an ejection burn, getting captured at the destination, landing, taking off again, and burning for home. It\u0027s just like going to Mun or Minmus all over again, except it takes longer and you have to wait for launch windows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd in the meantime, just dropping on 1 spot and planting a flag is a huge disservice to the destination. You\u0027ve got an entire planet to explore, with its interesting scenery and perhaps anomalies to investigate. So, you need to develop methods of seeing beyond the horizon around your landing site. So if possible, you want to fly long distances. In not, you want to be able to drive long distances, set up multiple bases or at least make multiple landings in different places. Maybe even start exploiting Kethane, and building staging bases or even orbital shipyards and extraplanetary launchpads to make exploration of further planets easier. IOW, actually start living in space instead of just visiting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, now you have to start adding capabilities to your rockets. And they start getting big and heavy fast, so pretty soon there\u0027s nothing for it but assembling them in orbit. This inevitably leads to the creation of a \u0022mothership\u0022, aka a mobile space station, and designing all sorts of ground, air, and space vehicles to do all sorts of different jobs. This is what keeps the game fresh and entertaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see lots of people plunking simple, limited-capability landers on distant planets. That\u0027s Apollo in philosophy if not in all technicalities.
