I didn\u0027t pick up Making History when it came out because it didn\u0027t add anything I was interested in. Breaking Ground does, and I would have picked it up already were it not for two factors: First, I rarely play stock these days, mostly being buried in the lands of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/RP-1, and that\u0027s unlikely to change given the lengths I find myself having to go to in order to extract a challenge out of the stock game. Second, my gaming rig (i.e. the only computer I own that can run KSP at a decent framerate) is currently in pieces in a box behind me, and is likely to stay that way for the next 3 weeks because of IRL stuff. Once the turmoil is over I might pick up Breaking Ground... but it\u0027s going to take a lot more than good robotics to drag me back to stock KSP, especially to the kinds of things in stock KSP that robotics is good for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, I haven\u0027t played KSP in a while, period.
