But yes I too hope one day Squad opens up the IVAs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut for starters... I want more stuff going on inside the cabin. For instance the doll the Russians use to signify the presence of gravity or freefall. That would be great. Then maybe trash. As the mission goes on itd be cool to see snack wrappers build up and float around the iva. But most importantly all these props need to respond to gforces. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen maybe one day the Kerbals can get out of their seats. The IVA should be seamless. You open up the hatch and Kerbals should be able to freely traverse in and out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen take it a step further by introducing a pressurizing factor. If you want to go on eva you either need to depressurize the entire cabin like Gemini or add in airlock parts. Imo Squad needs to make space feel more like space. Space is dangerous.
