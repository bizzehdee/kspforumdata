Is it impossible to mod?\n\nIs our fate is to sit endlessly in hitchicker cans?"},{"CreatedByName":"Rithsom","CreatedById":114646,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T19:36:03Z","Content":"I think a first-person EVA view would be a lot easier. Making it so that Kerbals can walk/float around in crafts seems like a lot of work."},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T19:38:28Z","Content":"The only way it can be done now is putting together a fake iva with command chairs or something. But yes I too hope one day Squad opens up the IVAs. \n\nBut for starters... I want more stuff going on inside the cabin. For instance the doll the Russians use to signify the presence of gravity or freefall. That would be great. Then maybe trash. As the mission goes on itd be cool to see snack wrappers build up and float around the iva. But most importantly all these props need to respond to gforces. \n\nThen maybe one day the Kerbals can get out of their seats. The IVA should be seamless. You open up the hatch and Kerbals should be able to freely traverse in and out.\n\nThen take it a step further by introducing a pressurizing factor. If you want to go on eva you either need to depressurize the entire cabin like Gemini or add in airlock parts. Imo Squad needs to make space feel more like space. Space is dangerous. Players need to feel like there in a boat and can\u0027t swim.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T19:48:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 07:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600**"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T20:01:53Z","Content":"\u0027pocker\u0027?
