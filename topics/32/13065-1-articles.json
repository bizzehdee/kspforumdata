The game\\\u0027s units are in meters, and 250,000m is well beyond atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, with that assumption, I\\\u0027ll continue. Kerbin\\\u0027s atmosphere is a bit funny, and what seems to be happening is that the thinning of the atmosphere that begins rather abruptly around that height is adversely affecting your craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo fix it... well, let\\\u0027s examine your craft... oh, wait. Canards. That right there *could* be your problem, or a large part of it. Canards tend to act funny in rockets, as they were *designed* for planes, and the simulation for them isn\\\u0027t, well, 100% accurate. Try replacing them with standard rocket fins, either fixed or the movable ones. In addition, I see a disturbing lack of any control systems... that there could be a serious problem. Throw in an ASAS module just under the command pod, add a normal SAS unit to the top of each of your radial quad stacks in that stage, as well as perhaps one on top of each of the small fuel tanks just below that stage, as seen in that screenshot. Even if you don\\\u0027t want to have it taken care of by an ASAS module, controlling a rocket is much easier with more SAS modules, so make sure you have a fair few of them. It\\\u0027s a trade-off between control and weight, so try to find an approximate balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, if you notice the bottom parts of the craft are moving at all during takeoff, add a lot more struts down there; it appears to lack struts, but I can\\\u0027t be absolutely certain.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HarvesteR","CreatedById":4,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-22T15:38:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECanards and control surfaces on the upper parts of the ship are usually not a very good idea.
