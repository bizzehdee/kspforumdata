I heard some where that 0.90 \u00A0mods could work if the contained modles and parts that did not require any plugins , such as command pods or habitats. The mods I was wondering about were only mods that came with certain modles. Is it possible to download these mods and use them with the current version of ksp? and will they work with other 1.3 mods like mods that include plugins?

There have been some significant game engine upgrades since .90. The parts would need an extensive overhaul to work properly, not to mention new aerodynamics, thermodynamics, structural aspects and more that\u0027s been changed. 1.1 brought a lot of under the hood changes and most of them made old mods like that unusable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-04T04:15:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost game versions require mods to be updated, and .90 is several versions ago, so I would not expect those mods to still work.
