I orbited for about .75 of a rotation until I decided on a specific mountain. I took screenshots as I came over it. I hope that if there is ever an official map of the Mun made, that this mountain will be listed on there. I have considered making an entire map, but I\\\u0027m not sure if I have the patience. If anyone wants to have a mountain named after them if I get around to my mapping idea, post pictures on this thread. Make sure to show it from close up and then medium and then afar. This way we can get the general vicinity in which it is located on the Mun, and then a little closer to see where in that vicinity it is and then super close to get good detail of the mountain. The idea was inspired by Jim Lovell\\\u0027s naming of Mt. Marilyn after his wife as he orbited the Moon on 8.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA whole Mun map would be really cool! Are any of the Mares named on the surface or should I have a poll on this thread to name each one?
