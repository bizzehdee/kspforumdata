Squad has said many times that they\u0027re trying to implement all the features they want and do the fine tuning near the end/close to release. Destructible buildings now means the next update (0.26 I guess) could include building new space centers and/or off-world bases (which is definitely needed in stock KSP without having to resort to mods like Karbonite/MKS/KerbTown). Right now it might only be some eye-candy, but it has the potential to evolve into much more since, to me, it\u0027s the logical first step in setting up a framework for adding new buildings -- I think the community as a whole would complain more about having new buildings and/or building new ones if there wasn\u0027t some sort of risk to having them or the new buildings were too over powered because you can\u0027t screw up and destroy your newly built Mun Base because you suck at landing in airless environments. Just imagine screwing up a plane launch, crashing into the VAB, and not being able to build rockets for a few game weeks while it gets repaired -- While I\u0027d like the more technical stuff and controls you describe, I know that there are mods to use in the mean time that cover most of those complaints as well as the fact that Squad just might be waiting for Unity 5 before they start adding in more serious features or revamping the old ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, if I were gonna make a KSP complaint it would be -- I\u0027d rather Squad did a feature freeze with 0.25 and switch to porting that to Unity 5 beta for future releases. I say feature freeze because that allows for bug fix releases and whatnot while also allowing those of us who want to help and produce logs run the Unity 5 version. It could be a bit of a fustercluck, but if U5b KSP testing didn\u0027t allow mods, that would clear quite a bit of that up. Once that testing version is released as, say, 0.26, modding would be allowed again. I say no mods for testing so any crashes, bugs, etc would all be from what Squad is releasing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI run Linux x64 (Mint 17 XFCE) and can install a ton of mods with little issues so I can wait and be patient until Squad gets around to U5, but, like I said, if I had a complaint, Squad not switching to Unity 5 Beta would be it...though it is in Beta so I can completely understand why they haven\u0027t. If you (anybody) run Windows and have about 30GB of hdd space to spare (maybe a bit more for a swap partition), you should look into GParted and making a partition for Ubuntu/Mint for playing KSP. My current Mint XFCE system is 16.2 GB on /root, 200mb on /boot, and an 8gb swap (equal to my ram) and that includes plenty of non-stock apps, working Netflix with both Chrome and pipelight, and AMD\u0027s 14.9 Catalyst drivers (yes, those exist for Linux). It only takes an hours time and that includes partitioning the HDD, installing Linux (it\u0027s literally clickity, click, click, fill a form, click, click with Ubuntu/Mint), installing Steam, and downloading and installing KSP (provided your internet doesn\u0027t suck). Getting back to where you were is as simple as mounting your Windows partition, copy/pasting all installed mods (everything under GameData except Squad and NasaMission), and the \u0022saves/your saved games\u0022 and \u0022Ships\u0022 (selecting don\u0027t overwrite existing files...not sure if the Linux defaut ships are the same as the Windows versions) folders in the root KSP directory.
