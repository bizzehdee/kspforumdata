Not only that, but this idea also forces a lot of lore on a game where nothing is cannon and everything is debatable because kerbals have no backstory at all other than being a very intelligent race with a disregard for security measures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FleetAdmiralJ\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FleetAdmiralJ\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHowever, addressing your first point: it\u0027s hard to argue that you aren\u0027t \u0022giving orders to the kerbals\u0022 or else you would be able to fly command pods without kerbals in them, which of course you can\u0027t. Requiring kerbals to be in the pods to operate them implies that the kerbals are the ones actually pushing the buttons.

I am still the one pressing the buttons in both cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not against kerbal experience at all, or greater differentiation among kerbals, or creating reasons to make keeping kerbals alive desirable; but I don\u0027t think improving ship performance through kerbal stats is a good way to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe realism reasons for that have been discussed to death in this thread already, so I won\u0027t rehash them. Instead I\u0027ll explain why I think it\u0027s a bad idea from a gameplay perspective:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It changes the relationship between sandbox and career modes. If kerbal experience buffs craft performance, then it becomes easier to build craft suitable to a mission and fly those missions in career mode. This is backwards, sandbox should be the easier of the modes as it is supposed to be free of career mode restraints, of which kerbal experience is one. If instead kerbal inexperience nerfs craft performance, then sandbox loses its viability as a test simulator for career mode (a scenario that many players use). Their craft that performs adequately in the sandbox may not be up to the task when inexperience penalties are applied. So either career mode features \u0022easy mode\u0022 spaceflight or sandbox becomes less useful as a proving ground for designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It diminishes the core gameplay of KSP. At its heart, KSP\u0027s play is about designing and flying spacecraft. Kerbal experience affecting craft performance makes the player\u0027s skill at those things less important; to some degree deficiencies in design or piloting skill can be offset by levelling up the kerbals. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It makes the game harder for new players. New players generally kill more kerbals, so it will be harder for them to have experienced kerbals at the controls. This means that new players have to struggle with the performance handicap of unskilled pilots for longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It makes the game more tedious for experienced players. Veterans often want to maximize performance, with a kerbal experience mechanic that increases craft performance they have to grind out the levels for their kerbals if they want to achieve that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- KSP is about rocket science, it\u0027s right in the tagline \u0022It\u0027s only rocket science\u0022. Experience improving part performance goes against that ideal, it\u0027s rocket magic. Maybe some players find that desirable, but it would seem to go against the vision of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that sort of begs the question: How would I make experience relevant? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll ignore the idea of buffs to science, reputation and funds as you seem to feel that the only appropriate buffs for those are already in the game (I disagree with that, but I know such arguments won\u0027t convince you). So here\u0027s a few other ways experience could be made relevant (some of which have been mentioned by others already):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Qualifications. A level 1 pilot might be able to pilot a craft with up to 250 thrust. A level 2 might be able to pilot one with 650. Exceed the amount of thrust that a pilot is qualified to control and control is lost. The numbers are arbitrary and for example purposes, but it could create interesting scenarios where the main pilot is killed or lost and the less skilled copilot has to \u0022limp home\u0022 with reduced thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Specialization. Require trained kerbals to operate certain pieces of equipment. A payload specialist might be able to operate docking ports and RCS. A scientist might be required to operate certain pieces of science equipment or take surface samples. A systems specialist might be required to operate an electrical system consisting of more than a certain number of parts. All these specializations might be graduated into levels, too. This could make multiple-kerbal crews relevant and desirable; as it is now there is almost no purpose in sending more than one to a destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Leadership. A veteran kerbal might be placed in a command role, where his or her experience can make the other kerbals in the crew more effective at their roles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there are lots of ways Squad could make kerbal experience relevant and interesting and make which kerbals are in which seats an important consideration, which I think is the end goal of the experience system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Broax","CreatedById":109333,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T16:06:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cantab\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cantab\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOn Broax\u0027s idea given at the top of the page, my reservation is that it might just feel like having to jump through hoops.

I gave these ideas because most negative comments I\u0027ve seen on this thread (which is growing too fast to monitor properly) seem to focus on not wanting Kerbals to passively affect the ship performance, so I gave a couple of ideas how a system like this could work without affecting the ship directly. Having only the \u0022Bravery\u0022 and \u0022Intelligence\u0022 stats affect kerbals was suggested because those are currently the only two stats in the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI completely understand this might not be appealing to you (and a lot of other players) but if you have an option for \u0022Kerbal classes\u0022 and \u0022Kerbal stats\u0022 on the difficulty settings everyone would be happy...

So you don\u0027t have a scientist on-board but if you have a good uplink with Kerbin and enough batteries the ground crew can walk you through cleaning and resetting this experiment. The problem with this idea is that time is generally looked down upon as a resource since the nature of the game makes timewarp necessary - so it\u0027s either no big deal or just a grind to wait an extra X minutes while the experiment gets cleaned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, I love the idea of differentiating Kerbals.

Most likely, specialists will give currency boosts. Scientists will return more science points (being more thorough), engineers will return more funds (better at maintaining the reusable equipment), pilots will return more reputation (everyone wants to be that guy). These buffs are a little boring; 5% more funds/science/rep on a mission are nice gimmies, but don\u0027t radically change much. They are still a good reason to keep experienced Kerbals alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u003Cstrong\u003EEfficiency of systems\u003C/strong\u003E (like energy generation/drain, science transmission, speed of resource extraction) remains a possible buff, though redundant. If you can just add another panel and 2 batteries, why require an electric specialist?! And you start running into the problem of different Kerbals causing different mission results despite flying the same profile (running out of battery unless you have an electrician aboard). There might be a realism issue here too (how can you make your calculator not run out of battery as fast?), but definitely not as bad as with engine stats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u003Cstrong\u003EControl surface reaction speed\u003C/strong\u003E (mentioned by Maxmaps on twitter) is possible. Would only affect flying in atmosphere, follows physics well enough (assuming the changing deflection of control surfaces is accurate in the sim), and is something a pilot could be better at (pulling on the flightstick confidently). I could buy that, though I could see being annoyed at have the controls be artificially more/less responsive based on the Kerbal pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u003Cstrong\u003ECertification-Requirements\u003C/strong\u003E could limit things already available to Kerbals (repairing parts, EVA thrusters, ability to use certain engines or ship systems), but I\u0027d be careful about removing access to features and then calling it a feature. I\u0027m not sold just yet on Kerbals being unable to press \u0022Launch\u0022 because they haven\u0027t trained on a certain engine. It could be a fun mechanic, but I\u0027d have to see some examples to know it would not cause gridlock or grinding. Further, Flag planting skill isn\u0027t a thing, all Kerbals need their jetpack since tethers don\u0027t exist, repairing wheels can either be done or it can\u0027t (which could be annoying), and I doubt sitting in a chair requires any knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGoofy traits\u003C/strong\u003E could be fun to have... Bill\u0027s a Good Jumper. Bobgas is Flatulent. Lemmy wears sunglasses at night.

This would be cool and unobtrusive (since players can use it for convenience, to role play mission control, or manually control vessels at their leisure). This is basically a whole different feature from Kerbal Experience so it\u0027s implementation is not guaranteed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlenty of good suggestions going around.

The hyperbole is merely ment to show how the prevailing rationale here argues against a basic tenet of videogames, which is character stats. Should all Street Fighter characters have the same moves because we want only the player\u0027s skills to matter? Should all the athletes in a FIFA game have the exact same stats (and this could even be said to be a simulation game) for the same reason? I hear many people claiming it breaks the laws of physics, some implying it breaks immersion - though I\u0027m not convinced of either. Far more importantly: it would add to the gameplay. It would give us a reason to care about the characters - an in-game reason, not something that\u0027s only in our heads. It would make us invest in our kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead we\u0027re probably getting bonuses to funds and reputations.
