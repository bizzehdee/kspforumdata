It could be the way that it simulates how space travel requires extraordinary patience punctuated by moments where quick action and a cool head are called for. It could be that it lets me exercise whichever kind of space travel I want at any given moment, be it trying to be a hotdog pilot or trying to meticulously calculate every little detail to optimize some resource (e.g., fuel or time). It could be the ability to create space exploration with constraints, and send things to explore \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhatever I want\u003C/strong\u003E according to whatever priorities I dictate, making me the rocket and mission designer I wish I could be (with so many ways to get it hilariously wrong).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhatever it is, I want to thank everyone here. The people who put the program concept together; the people who continue to add content and new wrinkles in play; the people here, full of interesting ideas and thoughtful opinions; the moderators, who have to walk a tough line (keeping people with high-octane interests civil!)... I can\u0027t believe I found this corner of the Internet. I wish I had deep pockets and resources to give back to each and every one of you. Thank you all so much for being who you are, and sharing that with the group.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the same vein, I know I\u0027ve been more contentious in some threads than I want to be. Thank you all for being patient with me. I tend to be my own worst enemy when it comes to people I treasure. I really don\u0027t want to be argumentative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027m rambling. Again, everyone, many thanks. Here\u0027s hoping the KSP community remains the same awesome community I\u0027ve seen so far.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
