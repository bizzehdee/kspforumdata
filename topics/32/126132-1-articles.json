Now I\u0026#39;m guessing this doesn\u0026#39;t actually launch the 64-bit player, but I\u0026#39;m confused as to the reason its not grayed out. I seem to remember it being grayed out in v0.90, though I could be mistaken. Does the option have any effect currently, or can I just ignore it?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T05:05:17Z","Content":"\nThere isn\u0026#39;t a 64bit executable so it can\u0026#39;t possibly launch the 64bit version.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RyanRising","CreatedById":79932,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T05:33:28Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Alshain\u0027]There isn\u0026#39;t a 64bit executable so it can\u0026#39;t possibly launch the 64bit version.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think he knows that. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway.
