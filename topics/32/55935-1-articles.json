Somehow I also ended up on the \u0022What not to suggest\u0022 thread, and it jolted my brain: why not?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I understand that there are mods that would break the sandbox aspects of the game and turn it into some kind of space RPG (such as resource mining, a.k.a Kethane), I see no reason why Squad wouldn\u0027t want to improve the stability of rockets (Kerbal Joint Reinforcement), or speaking of Ferram4, the rather poorly implemented stock \u0022aerodynamics.\u0022 C7\u0027s parts were added to the game, so why not?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen a proposal for a random events/malfunctions mod a while ago. Random events are on the \u0022What not to suggest\u0022 list for an obvious reason: lots of players don\u0027t want their crafts to be destroyed or crippled only 80 kilometers from Kerbin, I know what a pain that is. However, some posters brought up arguments claiming that it would add to the \u0022realism\u0022 of the game. I agree with both parties; although I like the idea, random events should be for people who really want it. Maybe a DLC (or a mod by Squad), but certainly not a stock feature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same goes for RemoteTech 2: it adds a great deal of immersion, but it is certainly not something I wanted in my very first save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis all got me thinking: what mods do \u003Cstrong\u003Eyou\u003C/strong\u003E think should be stock?
