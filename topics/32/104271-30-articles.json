I have come up with a simple riddle.\n\u003E Kerbal Space Program has been assigned a massive contract - you need to land on several objects in a specific order. Sadly, the person who gave you the contract likes riddles.\n\u003E \n\u003E The fourth object you visit is smaller than Minmus.\n\u003E \n\u003E The seventh object you visit has an atmosphere.\n\u003E \n\u003E The first object you visit is larger than Kerbin.\n\u003E \n\u003E The fifth object you visit is a moon smaller than the Mun but larger than Minmus.\n\u003E \n\u003E The third and sixth objects you visit are smaller than Vall, but are not moons.\n\u003E \n\u003E The second object you visit is the only moon in a different SoI than the first object.\n\u003E \n\u003E Each object is, at some point in their respective orbits, further from the Sun than the previous one.\n\u003E \n\u003E Which objects are you visiting, in what order?\n\u003E \n\u003E I think I\u0027ve constructed this with only **one** valid solution - but it\u0027s possible I\u0027ve accidentally left more than one way to complete the contract, and I\u0027m curious what people will end up with.\n\u003E \n\u003E Edit: had to change a couple of items within a few minutes of posting when I realized my list left too many solutions.\n\u003E \n\u003E Edit 2: making riddles with only one possible solution can be hard.

Is this really the kind of references we need to KSP v 1.0?\n\nWell, at least my first flight in 1.0 will most likely result in a disaster while trying to check how far i can push the new aerodynamics, so it\u0027s kinda fitting. Otherwise it\u0027s just a great sequence.\n\nOtherwise Apollo 13 is also the proof that you can recover from a disaster in the worst imaginable place.
