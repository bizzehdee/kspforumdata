I just picked it up for the PlayStation and really enjoy the game but unfortunately things I see on YouTube videos I am incapable of doing. I was just wondering if we\u0027re going to get the same updates at some point. Forums from other locations people talk about the fact that there doesn\u0027t seem to be any support for the game and sometimes the last post is as far back as 2022. So I was just wondering I really enjoy the game but I\u0027m wondering if I spent my money in vain due to the fact that I\u0027m not kidding any more support for the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-12T05:49:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWork on KSP1 has ended, I\u0027m sorry to say.
