But with v0.24, it seems that early on, there seems to be no incentive to try out a pure aeronautical career path, perhaps because, a) the mission generator doesn\u0027t seem to generate missions that require long atmospheric flights, or recovery/discovery flights to different areas of Kerbin, \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E the aerodynamic related components don\u0027t appear on the tech tree til much later, or c) I felt that there seemed to be no thrust into that direction of exploration/testing (or am I wrong? I haven\u0027t gone deep into career--are there missions or tests for atmospheric vehicles?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I was thinking, what if in the beginning, you can opt to try an almost purely aeronautics career, that can STILL evolve into a space career, or just skip aeronautics altogether and just aim for a pure rocket career. By this, I mean, the rewards/profit, and perhaps even science collection, should be adjusted somewhat, to give emphasis that the player chose an aeronautics-heavy career path. It can perhaps even unlock certain bonuses, if at the \u0022end\u0022 (I don\u0027t know what signifies the end of the \u0022aero\u0022 career path at this point though) of this career path, the player chooses to go on towards a space career.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am curious as to how the career will evolve, if the player chooses a path that focuses more on aeronautical operations, PLUS space, as opposed to just jumping right away into space/rocketry missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust thoughts, meant for discussion.

A well built atmosphere only plane can deliver a 1-3 tonne payload into LKO at almost orbital speeds (ramp up speed in air breathing over 2k before letting momentum carry you out of the atmosphere). The plane burns 70-80 units of fuel and then returns and land on the runway for 100% recovery while the payload has at most a 100 Delta V burn to orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe returns diminish but I have had SSTMun and SSTMinmas spaceplanes that could drop 1 tonne payloads off on the surface and return. SSTGilly and SSTIke were botderline as efficient and my SSTDuna wasn\u0027t as efficient as a rocket and never could land like the others (Duna flying isn\u0027t easy).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it would be both too hard an too easy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T20:57:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I think you can still \u003Cem\u003Eattempt\u003C/em\u003E an \u0022aeronautics first\u0022 career mode. Just stick largely to the lower half of the tree.

SSTO\u0027s are a bit more complicated, but they should be, and honestly SSTO\u0027s under a \u0022KASP\u0022 type tech tree wouldn\u0027t be something you\u0027d naturally attempt until you\u0027re into the rocketry part of it anyway. Learning to fly a plane is even easier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big issue with it however is that you\u0027d have to add a LOT of new aero parts to the game to make the aeronautic half of the tech tree as fleshed out as the rocketry half would be. It\u0027d basically be Firespitter and B9 combined with some other bits and bobs that are still missing.

With a re-balance pass on the Kerbin biomes (to accommodate the aeronautic nodes) and a multitude of new experiments, you could have an early game where you explore Kerbin, but don\u0027t have to waste countless hours flying to each and every biome just to get to basic rocketry. The way I see it, ideally you\u0027d want to be able to just hit up may be 3 or 4 different biomes (there\u0027s about that many just around KSC) with the basic experiments you\u0027d get (at various altitudes of course) and then you\u0027d have enough science to go for rocketry, or for more advanced plane parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-18T21:13:14Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2014 09:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by G\u0026#39;th\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Liowen","CreatedById":94498,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T21:09:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see something like this, but more focused on probes first and then manned missions.
