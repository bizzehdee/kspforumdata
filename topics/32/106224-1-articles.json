Really?","CreatedByName":"Srpadget","CreatedById":111267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T05:54:30Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Srpadget","CreatedById":111267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T05:54:30Z","Content":"I\u0027m still early in career. I\u0027ve had ONE, count it, kerballed orbital mission (Valentina has been to orbit and back, but Jeb hasn\u0027t yet). I started getting space-tourist contracts. Okay, that\u0027s fine, not sure I want to trust a tourist to survive reentry until after that little heat-shield bug has been stomped, but the game doesn\u0027t know that. I\u0027ll hang on to them and maybe accept them later.\n\nOkay, there\u0027s LOTS of tourist contracts. Good to know. I start rejecting them in order to find something a bit less potentially-lethal, like testing an Ant engine during a suborbital lob.\n\nThen I start looking at the later ones a bit more closely. They\u0027re all looking for Grand Tours of the Kerbin system: Kerbin orbit, Mun flyby, MINMUS orbit. Really? I\u0027ve barely managed to \u0022escape the surly bonds of Kerbin, reach out, and touch the face of the Kraken\u0022 at all, and I\u0027ve got wannabe tourists begging for Mun and Minmus trips? Okay, whatever. It\u0027s not like that\u0027s going to be SO hard...at least once I\u0027ve got the VAB and launchpad upgraded so I\u0027m not restricted to 18 tons and 30 parts (and the aforementioned heatshield bug is fixed). And the early-game contracts pay SO generously, that building upgrades are vastly less grindy than in 0.90.\n\nSo I launch a probe toward Mun to fulfil the \u0022Mun flyby\u0022 record-keeper contract (I assume that\u0027s a built-in standard progression contract, like 0.90\u0027s R\u0026D Department \u0022Explore (next world)\u0022 mission contract?), and once it\u0027s on its way I launch a probe to a specified orbit. Check contracts, intending to grab up a couple of the Kerbal-rescue offers that have cropped up, and I see a new two-star contract: temperature survey of ... POL?? WHAT?? Okay, that\u0027s freaky. Reject it. I need to send Valentina to Mun and Minmus LONG before I\u0027m going to think about interplanetary (not to mention it\u0027s still Day 1 in this save, so the Jool window doesn\u0027t open for, like, forever).\n\nAnd it gets replaced with a \u0022Science from the surface of Pol\u0022 contract offer. POL? AGAIN?\n\nAw geez. This is going to be like the endless spamming of \u0022test TT-70 radial decoupler flying/landed/flying/suborbit/flying/splashed/flying/dangit-test-this-decoupler-SOMEPLACE-I-won\u0027t-leave-you-alone-until-you-do\u0022 contracts in repeating sequence, isn\u0027t it? Only... POL? My very highest tech right now is OX-Stat solar panels powering an Octo probe core mounted on a FL-T400 1.5 meter tank, and the game is obsessing about getting me out to the JOOL system...!\n\nSo have others seen this? Is it an actual balance issue with the contract-offer code? Or is it just me, and I\u0027m the random victim of a couple highly-unlikely random-number results?"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T05:58:00Z","Content":"The Pol thing actually got figured out!
