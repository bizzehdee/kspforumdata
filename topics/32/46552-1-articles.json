Fuel refills of the station by arriving crafts now served a new purpose: to refuel an unmanned drone that travels between the surface and the station and delivers unpowered base modules. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a while I was thinking about refueling the station from the mining operations on the surface, make it fully independent from Kerbin supply, but so far the fuel that is spent by a dedicated transport drone to ascend the Mun and rendezvous with the station in orbit (and then return to the surface) is too much for just that purpose alone, IMO. The light LM\u0027s however already ferry personel up and down and are much more practical to also carry excess fuel to the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I can work out a slingshot system of some sort, though...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the entire setup here is supposed to be an exercise in logistics where fuel and redundancy play a central role.

Here are some of the key things you can do to keep your part count low, and your station organized and effective at what it does. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Throw \u0022making the station look good\u0022 out the window. Form MUST follow function on large things such as stations. If you build your station well, it will end up looking good anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Keep in mind what you want to accomplish. Set a goal for the station at the beginning, and follow that goal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Design a lifter that has a main purpose of station building. Give it either a transfer stage, or an enlarged insertion stage, with its own support systems, so that you don\u0027t need to put RCS, electricity, or probe cores on each station module. This will really cut down your part count. The modules, once docked, will have their own support systems once docked to the rest of the station, where there are already electricity supplies, fuel, and anything else of that nature. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-As others have said, design the entire station, in its entirety, as well as any types of expansions or alterations you may make to it, out in your head, or in the VAB, or, like I do, on paper or in a graphics program. It doesn\u0027t have to be DaVinci quality sketches, but you want to know basically how you\u0027re going to lay things out. This also lets you allocate where you\u0027re going to place resources, and lets you know which modules are actually going to need RCS thrusters. (Not every module needs them, but some of the station\u0027s extremities may need them for better rotation.) It will allow you to plan your light placement, and hopefully your solar panel placement, so that they are away from high-traffic areas, and will receive the best sun exposure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Use as big of resource containment pieces as possible. This is an interesting problem. When you use a larger fuel tank to hold some amount of a given volume, you reduce part count, but you also reduce the potential for modularity. In general, if you\u0027ve set some number for how much of a resource you want to keep aboard your station, you want to use as large of a part as possible to make that happen. For example: Let\u0027s say I want to keep an orange tank worth of fuel on my station. Well, the best way to do that in respect to part count, is to place..Well, an orange tank of fuel on my station. I could also sub-divide that into smaller tanks, if I wanted to spread out the mass, or make the design more modular, but it will require more parts. This is where your planning really comes in handy. When you plan, you\u0027ll balance your needs and decide what\u0027s best for your application. Want a supply of RCS? Use a big RCS tank. Wanna spread it out? Fine, use smaller ones and spread it out. But it really doesn\u0027t make sense to use a bunch of radial cylindrical tanks to store 4000 units of monoprop. It\u0027s more parts than you need.. It may arguably look cooler, but it\u0027s more parts than you need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Keep one unmanned orbital tug on-hand at all times. Your station lifter will peter out sometimes on you, and other times you\u0027ll need to move loads around, so for those times, it\u0027s always good practice to keep a medium-duty unmanned tug on-hand. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Also a good idea, keep an OTV/Space capsule on board in the event of needing to rescue a Kerb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Build your station in lower orbits, and boost it up as a whole with a disposable tug. This will allow your lifter to loft much larger payloads, so you can make much larger modules with less relative parts, rather than boosting smaller payloads to a higher orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are all the station tips I\u0027ve built up over time, and I\u0027ve gotten station building down to an art, and it\u0027s currently my favorite thing to do in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerba Fett","CreatedById":62292,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T17:33:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lsutic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lsutic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes.
