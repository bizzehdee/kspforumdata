Then I decided I need to go to Moho. So, I need delta-V, and lots of fuel. So then I need a big lifter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI spent a couple of hours building the lifter as cheaply as I could (first screenshot), with fine-tuning the TWR and dV to get to LKO, with an asparagus system with a few SRBs in the mix. It worked, but was slightly wobbly, and took too long to assemble and test. So I made a second variant (second screenshot) using just 3.75m parts. It doubled the launch price, but made it more stable and reliable too, and only the outer ring of 6 boosters needs a mod for recovery (StageRecovery), with the inner bundle of 7 being just one huge piece that I can land back at KSC. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI probably could build something in between, with cheaper outer boosters, but this was easy to design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESticking with the latter design, it costs over 1.4M on the pad, but nearly everything is recoverable (when you consider using a mod for the outer onion ring), excluding fuel, a few drop tanks that the mission vehicles have, and two small probes that will be left behind. I recover probably over 600k before my escape burn. And of course the interplanetary stage is recoverable too.
