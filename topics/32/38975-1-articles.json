It can\u0027t be used properly when the flight controls and the rover controls are the same, but result in different rotations. In this case, the axis used to turn is the roll axis, when it should be yaw.

The new SAS is more strict in that regard. But, yes. If the issue is just in that rover controls don\u0027t release the control axis the same way pilot controls do, then it\u0027s something of an easy fix for Squad.\u003Cp\u003EActually, I would even prefer if there was some kind of \u0022rover SAS\u0022. It\u0027d use the same logic that the wheels do to know which way to turn, to know which axis is the turn axis, and would adjust its axis lock behavior accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot if you\u0027re a practical person and have the rover controls rebound to IJKL or the numpad, because using WSAD to control a rover with any reaction wheels at all is a terrible idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow imagine that you have to use RCS.
