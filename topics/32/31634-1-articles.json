This is because NASA technically uses the Air Force\u0027s Eastern Missile Range facilities (tracking stations and impact areas) for launches from KSC and CCAFS, and since they\u0027re Air Force facilities, NASA has to follow Air Force range safety rules--one of which is that it be possible to destroy any out-of-control vehicle before it can threaten populated areas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side note, there was not actually a destruct charge on the Orbiter itself; the linear destruct charges on the Shuttle stack were on the two tanks of the External Tank, plus one on the side of each SRB to terminate their thrust if they were flying out of control. While NASA didn\u0027t heavily publicize the range safety charges, they were never secrets; they\u0027re actually mentioned in the report on the Challenger accident as one of the first things to be investigated and ruled out, since the SRB charges were fired by the RSO about a minute after the breakup (when the SRBs, defying all engineering analysis, did not tumble and instead kept flying and started curving back towards Titusville), and the ET charges were recovered intact in the debris recovery operation. Apparently, the Air Force makes an exception to the destruct charge requirement for human-carrying components of the system, to allow for crew escape; in fact, the Destruct ARM switch doesn\u0027t just arm the charges, but also issues an immediate shutdown command to all liquid-fuel engines to improve the chances of a successful abort (by ceasing the booster\u0027s acceleration to allow cleaner jettison and quicker separation before the destruct command is sent).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a reminder, even after a successful destruct, there\u0027s a hell of a lot of metal that\u0027s going to rain down in the impact area; the point of the range safety charges is to terminate thrust and dump all propellants at high altitude, so that when they burn, it\u0027s not in the middle of a city. (Remember, the Saturn V had, when sitting on the launch pad, fully fueled, an explosive equivalent of a two kiloton atomic bomb, and the Shuttle had about half of that.) There will still be a lot of damage if the impact zone is a populated area, but nowhere near as much as if it fell with the propellant tanks intact...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"csiler2","CreatedById":62800,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T16:20:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NeoMorph\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NeoMorph\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe Abort key fires off the escape option... if you remember to set up the control group correctly.

I knew about the range safety \u0022packages,\u0022 but I didn\u0027t know that the safety option included steps to maximize escape potential for the astronauts. The shuttle was still incredibly dangerous. Looking at the abort options still makes me wonder who thought they might actually work. Clearly NASA had more faith in those options than I did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterestingly, the shutdown command is also sent on Destruct ARM with unmanned missions; a little more digging revealed that it\u0027s in hopes that a booster that\u0027s starting to exceed the tolerances will, if shut down, stay within the hard limits so that they can maybe salvage a partial mission or at least recover the hardware in better shape for the investigation, or something (it\u0027s not entirely clear); they only send DESTRUCT when the vehicle passes the hard limits where it could fall within a certain distance of the designated impact area\u0027s boundaries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Shuttle abort options were *mostly* viable ones; the three later-stage ones were all considered entirely feasible. Transatlantic landing and Abort-Once-Around were just long suborbital flights, which isn\u0027t anything difficult, while Abort-To-Orbit wasn\u0027t so much an \u0022abort\u0022 as a contingency mode to save as much of the mission as possible. (ATO is the only mode that we ever actually used, on STS-51F, when they lost a single engine at T\u002B5:43 and had to accept a lower orbital altitude.) Return To Launch Site, however... well, put it this way. Initial plans were for STS-1 to be a preplanned RTLS test, rather than an orbital flight, but these were cancelled due to mission commander John Young voicing the opinion that NASA \u0022shouldn\u0027t practice Russian roulette.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
