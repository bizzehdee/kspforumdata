Last night I tried a new method of encoding the video because I\\\u0027m *still* trying to figure out why AVS Video Editor sometimes crashes... the new method didn\\\u0027t work. No crashes, but the final vid has unacceptable glitches. So right now I\\\u0027m about to try re-editing the episode and encode it the old way.\n\nNote that I\\\u0027m absolutely *not* promising or even hinting at any kind of ETA for a finished product to be uploaded.\n\nReally, the attention is flattering, and I did start making gameplay videos because I want people to watch and like them... but please recall this is a hobby for me.
