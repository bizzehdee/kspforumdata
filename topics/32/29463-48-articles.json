By the time I\u0027d manually stopped, it was 30 seconds past.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo matter, I quickly oriented the spacecraft, turned on the engines, and throttled up for the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe a minute or so later, I realised that something wasn\u0027t right. The delta-V requirement was hardly dropping, certainly not as fast as it should have for a five-ish minute burn. I went back into normal view, killed the engines, and wondered what was going on. Were my engines blocked? There was a fuel tank between them, though nothing behind. But I\u0027d used them before hadn\u0027t I? I considered sending one of the crew out to EVA behind the engines and see if the thrust was blocked or not, though it\u0027d be a bit of a problem if it was fine and the Kerbal got sent flying. Then I thought, is it some kind of bug? What happens if I use RCS? So I turned on the RCS and pushed down H.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the RCS jets clearly pushed the ship sideways. What the?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it hit me. I still had the docking port on the side of the ship set as \u0022Control from here\u0022.

I didn\u0027t want to wait another orbit, I might not get the Munar assist. It wouldn\u0027t matter for a planet, but this asteroid is considerably out of the ecliptic and the Mun really helps for the inclination change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I burned I watched my path pass through the Mun\u0027s SOI when I\u0027d completed nowhere near the whole thing. Trusting the navball and the node, I kept burning, but then after watching my path drop out of the Mun\u0027s SOI and stay out I stopped and took a wider look on the map view, ostensibly with about 200 m/s left on the burn. It was instantly obvious that I was way off course, my apopasis 60 degrees ahead of where it should have been.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*BLEEP*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was already in such a high orbit that going around wasn\u0027t an option, I had to fix things now. The obvious way was a radial burn to deflect my course, and I set up a node in five minutes to put me back on for the Mun flyby and onwards for asteroid intercept. However, this intercept was a full three days later than the original.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally this burn at least went smoothly, but the cost? An eye-watering, for what was essentially a course correction, 600 m/s. So my cheap 900 m/s ejection burn turned into a 1300 m/s one. And this is a mission to aerocapture a D class around Kerbin.

It was my first one and more of a proof-of-concept/design than anything else. It\u0027s not going to serve any practical purpose in Kerbin orbit other than something to be proud of. Jeb rode it up himself in the cupola module and successfully placed it at a 100km orbit. Bill and Bob launched in an Apollo capsule with an empty seat to go get him and do a little docking practice while they were up there. Their flight goes very well and I get some good rendezvous and docking practice in. They fetch Jeb and all three head home. However, the second stage of the station is floating about 10km away and not really going away...so I reconfigure the crew bus slightly in the VAB and launch again, this time with a grappler and the intention of grabbing that big spinning tank and getting rid of it (mainly for more RV and grappling practice). By the time I get back up there, it\u0027s drifted off further than it had been, so I shrug and make some mock rendezvous runs with the station...no docking clamp fitted to this vehicle so I make a few runs but don\u0027t make contact. Eventually I scrub the rest of the mission and start my deorbit...except I\u0027m overtired and not really paying attention, and my deorbit burn smashes me directly into the station. Two Gigantors kersplode off the station and it goes tumbling away with the autopilot burning the RCS madly to regain control. Meanwhile the crew bus has blown into tiny pieces and the command pod is tumbling away with no engines (service module is still burning and spiraling crazily away) and no parachute - I saw it break off and drift away. Crap. Orbit is decaying. Periapsis is now like 59k. Jeb and friends get out and push to stabilize the orbit slightly above 70 and we quickly fit out another crew bus with a hitchhiker mod and lift off. Jeb and friends are playing cards in the CM when the rescue ship arrives and pulls to a stop about ten meters away. They hop outside and EVA over to the rescue ship. Success! All are aboard. We begin deorbit burn. Just before we start reentry I release the last stage to trim things down for splashdown. Wait. This capsule is awfully small now. Where are Jeb, Bill and Bob sitting? Oh. Right. I didn\u0027t re-arrange the last decoupler to account for the hitchhiker and just jettisoned them. I saved them and then killed them all two minutes later.
