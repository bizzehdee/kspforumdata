I might be able to pull it off after getting some requested permissions from mod designers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, there are alot of mods for habitats, parts, game-breaking features, etc, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with this is that there still usually is no Reason to actually go do this stuff..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow.. check this out.. Imagine you go through the original tech tree first.. then after that, you SLOWLY gain Kethane and habitats,extraplanetary launchpads, infernal robotics, and KAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efinally you would get the engines from interstellar ... I can mod the tree to progress this way.. But Im (not sure but maybe) im savvy enough to make these mods require things from each other.. For instance.. The science lab from Interstellar would come first after the original tech tree, this would allow you to start generating all that rediculous amount of science needed to get the other parts which would be changed to be within the 1000\u0027s. after you unlock kethane with some science, For you to have a kethane producing plant on another planet, you have to have atleast 5 full habitat buildings landed in the same biome with a full crew of kerbals to run the thing.. Otherwise no kethane is produced.. To construct an extraplanetary launchpad, you need atleast 7 of such habitats in the same biome. This adds the necessity to add such buildings and the hilarity would ensue im sure while people are trying to take 5 habitat buildings in one trip to say (Jools moons?). KAS and infernal robotics would be useful (as always) simply to exchange stuff between refinery and ships and maybe move habitat capsules around. Finally you could unlock Interstellar and go crazy with it. Especially if you added another star system to the game. What do you guys think? looking for opinions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E PS: Also posted in addon requests just incase I can\u0027t do this myself.. lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
