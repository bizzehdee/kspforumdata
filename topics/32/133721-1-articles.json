some (usually most) of it\u0027s data space. \u00A0You can then take the result out of the lab and return or transmit it for whatever science points it\u0027s worth. \u00A0However,\u00A0the \u0022data\u0022 pseudo-copy remains in the lab. \u00A0Provided you have at least 1 scientist in the lab, over (a very long) time, the lab will slowly convert the \u0022data\u0022 pseudo-copy into science points. \u00A0The amount of data in the lab decreases and you accrue the science points. \u00A0The rate at which this happens depends on whether the lab has 1 or 2 scientists, the experience level(s) of the scientist(s), and how much data is left in the lab (science production rate falls off exponentially). \u00A0The net result is that you can use the lab to (eventually) get several times the science point value of the original result, 1 time for the result itself which you transmitted or returned after putting in the lab, and then a few more times for the science the lab creates from the \u0022data\u0022 pseudo-copy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis all sounds very attractive but it\u0027s actually useless in practice, for 4\u00A0reasons. \u00A0First, a single surface sample is all that will fit in the lab at one time, whereas your lander has Goo, Materials, thermometers, barometers, and whatever else you can put on it. \u00A0Thus, in just 1 biome, the lander can grab way more science than the lab can handle. \u00A0Second, the lab\u0027s rate of making science is so slow that you can easily finish the entire tech tree with a few biome-hopping landers MONTHS before the lab pays off. \u00A0Third, even if you haven\u0027t quite\u00A0finished the tech tree by then, the remaining nodes will be more expensive than whatever the lab gives you for that Minmus surface sample you stuck in it so many months before. \u00A0And finally, and most tellingly, even a 0-star scientist can reload Goo and Materials experiments in the field, and capsules can hold an infinite number of results (although only 1 copy of each). \u00A0This makes biome-hopping landers cheap and easy, and WAY, WAY faster than anything the lab can do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack when they 1st came out, labs were the only way to reload Goo and Materials, and in fact that was their only real purpose. \u00A0So if you wanted to hit multiple biomes, you had to bring a lab with you for that. \u00A0And do a complicated mission docking with the lab after each biome (or lugging it with you), needing to refuel the lander, etc. \u00A0But then Squad let any noob scientist do that job in an effort to justify the unworkable and unloved Kerbal class system, which made the labs useless. \u00A0So to try to give the labs a new purpose, they can now farm science. \u00A0But due to the factors above, they can\u0027t farm enough science fast enough to compete with biome-hoppers crewed by noob scientists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore,today, labs have no practical gameplay value, except when needed to fulfill base and station contracts that specify them. \u00A0Otherwise, they\u0027re only useful for roleplaying, aesthetics, and the Simple Construction
