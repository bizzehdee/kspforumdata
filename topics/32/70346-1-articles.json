I\u0027m new to the game, but I have relevant real world experience, and I couldn\u0027t help but notice that a straightforward Apollo type re-entry was imposing something like 15 g on my little green guys.

I have taken to planning my final periapsis at about 60km, just skimming the atmosphere. With each atmospheric encounter (and yes, there are many more than one) the apoapsis is lowered a bit, making the subsequent skip just a bit longer. When final re-entry occurs, peak g is greatly reduced (per the end of mission stats, peak g went from 15 to \u0026lt; 5; I think the peak was during initial launch, as I observed nothing \u0026gt; 3 during re-entry).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are in a hurry and you have fuel left, a retrograde burn at periapsis can cut a few of the extra orbits out, or even all if you have enough to circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo the Kerbonauts care?
