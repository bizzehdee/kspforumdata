As Lemay\u0027s comment pointed out, I\u0027m not here to really \u0022complain\u0022 so much, I was just curious who else was really that enthusiastic about the career mode edits in the 0.25 update. I see I\u0027m not alone in my feelings. I just don\u0027t care about the career path for the game. One of you mentioned getting bored with the game after exploring/building stations and etc. KSP doesn\u0027t get boring to me, it never will. The career mode for me dictates too much of what I want to do and sometimes forces me to play the game in ways I don\u0027t want. Personally I have played KSP almost 500 hours now. I started playing a very long time ago just on the demo when there was still just the old launch pad, and then I actually bought the game around 0.22 I think earlier this year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot to re-iterate things or go against the forum rules of posting \u0022features that will never be implemented\u0022, but I wish there was more grander features added rather than the whole career bit. As my original post mentioned, I would die for an official \u0022Saturn\u0022 like planet. Maybe not just Saturn, but a complete solar system because right now we are missing a few obvious gas giants! Saturn is the most beautiful planet in our solar system and most mysterious with it\u0027s ring system. It would have complimented KSP so well if we could have Saturn as part of the game as an explorable planet IMO. They always talk about making more difficulties with this game, Saturn is the place they could do that. Add the rings and make them treacherous to fly a ship through. And Titan, Saturn\u0027s moon, in real life they say the atmosphere is so dense that you could literally swing your arms around to fly in it\u0027s thick atmosphere! That would be a very interesting element to have in KSP, trying to land a ship through an atmosphere like that an avoiding it\u0027s acidic lake systems. What about a molten world as well like the real life Io? We have \u0022Pol\u0022, but it\u0027s just another boring rock where Io is a stunning moon that is constantly geologically active. I also heard about an asteroid belt, would it be nice if there was an actual one in the game and you had to carefully maneuver around it in a harder difficulty? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis game at it\u0027s core was a \u0022NASA sim\u0022 and part of it\u0027s magic was being able to leave the planet and explore space. I feel that the career mode stuff, although it adds more of a \u0022purpose\u0022 to the game, takes the focus off of make this game have a grander universe. I am also an indie developer/programmer myself, I get that this game is huge and takes a while to add things. I\u0027m glad they followed through with the career mode as it feels like something they always wanted in the game. But now that it\u0027s here, I want the focus to go back to new worlds, exploration, and new ships/parts. I also heard they (Squad) were religiously against adding other stars/solar systems but to be honest, I don\u0027t see why not. NASA discovers new exo planets almost on a weekly basis. Assuming we had a dedicated space program with 100\u002B years of experience in traveling in space, reaching these other solar systems and worlds isn\u0027t really that impractical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just an explorer at heart. I\u0027ve studied astronomy and \u0022the big bang universe\u0022 in college, I\u0027m also a hobbyist astronomer with a dobsonian telescope. Part of the magic in KSP for me is the exploring aspect. I like the \u0022science\u0022 system in the game because it gives me a purpose to go to these places, but the currency and contracts are piling on features I don\u0027t really want and kind of diverts what I want to do in the game. There\u0027s also tons of mods that I feel should be part of the \u0022official\u0022 game as well but that\u0027s a different argument for another day. I\u0027m just stating my dislike for the focus on the career mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T02:05:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had high hopes for career mode.

It gives nice elements to rolegaming if you can collect science and have limited (however, very high) budget. I start a new career maybe every other update and play most of the time on sandbox like situation when I have unlocked every parts and have millions of money. However, I hope that career stuff will not take too much attention from essential, space and space flight. That SQUAD could finally decide that career is ready (maybe except some details and balancing issues) and go on with spaceflight things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried 0.25 with hard settings, FAR and DRE but frustrated. It is not hard in technical sense, because I know properties of parts and physics of atmosphere (I am not supersonic aerodynamics expert but it seems that even FAR cause not any problems with small rockets, just decrease delta-v requirement) and orbital mechanics, but I just need to repeat simple basic tasks tens of times to proceed. Career mode would be great, if I was novice and could learn basics with it. But I have played since 0.18 and have visited on every planet before first career version. Therefore I know what to do and beginning is repetition of very simple things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zylark","CreatedById":101018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T05:08:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really like the Career mode - actually never played Sandbox. And now that it\u0027s gotten a bit tougher to progress (playing on moderate - I need my revert and quicksave/load) I find it even more engrossing. I also flavour the game with a ton of mods. For more interesting contracts for instance, the Fine Print mod is awesome. It does give those kinds of missions some here have requested, like say (and is a mission I just did) land on Minmus, collect Laser Surface Scan (from DMagic Orbital Science), Goo Sample and Temperature Sample from Minmus Flats. Combined that with a contract to plant a flag and another to do science in orbit around Minmus. Swatting three contracts in one go and receiving a great payout on Kerbin return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd to that contracts from Station Science and MKS/OKS, some of which are quite comprehensive - more long term projects than single missions - and there is plenty to keep one occupied whilst of course also doing all the other stuff. Such as setting up infrastructure for resource harvesting and planning the road ahead for going to faraway places.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe challenge is to have at least a skeleton of a plan on how you intend to move forward, so that doing the contracts isn\u0027t a deviation and distraction, but rather adds to your capabilities.
