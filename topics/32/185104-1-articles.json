Then I wondered, what color is Pol compared to Bop? I don\u0027t know why I asked myself this, but I looked for the answer. Upon closer inspection I discovered:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: Pol is more orange and yellow compared to Bop\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nB: Bop has a hole on its North Pole, similar to the one on Moho\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpon discovering B, I looked at Moho, and then back at Bop, and realized they are almost identical sinkholes in the almost same spot. So is this a glitch in the map screen, or is this an actual Bop-Hole?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-04T03:20:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost planets have weird terrain features at their poles.\u00A0 It has something to do with how the system works.\u00A0 Often you get a weird mountain or a deep hole.\u00A0 Sometimes neither, either because the devs took the time to smooth it out or it just worked out that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuna\u0027s got some interesting polar features, too, but my favorite is the south pole of Tekto in the Outer Planets Mod.\u00A0 Looks like the Emerald City being besieged by an army of Godzillas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DRAG0Nmon","CreatedById":196609,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-05T02:33:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223611721\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022185104\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221559618433\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002269507\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 hours ago, Geschosskopf said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost planets have weird terrain features at their poles.\u00A0 It has something to do with how the system works.\u00A0 Often you get a weird mountain or a deep hole.\u00A0 Sometimes neither, either because the devs took the time to smooth it out or it just worked out that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuna\u0027s got some interesting polar features, too, but my favorite is the south pole of Tekto in the Outer Planets Mod.\u00A0 Looks like the Emerald City being besieged by an army of Godzillas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting about the pole of Tekto, I\u0027ll need to look that up.
