When you are moving slower, the particles are released\u00A0closer together as you have covered less distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, this (badly designed - its just one of my random screenshots) ship is going at 297 m/s. Say if the particles are released 5 times a second, that means that the 5 particles will be spread across the 297m it has covered, (a particle every 59m) so spaced out like you can see.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022BA0C56B9818AF3D408EB74484D11BE2087E6E047\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/841520017369079393/BA0C56B9818AF3D408EB74484D11BE2087E6E047/\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the ship was moving slower, like 10m/s, the 5 particles would be spaced out over 10m, (a particle every 2m) and so it would appear to have more smoke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe RAPIER engines on the ship is a lot clearer than Wheelsey exhaust, however, the point is the same. This doesn\u0027t effect actual gameplay in any way, nor reflects the status of the engines (except if there is no exhaust, which tends to imply no thrust\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-30T04:00:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKrakensbane also had an interesting effect that when going fast enough, the exhaust smoke would actually \u0022wrap around\u0022 such that the back end of the smoke trail would end up in front of the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
