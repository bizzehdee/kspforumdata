This is a game (i hate calling it a game, its MOAR) that you end up feeling passionate about. And not just about the Kerbals (although how many other games do you care so much to spend hours doing rescue missions) but its about the distance (in terms of understanding) that you go, the things you create, the hours spent dreaming of what else you can do. Truly KSP is an amazing work of art.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadpangod3","CreatedById":58339,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-11T18:42:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAhhh sweet memories, first orbit, first munar orbit, first attempted (and of many failed) mun landings in the demo, what I think was my first deep space kraken attack (scared the hell outta me)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESweet memories \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you squad for creating such an awesome game \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Procyon","CreatedById":57510,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-11T22:29:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe many times I have jumped out of my skin when my ship spontaneously explodes....\u0022sigh\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brabbit1987","CreatedById":65801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-11T22:32:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have not played long enough to have had this experience yet.
