I may be wrong, but I don\u0027t really recall the devs being told that they need to push updates as fast as possible. Sure, people are excited for the next update (and why wouldn\u0027t you be, it looks awesome) but, from my perspective, people just want to know rough timings for the potential release. Sure, there will be a bit of backlash from some people if the game isn\u0027t released when the devs say, however, communication would become key in this situation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf, for example, the devs say that 0.21 will be released during the week of the 22nd July and there is an issue with some bugs somewhere and it doesn\u0027t make the release, providing the devs say exactly what has happened I think this community is mature enough to be able to accept that and be grateful that the devs are keeping us updated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I\u0027m not saying that KSP Weekly isn\u0027t good enough, it gives me my weekly fix and I enjoy reading it. I just think that if they could put a rough timeframe on their KSP Weekly, and keep it updated as events progress, the community as a whole will be a lot happier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s all people want from my perspective, a potential release date (or week) of the game. I think it\u0027d kill a lot of the rumours that start and prevent a lot of the impatient posts that come up from people not knowing when to expect the often over-hyped updates. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I can almost guarantee that their first few release date estimates will be wrong and people will be more than willing to point this out to them. But as they progress in the game\u0027s development (over the period of months), these estimates will become more and more accurate as the devs get better and better at seeing where they are in the stages of the update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said, I agree with the whole point of your post, but like you\u0027re first sentence says, it will be released when it\u0027s ready. People understand this point, they just want to know when it will be ready.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-21T02:22:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf this thread were a persuasive business suited gentleman with a carefully worded and superiorly crafted hypothesis, I would invite him inside to talk it over with coffee.
