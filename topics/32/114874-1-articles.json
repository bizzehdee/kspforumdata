After having accomplished a few, I came to realise something rather counter-intuitive concerning aerodynamics and reentry:\n\nFor the same reentering capsule, an reentry from LKO will be slowed down enough to deploy chutes and land safely; while for some obscure reason, reentry from a suborbital flight (~75km apoapsis), even though going slower initially, will lose less speed and end up too fast too low, leading to unavoidable crash, even when using chutes as soon as possible.\n\nI haven\u0027t conducted methodical tests with different flight profiles to determine the exact circumstances of this event, but I have had a few suborbital flights that ended up crashing, even in the sea, at alt 0, due to being too fast too low.\n\nI thought a some time about it, and have come up with two possibilities explaining this:\n\n1- (the most plausible to me) Vertical velocity issues:\n\nThe craft does not slow down much as it is slower when coming back from suborbital flight, but the reentry being steeper, the vertical velocity ends up being higher than for an orbital reentry. This would explain this issue, and the fact that going \u0022faster\u0022 (with higher horizontal velocity) in a suborbital flight prevents it. The thing is, when getting down to under 10km after reentry, whether you come back from LKO or suborbital flight, your ship has basically the same trajectory, almost vertical, so there would be no reason why speeds are different between the two.\n\n2- KSP aerodynamics being inaccurate:\n\nThe title speaks for itself: for some reason, aerodynamics is inaccurate and creates this issue inevitably. I know that KSP stock aerodynamics is not an exact model of the Earth\u0027s atmosphere, but even when considering approximations, the drag induced by the reentry should make the two profiles end up the same way. What could also cause this, is the fact that drag in 1.0.4 was reduced, and for some aerodynamic reason, this creates the issue discussed.\n\nI made this thread to see if anyone else has encountered this, or would like to discuss it, or even come up with a solution to it. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n(I may add screenshots if anyone asks for some.)"},{"CreatedByName":"LittleBlueGaming","CreatedById":144665,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T17:29:54Z","Content":"Probably because the descent profile is too steep for the mass/cross-section.

At that point you have a lot of drag acting on the ship, but if you are screaming straight down at 2 kps you have only 5 seconds or so before impact. If you are dropping at 100 mps while screaming along at 2 kps sideways, you have a LOT of air to go through before you hit the ground, and all that air will be trying to slow you down."},{"CreatedByName":"Hotblack Desiato","CreatedById":93895,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T07:40:01Z","Content":"but that\u0027s what people complained about in earlier days.\n\nfor example: land an asteroid on kerbin. pre 1.0, that was quite easy. fly to an asteroid, rendevouz with it, bring it on a trajectory that intersects kerbin (not only the SOI, but the ground). and then ride a small craft with the asteroid through kerbins atmosphere. even if the asteroid hits straight downwards (no lateral velocity), the asteroid would just decelerate from \u003E3km/s to 100m/s. and the asteroids speed is lower than its maximum impact velocity, resulting in an asteroid which hits the ground like a ball.\n\nby the way, such a suborbital flight is no problem on earth. for example space ship 2. it launches on white knight 2, goes up into a suborbital flight with an apoapsis of \u003E100km, and falls straight back to earth. and that thing has virtually no heatshields."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T08:05:17Z","Content":"\u003E by the way, such a suborbital flight is no problem on earth. for example space ship 2. it launches on white knight 2, goes up into a suborbital flight with an apoapsis of \u003E100km, and falls straight back to earth. and that thing has virtually no heatshields.\n\nThat thing has wings.

Then you lift your nose, and glide up, until the atmosphere gets too thin and your speed too low to support you. Then you fall into thicker layers, gaining speed (and heat), and glide up again. Instead of trajectory consisting of a dead drop from 100km down, you have the trajectory flattened to about what an orbital reentry would give you, except using wings instead of orbital centrifugal force to stay \u0022afloat\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"Finndibaenn","CreatedById":145700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T08:06:25Z","Content":"isn\u0027t white knight 2 a plane ? if so, space ship 2 will have quite some horizontal velocity at its apoapsis too"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T08:17:58Z","Content":"I was surprised to see this happen to Kurtjmac.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-03T08:20:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2015 08:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro**"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T08:24:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I was surprised to see this happen to Kurtjmac.\n\nWhat do you mean my a Mercury-Redstone type flight?

Sure, going into orbit around Earth takes massive amounts of speed more than it does on Kerbin, but a suborbital launch goes to roughly the same heights and has roughly the same speed coming back down. But Earth\u0027s atmosphere extends much higher, so the craft falling back down is slowed down sooner, especially if you give it a little bit of horizontal velocity as well (like Mercury-Redstone did). But, while that helps, the main reason is:\n\n2.) moar chutes! Capsules returning to Earth have the option of using drogue chutes, which can be opened higher up and at higher speeds than regular parachutes. Even though they don\u0027t offer enough drag to allow a safe landing, they still offer more than enough drag to lower the terminal velocity by a huge amount and slow the craft down to safe main chute levels long before approaching the surface. In KSP, we have drogue chutes too... late in the tech tree, for 2.5m craft sizes. Except, nobody does suborbital flights with 2.5m craft during late career mode. We do them with 1.25m craft during the very first flights! And there are no drogue chutes available to fill that niche.\n\nBoth issues can be addressed by installing mods, but for the stock game, the situation is indeed less than ideal.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You have to travel in a parabolic arc, you can\u0027t just go straight up and down.\n\nOf course you can. Blue Origin is doing it, and the capsule does return safely (they have already done full-scale test flights).\n\nYou just need a good way to slow down, like drogue chutes.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-03T08:34:14Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2015 08:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"Monger","CreatedById":4143,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T08:31:47Z","Content":"\u003E by the way, such a suborbital flight is no problem on earth. for example space ship 2. it launches on white knight 2, goes up into a suborbital flight with an apoapsis of \u003E100km, and falls straight back to earth. and that thing has virtually no heatshields.\n\n100km is not THAT high considering the size and sphere of influence of earth.

KSP approximated the shape of an object by it\u0027s mass. That resulted in every object having the same terminal velocity. Ridiculous.\n\nWhat do you expect would happen if a giant asteroid hits earth head on? \n\n\u003E \n\u003E such a suborbital flight is no problem on earth. for example space ship 2. it launches on white knight 2, goes up into a suborbital flight with an apoapsis of \u003E100km, and falls straight back to earth. and that thing has virtually no heatshields.\n\nYou are comparing apples to oranges in many ways here. \n\n1.) The problem is not about heating, it is about braking. \n\n2.) Space ship two and and White Knight 2 are planes, using lift to get into shallow trajectories.\n\n3.) Suborbital trajectories are totally possible in KSP, just not straight up and down. (depending on the aeodynamic qualities of the vehicle)\n\n4.) Kerbin is very different from Earth, as it is way smaller, while the atmospheric hight is similar. Orbital speed is way higher in LEO (7.8km/s) than in KEO (2.4km/s). On earth that means that you need a heatshield to bleed of that horizontal velocity. In KSP, using realistic aerodynamics, there would be no dangerous heating at all, due to the lower speeds. Ontop of that the path through theatmosphere is quite long, so there is plenty of time to slow down on a shallow trajectory. Squad had to increase heating to get some heat going on.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E a suborbital launch goes to roughly the same heights and has roughly the same speed coming back down.\n\nno.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-03T08:51:59Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2015 08:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Chaos\\_Klaus**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wemb","CreatedById":121979,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T11:48:26Z","Content":"Another thing that caught me is following the recent update, my sub-orbital joy-ride which was perfectly safe now turned Kerbal tourists into meat-paste because the Mk16 parachute, which now needed 700m to finishing deploying was still deploying at 500m since my ship had been designed before the update.
