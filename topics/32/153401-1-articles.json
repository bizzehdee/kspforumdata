implication here-- that \u0022minor updates don\u0027t break things\u0022-- isn\u0027t necessarily the case.\u00A0 In software development, when you have a shipping product that lots of people are already using and you\u0027re proposing changing it in some fashion-- \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eany\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E fashion-- then you pretty much have to take the attitude that \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eall software changes are guilty until proven innocent.\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s nightmarishly hard to change anything while guaranteeing that you don\u0027t break something else.\u00A0 In fact, a lot of the time, it seems like it\u0027s practically guaranteed \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eto\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E break something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s why software producers have to spend time testing their software.\u00A0 A lot.\u00A0 QA takes incredible amounts of time and effort, and \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Estill\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E can\u0027t catch all the bugs.\u00A0 That\u0027s not because the QA folks are lazy or incompetent-- it\u0027s because they have an impossibly hard job.\u00A0 I\u0027m not employing hyperbole, here-- it\u0027s literally, mathematically impossible.\u00A0 There are simply too many potential combinations and permutations of interactions to be able to test everything exhaustively.\u00A0 Cannot be done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore, since it\u0027s impossible to test \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eeverything\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, you have to focus your resources on testing the most important things first.\u00A0 Any simplifying assumptions you can make, to establish large areas that you \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edon\u0027t have to test\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, is a huge win, because that frees up more resources to test the really important things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... say you\u0027re a software developer.\u00A0 What\u0027s a really, really big time saver, that can be achieved simply and easily?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow about this one:\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003EData produced by a new version of the product does not need to be backwards-compatible with old versions of the product.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a hugely valuable assumption to be able to make.\u00A0 Squad\u0027s making that assumption, here-- that stuff saved in 1.2.2 doesn\u0027t need to be openable in 1.2.1.\u00A0 Why is that valuable?\u00A0 Because it means \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethey don\u0027t have to test that\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 They have their hands completely full just testing the following:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Does stuff that the player does in version N work in version N?\u00A0 And does stuff produced in older versions continue to work in N?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot having to test the reverse-- \u0022does stuff produced in version N work in older versions?\u0022-- is a giant win, from a QA perspective.\u00A0 (It\u0027s also a giant win from a development perspective:\u00A0 the devs don\u0027t have to worry about \u0022will the thing I\u0027m doing here cause breakage in older versions of KSP?\u0022, which is tremendously liberating and makes things much easier to develop.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that not all software developers can get away with this assumption.\u00A0 Consider a product like Microsoft Word or Excel, for example:\u00A0 there\u0027s an enormous installed base out there, and the company has to support multiple versions (not just the latest-and-greatest), because it\u0027s not a free or automatic upgrade to newer versions of the product.\u00A0 And Word \u0026amp; Excel files are a commodity that users farm around a lot.\u00A0 If Microsoft didn\u0027t make their file formats backwards compatible, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eand test it\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, they\u0027d be shooting themselves in the foot-- millions of angry users who keep getting sent files they can\u0027t open.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSquad has taken the approach of \u0022there\u0027s only one valid version of the game that\u0027s actively supported, and that\u0027s the current version.\u0022\u00A0 That\u0027s something that they \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecan\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E do, and that\u0027s also something that they pretty much \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehave\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecan\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E do it because it\u0027s a game, and the upgrade-to-newer-version is free, and they\u0027ve provided an automatic upgrade mechanism.\u00A0 So they\u0027ve given themselves an \u0022out\u0022, there:\u00A0 if anyone comes with a problem of \u0022this thing in the old version is broken\u0022, then the answer is simply \u0022upgrade to the newest version, then we\u0027ll talk\u0022.\u00A0 Users are free to run the older version if they \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewant\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E to, of course, but that\u0027s a conscious choice on the user\u0027s part, so Squad doesn\u0027t have to take responsibility for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey pretty much \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehave\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E to do it because they\u0027re a small company with relatively few resources, and KSP is being run on a relative shoestring; they don\u0027t have Microsoft\u0027s gigabucks to play with.\u00A0 If they had to deal with the interaction matrix of how all the different KSP versions play together, QA would become prohibitively expensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo although I can understand that a decision like this can be frustrating to a player... I still suspect it\u0027s the right strategic choice on Squad\u0027s part.\u00A0 If they \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edidn\u0027t\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E put this strict restriction in place, there would be another cost:\u00A0 they\u0027d have to either cut back on QA resources making sure that the \u003Cem\u003Ecurrent\u003C/em\u003E version of KSP works well with itself-- leading to a buggier experience for everyone-- or else they\u0027d have to skimp on the backwards-compatibility testing-- meaning that they\u0027d get flooded with bug reports for incompatibilities, which would be another drag on their time and come at a cost of future feature work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-12T16:41:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, you\u0027ve convinced me.
