Using this method you could make prop planes, helicopters, and giant trucks all stock.\n\nThis has all been changed. Now landing gear do not register the collisions the same and makes this impossible.\n\nThe entire reason I liked KSP is because you could build anything. Now all you can build are planes, rockets and small rovers.\n\n![pLZHUO3.png](http://i.imgur.com/pLZHUO3.png)\n\n![6GjHdGH.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/6GjHdGH.jpg)\n\n![RyHGOxb.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/RyHGOxb.jpg)\n\n![m8bGXXv.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/m8bGXXv.jpg)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/qkVvThydN4c?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**All the insane bearing used crafts I have posted no longer function.**\n\n**I love all the additions... (ESPECIALLY REALISTIC AERODYNAMICS! WOOT!) But they need to fix this!**\n\n*Humble Update*\n\nThe very small landing gear added in the update have real promise at replacing the functions of the old landing gear. They lack suspension so bearing grips can be tighter than ever before. Unfortunately they have very wonky hit-boxes and that makes building bearings with them a bit harder. \n\nAll is not totally lost.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T04:34:19Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 04:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jon144**"},{"CreatedByName":"Aerindel","CreatedById":109952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T20:59:42Z","Content":"Never even knew you could do this...to be fair, all want to do is build rockets and rovers but this would be really useful for that too."},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T21:02:02Z","Content":"Aw man, they killed the landing-gear-bearings?"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T21:03:04Z","Content":"**[MOD - Renamed thread title for clarity]**"},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T21:03:44Z","Content":"Azimech is going to have a fit when he hears this... ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"EladDv","CreatedById":118368,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T21:07:47Z","Content":"as far as i know all previous K drive designs were not fixed by 1.0 (no testing just kasper telling me he wont push the devs the crafts for fix) so far we could still have goo ways of wondering around the system and atmos are going to make it a whole lot more interesting. the drill (by roverdude\u0027s description) may hold a new way of K-drives as the heads (AFAIK) posses colliders."},{"CreatedByName":"Redshift OTF","CreatedById":78679,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T21:16:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Azimech is going to have a fit when he hears this... ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nHeh, yeah, also you can\u0027t make turbo-props now because jet wash heats up parts until the explode. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E as far as i know all previous K drive designs were not fixed by 1.0 (no testing just kasper telling me he wont push the devs the crafts for fix) so far we could still have goo ways of wondering around the system and atmos are going to make it a whole lot more interesting. the drill (by roverdude\u0027s description) may hold a new way of K-drives as the heads (AFAIK) posses colliders.\n\nI don\u0027t believe this problem is related to K-Drives.

The entire principle was to use landing gear to hold in a round object yet still let it freely rotate. Now the landing gear suspension sinks into the object bound to be held in place. This means this old bearing system no longer works with those parts. Bearings are still possible with smaller landing gear.\n\nI\u0027m the one having a temper tantrum right now.

Squad aren\u0027t selling a general-purpose physics simulation, they are selling a spaceflight simulation, and nowhere in their advertising or other material do they suggest that you can build monster trucks using tricks of the physics.\n\nMy guess is that they had to adjust the landing-gear physics in order to improve runway handling.
