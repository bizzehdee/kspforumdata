You now proceed to have infinite mass which leads to having infinite energy, breaking the law of thermodynamics. Infinite Energy then allows time travel, you go back in time to view the Rapid Duna Acceleration Event (from a 3rd person view) (the one that made you break light,) then proceed to break more laws of physics, and finally as a result of infinite mass and energy you implode into a black hole so large that the entire universe would exist in the singularity, so anyone inside wouldn\u0027t notice and there wouldn\u0027t be anyone outside to contradict. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe following is philosophical: But the last part above can also mean the such an event already happened to the real (human) world, and we live in a universe located in the singularity of a black hole, but, we would never notice as the black hole is too large and scattered from our point of view, but since there is no universe outside, there is no external perspective. ...of course I don\u0027t believe this has ever happened, but it is interesting to think about it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-11T13:28:42Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2013 01:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by TheTriniFlyer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-11T13:37:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExameters?
