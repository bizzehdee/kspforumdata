Seriously?\n\nThe game doesn\u0027t track the source of the ore.\n\nIt will check that you mined 500 units of ore on Eve.\n\nThen it will check that you have 500 units of ore on gilly.\n\nIt will not check that those 500 came from Eve.\n\nThus its actually an easy contract ot complete by just sending a few mining drills on a 1 way trip to eve, and then send some ore that you got from Minmus to gilly.\n\n(you could even mine it on gilly itself, but I\u0027m not sure if you need to cross the SOI for it to trip the flag... however, its not much dV to leave gilly\u0027s SOI, and then land again)\n\nThis main contract could be done by including a tourist on an Eeloo mission... at apoapsis, before the Eeloo rendevous, bring Pe down to the sun, get scooped up by Eeloos gravity and do an insertion burn.\n\nBut really, rather stupid"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain H@dock","CreatedById":139017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T09:06:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It doesn\u0027t say anything about landing...so basically all you need to do is pull your PE below the Sun (so you\u0027re sub-orbital), the contract would complete that section, then you could pull the PE back up and all the kerbals survive.\n\nWhile I agree, there\u0027s no way I\u0027m going to attempt that for the same fare as a Kerbin sub-orbital or a minmus orbit.... I actually decline most complex tourist contracts because the money they offer isn\u0027t enough.
