It\u0027s a very simplified system where drag, for whatever reason, is related to the object\u0027s mass, and is the same no matter it\u0027s orientation or position. For example, in stock KSP adding a nose cone to a fuel tank not only won\u0027t reduce reduce drag, it will actually increase it, since the nose cone\u0027s drag is added to the fuel tank\u0027s drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of this means that the terminal velocity in Kernin\u0027s atmosphere is extremely low, and as such it\u0027s more efficient to gain altitude before starting your gravity turn so you can minimize losses to drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re looking for something more realistic, I\u0027d suggest you look into the FAR mod. It adds a much more realistic aerodynamic system, where things like nose cone\u0027s and payload fairings actually make a difference. Furthermore, drag is no longer related to an object\u0027s mass, but rather it\u0027s actual shape and size. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR is most helpful for aircraft, but it has a big impact on rockets too. For example, with FAR, it\u0027s generally recommended to begin your gravity turn as soon as you clear the docking clamps. It also encourages you to design aerodynamic rockets, and to put your payloads in aerodynamic fairings (KW Rocketry is great for this). If you do, you\u0027ll find it requires less fuel to get into orbit than stock KSP. Of course, on the other hand, if you try to fly some of the unaerodynamic monstroties you see in this forum with FAR, you\u0027ll be punished severely.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-06T16:02:52Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2013 04:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Firov\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T17:35:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rdfox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rdfox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPersonally, I have MechJeb start all gravity turns at 1km (unless I\u0027m launching from a planetary body with higher mountains nearby).
