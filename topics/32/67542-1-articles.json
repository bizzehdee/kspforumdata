With it you can load up any past quicksave or autosave and you can revert craft back to how they where at each launch during their development. You interface with it via your browser (or from any web capable device on your LAN, 2nd machine, tablet, phone, whatever) and it has a v simple interface but under the hood it uses the git version control system. It tracks every single quicksave and autosave, but does it in a very space efficient way (thanks to git). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo long as you didn\u0027t wipe your entire save folder then it would have (if you\u0027d been using it) been able to just restore your save with two clicks.
