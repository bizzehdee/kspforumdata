IT SUCKS! I know it wasn\u0027t realistic, but deploying parachutes at any speed was WAY better then not being able to deploy them at 250 m/s or less. Duna landings now require way more delta-v then necessary due to the fact that you go too fast for parachutes to deploy. No more upwards launches! When you come back down, you usually die of lithobraking because of the 1 inch sheet we now call an atmosphere on Kerbin. Atmospheres go so much higher that reentry takes like an hour.
