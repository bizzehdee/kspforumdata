Tried to skip atmosfere by angling rocket but something went loose and BooM! I had only Mk1 and luckily parachute still atached. Jeb face was extatic! Angled capsule to get some lift and as the temperature soared to 2100\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C i left upper atmosfere. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EFrom my first pass i noticed for the first time that heat conducts which was serious danger to Mk16. Soon after i finished writing my speech for Jeb funeral (something, somethin Icarus blabla), capsule entered upper atmosfere. This time it was realy nerve wracking. Capsule was angled as much as posible in hope we will make another skip. By doing this Jeb stayed in upper atmosfere for almost 1/4th of kerbin circumference and slowed capsule down more \u0022gently\u0022. This i belive saved Jeb\u0027s life becouse as capsule descended it again almost reached 2200\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EMost intense moments in KSP for me so far. Had to open another bottle of bear after landing to celebrate. What i think saved Jeb was landing in cooler night side and skipping atmosfere for as long as possible in thin atmo. I dare to say that with similar reentry patern in FAR and DRE(set normal) i would not have as much trouble getting down (partly becouse DRE adds heatshield to Mk1).\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theorigin","CreatedById":141982,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T10:12:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am so glad i rarely used mods/sas while flying crafts in the past!
