Time warping needs to mean something. I think that your space program should have a monthly operating cost that represents building maintenance, salaries, etc. and that operating cost increases with building upgrades, kerbals currently on mission, and probe cores on mission. That way, when you time warp to get a new set of contracts, complete lab science, or get breaking-ground deployed science finished, it actually costs you something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yellowburn10","CreatedById":107558,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-08T19:31:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223850723\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022196677\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221599528767\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022201201\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Neil Kermstrong\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 hours ago, Neil Kermstrong said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen it would have close to no use when in a space station in orbit of a body, and would be the most effective as/in a rover, since it would be able to travel to each biome and transmit full science, but sti that would be a huge nerf and would make it almost into a different part.
