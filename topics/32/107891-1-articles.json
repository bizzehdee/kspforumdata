Oh Jeb, you so silly!![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nFirst of all, welcome to the Forum! I hope you enjoy your stay ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nMy first thought is that your rocket is borderline unstable when the boosters are decoupled, as boosters mounted near the bottom of your rocket increase stability (they have a lot of drag, which lowers the center of drag enough to make your rocket stable). Once your boosters are jettisoned, your ship is *just* unstable enough to flip once. \n\nThis flip decreases your speed. As your speed decreases, aerodynamic forces begin to matter less and gimbal and SAS matter more. So your craft can stay in an upright position without too much of a problem after the flip.\n\nBy the time you reach the speed you were previously at, you\u0027re high enough in the atmosphere that aerodynamic forces begin to matter a bit less, so your rocket can stay stable.\n\nHopefully this makes sense. To learn more about aerodynamics, I humbly recommend my [Simple Guide to Rocket Aerodynamics](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119185). It will help you avoid flipping and teach you how your rocket behaves in the atmosphere.\n\n-Upsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"TimberWolffe","CreatedById":119811,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T15:48:30Z","Content":"I\u0027m thinking slightly off-centre COM or thrust, usually not noticeable until you\u0027ve spent a few minutes in flawless flight"},{"CreatedByName":"Xacktar","CreatedById":88876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T16:21:28Z","Content":"I\u0027ve had the same thing happen a few times.
