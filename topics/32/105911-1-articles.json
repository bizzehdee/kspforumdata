It really doesn\u0027t help that early career mode basically forces you to build long thin rockets without access to wings or fins. No matter if I went into the gravity turn steep or shallow I would always flip out at basically the same elapsed time. Then it clicked that I was going transonic at that time, and it all totally made sense. It still wasn\u0027t easy to re-learn everything, but from then on it was so cool to know that it really is more realistic. Since then I have flown some basic career path planes, which are now such a dream to fly. Previously I always hated planes, but I think I might be a convert with the new atmosphere.
