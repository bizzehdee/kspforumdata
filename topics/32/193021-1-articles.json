Now with Covid-19, I\u0027m not currently working, so I\u0027m putting in my time with KSP. Originally KSP 2 was supposed to be out by now. I\u00A0am playing stock KSP; no DLC\u0027s, but now that I have more time to play, and have far advanced my abilities, I kind of want to buy both of the DLC\u0027s, however I don\u0027t really want to spend half the cost of a new game right now, just for KSP to drop two weeks later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo any of the developers frequent this forum? I would thing with the influx of unemployed people at home, and the next game on the horizon, this would be the right time to slash prices on the DLC\u0027s to get a last bunch of customers, and they would not feel like it as a waste when KSP 2 comes out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly, at the current prices, and coming from Science mode, without the top tier of the tree unlocked, is it worth buying the DLC\u0027s right now? I have played career, but I find it tedious, and I have played sandbox, but I find it boring, not having and particular goals, and I have not learned enough about the best applications of all of the parts available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMostly should I just buy the damn DLC\u0027s, or wait for KSP 2, since I have not really gone too deep into KSP 1 yet?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-10T05:25:24Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2020 05:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by 70mphMax\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
