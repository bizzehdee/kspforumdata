Squad had a difficult task, without reliable metrics by which to judge how people were enjoying the previous changes, it can really only follow its instincts. Forum posts are not a reliable metric... it only tells you what those who are the most engaged with the online community think, but that is only a fraction of the total number of players of KSP... and even if it did represent the general will of the player base, there was no way you could say that there was a consensus on the forums about previous aero changes.
