I arranged the claws position to create a ring on the unmanned spacecraft so that i can grab the unmanned probe with my own claws. However when i switched the ships one of the claws positions was disrupted a lot it wasn\\\u0027t possible for me to fix the claw since the game changed the position of the hinges :S. Anyway i used the other docking ring which was still OK.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Accidentally","CreatedById":29429,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-25T11:01:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Egreat idea \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eseeing your post inspired me to create a space station for claw docking, my aim is to \u0027hug\u0027 the other ship, rather than \u0027hold hands\u0027 \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"colmo","CreatedById":25950,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-25T14:41:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m wondering if attaching something with a suspension, like landing gear, would mean the \\\u0027hug\\\u0027 would be more effective?
