I myself play once every few days, I\u0027d like to play it more but it\u0027s a bit laggy and crashy, probably due to all the mods I have installed. I also play in Career mode, which means\u00A0I\u0027m limited\u00A0in the stuff I\u00A0do by funds.\u00A0How often do you play KSP and what are your reasons for playing it so often/not playing it that much?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Dolphin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-12T11:39:22Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2016 11:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by DolphinDude3\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-12T18:10:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt varies for me. \u00A0Sometimes every day for quite a while, but mostly each day for several days then a day or few\u00A0off. \u00A0Occasionally I leave it for a couple of weeks or so, but not very often.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently just \u0027ticking over\u0027 waiting for 1.1 so playing a bit less, but\u00A0not very seriously.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Curveball Anders","CreatedById":107529,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-12T18:15:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI play when I have the time and feel for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsually a couple of hours each week, plus a bit more reading, thinking and planning which can be done when away from my computer (like on the metro).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-12T18:35:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just started playing again after 2 months so you know.
