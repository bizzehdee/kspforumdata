Another point is that Squad are not artists but software developers who are in the business of selling a game, being they are also primarily businessmen.\u003Cp\u003EAfter a couple of recent news announcements from Squad I think the way to influence them to do what we want is to make them think it will hurt profits to NOT do it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI notice you didn\u0060t actually disagree with anything in my post, I didn\u0060t even call them a band and in fact you agreed that they were in the music business as businessmen. What they said was that the reason they were in the music *business*, rather than just making music for the sake of art, was to sell records. If they were only concerned with the art they would not have started on the road of selling records, in a similar way if Harvester only cared about making his game about \u0060little green men\u0060 for art/himself etc we would not have even known about it. Instead he started on the road of making KSP into a business and like the universally despised UB40 he didn\u0060t do that to NOT sell copies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last point was, it was supposed to be a humorous/witty quote.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen did everyone around here lose their sense of humour?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMyself I could not care less whether KSP can be implemented on a Wii-u, a PS4 or an Xbone.

The game simulates each citizen, where they work, live, go to school, who their family is etc..., and it\u0027s all very CPU dependent. On the PC there is a limit of around 2000 people per island (there are ways to increase this, but you will always run into CPU performance problems at some point), but on the XBox version the population cap was reduced to something like 500-600. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game was otherwise the same, but limited to much smaller cities. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout any mods I would expect KSP to work fine on consoles, just with some similar kind of part limit, or maybe just with terrible performance above a certain point.

Convoluted interfaces would be necessary to carry over most of the functionality of the PC version to typical consoles (building in particular would be a nightmare with analog sticks), but the presence of an actual touchscreen ups the options considerably. The hardware limitations are not even half the big deal they\u0027re being made out to be; I\u0027ve heard tell of people getting KSP to run just fine on less powerful hardware before. Really, controls are what make or break a game more than anything else (loading times being the next big one on the list).

They released a very much so unfinished product. In my personal opinion, realistic aero and reentry damage should have been put in before a full version.

All I\u0027ve seen from KSP people is tactful since the porting madness started months back, and it hasn\u0027t done anything (except give us more ports). If you bought the game and want to influence it, being clear and opinionated is the way to save it. Not being milquetoast until its too late. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsoles are great for arcade games, but not simulations, and nearly everyone on this forum wants some sort of simulation.

Squad will be neck deep trying to sell schools Wii\u0027s, faxing NASA for more licensing rights, and creating yet another set of jet engine parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP has an opportunity to be the king space simulator for a long time, but they\u0027re wasting their lead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
