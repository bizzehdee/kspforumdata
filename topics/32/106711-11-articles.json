What I\u0027ve learned so far is that there appears to be a \u0022tipping point\u0022 of getting enough velocity for the ramjets to develop ludicrous thrust. For my designs to date, I find I need to keep it under about 9.5 tons per jet engine and about 14 tons per nuke. The 28t craft shown above works great on 3 jets and 2 nukes; at 30t is doesn\u0027t make it.\n\nAscent profile for the Nooxie 6:\n\n--Start on full throttle jet engines 1 and 2. \n\n--Fly off end of runway, retract gear.\n\n--Start jet engine 3 and pull up to 25-30 degrees\n\n--Keep full throttle all three engines. Velocity should rise steadily as thrust compounds, beginning to spike around 10km\n\n--At 18-20km you should see your velocity approaching 1200 m/s, climb rate 400 m/s or better, and jet thrust decreasing.\n\n--Start the LV-Ns when you begin losing velocity. You may have to start early, around 18km, if TWR is low.\n\n--When jets flame out, close your intakes. \n\n--Depending on your TWR you will need to climb at 30-45 degrees. Watch your time to apoapsis; nose up to always keep it \u003E30 seconds out as your apoapsis increases and your periapsis becomes less negative\n\n--As you approach orbital velocity you can nose down to prograde, and circularize.\n\nGood luck! There may certainly be room for improvement in the above and I would love to hear how you make out.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Make the best of it: stick some VTOL Vernors on the underside for low-G landings, use the bicoupler to carry a smidge of oxidiser just for them.\n\nYou know, that\u0027s not a bad idea.
