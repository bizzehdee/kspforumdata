Kerbals believe they are alone in the universe, but that is only because other races are afraid to brave the rings of spent SRB\u0027s and corpses surrounding the planet. Kerbals has very large heads, and two large bony ridges in their mouths that function as teeth. These \u0022Teeth\u0022 give the impression that kerbals are herbivores. Kerbals have green skin, giving the impression of a plant-based life form. This makes sense, as they do not need food or water, nor sleep to survive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheory Gallery:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Kerbal Spacesuits\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps one of the most ingenious inventions of the Kerbal race (outside of the Self-Detonating SRB and Jeb\u0027s Coffee) is the technology which they utilize in their spacesuits. These marvels of high science are capable of maintaining any Kerbal wearing one indefinitely, as well as shielding them from falls that would easily kill a Kerbal not in a spacesuit. It was long believed that Kerbals simply do not need to eat or sleep, but recent discoveries have shown that this is not true. It is, however, very true that a Kerbal in a spacesuit does not need to do either, as their spacesuit\u0027s functionality halts all biological processes for the Kerbal in question.

I saw somewhere the KSP devs said that Kerbals are not plants, but as far as I know they have not said what they \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E, if not plants. If a plant creature eats other plants does that make them a carnivore or a herbivore? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets look at the facts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Kerbals are green in color, this does not guarantee they are plants. All photosynthesis needs is a color that can absorb the chosen light wavelength efficiently, on a planet called Earth, this color is mostly green, but it has been observed that dark colors may be just as effective if not less efficient at absorbing visible light from Earths star, The Sun. So, the green skin does not mean a Kerbal is a plant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Kerbals seem to be able to survive near indefinitely without food or water or on very tiny amounts of it, this suggests another possible source of nourishment, prevailing theory seems to be photosynthesis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Kerbals are able to endure extreme amounts of stress and gravitational forces without any known physical side effects, this suggests very flexible but strong skeletal systems and a lack of complex internal organs and circulatory system. Judging by facial expression they do experience emotional side effects when under the effect of these extremes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: Kerbals have no known sexes, it appears they are Asexual. It is possible they are produced by a, as yet unseen, \u0022Queen\u0022 Kerbal and these are just the \u0022Workers\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: Kerbals display an advanced intelligence but seem to lack a fight or flight response, they show fear, or elation in the case of one unique subject, when under stress but do not run or fight, they continue on what ever task they have set for themselves This is possibly due to the absence of any known animal life, other than Kerbals, on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6: When a Kerbals body is put under more stress than it can handle they explode into a cloud of grayish black particles, it is thought that this is the death of the Kerbal, but some individuals seem to come back, where from is still unknown. This also suggests a more complex entity involved, an entity with the ability to store the personality of the individual and re-grow that individuals body after the previous bodies destruction, these individuals seem to be known by the local populace and are given orange flight suits to signify their celebrity and immortality. This entity seems to have an unlimited supply of material and unique personalities to produce these \u0022Workers\u0022 with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7: Kerbals seem to not have adaptive emotions, each individual reacts to stimuli differently, but will react the same way to the stimuli as they did the first time they experienced said stimuli, no matter how many times they experience that stimuli. For example a Kerbal that fears heights will always fear heights throughout its entire life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8: Kerbal astro/aeronauts seem to be graded by they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re courageousness and stupidity, any applicant that gets negative scores in these fields is likely to be given jobs as scientists, engineers, or other essential jobs needed to run their space program. It seems a high score in stupidity, meaning a low intelligence, does not stop a Kerbal from becoming a astro/aeronaut. While in a Human space program a low intelligence, or high score in stupidity, would likely result in disastrous accidents and numerous deaths and is therefor avoided at all costs. Kerbals on the other hand seem to prefer high stupidity applicants despite the numerous accidents and deaths. Perhaps this is a translator malfunction and its supposed to mean smarts or intelligence, or Kerbals are using the dumbest most impressionable individuals they can find to either dispose of them, or use them should they succeed in not dieing horribly. In a way I find this method practical and logical, as long as you don\u0027t consider the moral ramifications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9: A \u0022natural\u0022 Kerbal death has never been observed. All Kerbal deaths seem to be violent or the cause of something that translates to the word \u0022Kraken\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10: The Kerbol System seems to be located in a physically compressed space time region, known physical laws are different in the Kerbol system than in the Sol system, this phenomenons cause is still unknown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWall o text I know, but these are a bunch of theories I thought up on the fly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nadreck","CreatedById":89087,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T03:27:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I find the Kerbals remind me most of the Moties from Larry Niven\u0027s \u0022The Mote in God\u0027s Eye\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jaxal1","CreatedById":85315,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T17:35:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think the reappearing Jebs, Bobs and Bills are reincarnated or anything like that: I think we\u0027re getting Jebidiah Kerman Jr. (III, IV, V, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T17:52:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jaxal1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jaxal1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t think the reappearing Jebs, Bobs and Bills are reincarnated or anything like that: I think we\u0027re getting Jebidiah Kerman Jr. (III, IV, V, etc.)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy hypothesis on this is, that there are clone tanks for Bill, Jeb and Bob and every time one of these 3 dies, another clone is raised and, a short time later, appears in the Kerbal Spaceport.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately cloning (and storing the DNA samples needed for this) is expensive on Kerbin, which is why it was decided that only Bill, Jeb and Bob should profit from this technology\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T17:55:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Godot\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Godot\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy hypothesis on this is, that there are clone tanks for Bill, Jeb and Bob and every time one of these 3 dies, another clone is raised and, a short time later, appears in the Kerbal Spaceport.\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately cloning (and storing the DNA samples needed for this) is expensive on Kerbin, which is why it was decided that only Bill, Jeb and Bob should profit from this technology\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I rather like my theory better.

Ants are also known to sacrifice theyr own existance for the survival of the nest. Kerbals take this concept to a whole new level though. Instead of just sacrificing for survival, they will sacrifice themselves for every little thing the queen figure seems to demand of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn keeping the instect analogy, Kerbals seem to posses some form of what we know as \u0027hyvemind\u0027. The Kerbal \u0027workers\u0027 all seem to follow orders given to them exactly, and these orders can seemingly be transmitted instantaneously over unlimited distance. What this means is, that the can transmit information faster than the speed of light. This could be either a form of telepathy, or maybe some highly advanced form of quantum entangled particles, or it could be information transmission as we know it, modified by the modifyd laws of physics, as talked about in theory #10 of Savage117.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0027entity\u0027, as talked about in theory #6 of Savage117, could be some form of a devine being.

This would explain the devotion of individual Kerbals to it\u0027s orders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn alternativy theory on this, is that the \u0027divine being\u0027 is in reality some extremely technologicly advanced alien, stranded in the Kerbol System. Sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic afterall, so it could be that the Kerbals are tricked into THINKING that it is divine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe existence of such an alien would explain the seemingly random jumps of technological advancements that the Kerbals are making, including the sudden jump from nearly nothing to space travel.
