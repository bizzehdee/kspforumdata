Unfortunately, I discovered that when I staged it and turned around to dock, it just sat there between the two, blocking my docking approach. I wound up using two decouplers back to back. Staged the first to separate the CSM from the LM, turned the CSM around to dock, after docking staged the second to free up the CSM engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have had designs where the only option was to connect two parts with a large docking port. They were very fragile, I wound up using lots of struts around them to hold everything together. Even putting a large docking port against a decoupler is fragile.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
