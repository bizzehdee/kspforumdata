Its been fun and it keeps you focused. Unlike the rest of the game where you either need science and a limitation in parts or pure fascination (which can wear off if you play the game a lot) to keep you going, doing something like this gives you a solid goal and schedule to work with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* My idea is a four stop system between Munar surface, my orbital command station (which was constructed out of an old Kerbin space station that was moved to Munar orbit and retrofitted), my Kerbin gateway station (which I use as a pit stop for interplanetary flights) and then Kerbin\u0027s surface. I\u0027d use a basic lander for Munar-Orbit transport, a shuttle for inter-station travel (larger payloads and pre-fabricated colony components would use their own transportation tailored to their requirements) and then a reusable (technically) drop pod system for returning to Kerbin\u0027s surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Col_Jessep","CreatedById":4071,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T02:25:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had a little burnout myself recently and I enjoy Mount\u0026amp;Blade Warband for a bit.
