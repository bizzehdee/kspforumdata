Instead of gambling on whether or not you can recover a test vehicle (especially one you spent weeks waiting on to be built) and lose or regain the full price, you simply pay a flat fee (depending on the vehicle and the testing parameters chosen) to enter a simulation instance. You can simulate anywhere you have legitly been to before, in orbit or on the ground, even modify the point in time... but when you exit the simulation mode, the game reverts to where you were before and nothing you did in the simulation actually ever happened. Except that the funds are gone, of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is even more useful than you think, since some of the most complex things you build are also those that take the longest ingame to finish being constructed.
