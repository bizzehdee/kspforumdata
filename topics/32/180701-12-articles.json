I\u0027m Ok with this change though, it looks better. Better to be nearly the same as the mainsaile and look better, than to loook better but be worse than the mainsail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBobcat: EC and crash tolerance changed? Meh, I remember it as\u00A0a bit underpowered relative to the others... so I guess it still is. It looks to be\u00A0just a wee but better than the reliant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheetah: I thought this was fine where it was. I see its 355 Isp, not 345 Isp now. Its not on the wiki as a change though... maybe something changed on the bobcat too? Anything over the old stock poodle may be a bit OPd IMO... but I\u0027ll be playing on 3x rescale, so...

Its weakness IMO was its low thrust to cross section area. It got hit with the nerf bat hard.... a 60% increase in mass, no change to thrust or Isp. I guess it needed it, but its still too weak for its size IMO, I would have tripled mass and doubled thrust... now its just a better swivel engine, but for similar size rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWolfhound: Nerfed... I see the wiki notes aren\u0027t very good \u0022improved Isp\u0022... when it has a worse Isp (better for balance, but worse for performance). its mass was increased too... but 380 Isp is still really good. I would have nerf batted this down to 360\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKodiak: Used to be just a slightly worse reliant engine. The changes make it better as a first stage engine, worse as a 2nd stage (well, at least lower vacuum Isp),\u00A0relative to the Reliant. I\u0027ll approve...
