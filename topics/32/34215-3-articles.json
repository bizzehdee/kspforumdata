After that we\u0027ll start sending our modules up. Once one person is done, all they need to do is take the save file and send it to the next in line. There should be no need to edit the save file, especially if we can add ourselves as Kerbals in the Kerbonaut Complex, so it should be a simple process.

My current space station in my own game is 314, and that\u0027s noticeably laggy - enough so that I\u0027m considering putting up a refueling depot instead in .21. Remember, it gets ridiculously difficult to dock at a certain point, and everyone who has to deal with, say, more than 150 or 175 parts on approach is going to have a hard time if they\u0027re on a lower-power machine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can make a pretty awesome station for 300 parts, too. My station is chock full of lights and RCS thrusters, but if I removed those it\u0027d probably be closer to 150 parts or so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to go through the thread and count the number of folks who\u0027ve signed on, and then we can divide the total number of parts by the number of users.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, so my count gives me some 18 members. Even with a part limit of only 20, we end up with a final space station count of 360 parts, which is really pushing it in terms of lagginess on slower PCs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat poses an interesting problem. Should we all work on the same station? If we do, our part counts will be harshly limited to 20 parts each, or less, and we\u0027ll still have huge lag issues. Unless we have a heck of a lot of coordination - ie, you build a docking ring, she\u0027ll do the fuel reserves, I\u0027ll handle the core, etc - we\u0027ll end up duplicating modules or adding useless modules. The other question is whether it\u0027s even really necessary for a space station to have eighteen separate modules. How could they each have a function? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, I\u0027m inclined to suggest we break into two teams. This allows us to have individual part counts higher, and allows more flexibility in station design. If we increase our part limit to thirty parts each, now, we can build a station at 270 parts fully loaded, which is on the lower end of the lag spectrum. Or, if we chose to do 25 parts, we can keep the parts down to, what, 225? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is going to need some more thought; what\u0027s the minimum amount of parts we can have on a module without them all turning into some Hitchhiker modules ported together?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is probably our only reasonable suggestion, considering we have a whopping eighteen (or so) members. We can do this in a few separate ways:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) Put two stations in the same orbit, 180 degrees apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Put two stations in Kerbin orbit, one in a significantly higher orbit than the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) Put one station in Kerbin orbit, and another in orbit around another body, likely the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption 1 has the most cause for concern; it would be pretty easy to mistake the stations for one another, and you might end up rendezvousing with the wrong one. Option 2 is probably the middle of the road option, albeit perhaps the least interesting for the viewers to watch. Option 3 is interesting in that it allows us to break up the members into, say, more and less experienced. We could even have people sign up for Mun Station or Kerbin Station, if it comes to that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course - we could even split into three teams of six. Part count is still a concern, but not by much - six modules at 40 parts each gives us a final count of 240, just outside of the lag limits on most PCs - but then, we\u0027d have the same issues, and the project would become more and more clouded with three stations in the Kerbin system. (Kerbin - Mun - Minmus, anyone?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is going to take some thought. What do people think? Should some people just sit this round out? Or is multiple stations the way to go? Or, ultimately, do we want to cut parts down to like 15 parts per person, to build a single, massive station?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-09T06:23:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2013 06:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Jm419\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"esinohio","CreatedById":57681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-09T15:03:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m really game for just about anything here.

If we went with #2, one station could maybe be a large fuel depot in low Kerbin orbit while the other could be a proper station up in a much higher orbit.

The idea of splitting up into 2 or more teams would work best with option number 3 that he suggested.

After reading through JM419\u0027s post I think I would lean more toward options 2 or 3. Of course that is assuming we split into two or more teams for the build as JM419 suggested. If we went with #2, one station could maybe be a large fuel depot in low Kerbin orbit while the other could be a proper station up in a much higher orbit. Getting a fuel depot built can be challenging itself so it might not make it too easy on less experience people.\u003Cp\u003EJM419\u0027s points about the part counts seem right on the mark to me. The idea of splitting up into 2 or more teams would work best with option number 3 that he suggested.

Instead of two stations, why not build a station and a refueling depot? That way, there\u0027s some more flexibility in the station, and we wouldn\u0027t have to run four tanker flights to refuel it at a high orbit. The refueling depot could then be a dedicated orbiter designed only for fueling up interplanetary flights - something which would be \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E useful if we ever decide to build a station around, say, Jool. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou know - that could be our eventual goal of the project. We could consider this a persistance file that we slate for general release in the future, with all the infrastructure intact. A Kerbin station - refueling depot combination would allow users to skip the in-between steps and go straight for interplanetary flights. We\u0027d be building a persistance file as a service to the community. \u0022Want a space station, but hate docking?

Ingame months, at least, because we\u0027d have to wait for the planet to rotate underneath the orbit, and then we\u0027d have to launch regardless of where the space station is. Whereas you can build an equatorial station in a day if you time your rendezvous right, this would have two variables to worry about.
