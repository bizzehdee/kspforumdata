The cockpit is fine for driving, but to be oriented correctly for \u003Cem\u003Elanding\u003C/em\u003E I have to switch to the probe core, which is tricky to get at as it\u0027s tucked up underneath the chassis. So the deployment sequence is as follows:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Open bay doors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Switch control to rover cockpit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.

So steps 4 and 5 have to be done in a big rush to make sure there\u0027s time for steps 6 through 8 before the rover crashes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving a \u0022switch to\u0022 action assigned to a group would reduce the cumbersome steps 4 and 5 down to a single key press.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdmittedly this scenario is a bit of an edge case, but I\u0027m sure there are others where this would be useful. And in any case, it would definitely be more convenient even in less time-critical situations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
