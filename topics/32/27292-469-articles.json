Even though it was designed for trips like this, I hadn\u0027t actually flown it to Laythe since 0.22, so I was overdue for a return trip. It doesn\u0027t quite have enough range to get there and back without any mid-flight refueling, but it gets pretty close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormally, I top off my planes in low Kerbin orbit before long trips like this, but this time I decided to see how far I could get without any Kerbin-area refueling or slingshots.

(The fuel station had already landed there to refill, but it\u0027s unmanned so it doesn\u0027t really count.) This plane is designed to land vertically on airless moons, although slopes can get pretty hairy, especially at night. Pol has a very rough surface and little illumination, so landing on the night side makes it very difficult to judge your landing spot. I should have just waited untl day, but I was in a hurry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/soPTuAp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022soPTuAp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, it was off to Laythe. I slingshotted off Tylo right into a close Laythe intercept (altitude ~30km) with let me use two light aerobraking passes before attempting a landing. Unfortunately, this meant landing on the night side of Laythe as well, which makes it very hard to spot islands even with satellite maps:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DZJvh9l.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DZJvh9l.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(The island I\u0027m going to land on is a bit to the right.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made it down safely, landing in a small valley on the center of that island.

And yet no land is in sight, all ocean. At least Tanbur had stopped screaming when we reached leveled flight... Where do they hire these newbies nowadays ? I wonder.
