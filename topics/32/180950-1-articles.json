Also I really missed a 2,5m 6 way hub in the vanilla parts catalogue.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen I took a first look at the KSP forum to find more gameplay related answers I was pleasantly surprised by the generally friendly tone of the messages, and the amount of activity by forum users. So ofcourse I ended up on the forum again in search for answers on this latest question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Modding games was new to me. Sequels yes, expansions (cd-rom, dvd-rom, later DLC\u0027s) yes, but modding? Before KSP I was on kind of a big break from gaming, persuing hobbies in the fysical world instead. So modding was quite unknown to me, though I heard of it before.\u00A0Then I discovered the \u0022add on release\u0022 page and found the answer I was looking for in the form of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E (\u0026amp; \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E)...and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E. Now I\u0027m not really a techkid, physics wonder or programmer, so \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E, which takes care of for example dependencies, was a bulls eye for me. And so modding began. I found the \u00A02.5m 6way hub in the form of DrJets chopshop, which has been in my much used modlist ever since...there are quite a few beautiful mods providing several hub parts, but drJet\u0027s was my first. A new dimension\u00A0of gaming opened up to me. Without modding, I probably would have put KSP aside more than a year ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m curious what your stories are!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan
