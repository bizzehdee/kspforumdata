My return lander for the Mun, Minmus, Duna, Ike and Gilly has approximately 7000-7500dv. My Jool omnilander has around 14,000dv for the standard mission profile. But if I wanted to propel a probe at high speed from Kerbol, I expect I could manage at least 18,000dv. I can essentially achieve whatever dv I want at the cost of part count lag and ease of payload operations or maneuvers. So essentially there is no usual amount of delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"acealeam","CreatedById":61964,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T18:12:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022brobel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022brobel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Edo you mean delta V once in orbit or at launch?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"duncan1297","CreatedById":57230,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T20:48:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI usually just look at the ship and if it looks like it has enough fuel I launch.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T20:58:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022duncan1297\u0022 data-cite=\u0022duncan1297\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI usually just look at the ship and if it looks like it has enough fuel I launch.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m guilty of this.
