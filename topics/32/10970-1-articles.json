This is about best, where you are getting the most bang for your fuel usage. From there its about what throttle position gets you the most speed for the least fuel used. It will vary by design usually. My designs that use more engines will usually have a set or two deactivated once I\\\u0027m cruising."},{"CreatedByName":"Vostok","CreatedById":22467,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T00:44:32Z","Content":"Therein lies the crunch; what throttle uses least fuel for most thrust based on how many engines... hmm"},{"CreatedByName":"Herpderpsslerps","CreatedById":8284,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T02:18:41Z","Content":"Its going to be a bunch of experimentation, that is about all you can do."},{"CreatedByName":"samstarman5","CreatedById":12469,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T05:19:35Z","Content":"I feel like I missed an important meeting.
