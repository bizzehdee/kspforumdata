The reason for asparagus staging is so good in KSP is that both engines and fuel tanks themselves are much heavier in KSP. Just by making simple 3 stack one stage configuration into 2-1 two stage asparagus increases the Dv by around 24%. Comparably, real world engines are ~6x lighter and fuel tanks are ~4x lighter, that Dv increase would be less than 5%. And thats not counting additional pumps and fuel line mass (that would probably bring the Dv increase to a whooping ~4%).

However, you can potentially make up for some of that by moar rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere comes a point though where it is difficult to make moar rocket, and then you need to do something else, like boosters or asparagus staging.

Test even a modest sized scale model of a rocket with different staging and stuff might cost millions of dollars and take years. Then scaling it up and testing real parts and rockets would take many times more money and lots and lots of time. NASA and others are just starting to get good at rapid prototyping and making cool machines that\u0027ll allow you to 3D print complex metal objects, so they can do things like make one-off turbo pumps, valves, rocket engines, etc so they can much more cheaply test things like asparagus staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t save much money if you spend a billion dollars on a failed asparagus staging design to allow you 10% more payload in the same rough size, mass and construction/operating cost of a rocket. If it works and is reliable great, but if it doesn\u0027t work out, you wasted massive R\u0026amp;D on a failed design.

The only way to test the first stage was to launch the thing. The engines were not designed to be reused - they couldn\u0027t be \u0022hot-fired\u0022 (or full-duration test fired) on a test stand and then flown - the first time the engines were used was the real flight. Oh, sure, they did test individual engines in test stands and hoped to know how the mass-produced engines behaved, but nothing beats actually test-firing every engine before flight (like SpaceX does it) or at least testing whole stages on test stand to see that they work as advertised. Soviets just took 30 mass produced engines, never fired them, built a whole stage complete with analog KORD control system to ensure that any failing engines would be shut down on the fly (it had multiple-engine-out capability), and hoped they all worked in a full-blown launch.

Incredibly they built almost a dozen and flew four of them, full stack, with every single one going all Kerbal before end of 1st stage flight. One of them happened to take out the launch facilities, causing substantial delays as it was rebuilt. Last try got pretty close - about 7 seconds short of staging.
