Even Scott Manley mentioned he needs to push the IKJL buttons sometimes just to check in which direction the craft will go before committing to a maneuver. I had that problem too before i tried switching I and K controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt really made a ton of difference, now by watching the craft from behind IKJL are 100% intuitive J/L : left/right I/K : up/down translation. After a moment of using this system i could rotate camera around and still press correct buttons without even thinking of it. It made it much easier to dock as i could concentrate on other docking aspects, and sometimes just use Nav ball to see where the ship was going and make corrections, and camera was set from the most cinematic angle for screenshots. (Something that was completely out of the question on default controls).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is another part that points that the default control mode is incorrect. If you use Mk-1 cocpit from IVA view the \u003Cem\u003E will actually translate downwards. Similarly if you have a velocity vector forwards on Navball, JL will go naturally left-right but IK will go down-up which is reverse.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIn RL planes we use a control set that\u0027s set in \u0022top down\u0022 position, stick movement (rotation of its base) corresponds to rotation of the aircraft. If we look at the controls from the back, it looks like top and down are reversed. (i think the idea of reversing controls is from this effect). But it\u0027s intuitive to use (especially when using joysick or flying an actual plane).\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EFor RCS translation in RL people usually use a small stick that is in line with the front-back of the craft, this makes pressing UP or moving the stick UP and going UP intuitive, KSP has it reversed where pressing UP moves ship down. (I\u0027m not 100% sure how it is actually done on space shuttle but i think i saw it used that way somewhere).\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESo i have a question, does anybody here tried reversing default IK ? Or is maybe the KSP control method is copied from the way its used on ISS or Space shuttle? (That would still not disqualify my method as in KSP our main camera and reference points are outside behind the ship, something that is not possible in RL).\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MRab2","CreatedById":22875,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T17:35:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOkay, let\u0027s do docking:\u003Cp\u003EStep 1: Put yourself in an elliptical orbit with your apoapsis touching your target\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 2: At ascending/descending node, correct your inclination to your target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 3: Wait (and time accelerate) until you and your target pass close by at that intercept.

It made it much easier to dock as i could concentrate on other docking aspects, and sometimes just use Nav ball to see where the ship was going and make corrections, and camera was set from the most cinematic angle for screenshots.

As your ship rotates, so does the camera (so the ship stays fixed on the screen and everything else seems to be rotating instead).

Well, you probably know by now, the point is to get the two orange arrows in the map view to line up with each other. Or the two purple arrows, which is the encounter after the orange arrows. The top arrow pointing down is where you will intersect the target\u0027s orbit, and the bottom arrow pointing up is where the target will actually be at that time. You also need to get one of the green sideways arrows, the ascending/descending nodes, in contact with the orange arrows. If you don\u0027t their altitudes relative to the planet will be the same at the encounter, but their altitudes relative to each other will be different because their inclination isn\u0027t the same. Just experiment with the maneuver nodes and try and get is as close as you can, using the guidance computer isn\u0027t going to hurt anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother important point is knowing when to launch. If you launch when your target is on the opposite side of the planet, you\u0027ll need to spend a long time in a lower or higher transfer orbit to catch up to the station, or let the station catch up to you. It varies with different rockets and ascent profiles, but I find a good time to launch is when the target is just coming up over the horizon relative to the ship waiting on the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nerfherde","CreatedById":63692,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T19:55:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, alot for your help everyone.

Now you\u0027re flying sideways. Hit T. And leave it alone until you come back with another ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Launch your second craft. During launch, pay attention to whether your target will be west of you (behind you) or east of you (ahead)--this assumes you take off and do your gravity turn to 90 degrees (east).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2a) \u003Cstrong\u003Eis it behind you? Make your apoapsis higher by ~5000 m\u003C/strong\u003E. Your speed will be slower the higher off the surface you are, so your target craft will catch up to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2b) \u003Cstrong\u003Eis it ahead of you? Make your apoapsis lower by ~5000 m\u003C/strong\u003E. Your speed will be faster at lower altitudes, so you will catch up to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Circularize your orbit. If you are not using nodes, use nodes. Learn how to use the three axes. Don\u0027t be afraid--a node doesn\u0027t lock you into anything and you can **** it up and delete it and start over. experiment, see what burning in different directions will do to your orbit. Nodes give you a blue tick mark on your navball--orient to follow it, then engage your engines to consume the delta-v that it\u0027s calculated you need in that direction. Use nodes to make concentric circles--inside your target to catch up, or outside your target it to let it catch you. \u003Cstrong\u003EAgain, the circles should be 5000 m apart roughly\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esome notes about nodes: yellow is prograde (faster) and retrograde (slower)--it has the effect of making your orbit larger or smaller. Blue moves you towards the planet or away; it has the effect of shifting your orbit left or right, so you can correct for lopsided orbits (unequal apo/peri). Purple corrects for orbits that are not equitorial--it matches the planes of each orbit so they\u0027re parallel. That\u0027s important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Set your target craft to be your target. now click on the speed on the navball until it says \u0022target\u0022: if you\u0027ve done things right, then this number should be getting smaller, it is your speed \u003Cem\u003Erelative to your target\u003C/em\u003E. Now your orbits are probably not on the same plane--look at it from the side and see if they line up. If so, great, go to the next step, but it\u0027s probably lopsided. But there is a point where they cross, and when you look at it top-down there should be a dashed line between the orbits at that point (called ascending or descending node). Place a maneuver node there and adjust the purple vector so you match planes. Orient towards blue tick, wait till you hit the node, and burn till your orbits are in the same plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Now we wait and plan--NO ENGINES YET. watch the \u003Cstrong\u003Epurple tick marks\u003C/strong\u003E as you complete each orbit; they show how close your craft are. They should be getting closer by about 30-80 km per orbit. \u003Cem\u003EWait until the purple node says you\u0027ll pass your target \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eon the next orbit\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E. Now **** gets real. Your practice with nodes is about to pay off. Start placing nodes around your orbit and go prograde (yellow open) if you\u0027re catching up, or retrograde (hatched yellow) if its catching up--you want to adjust your orbit to touch your target\u0027s, ideally at a ascending/descending node. Then mess with the other vectors (blue and purple and yellow) to get the predicted distance (purple tick marks) to be 1 km or less apart. It is possible with less, but SO MUCH EASIER the closer you are. If you can\u0027t get it close, erase the node and try somewhere else. For the time being, ignore what your resulting orbit will be, you just want an intersect--just makes sure you don\u0027t put your periapsis at 10km or something to accidentally de-orbit. Once you\u0027ve set your nav coordinates, orient your ship towards blue on the navball, wait for the timer to hit zero, and burn, but not all the way --\u003Cstrong\u003Enow here\u0027s the clutch part\u003C/strong\u003E: with about 10 m/s left, cut the engines and \u003Cstrong\u003Edelete your node\u003C/strong\u003E. You\u0027re still pointed in the right direction anyhow. Now barely turn on your engines and keep track of how close your closest approach will be. keep tapping the engines until your closest approach stops getting smaller. Often times you can get closer than you thought. but if you miscalculated you will still be as close as you can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Close the gap--complete the orbit and wait for your closest approach. \u003Cstrong\u003EMAKE SURE YOUR NAVBALL STILL SAYS \u0027TARGET\u0027\u003C/strong\u003E. once you\u0027re within 2000 m or so, reorient your ship: were you at a lower orbit and catching up now? you need MOAR SPEED--orient towards prograde (open yellow navball icon) and burn until your relative speed is zero. Were you at a higher orbit? You need to slow down; burn prograde (hatched yellow navball icon) until relative speed is zero. At this point you can use RCS to get really good and zero\u0027ed. Check your orbits. They should magically be pretty damned close. You\u0027re halfway there!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn important note in these final stages (again, make sure your navball is set to \u0022target\u0022): NOW yellow prograde/retrograde are speed relative to your target--it\u0027s the axis of your motion. Purple prograde/retrograde are the direction towards/away from your target. These are critical to get straight if you\u0027re going to close to within 50 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Find the purple prograde marker on the navball--this will point you towards your target. is your nose pointed at your target? Good. What\u0027s the distance? Divide that number by 100, and burn towards the target at this speed (if you are 1000 m apart, burn at 10 m/s). That way you\u0027ll hit the target in 100s, whereever you are. Flip ~180 around towards the \u003Cstrong\u003Eyellow\u003C/strong\u003E retrograde marker--you want to close distance, but stop ALL relative motion at every step, reorient towards your target, burn at 1/100 the distance (speed = distance/100), flip 180 degrees while you\u0027re closing and point towards yellow retrograde, stop, rinse, repeat until you\u0027re within 50 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) Remember your target ship in step 1, and how you oriented it to point at the north pole? You\u0027re going to do the opposite with your chase ship now--point towards the 180 degree mark on the horizon line on your navball. your ships should now be parallel and pointed in opposite directions. What this does--even though your orbits are the same now, your orientation as you complete an orbit changes. If you find you\u0027re drifting apart, this is usually why. but if you\u0027re oriented north/south, your orbits are parallel, and any change in direction is matched by your target. MAGIC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) Hit \u0022v\u0022 until it says \u0022chase cam mode\u0022. Look from the back end of your ship. Tap the \u0022I, J,K,L\u0022 keys, see which direction your RCS ports thrust. Often times this is not intuitive--\u0022J\u0022 may thrust you left, right, up or down, just keep it straight. It\u0027s always OK to tap it to remind yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA note about RCS: You want your RCS ports \u003Cstrong\u003EONLY AT 90 DEGREE ANGLES\u003C/strong\u003E. A rule of thumb is \u00221 set of 4 for every 10 tons of craft\u0022. Try to balance them along the ship\u0027s center of mass. Using the I,J,K,L keys \u003Cem\u003E shouldn\u0027t \u003C/em\u003E push you off axis, but if it does, that\u0027s why you re-oriented towards 180 degrees--you can use the ASWD keys to keep pointing in that direction. Also, when you\u0027re building the thing in the VAB, looking out the door of the VAB is \u0022south\u0022--placing RCS ports along the cardinal directions using this as a reference point (0/90/180/270; N/E/S/W) will make a big difference using the IJKL keys, as only one pair should fire at any time. Your goal is to deal in only one vector (one direction out of the three in 3 dimensions) at any one time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10) This is the money shot. More than ever you must think in 3 dimensions now. Correct your distance to target ONE VECTOR AT A TIME. First, use H and N to get the get the ships--still parallel--separated by a hair \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhen looked at from the side\u003C/strong\u003E. Now look from one side, then another, see which direction (vector) you\u0027re furthest from your target, and tap IJKL to see which pair of RCS keys will thrust you in that direction towards your target. Tap WASD to keep pointed towards 180 degrees--if your ship is small (less than 20 tons) and well balanced, you can keep ASAS on, otherwise you won\u0027t be able to see the RCS directions and you\u0027ll burn through monoprop like whoa, so you\u0027ll have to keep pointed south manually. Once you get close, stop. Try not to go more than 0.2-0.3 m/s--you\u0027ve got to stop. Now repeat this \u003Cstrong\u003EONE VECTOR AT A TIME\u003C/strong\u003E until you are damned close. Pay attention to your H-N vector, and try to keep the ports close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11) Keep shifting your focus from top to side to side and seeing which direction you\u0027re off, and then back to stern and hit the right IJKL RCS key to close that gap. Sometimes you can adjust the view to look along the axis of your target ship so you can gauge what \u0022stationary\u0022 and \u0022matched\u0022 and \u0022parallel\u0022 are. Once your ports are matched and STATIONARY, tap H, get a bit of thrust, MAKE SURE ASAS IS OFF, and enjoy the fruits of your hard won fight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest of luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerba Fett","CreatedById":62292,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T20:03:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MRab2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MRab2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat?
