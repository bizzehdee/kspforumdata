Then I discovered I could just eva and end flight to get rid of a kerbal (this also avoids the problem of eventually having a crown of kerbals at the laucnh pad, just waiting for a rocket to fail and rain down upon them. Currently working on seeing what I can get into orbit, without going totally crazy. Need to clean up my rocket saves, since most of them are invalids from the last version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething still seems to be wrong with the 2m parts as well. I got a beefed up coupler so that I am not launching huge rockets fastened together with twine and prayers, but my fuel tanks are crashing into each other, which tells me the fuel tanks are now buckling in my rockets. Don\u0027t know how to fix that. Think I\u0027ll leave them alone for now, since the only 2m rockets I can get into space are only designed for orbital purposes, as rondevouz craft. Ones rescue rocket should not be less reliable than every other rocket in the fleet. Odd thing is, my ascendant design used to work just fine. That rocket has performed rescue missions before. Might just rebuild it from the ground up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt some point I might try to design an inverted lander, as proof of concept for performing vanilla missions entirely from IVA, with the hope of being able to land on solid surfaces without needing anything to give me a more exact altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Accelerando","CreatedById":543,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-12T01:17:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel tanks crashing into each other may owe something to a bug that sometimes causes parts to jump every 6km travelled by the vehicle, assuming it\u0027s happening with that kind of frequency/timing as you lift off. I\u0027ve noticed it more often while using Damned Robotics in orbit \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC one time it punted a Kerbal so hard it killed him \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC but every now and then it can affect one of the more solid, blocky rockets of my fleet, which are generally the most stable for me. If the problem can\u0027t be fixed by struts, rebuilding is probably the best way to get around this bug.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randox","CreatedById":18034,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-12T02:49:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I really noticed that tonight watching my main rocket launch.
