It\u0027s fun to engineer and troubleshoot the system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, there is a Mars-like planet and Jupiter-like planet, and a pluto-like dwarf planet called Duna, Jool, and Eeloo. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods I recommend are KW Rocketry, Nova[slug]Punch Remix, and the KSPX (Kerbal Space Program Expansion) pack, which adds a few parts to the game that look like they are from the game itself, not mods. In fact, they are becoming actual parts, more in every update come from KSPX. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get used to the game I recommend a YouTuber named \u0022Scott Manley\u0022 and \u0022Wernher Von Kerman\u0022 over any other, although Wernher\u0027s tutorials are outdated to some extent, he usually updates the playlist every time something changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game needs a good computer, because although the graphics aren\u0027t too intensive, the physics simulations are very intensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is very controversial, but if you just can\u0027t fly, or learn orbital maneuvers, there is a great and very well put together autopilot called Mechanical Jebidiah, or MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWho is Jebidiah? Jeb is a badass. He\u0027s the first Kerbal you fly in your rocket, and he is the most brave. His other orange-suited brothers, Bill and Bob, are scared all the time. Jebidiah is supposedly the best pilot there is, which is why MechJeb is called what it is, because the copied his brain and put it in a computer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to re-enact historic NASA and Russian Launches, there are a few Mods you might want to try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Historic Russian Spacecraft Pack: Includes Soyuz, Progress unmanned module, Buran, and a few others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELINK: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24724-0-20-X-BobCat-ind-Historical-spacecraft-thread\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24724-0-20-X-BobCat-ind-Historical-spacecraft-thread\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--FASA Gemini and Mercury: This includes the Redstone, Atlas, Titan GLV and IIIC rockets, and the Gemini Spacecraft, fictional Gemini Lander, as well as a conversion kit to turn the regular Mk1 Command Pod into a Mercury Spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELINK: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24867-19-1-Gemini-and-Mercury-Pack-FASA-v1-3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24867-19-1-Gemini-and-Mercury-Pack-FASA-v1-3\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Apollo Mission Pack: *WORK IN PROGRESS* Saturn V rocket, Apollo Lunar Module and Command/Service Module.
