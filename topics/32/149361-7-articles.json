If they were making a statement in leaving, fine - the statement wasn\u0027t for you, it was for the employer. \u00A0You have zero expectation of inside knowledge here, any more than you deserve to know why your favorite celebrity couple got a divorce or why your favorite car company decided to switch from coke to pepsi in its cafeteria. \u00A0You paid for a product, you didn\u0027t buy stock in the company. \u00A0You\u0027ve received that product. \u00A0If you have a problem with that product, Squad has an obligation to address your product-related problem. \u00A0They do NOT have any duty to discuss employment issues with anyone, and in fact it\u0027s probably illegal for them to do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem here, as I see it, is that this forum has created an expectation - an unreasonable sense of entitlement, even - of intimate knowledge of every facet of Squad\u0027s inner workings. \u00A0Life doesn\u0027t work like that. \u00A0You paid for a product, that doesn\u0027t mean the company has to lay itself bare to you an your slightest whim. \u00A0That doesn\u0027t mean people have the right to come on here and harass \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022105198\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@RoverDude\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0for trying to be candid because they don\u0027t like what he said. \u00A0Squad, in fact, has zero duty to even maintain this forum, and could pull the plug on it in the next five minutes and leave you all in the dark permanently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s clear that things are changing. \u00A0Squad has been less forthright about the doings of developers, Devs themselves have been less inclined to post on the forums (and no wonder) and they\u0027re hiring a lot more community-focused people to interact with us. \u00A0You\u0027re not going to have direct access to the developers anymore, you\u0027re going to have people like Baddie and Uoumowhatever to deal with. \u00A0That\u0027s how it\u0027s going to be. \u00A0You\u0027re not *entitled* to anything but that icon on your desktop. \u00A0Demanding answers and acting like a general-purpose douchebag on here isn\u0027t going to change that. \u00A0Some of you guys need to get over yourselves, seriously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-06T13:14:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI never claimed to have any sort of legal contract.
