The success rate of all my rockets is very near 100%, with assorted safety features and escape systems if anything goes wrong. There is also an \u0022restricted inclination\u0022 and a \u0022restricted altitude\u0022, which my spacecraft cannot pass or face legal reprecussions. This ensures that if any manned vessel breaks down, it is within range of a spacestation or one of its RCS tugs to reach and bring them back to the station to await a shuttle to bring them home. Even on beyond LKO-missions, the craft are loaded with extra fuel and supplies in case of emergencies, and there is a spacestation around the Mun and a small surface outpost to host anyone whos stranded. Travel for non-Expedition missions is pretty limited to within range of a base or station, and it is sort of restricting and highly inefficent (I still haven\u0027t been to all the Mun or Minimus biomes yet), but to this day, not a single Kerbal has been lost in space under my watch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I\u0027m proud of that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-03T01:58:26Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2014 01:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by NASAFanboy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-03T02:30:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeeing as I\u0027m a human, not a Kerbal, I\u0027d have quite a task of riding in one of their rockets.
