been dinking around with seaplanes ever since 1.05 came out and have begun to form opinions of what works and what doesn\u0027t when it comes to general design characteristics.\u00A0 I\u0027m wondering if my thoughts are generally in line with those of others so here goes....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPart Breakage\u003C/strong\u003E:\u00A0 What causes part destruction in the water is a huge mystery to me, and this unknown lurks under all my observations, casting doubt on my conclusions.\u00A0 Horizontal speed seems irrelevant.\u00A0 I\u0027ve had boats\u00A0reach 250m/s without damage but on various runs, sometimes parts (even those apparently above water) die at lower speeds.\u00A0 I\u0027d really like to know what it is that destroys parts in the water these days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWater Takeoffs:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 Provided your CoM is slightly aft of the center of the parts\u00A0that are touching the water, taking off from the water will eventually happen or become possible with elevator input once you build up sufficient speed for your wings to lift you.\u00A0 If your CoM is forward of the longitudinal center of the wet parts, you probably won\u0027t achieve flying speed.\u00A0 Achieving high speed on the water seems to depend on natural planing, the whole plane lifting slightly and the nose lifting more than the tail, thereby\u00A0reducing the surface area in contact with the water, and this only happens if the CoM is far enough aft.\u00A0 While up pitch can force the nose up into a planing attitude if it won\u0027t come up by itself, this almost always results in a decrease in speed due to deeper immersion of the tail plus the drag of the deflected control surfaces.\u00A0 But all in all, water takeoffs are much easier than water landings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWater Landings:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 At any reasonably SANE landing speed (say less than 100m/s), part breakage is rarely if ever an issue.\u00A0 What IS an issue is fliipping over.\u00A0 This is apparently caused vastly increase drag happening at the tail upon contact with the water, with the plane\u0027s forward momentum causing the nose to drop sharply.\u00A0 The further below the plane\u0027s CoM this point of 1st contact is, the more leverage the sudden drag has to flip you.\u00A0 So you want to land as slowly as possible to minimize your momentum, and you don\u0027t want too much vertical space between the part that hits the water first and the CoM.\u00A0 Also, once the nose hits the water, its buoyancy acts against the nose-down moment, and the longer the nose is, and the wider it is, the more buoyancy and leverage it has to keep you from flipping.\u00A0 But even designing the wet parts to conteract the flipping, I still find about 50m/s\u00A0to be\u00A0the safest possible landing speed---slower is better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGeneral Design:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 There are 2 main options here:\u00A0 A realtively\u00A0conventional plane design with pontoons of some sort stuck on below, or a flying boat where the main fuselage itself is in the water and\u00A0small pontoons under the wingtips.\u00A0 Taking the above points into consideration, I see some general guidelines for each type.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EPontoons\u003C/u\u003E:\u00A0 The design of the plane itself is pretty much the same as normal, which simplifies balancing lift, CoM, and thrust.\u00A0 However, if the pontoons are too far below the actual plane, they cause severe flipping tendencies on landing, to reduce which they should extend out ahead of the main fuselage nose.\u00A0 The pontoons also need to be relatively large diameter compared to the fuselage to provide the necessary buoyancy to float at all, and also for the all-important counter to the flipping tendency.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EFlying Boat\u003C/u\u003E:\u00A0 You need to keep as many parts out of the water as possible to minimize water drag, so you can gain take-off speed.\u00A0 This typically means a shoulder wing configuration, intakes on top of the fuselage, etc.\u00A0 All this complicates proper balancing of CoM, CoL, drag, and thrust, which can cause problems in flight both in the air and in space (if this is an SSTO).\u00A0 Also, the main fuselage should be pretty long (as in zero or few radial fuel tanks), so the buoyancy of the nose has the most leverage to prevent flipping on landing.\u00A0 Mk2 fueselage makes the best flying boat IMHO due to its width and built-in lift, both of which tend to prevent flips on landng.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven the need for some sort of pontoons, either to hold up the whole plane or just the wingtips, all seaplanes will have more aerodynamic drag than landplanes so will need more thrust to do the same jobs.\u00A0 They also have more mass so need more wing to stay in the air at the same speeds, so need more thrust for that to reach the same speed as well.\u00A0 And they also need enough wing and/or flaps to land and take off at 50m/s or less, which again means more thrust.\u00A0 Acceleration during water takeoffs is slow, which means a longer,\u00A0less efficient burn just to get airborne, so more fuel is needed, which means more mass, which means more wing, which means yet more thrust.\u00A0 So any sort of seaplane will therefore be bigger and more expensive than a landplane to do the same flight, and somewhat more difficult to make SSTO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComparing pontoon planes and flying boats, it seems to me that pontoon planes have less drag in the water (due to less wet surface area) so are easier to get airborne (shorter takeoff time and distance with less thrust needed) but more overall mass and more drag in the air due to have essentially 3 fuselages.\u00A0 Plus they\u0027re harder to keep from flipping on landing.\u00A0 However, they\u0027;re easier to design and fly.\u00A0 The flying boat has fewer extra parts added to the bare necessities it needs to fly so is lighter and has less drag in the air, meaning it\u0027s\u00A0easier to SSTO (at least on paper).\u00A0 It\u0027s also safer to land.\u00A0 But it can be a bear to get airborne so needs the most thrust of the 2 types, and present some tricky design and possibly flying challenges.\u00A0 Overall, therefore, there doesn\u0027t seem much to choose between the concepts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you all

First ever submarine aircraft carrier and a pretty good example of why the idea never caught on. Designed as a K-class \u003Cem\u003Esteam\u003C/em\u003E powered submarine (yeah, that went well. The K-class\u00A0were insane deathtraps even by the standard of World War One submarines. And that\u0027s saying something.) but converted to a regular diesel-electric design.....with a 12-inch gun mounted in the front of the conning tower. The idea was that because torpedoes were terrible back then you\u0027d surface off the side of a merchant ship and blast it with the massive gun the instant you surfaced. This had some rather massive issues as a concept, but they built three of the darned things anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter realising how bad an idea this was (also after M1 sank because a merchant ship accidentally rammed it....ripped the big gun off, and the sub flooded through the loading system), M2 got converted in 1925 or so\u00A0into what it looked like in that picture....the gun got removed and the space where it had been fitted became a hanger.\u00A0Trouble is, having a really big door leading into your submarine (which from that photo looks like it might even open inwards?) is a \u003Cem\u003Ereally bad idea\u003C/em\u003E. Especially as, since it was built in the same way M1 was, that hanger bay wasn\u0027t that well sealed off from the rest of the submarine.\u00A0One day the hanger flooded during a launch\u00A0and the sub just went straight down. As you\u0027d imagine, the Royal Navy didn\u0027t really pursue the idea after that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[/end history lesson]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn KSP however we don\u0027t have pesky things like water pressure, tensile and compression strain on materials, or having to worry about the wellbeing of our crews at all. So a submarine aircraft carrier should be perfectly viable ingame. Though it might be easier to make one that launches and recovers aircraft from a proper flightdeck rather than using seaplanes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn terms of actual seaplanes, I tend to build flying-boats. Much easier to build and control, and I\u0027m used to high-wing designs anyway since that\u0027s what I normally make anyway. Really big planes also tend to flip a lot less. I modified the Mallard that comes as a stock plane recently....buffed it up from the weedy stock engine setup to having a 4XPanther setup in the wing roots (also more fuel, obviously). Using my standard test for long-range stable flying (turning on SAS, taking off with full afterburner, then having the crew bail out so I can fly it until the engines run out of fuel using only the flap-deployment menus that don\u0027t shut down in an uncrewed vessel) I made it almost halfway around the planet *on afterburner*. And then landed it in the dark using only flap deployments.\u00A0So you can get pretty good range out of a big flying boat even if you do something really stupid with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-04T10:27:48Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2015 10:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fendleton\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMust not get dates wrong on unimportant history lesson\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arsenal3185","CreatedById":154240,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T23:32:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222307527\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126850\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449208733\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002269507\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 12/3/2015, 11:58:53, Geschosskopf said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, several nations built at least 1 sub that could carry aircraft internally and others carried aircraft in external pods on normal subs.\u00A0 For most, this was for the same reasons that they all\u00A0put aircraft on their cruisers, to provide long-range recon to the ship in the days before radar, to help it hunt for prey in commerce warfare.\u00A0 The Japanese different mainly in doctrine, viewing their submarines as scouts and attrition weapons of their main battlefleet, instead of lone raiders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut is it an I-400?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-08T16:05:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222309967\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126850\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449358322\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154240\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022arsenal3185\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn \u200E12\u200E/\u200E5\u200E/\u200E2015\u200E \u200E5\u200E:\u200E32\u200E:\u200E02\u200E, arsenal3185 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut is it an I-400?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, As \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/22867-fendleton/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002222867\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/22867-fendleton/\u0022\u003E@Fendleton\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0noted in the post above, it\u0027s HMS \u003Cem\u003EM2\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 If you\u0027re into weird submarines, you should follow up by reading about the K class he mentioned, probably the most notorious things even put in the water.\u00A0 There are a number of books devoted to them and the horrors they inflicted on poor matelots.\u00A0 Here\u0027s an example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6308933-k-boats\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6308933-k-boats\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-08T18:31:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you build a seaplane with submarine capabilities and a small positive buoyancy, then takeoff is not an issue.
