(which i made enough money on to finish my savings for a new game.) however, i encountered a bug that would not let me load up a save, freezing the game and my 8 GB RAM mac in the process. with the help of squad bug support, we isolated the problem to steam, as when i ran it isolated from steam, or without steam running, it worked perfectly. (was my first game time in ksp in the two weeks of figuring this out.) so i then asked if i could undo my transfer to steam, as, at least when i transferred, it said that if i had a problem due to the transfer it could and would be undone. (i can not find this anymore, so they may have removed it, but i clearly read it when i transferred. this was the reason i decided to take the risk in the first place.) however they emailed back saying that they could not do this. i am at a loss, as although i can still play this game, it requires a good bit of file delving and program managing to do, and gets very annoying on a busy day when my computer is getting shut down when i go for a wile and then getting turned on again and i have to file dive all over again just to get the game running. this would not be as much of an issue if the subject on the bug tracker says it is not even being worked on! so what do you guys think i should do? should i pursue the matter with squad? is there a known workaround that wont require 5 minutes of file searching to start the game?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eagain, because i know some people will mis the first one,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis is NOT a rant on how bad squad support is or on the company in general. i do not mean to hate in any way, sorry if it comes out that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: thanks everyone for you suggestion, and i will definitely use it, but it still irks me. i will be starting a poll as to wether you think it would be worth it to pursue this matter with squad anymore. this may end up being a petition also, so help will be greatly appreciated if i decide to pursue the re transfer back to the ksp store.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-16T21:41:25Z\u0022 title=\u002208/16/2013 09:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by toric5\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T20:49:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can just launch the game from the directory it\u0027s stored in, without going through Steam.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T21:00:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Richy teh space man\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Richy teh space man\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou can just launch the game from the directory it\u0027s stored in, without going through Steam.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis.
