Here\u0027s my contribution to the milestone. It\u0027s just a short cinematic but I hope you all like it. I\u0027ve done it using a combination of my two favourite games/sims - KSP and Space Engine. Also a Massive thank you to Squad for making such an awesome game!!

Which this video does not do. \n\nThen there is a \u0022I\u0027m so excited the game is going into 1.0 I decided to make a cinematic video\u0022. Which is what this video does. \n\nVery well made none the less, but it really has nothing to do with 1.0.. Especially with the sad ending (on a joyous occasion as 1.0 release), and mods which have nothing to do with KSP, and never will (Developers said weapons, etc. will never be in the stock game)."},{"CreatedByName":"WanderingKid","CreatedById":110855,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T00:14:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So long as he\u0027s not making any money does it matter? Copyright laws are trash anyway, there are so many loop holes.\n\nWhether or not I agree with the laws, they exist. That he\u0027s not making money (can have NO ads on the channel or screen when it occurs) can get away from some of the concerns. Most of the loopholes, as you put it, are for fair use laws for criticism of a particular item.\n\nThe reason I\u0027m warning him isn\u0027t because I care if he borrows Wile E. or not. I happen to like the character. However, YouTube gets fascinatingly insane with copyright take down requests and you better be damned sure you\u0027re in the clear if you want to keep your channel up. I\u0027ve had a claim put against my channel for part of a song that was being played outside my window by a slowly passing car and was (poorly) drowned out by my background music. It\u0027s messy to get released and strikes against your account sit there with significant impact.
