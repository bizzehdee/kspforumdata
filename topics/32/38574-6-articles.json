Forgot the people who don\u0027t care about having to babysit for 3 minutes to orbit, or have to fiddle during a 2 second circularization burn. What are you supposed to do on a 5 minute burn to another planet? Fiddle and fight for 5 minutes to keep it sort of on the mark and then make a dozen more correction burns because it turns out that a few degrees off for a few seconds in space is ACTUALLY a big deal. Its the difference between an encounter and not, the difference between a PE of 50km and -50 or 500000. If you want to fly an elegant mission and use your delta V with caution this doesn\u0027t help, Id rather not bring up an extra tank of fuel for oopsies, thats not a good mission in my mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts playable, yeah but its not what is intended.
