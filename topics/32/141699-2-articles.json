Seriously, I use 1.25m service bays to re-enter all my mk1 command pods. They even work on interplanetary reentries (from Duna, at least. I suspect they won\u0027t survive a reentry from a Jool-\u0026gt;Kerbin reentry). I never realized how useful the service bay actually was until I gave it a try. From now on, my mk1 capsules won\u0027t leave home without it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot too long ago I made a craft that was returning to kerbin from a Mun science run and the design called for a service bay sandwich.\u00A0 On the lander I docked another service bay along with fuel for the trip.\u00A0 Heat shields block fuel flow and service bays seem to manage re-entry without them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen entering the atmosphere the command pod and Materials Science module was in the middle and never got scorched. \u00A0 When entering the thicker atmosphere the vessel lost control but was regained when the bay doors at the \u0022back\u0022 were opened and acted as drag which righted the vessel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222631458\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022141699\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221465961706\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022102132\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kBob\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n42 minutes ago, kBob said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do something similar in early career mode.\u00A0 What I found is if you put a 1.25m service bay right below the mk1 command pod and then if it falls over blocking the exit hatch you can just open the bay doors and\u00A0it will push the pod up enough that you can than EVA to collect science.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you actually open the doors on the way down in addition to providing some nice drag they will act as a sort of parking brake if you happen to come down on a hill-side and keep you from sliding (or sliding, but so slow you can still EVA and then recover the ship)...now if you come down on a steep mountain side it won\u0027t help unless you are close to the bottom or hang up on something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo given the other benefits to bays they are very useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe re-entry happened at night and it seemed the vessel was over the highlands and I was suspecting that mountains were next.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving the doors opened certainly saved Jebediah from rolling down the mountain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-15T04:20:45Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2016 04:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by MoeslyArmlis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
