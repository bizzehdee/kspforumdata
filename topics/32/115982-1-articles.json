Obviously, scores are a simplification and aren\u0027t the only thing I personally look at, but they aren\u0027t a bad indicator of a game\u0027s quality. \n\nIn regards to KSP, a 8.8 average seems right on the money."},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T04:27:01Z","Content":"Apparently, I\u0027m a harsh critic."},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T09:56:48Z","Content":"A fine example of why either Internet customer ratings or numerical ratings (you choose) are usually not worth the time it takes to read them. \u0022This game is great but because it omitted one small detail, I\u0027ll give it a zero.\u0022 Because that clearly makes all kinds of sense."}]}
