The laptop was a kind donation, so it\u0027s not top of the range. In fact, it has trouble decoding HD video, and is currently stuttering just trying to decode the stream. My main pc has some load encoding it too, but seems to cope well. I\u0027ll let you know how it goes. I\u0027m running the KSP.exe with Steam overlay and not the Steam native version of KSP. Everything seems to work except the camera needs keyboard input as it does not respond to the mouse clicks, but that might be my setup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than my laptop being too slow to decode the music, the game is playing nice and enjoyably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Steam remove the restriction of this being local network only, I could see playing KSP on the go as even more viable. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can test or use this option already, I\u0027d be interested to know your opinions. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[upate]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilt and launched a ship with no bugs or problems.
