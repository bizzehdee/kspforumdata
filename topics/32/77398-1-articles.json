Paging is used when programs collectively want to use more memory than the OS can put in physical RAM. When that happens, memory that hasn\u0027t been accessed in a while is swapped out to disk to free up physical memory, and is swapped back if needed. Switching to 64-bit increases KSP\u0027s virtual address space; it does not increase the amount of physical memory on your computer, nor does it increase KSP\u0027s priority for that memory. All it means is that KSP has a larger virtual address space; the kernel will still swap KSP\u0027s pages to disk if it can\u0027t fit them in physical memory, and a larger virtual address space makes it more likely it can\u0027t fit it in physical memory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darkstar616","CreatedById":113661,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-12T21:14:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMulti-threading \u002B 64-bit = Stable\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor people with potatoes for computers this doesn\u0027t mean much but for people with super computers its a really good thing since it makes our machines look like garbage when its the games fault.
