With MechJeb, you can typically land within a couple hundred meters of an anomaly, but why go to all the trouble of bringing a rover just to cover that distance 1 time to plant your flag?

The really nice thing about slow, hopelessly unstable and, in all possible ways, completely pointless rovers is that they\u0027re not rockets.

However, once you get them to where you want them, you can point them in a direction and, provided you don\u0027t say POWWWEERRRR and die in a fireball, rovers are slow but easy to drive. The alternative for \u0027exploration\u0027 is a VTOL, another rocket or a plane, all of which involve big engines and rockets and no matter how simplistic actually require some level of skill to get exactly where you want to go. The only skill required for the rover is patience. You can also admire the scenery whilst driving happily along the surface of (e.g.) Duna\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditional Challenge:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027m going to entirely contradict myself, but this really applies to the bit before the rover is roving about on the surface of another world; construction and transit. Say you have an amazing heavy lifter you made and love to show off to the KSP community and you want to put a rover on Duna for the first time. The lifter can easily transport 300t to LKO and then a transfer stage will do the rest. Sounds simple, but it isn\u0027t. The first problem with rovers are that unless you want to make a...er...\u0027blob\u0027...they\u0027re not exactly symmetrical. If not in the first stage or even the second, most rockets will suffer the consequences of an unbalanced load and start doing crazy and unhelpful pirouettes in zero-gravity. The solution is MOAR RCS (therefore more weight and a load of white flamey stuff that drives your FPS to 0 when you turn on ASAS) or TWO ROVERS to balance the rocket. Two rovers is more weight and then you need a bigger rocket. Then you have to drop them off when you get there...the right way up \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExplodey stuff:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAim for the nearest cliff, veer left or right at 20m/s\u002B and watch your poor Kerbal (or probe, but that\u0027s no fun) fly gracefully to their inevitable death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDISCLAIMER: All this is based on my experience with rovers and may vary depending on patience, ability to fly and land large rockets and probably CPU/GPU power.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Khrissetti","CreatedById":29557,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-30T21:30:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can build up a fair lick of pace if you build it to be safe, get it up to speed and then go 4x zoom. 80m/s is fast enough for most journeys shorter than traversing a continent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus they add another series of technical challenges, like making a reliable schrimech.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s289.photobucket.com/user/chrissetti/media/screenshot15_zps0cd0c8f6.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i289.photobucket.com/albums/ll232/chrissetti/screenshot15_zps0cd0c8f6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot15_zps0cd0c8f6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s289.photobucket.com/user/chrissetti/media/screenshot17_zpsdc9e05be.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i289.photobucket.com/albums/ll232/chrissetti/screenshot17_zpsdc9e05be.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot17_zpsdc9e05be.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you can be sure it\u0027ll be safe whizzing over the deserts of foreign planets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s289.photobucket.com/user/chrissetti/media/screenshot24_zps6ea69b6b.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i289.photobucket.com/albums/ll232/chrissetti/screenshot24_zps6ea69b6b.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot24_zps6ea69b6b.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"earth","CreatedById":18562,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-30T21:44:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eall my rover designs are made so they can have a 20m/s rollover and have nothing broken ans be able to bet back on wheels. i will post my favourite design if you want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TouhouTorpedo","CreatedById":30603,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-30T22:08:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERovers too slow?

For some time ago I was sending new crew to my Mun base to change the old guys that will be getting home, I didn\u0027t landed perfectly and I ended up few hundreds of meters from base. I would probably be capable of throtling it up and getting closer or getting Kerbals to use their jetpacks to fly around, but decided to use rover I had at base and that solved problem of transferring crew. And if it was celestial body with heavier gravity then jetpacks wouldn\u0027t help and perhaps I wouldn\u0027t want to risk losing some of precious fuel on my craft. So having rover around can be useful. With Kerbal Attachment System mod and some small tanks you can use it to refuel stranded landers too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
