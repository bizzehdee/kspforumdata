At all. The conditions of Kerbal space are forgiving enough that trial and error, with just a tiny bit of knowledge, will let you achieve the first objectives. From there on, you\\\u0027ll learn by doing and through Wikipedia. Now that we have better trajectory prediction in the map view, you\\\u0027ll also get an intuitive feel for complex maneuvers more easily (hint: open settings.cfg and change CONIC\\_PATCH\\_DRAW\\_MODE to 3. At least, I think it\\\u0027s more natural.)\n\nI think that KSP is extremely good as a self-learning tool: I could make all the calculations in the correct way, but usually I just eyeball it, and I can say that some concepts of orbital mechanics have actually become more natural to me through experimentation. Some people make threads like the one you linked because KSP has inspired them to learn about the physics more rigorously; there\\\u0027s Closette, for instance, who reverse-engineered the (very wrong) aerodynamic model that KSP uses and derived the perfect ascent profile for a rocket, solving our instance of what is a notorious problem in control theory.
