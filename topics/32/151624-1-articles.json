First post here. I\u0027ve been playing for a month and I absolutely love this game and the community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust wanted to share a weird experience/bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had one of those \u0022rescue kerbal and their ship\u0022 from the Mun missions. The ship turned out to be a Mk1 crew cabin. My first attempt to retrieve it with an advanced grabbing unit failed when I ran out of gas trying to land on it. So I trashed that ship and redesigned a better grabber.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI returned to the Mun, but I find the kerbal standing there all by herself \u2014 no crew cabin in sight. This is terrible news because I planned to use the cabin to bring her home. I decide to attempt to \u0022dock a kerbal\u0022 when suddenly I become aware of an object in the sky. It\u0027s the Mk1\u00A0crew cabin falling at high velocity from the sky for no discernible reason. Direct hit on my newly designed rescue ship. Totalled it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy!? How?

The capsule was saved while in contact with the terrain, and while the game was loading and the levels of terrain detail came in one after another, for at least one of them the terrain was slightly higher so that the capsule intersected it.

The cabin was a little too heavy to lob around the surface, so I just had the engineer attach a port, extended the winch cable to it, left it in release mode letting the cable extend the full 80 meters, and launched like that - towing the cabin to the orbit on the end of an 80-meter long cable. Only then I winched it in and attached more permanently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this is another one: this time only orbital recoveries, but four of them - one kerbal\u002Bpart and 3 parts.
