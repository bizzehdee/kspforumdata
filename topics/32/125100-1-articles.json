The best thing would be to create a huge array of power relays in low solar orbit, which would get their power from the sun and also reactors, and beam it anywhere in the solar system. With this, we have a dyson ring. Next, the best combination possible, providing you have adequate power beamed to everywhere in the system, would be to create a spaceplane, using a thermal turbojet for thrust in atmosphere, meaning no fuel is required, and a plasma thruster set to quantum vacuum mode in space, so no fuel is required either. Thus, you will only have to carry a small amount of fuel for that point where the atmosphere is too thin for the turbojet, but still in atmosphere (so quantum vacuum thruster won\u0027t work). The thermal turbojet does not require oxygen since it doesn\u0027t combust anything, so it\u0027ll work in any atmosphere, and theoretically, you now have an SSTE (Single Stage to Everywhere)!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if you do this in career mode there will still be a challenge: Getting enough money to fund all this!\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-12T16:28:09Z\u0022 title=\u002211/12/2015 04:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by A35K\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T16:36:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sovek\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sovek\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPlease explain what you mean by Eloo without reaction wheels?
