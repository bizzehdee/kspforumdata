I\u0027m using the same set of mods but of course one of them could be leaking memory now, whereas it didn\u0027t do it in its 1.0.2 version, but still, I\u0027m curious."},{"CreatedByName":"Theysen","CreatedById":144656,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T22:23:01Z","Content":"It\u0027s different for me, now using even more Mods and I can play for 4 hours straight without any issue. Also I tend to feel more fps but this might be subjective"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T22:28:23Z","Content":"I have the same number of mods from 1.0.2 but yet I haven\u0027t had a single memory crash in 1.0.4. This used to happen every hour or so. It might be because of the temperature gauge fix though."},{"CreatedByName":"rdwulfe","CreatedById":107690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T22:39:51Z","Content":"I\u0027ve got about 20 mods, including Adobe minor parts packs. Played for about six hours today, 0 problems 1.0.4 is a complete success for me. No unexpected rocket flippung.

Currently with 1.0.4 I get the 99.9% complete loading bar and then crash due to running out of memory. I also updated several mods to coincide with the new version so it could be a combination of the update as well as mods that are for various versions. KSP could also have been peaking at 3.9GB in 1.0.2 for all I know and then immediately stepping back under 3, there appears to be a threshold at the end of loading where the memory skyrockets before leveling out again."},{"CreatedByName":"justidutch","CreatedById":99185,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T14:56:43Z","Content":"I feel playing KSP has taxed my memory a great deal.

I have only 2GB of RAM in my PC and since I updated to 1.0.4 I can easily do 2-3 hours of continuous gameplay, something I couldn\u0027t do before.

Doing biome hopping seems to make it go up even faster, and I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s a bug with KSP or a memory leak from a mod."}]}
