And the PID in KSP excels at finding that frequency \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

Make sure the struts are separated by stages and the stages are connected with another set of struts, if needed.

Maybe increase the number of reaction wheels, this will minimize, theoretically, the vessel\u0027s response time to the engine inputs, thus reducing the frequency thus preventing the PID from finding that wretched resonance frequency. (I never verified this one)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Lock gimbal on all or some of the bigger engines and add some side stabilization engines if needed (cant remember the name of those, they are the ones who resemble saturn 5 first stage stabilization engines).

Or even give any physical support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E We all know by now that floppy rockets don\u0027t fly well, and we use all the usual design techniques to avoid such problems. However, much as I love the fairings, they behave in a way that I find counterintuitive, and would not be surprised to see others have trouble with as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The first issue is that the stuff inside a fairing undergoes full physical simulation, even though you can\u0027t see it. It will wobble. This is made worse by the fact that the fairing doesn\u0027t provide any physical support at all for its contents (which seems wrong to me). When they do start the first subtle swaying, it\u0027s invisible, and you don\u0027t notice until it gets so bad that it makes the whole rocket wobble, at which point it\u0027s easy to misattribute the problem (e.g. \u0022My engine is psychotic\u0022 rather than \u0022My rocket is floppy\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Making things still worse: I find that I\u0027m considerably more likely to build a floppy rocket when a fairing is involved. The fairing looks big and solid when it\u0027s not, giving a false sense of security. Also, having the fairing there discourages me from using struts in some of the places I\u0027d normally put them, such as where the strut would penetrate the fairing (the game does let you do that, but the behavior is buggy/inconsistent and it just feels wrong to me).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Moral of the story: Be careful with fairings, and firmly secure their contents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... and then there\u0027s that.
