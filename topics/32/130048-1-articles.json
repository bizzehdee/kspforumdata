I\u0027ve noticed that I\u0027ve evolved in how I build rockets since I first got the game. I was a relative latecomer, having first purchased KSP at version .23.5. At first, I would slap together whatever and brute force my way into space. As I learned the game, I\u0027d do all the tricks, like monster asparagus stages and things that would get Whackjob\u0027s nod of approval. But then, something changed. Over the course of my playing, I began to learn more and more about real rocketry. I was inspired to really read up on and study how all of this works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was put into overdrive when I decided to dip my toe in Realism Overhaul. Suddenly, brute forcing my way into space wasn\u0027t the be-all solution. I figured the best way to approach this from a realism standpoint was to try to recreate real rockets by the numbers using various references available. This lead to many of my own iterations of Atlases, Deltas, and Falcons. I have to say, getting a reasonable facsimile of one those beasts built and getting payloads to orbit remains among the higher of the high points of playing KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI noticed some of the design principles of RO creeping into my stock game, and now as I look at my collection of lifters, they all bear striking similarities with Atlas, Delta, etc. All generally have large boost stages with a smaller, more efficient upper stage. Some use small SRBs for the extra kick off the pad. Gone are the ridiculous asparagus stages and strut-covered monsters of my earlier games. In fact, when trying to figure out how to get large payloads up, I purposely avoid doing that stuff, feeling like it\u0027s somehow \u0022cheaty\u0022. I now abide by a loose set of rules, and I find these artificial limitations make my gameplay more satisfying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat about you guys?

I never asparagus\u0027d. I always found it stupid, disliked the community\u0027s obsession with overly complex vehicles that violate several geneva conventions related to torture the moment the physics engine kicks in. I could put anything my processor could handle on any planet in the game with the Munar III, which is a simple three-stage rocket. It puzzled me that people would shy away from simple and reliable, still does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven today I still rely on the same design. With the new aero it can put even more mass in LKO, or get the same mass even farther out into the stars. I\u0027ve taken to removing about a fourth of the fuel carried by the lifter because it was sending transfer stages to planetary surfaces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Basic design of the Munar III:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLift stage: 4x Rockomax Mainsails strapped radially to the main stage, fuelled by an orange tank and a X32 Rockomax tank. Originally it was just three of the X32 tanks, the orange tank just lets me drop part count. These light first, and when heavily laden, do the bulk of the lower atmosphere lifting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMain stage: Basically a carbon copy of one of the boosters stuck under the transfer stage. This lights when the boosters drop away and does most of the actual getting into LKO work when this thing is heavily loaded. While not intended, this stage can be lit at launch if the payload is particularly heavy. Doing so means an in-orbit refuel for interplanetary stuff, though. Engine can be a mainsail if needed, was in the original design, but these days it\u0027s usually a Skipper. It often also retains a few hundred m/s of dV so it will do a lot of, if not all of, the kicking when leaving Kerbin. Needless to say there\u0027s quite a few of these in solar and high eccentricity Kerbin orbits in my 0.17 save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTransfer stage: 1 X-32 fuel tank and a poodle strapped to the base of the payload. Pretty trustworthy setup, mostly used for either exiting, or if there\u0027s enough dV in the main stage(Often there is) the transfer stage is repurposed into a deceleration stage upon arrival at the destination body. This can be omitted if the destination is LKO, instead the payload itself will mount here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOdds \u0027n ends:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is equipped with RCS throughout. In the early days of my time playing KSP I needed this active from launch to keep it from flipping out, but refinements in the design, my piloting ability, and MechJeb have led to the RCS being mostly a vestigial organ. For the most part. Since the transfer stage is bulky it does get used for aligning to interplanetary ejection nodes. The tanks for this are kept in the transfer stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFins. I love the 50s retro-futuristic look that huge fins on a rocket give you. they also tend to help this thing avoid going out of control when it\u0027s either overloaded or too lightly loaded. Also, sometimes, the payload I\u0027ve got equipped is too awkward to fit in an aeroshell. These payloads also tend to make the aerodynamics go haywire. the huge fins on the transfer stage tend to help the craft force the payload through the air rather than the air force the payload off course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAero nosecones. Not necessary in the souposphere, but in new aero there\u0027s nosecones on the booster stages. Aeroshells go over some payloads but not all of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStrap-on solid boosters also come into play once in a while, but generally they\u0027re not necessary. It\u0027s hard for me to get a payload heavy enough to need them yet light enough on part count for me to get enough of a framerate to actually send it up. I tend to not fly missions that give me less than 12-15FPS and that\u0027s in the 200 part area.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-18T22:01:06Z\u0022 title=\u002201/18/2016 10:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Kenobi McCormick\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-18T22:39:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, same here. \u00A0I started really playing in 0.20 (even though I bought the game at 0.17) and played pretty heavily since then. \u00A0Around 0.23 I got into RSS and Real Fuels, actually making the 6.4x Kerbin (which eventually became 64K) and playing that for some time before transitioning fully over to Realism Overhaul in like, 0.25? \u00A0Aside from checking out how terrible career mode is every new update I haven\u0027t played much of stock/vanilla because, well, it\u0027s too damn easy and there\u0027s no sense of accomplishment anymore. \u00A0Seriously, after playing so much RO my main concern in stock is wobbly joints, not \u0022can I actually make it there and back?\u0022 or other silliness. \u00A0I literally slapped together a shuttle in less than an hour this weekend and got it flying good enough to place it into my desired orbit\u00A0after two hours of tweaking and building a station. \u00A0I\u0027ve built a hybrid shuttle type of craft in RO (sort of an STS/Buran remix from engine layout) that got five tons to orbit reliably, but that was a process of several nights and I never managed to survive reentry with it (I now know where I went wrong, but ... still).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, the stock game is fine for casual hung-over Saturday morning play but nothing compares to a finely-executed procedural\u00A0Vostok replica launch into the Lunar plane followed by a perfect transfer burn and landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tourist","CreatedById":143403,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-18T22:57:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI keep adding more rules to myself, for instance having enough living space for kerbals on long duration flights, trying to launch as much as I can via spaceplanes, only permitting crew transfer between certain modules.
