Although it\u0027s not a 4X game, adding \u0022Exploit\u0022 to \u0022Exploration\u0022 would open endless posibilities and would popularize ideas like in-situ resource utilization or made polar Mun base important due to the presence of ice (water -\u0026gt; rocket fuel and oxygen and, err, water). However, there wasn\u0027t any update from SQUAD on this in months. What could it mean? Here are the results of my speculations:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOPTION 1 - RESOURCES ARE POSTPONED\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most probable option. Squad realized that implementing this would a huge challenge, much bigger than the Science system and decided to postpone it for later, say 0.25 or 0.30.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOPTION 2 - RESOURCES ARE RESERVED FOR A DLC\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother possibly option. Seeing how huge the resources system is and how much it could add to the game it won\u0027t be unreasonable to not sell it in a separate DLC for $5-10. Now I know what you think:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://gratuitousoutrage.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/igod-thisisanoutrage2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022igod-thisisanoutrage2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I actually think DLC is a great idea. Why? First of all, Squad will make more money. It\u0027s good for us, because it means that the company will prosper and hey, who wouldn\u0027t want to buy KSP 2 in 5-6 years? Second of all, KSP is ridiculously cheap - I payed for it $16 and calculating (price/hours of fun) it was one of my best decisions ever in case of entertainment. Third of all, it\u0027ll be a guarantee of a decent resources system. Why? Because Squad will have a clear financial motivation to do so - and getting money from DLC could mean more free improvements for the KSP itself, just like Paradox does with CK2 or EU4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, this is a possible option. The third one, unfortunately, also is possible\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOPTION 3 - RESERVED ARE CANCELLED\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know for what reasons but sadly yes, it\u0027s possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to sum it up:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat I really would like to hear during Kerbalkon is official Squad statement about the resources system.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest, it\u0027s even more important for me than 0.23 release.

I want to make sure any bugs I come across are due to the game and not due to mods in order to try and help development.
