However, it\u0027s obvious that not all players are so inclined to make \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E stages to be recoverable, and that some are so finicky that they only use 100% reusable spaceplanes that can go Single Stage to Eeloo and Back, and will revert the entire mission if a small wing is destroyed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAhem... so, we get to the main point. In a scale of \u003Cstrong\u003EOne\u003C/strong\u003E through \u003Cstrong\u003ESix\u003C/strong\u003E, how efficient are you in Career mode?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOne - 1:\u003C/strong\u003E Not efficient in the slightest. Will make extraordinarily big rockets that pack way more Delta-V and costs than necessary just for the sake of it. And out of that, only the capsule is recovered. The player is essentially dependent on cash earned from contracts to not go into bankruptcy. He/she won\u0027t care whether he/she lands in the KSC or in the South Pole - as long as it\u0027s in Kerbin, it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETwo - 2:\u003C/strong\u003E Barely counts as efficient. Will try to make rockets carry only the needed, but will often do the job poorly or just not enough. One could say there are more flags scattered around his/her save file than money in his/her wallets. He/She wants to land in KSC, but won\u0027t actively try to achieve that and won\u0027t mind if he/she lands somewhere else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThree - 3:\u003C/strong\u003E Moderately efficient. Will only pack the necessary to optimize costs and part counts, and will try to land as close to KSC as possible. Will also try to use a reusable spaceplane, but not too often, and will be mostly for flights within the Kerbin system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFour - 4:\u003C/strong\u003E Highly efficient. Will keep a threshold of a value for each stage, and any stage whose price is higher than said threshold will be remapped to be efficient. If possible, will also use Kerbal Engineer Redux to monitor the delta-V levels for each stage to make sure that they\u0027re not packing much more than needed, but will also leave a little extra fuel. Other than that, the player is mostly similar to Level 3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFive - 5:\u003C/strong\u003E Finickily efficient. This is where things start to get creepy. Rockets are mostly really tiny, sometimes even trying really hard for that. There is also a pair of parachutes for each stage, which is triggered as soon as it is ditched.. Basically most of the program is Spaceplane-oriented, and designed to be as much recoverable as possible. Nuclear engines may or may not be common, depending on whether the player priorizes cost and weight or fuel savings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESix - 6:\u003C/strong\u003E 100% efficient. All vessels are as small as possible, any ship that doesn\u0027t land squarely in the runway is considered a failure, if a course has a mismatch and a correction is required, the entire flight is reverted to start, and Delta-V is as tight as possible to minimize costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t play Career, those can also apply to your Sandbox/Science save file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I would be a Level 2.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-11T17:45:38Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2014 05:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Commissioner Tadpole\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nine_iron","CreatedById":37971,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T16:05:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBetween 2 and 3...
