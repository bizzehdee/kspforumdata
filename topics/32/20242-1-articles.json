Scientists figured out that, while some of the atmosphere escapes over time, it is still gravitationally bound and at orbital speed around Saturn. It ends up in a diffuse gas ring along Titan\u0027s orbit called a \u0022gas torus\u0022, which Titan then continuously regains as much from as it loses over time. That\u0027s not to say that it hasn\u0027t lost quite a bit since formation - just that the losses are now in equilibrium with the re-aquisitions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis works because of the relatively huge gravity well of Saturn and of Titan relative to the other moons; from an orbital mechanics standpoint, all possible escape paths from Titan for the highest-energy gas molecules in the upper atmosphere lead into a narrow band of Saturn orbits that guarantee eventual return to Titan\u0027s atmosphere, and the torus is so thin that inter-molecular collisions aren\u0027t significant. This would stop being true if the gas gets too dense out in the torus (inter-molecular collisions would eject occasional molecules from the gas torus region), and there\u0027s also increased loss if the atmospheric temperature increases greatly (gas molecules at the upper edge of the atmosphere are then occasionally high enough energy to leave Titan\u0027s influence permanently) - so it all ends up with an equilibrium where we see it today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP probably can\u0027t model an extremely thin atmosphere in a torus along Laythe\u0027s orbit, but we can assume that it\u0027s there - Jool acting the same as Saturn does for Titan. The resulting thick Laythe atmosphere - possibly pure Methane, a really strong greenhouse gas - plus tidal heating, could explain the liquid water oceans. The lower molecular weight of Methane than H2O even explains why there are no clouds, incidentally - they exist on Earth because water vapor is considerably lighter than dry air at the same temp \u0026amp; pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, of course, we can go with \u0022because the devs made it that way.\u0022 I just wanted to point out that Laythe\u0027s condition isn\u0027t a logical fallacy or violation of physics, it just mimics an unusual quirk of physics that also exists to a lesser degree in our own solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-25T04:37:53Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2012 04:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by khyron42\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4 IN 1","CreatedById":1540,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T04:48:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@khyron24\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI assume you mean a Methane ocean?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T05:10:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022spikeyhat09\u0022 data-cite=\u0022spikeyhat09\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo Laythe is like a Europa analog?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EIt\u0027s sort of a cross between Io and Titan.
