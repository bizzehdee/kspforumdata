So the next step would seem to land the whole plane on the surface. But I have a couple of questions first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Given the new topography of .21 is there anywhere flat enough to land? Given I am stock I don\u0027t have VTol so i need at least 1/2 a runway of flat length. I am considering trying minmas first as I know it has flat valleys. Also it needs to be at least a runway wide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. So when landing a plane on a zero atmosphic body does everybody else just burn retrograde while backwards to slow down and then turn around and land at the last second? Should I instead mount rockets aimed forward or should I try the entire landing backwards? Do i try to land vertically almost on my rockets before turning to land normally? Basically what has worked?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Braking works at 50 m/s on a rover on the mun so is it safe to assume it will also slow my space plane at about 100 m/s without explodey consequences?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. I assume takeoff is simply building up speed and then using reaction wheel / rcs to lift the nose as the flaps will be useless? Is this possible given I will weigh around 40 tonnes on takeoff?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T16:54:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy advice would be to treat it like a regular lander, throw the whole \u0027airplane\u0027 idea out the window.

The craft was VTOL, and used a single NERVA for slowing down the primary vector, which was purposely kept as close to parallel to the surface as possible. VTOL engines were used for quick bursts of upward motion, and eventually the whole thing just slowly touched down onto a downward slope of a hillock and stopped. That\u0027s probably inefficient as heck though, I just wanted to land horizontally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your primary engine is good enough to land vertically, tail first, you\u0027re probably better off doing that.

Although if your designe is sturdy enough to survive a drop test you could litterly land very gently on the rear engiens (sub .5m/s touchdown) and then carefuly nose over to land on the gear with reaction wheels.
