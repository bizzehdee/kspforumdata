I kicked things off on Friday night by launching Bob aboard another \u003Cem\u003EFireball 7c\u003C/em\u003E craft on what I had hoped to be his final scientific exploration mission. Launch and transfer burn went off without a hitch, so afterwards I went ahead and checked in at the Minmus mining site. Sufficient ore had been gathered to send up another load to Minmusport, so I unhooked the \u003Cem\u003EWildcat 7\u003C/em\u003E lander from the rest of the mining rig and sent it on up. Docking was a success; the ISRU kicked on and started chugging away. I wound up filling up all of the fuel tanks associated with the station completely - including a refuel of the \u003Cem\u003EWildcat\u003C/em\u003E - and I had excess ore, more than enough to fill the refinery module\u0027s storage tanks while still leaving some in the \u003Cem\u003EWildcat\u003C/em\u003E. My plan for now is to leave the \u003Cem\u003EWildcat\u003C/em\u003E in place - I won\u0027t send it down again until more ore is needed. I\u0027m pretty happy with how my Minmus mining operations have gone up to this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that I went ahead and launched another \u003Cem\u003EMosquito 7\u003C/em\u003E drilling rig en route for Mun - while my Minmus mining operations have been a rousing success, Munar ops have been less than stellar so far. Launch and transfer burn went off without any trouble. With that done, I decided to go ahead and try to move some craft off the berths at Munport 1, starting with the \u003Cem\u003EProject Peacock\u003C/em\u003E craft docked there - I refueled the craft with what little fuel remained at Munport 1 and flew it down to dock with Munport 2 in a lower Munar orbit. Munport 2 was also low on gas but still had sufficient fuel remaining to refuel the \u003Cem\u003EPeacock\u003C/em\u003E when it arrived. Moving the \u003Cem\u003EPeacock\u003C/em\u003E turned out to be serendipitous...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter focusing on Munar mining next, Bob arrived and began his run. He hit the Twin Craters and Southwest Crater regions without issues. There were several reverted attempts to hit a narrow, nearby stretch of Canyon by the Southwest Crater, but after three attempts it was decided to just have him hit the Northwest Crater instead. Landing at the Northwest Crater was harrowing - he wound up in a region with a 26 degree grade, tipped and slid down a hill. Fortunately nothing broke off of his craft and after finagling his craft for a few minutes I was able to get it upright again. Not the easiest thing to do on Mun without RCS. I got most of the Northwest Crater science gathered, but the Kraken struck when Bob went EVA for a surface sample. That pretty much killed Friday night\u0027s gaming. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I loaded the game on Saturday, I discovered the Kraken had had no ill effect (thank God), so I finished gathering Bob\u0027s science. With his craft low on fuel, I launched him to orbit, only to discover his craft didn\u0027t have enough gas to return to Kerbin. He was only twenty degrees off the plane of Munport 2, though, and I remembered that I had moved the \u003Cem\u003EPeacock\u003C/em\u003E there, so I went ahead and aligned him with the station and then sent the \u003Cem\u003EPeacock\u003C/em\u003E to rendezvous with him (\u003Cem\u003EPeacock\u003C/em\u003E was designed with rescue ops in mind, after all). The rendezvous was a success; Bob collected all of the science he had gathered and transferred it to the \u003Cem\u003EPeacock\u003C/em\u003E, and the \u003Cem\u003EFireball\u003C/em\u003E was abandoned. The \u003Cem\u003EPeacock\u003C/em\u003E was then sent back to Kerbin and made a successful rendezvous with the Kerbinport space station. Bob was immediately put to work in the station\u0027s science lab processing the experiments he gathered and filled up the station\u0027s data buffer. I only needed 2200 science to max out my tech tree and there\u0027s 2500 potential in the station\u0027s buffer, so aside from the insufficient fuel hiccup, Bob\u0027s mission was a success. Plans were drawn up to have more scientists sent up to Kerbinport to assist in the emptying of the data buffer, as well as to transport the experiments back to KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, the Mosquito launched on Friday arrived at Mun and was put into orbit. It subsquently landed very close to the existing Mosquito lander on the Munar surface, but not close enough to the Midas processing lander for the winch cables to reach. Luckily, Theogel was on the surface and he still had the KAS tools from the refueling op he\u0027d done earlier last week, so I got him out, took one of the winches off the Midas (that thing tipped over so it\u0027s not like it was going anywhere any time soon), attached it to the existing Mosquito and ran the line from there:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ISYsHR9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ISYsHR9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMunar mining output now exceeds that of Minmus, when I can get the damn thing to run right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had big plans for yesterday but I wound up doing some much needed maintenance on my computer, including a disk defrag.
