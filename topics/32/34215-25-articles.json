Then, we could take all those Kerbals, shove them in one ship, and make a series of videos (possibly set up an order, so there\u0027s no confusion) showing off their misadventures. Lots of possibilities! We all know just how bad these Kerbals are at, well, everything. There could be accidental explosions, failed landings, Kerbals getting tossed out the airlock (or pretend airlock, I guess), etc. The idea is still in its rough stages, so I\u0027d love to hear what everyone thinks and how to improve on it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CakeNinjaProductions","CreatedById":92225,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-21T04:51:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I could probably make an SSTO big enough to do those things.

I\u0027ve been dealing with some family stuff over the past few days (my sister just popped out a kid). I played around with the saves when I had time and I now give up, something\u0027s not right and I can\u0027t figure out what. I\u0027ve put in several hours but without any luck, it\u0027s so frustrating. I also managed to overwrite the file I was creating several times, which certainly was no fun. Everything\u0027s been merged successfully other than the Minmus base. For some reason, part of it gets doubled up (all of Cake\u0027s module, but also a bit of Goose\u0027s) and basically blows up asap. As far as I can tell by looking through that code, there should only be one instance of the base. I copied it over from Goose\u0027s save and made sure to remove Cake, but in the process something fudged up.
