There seem to be both more \u0027bad\u0027 sections of terrain and I swear they seem larger. I can\u0027t recall ever getting stuck on one in 0.20 or earlier, but it\u0027s happened in 0.21. the available thrust on the \u0027bad\u0027 segments is so low that if you\u0027ll end up clear down at 1.25 m/s if you get stuck on one, at least with my design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually think there\u0027s two different kinds of bad terrain segments, negative and positive, depending on if the suspension thinks the terrain is higher or lower than it appears to be. You\u0027ll see certain segments where the suspension jacks all the way down and stays there, or jacks all the way up and stays there, regardless of anything else, and these are the \u0027bad\u0027 ones I\u0027m talking about. I\u0027ll call the ones that push the suspension all the way down \u0027Positive\u0027 (because to do that without a bug, you\u0027d have to have substantial positive G forces on the craft), and the ones where it jacks all the way up \u0027Negative\u0027. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Positive ones don\u0027t cause any problems: It pushes the suspension all the way down, so you\u0027ve got no flex left...which doesn\u0027t really matter. I used to drive a no-suspension Bigtrak around on the mun all the time, with no issues (didn\u0027t hurt that it was completely immune to impact damage, as it turned out, but all of my crashes were caused by the fact I was cruising at 80 m/s and catching massive air off every tiny rise, not by it being unstable). So it drives just fine on the \u0027Positive\u0027 segments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the \u0027Negative\u0027 segments, it\u0027s like the suspension is actually trying to lift the craft off the ground and failing to do so. It looks and acts much like there\u0027s something clamped to the rover, holding it up so that the wheels barely touch the ground, except it also makes the steering highly erratic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I\u0027ve seen, it doesn\u0027t seem so much like the rovers are more unstable as that there\u0027s more, and larger, bad terrain segments of BOTH types that came out of the new terrain generator. From what I\u0027ve been told in the past, it has something to do with \u0027imprecision\u0027 in the terrain mesh, or something, that fools the suspension and makes it act stupidly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI reckon you could cure that by just...well, disabling the suspension. I\u0027m not sure though, because my attempts to do so through the .cfg file have all failed. It seems like the suspension system is so tightly integrated into making the wheels work at all that you can\u0027t strip it out and have them still work, or at least I couldn\u0027t figure out how to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
