I\u0027m starting to do interplanetary stuff in my game right now, and I recently set up a station around Duna (to connect my ships orbiting) and the first real mission to the surface was a three-pilot lander with two rovers on the sides. The landing went successfully and I left the two rovers and two Kerbals on the Dunan surface, sending the lander for a direct ascent to my station. The problem is that I was a little low on fuel so I just BARELY rendezvous/docked and now I don\u0027t have enough fuel for a return. I think \u0022OK, well at least they\u0027re docked, I can send more fuel to them\u0022. I set out designing a fueling ship which ended up having to use half it\u0027s payload fuel to actually get into orbit. Now I have to refuel my refueler... once again, no big deal. More designing. Launch. Random failures...over...and over, different every time, too.

What I gather from anyone who\u0027s stuff is breaking is that it\u0027s either a freak glitch, or you haven\u0027t done proper shakedown flights. If you\u0027ve drop tested, flown, parachuted and generally abused your lander/rover/payload on Kerbin and it has survived, go ahead and launch.

Yes glitches happen, but stuff being attached with \u0027explosive tissue paper\u0027 is a bit of a stretch when you could\u0027ve simply tested your payload thoroughly and fixed any issues during design.

Nothing ever \u0027just falls apart\u0027. I have stuff I\u0027ve built and deployed on the launchpad for a droptest just freak out and explode on their own, stuff with no fuel/engines. Recently I had to design 4 different surface probes from scratch to get one that didn\u0027t freak out and explode, cubic strut/girder glitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are several known bugs like sometimes your landing struts just disconnect from the vehicle if you\u0027ve left them deployed out in space and log back to the ship. And putting stuff inside eachother sometimes causes unexpected rotation or disassembly. Stuff shouldn\u0027t occupy the same space and yes sometimes the VAB glitches and places 2 pieces instead of one and then potentially both break off. But that\u0027s where testing comes into play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut your stuff on the launchpad, put clamps at the top and go through each step in order. Fly your lander (by hack gravity if you don\u0027t have TWR for liftoff). Launch stuff with parachutes on a small booster to a few thousand meters and test it properly. Several times. Droptest stuff with landing legs from different altitudes to see how strong they are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you get into a proper design routine then stuff will stop breaking for you. You\u0027ll also learn better design and workarounds.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T14:44:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found the lander that had multiple landing legs in the same position... and this is what it caused WHEN I JUST DECOUPLED.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/v5U3ag0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022v5U3ag0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, it caused another effect.... my engines just drifted off.
