So, here are the pieces of headcanon: (TBH no point to not get straight to the point.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. There\u0027s a piece of slightly radioactive material in each and every spacecraft part. The radioation can using some weird kerbal supertech be easily detected and that\u0027s how we can see in the Tracking Station all of our spacecraft even if they have no power to transmit everything, no matter how small and far away with few parts the ship is. Also, each part\u0027s radiactive material is slightly different, which is how and why the spacecraft can be recognized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. On a slightly darker note, each part also has a built-in self-destructtion device. Said device can tear the part into immeasurable tiny, tiny pieces at an atomic level. That\u0027s how Terminating a mission works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
