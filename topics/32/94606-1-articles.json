The only limit is sheer part count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMostly, I think it\u0027s fine that way. Most participants in Eve Rocks and many in Jool-5 will prefer a ridiculously huge single launch to the hassles of rendezvous/docking. Now one could argue that something is wrong if a huge launch is easier to pull off than orbital assembly and refueling. But, well, even if you leave most of the menial tasks to MechJeb (and I don\u0027t think it can reasonably made any easier than that), orbital assembly still means that you spend a lot of time dealing with necessities (a.k.a. grinding) before you can get the mission underway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Just launch the damn thing already\u0022 is, and should remain, a valid approach. It\u0027s one of these things where gameplay beats realism. In career mode, it\u0027s kinda-sorta balanced by being quite expensive, forcing you to grind in the cash in some other way; but at least the player has the option of chosing his poison.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to good-looking rockets (by which I assume you mean needle-shaped): the coming aerodynamics will probably nudge the player towards that solution. However, I hope that it remains a nudge, that unwieldy payloads and pancake rockets will not become completely impossible. Besides, I\u0027m afraid that realistically-looking rockets will remain elusive until we get more rigid connections (decouplers are the main culprits, but there\u0027s more). There\u0027s also the issue of part recovery: the game strongly encourages king-size launchers that can make it to orbit and then be safely recovered. Nevermind if it\u0027s three times as expensive, you\u0027ll get most of your money back -- in practically all cases, this beats a \u0022cheaper\u0022 throw-away solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T22:36:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think Jool-5 and Eve justify larger rockets, specially if you want to take a science payload (which, while not at all heavy in itself, adds to the complexity of the design, specially if you want to add, say, 2-3 science jr to pluck everything in the descend/ascend).
