After the seperatrons burned out the launcher caught up and shot past Jeb in his capsule with about 2 coats of paint to spare in distance away probably going 300\u002Bm/sec faster than Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe capsule and Jeb were saved, but his space suit and undies were a complete write-off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"paleorob","CreatedById":60059,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T13:53:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s why, during an abort, it is a good idea to A)set up the abort to also kill the other engines in the rocket and B)steer slightly towards the ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
