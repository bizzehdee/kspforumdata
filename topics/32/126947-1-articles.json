that rapiers really shined at getting a plane to 1600m/s, and from there you didnt even need a drop of LFO but could nuke your way to orbit.\u00A0 Now, the absolute max ive managed to pull off is ~1400m/s, which is below the threshold where nukes can bring you to orbit alone.\u00A0 All in all, rapiers used to be the go-to engine for anything and everything space related since you could achieve much higher speeds (provided your plane wasnt excessively draggy or badly designed) then the turbojet gave you.\u00A0 Now with 1.0.5, its is still a far better engine for SSTOs, but it is nolonger cut and dry since your speed is still roughly capped at ~1350-1400, and the turbojet can get you to 1250 if you do it right, and it burns less fuel to get you to said speed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIve found teh aerospike\u002Bturbojet to be a very efficient combo, and it looks really cool too to have a aerospike clipped inside a whiplash or panther (although noone would use panther for SSTOs unless its career and no other choice since that engine cant really break 1000m/s reliably nor get you to a high altitude).\u00A0 The aerospike is now one of my go-to engines after it was buffed to 1t mass (used to be 1.5t back when), so unless its a very light purely vaccum craft, where i use a 909 instead, or interplanetary/pure space and heavy, where i use a nuke, its aerospike all the way.\u00A0 1.0.5 seems to have made the aerospike a very dominant engine in terms of a very good combo of TWR being up there with engines like the LVT-30, very good ISP (for a LFO engine), low mass (1t is pretty low given its thrust and isp), and also small size (easier to do something with it on unconventional designs, better for landers, ect).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverall what i use the aerospike for is almost anything that is designed to land on planets or fly around in atmo where a jet wont work (due to oxegen levels).\u00A0 It remains useful even on Eve (although 1.0.5 has killed off Eve for any real fun craft since its now so hot there and impossible to do jack without heat shield spam), and well, its my main duna engine of choice (nukes can do it on duna too but they are just annoying to land/take off with).\u00A0 Its a exceptional engine, and aside from the obvious nuke beats every single alternative in space itself, the aerospike has become my 4th most common space based engine (after the nuke, rapier, 909).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wrcsubers","CreatedById":148899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-04T04:41:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022
