I guess my playstyle is more like what you\u0027re talking about - I\u0027d class it in the 2nd bulletpoint above. However, I think that KSP has changed a lot since the early days when this approach was pretty straightforward. From my perspective, the default stock game is much less toy-like and much more sim-like than it used to be, which is fine and cool, but makes for a more-punishing less-seeing-the-funny-side game experience IMHO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-15T01:22:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2016 01:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by The_Rocketeer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketBlam","CreatedById":103420,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-15T08:55:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s the nature of the beast.
