I was amazed to see the ASAS recuperate from a very heavy spin cauzed by back-end first re-entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonnaly I like it, it feels a lot more like flying a plane and adjusting trim to set your heading right while lot leaving it to drive for you and take a nap. But I can see why some peoples are unhappy with it. It seems to want to drift off course sometimes if you dont give it a tap in the right direction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T15:17:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like it. I find it works for all vehicle types: rockets, planes, SSTOs, and rovers. It does require some changes in how you fly/drive compared to the previous version, and therefore has a small learning curve, but in general I think it\u0027s a big improvement. Could it be tweaked to be better? Certainly. But it\u0027s hardly the non-starter some make it out to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think a lot of folks are forgetting that using SAS now burns electricity. This means manned craft, not just probes, now need RTGs or solar panels; otherwise SAS stops working very soon after launch. So don\u0027t forget to add these to your pre-0.21 craft files if you want to keep using them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zarakon","CreatedById":5160,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T15:38:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really like that I can change heading without toggling it off/on, but I do have a few issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike others here have said, it just doesn\u0027t try hard enough to maintain heading.

If I input a 5% upward pitch, instead of pitching up gently at 5% it jumps straight to 25%, because the 20% pitch-down correction just goes away completely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be more ideal if it summed together the analog input and the control required to maintain course. So if I input 5% up, it should change from 20% down to 15% down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would also solve the issue where I try to input 5% down, and the plane actually ends up pitching upward because the control changes from 20% down to just 5% down. If they were summed, my 5% down input would result in a 25% total pitch down control, and a 5% \u003Cem\u003Eactual\u003C/em\u003E pitch down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe selection of parts is lacking.
