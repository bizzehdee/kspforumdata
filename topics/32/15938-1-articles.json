If your just a command pod and chute left (and use your separation from everything else to get you started), a series of EVA\u0027s should get you going where you need to go. Another series of EVA\u0027s will drop your speed (assuming your going to get picked up) so that you hvae a shot of hitting kerbin. Would take a while, but still probably faster than sending out another ship into solar orbit, especially since your not perfectly circular right now which only complicates things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kopecky","CreatedById":35604,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-04T04:48:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Richy teh space man\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Richy teh space man\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESwitch to that flight, then press Esc - End Flight\u003Cp\u003EThats the easy way \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to actually rescuing him you could make a craft that can leave Kerbins gravity and enter the suns, then try and match orbits and then when your close enough (ie under 1km) and your relative speeds are close enough EVA Jeb and get him to fly across and enter an empty crew pod.
