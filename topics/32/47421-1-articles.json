Well it wasnt needed anymore so I decided I was gonna undock it, land it at KSC, with whatever crew from the station I chose fit to get a vacation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelp thats all well and good, right? Nope!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead the game decides to curse me with some terrible bug. Some terrible bug you ask? Thats right!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I undocked my station literally took a dead drop. Just straight down. Its periapsis vanished, and along with it, its orbit. Now moments ago this was in a stable orbit of 80km x 80km. But nope, now its 80km by 0 with no arc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically as soon as I undock, my station literally fell straight out of the sky, ramming my now terrified crew (the ones who were going back down) to be slammed into the solarpanel arrays shattering tanks rupturing crew modules, basically just plowing its way through a station now falling ontop of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first station, a month of docking and hard work destroyed because of some stupid weird bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan someone tell me what the hell happened?
