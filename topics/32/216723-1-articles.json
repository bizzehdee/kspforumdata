At least for the stable L4 L5 points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could put a small pretend-physics sphere into the point\u0027s locations. It would be a very simplified physics model but would allow to park ships in that location. I have been looking into the physics behind it a while ago and found a couple of interesting possibilities. If it can be done via mod is questionable, though, but worth an experiment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically you would \u0022nest\u0022 two spheres in each other. The outer/larger one would behave like a very small body with very low mass. Since we don\u0027t want to have any mass center, we need the second, inner sphere, which would basically have no mass at all. Both could be calculated by the patched conics. The transition between the two spheres would be a bit janky, but since the influence would be very low anyway, it would not hurt so much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would love to work with someone on it, I just don\u0027t have the knowledge of creating bodies in KSP, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf someone is intereste, PM me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-05-31T08:58:38Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2023 08:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by dr.phees\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-01T14:24:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnything short of N-body is just incredibly broken and would need implementing in a breathtakingly horrible and garish manner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
