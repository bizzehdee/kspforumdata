Based on its orbit it was due to impact Kerbin at roughly 4,500m/s (relative to Kerbin) and at nearly 80\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 to the surface. 1,344t at 4,500m/s would release 13,608GJ of energy, roughly equivalent to a small North Korean Nuclear Bomb (3.25 kiloton). Given its angle of attack and velocity it\u0027s likely some of it would reach the surface, but with the low density much of the energy would be dissipated by the atmosphere as the rock breaks up.
