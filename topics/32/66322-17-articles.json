I believe I heard Scott Manley say they\u0027re 3.75 meters, but 4.2 or 4.125 would be more appropriate; 4.2 is proportional to the Mk1-2 pod and SLS core stage, while 4.125 would be proportional with the Mk1-2 pod and the S-IVB stage from the Saturn V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, I\u0027m not trying to \u0022nitpick.\u0022 I love Squad and everything they do! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECurrent design (real life)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/800x600_autoletterbox/public/sls-inflight_afterburn_300dpi.jpg?itok=14ZhJCVn\u0022 alt=\u0022sls-inflight_afterburn_300dpi.jpg?itok=14ZhJCVn\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-26T00:41:53Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2014 12:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Woopert\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T01:56:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo we know the mass of the Claw yet?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Giggleplex777","CreatedById":29829,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T02:30:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brotoro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Brotoro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDo we know the mass of the Claw yet?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s about 0.1 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-26T03:23:29Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2014 03:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Giggleplex777\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Giggleplex777","CreatedById":29829,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T03:27:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Woopert\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Woopert\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe new patch is really neat so props to Squad for the fantastic job they\u0027ve done.\u003Cp\u003EThe only things that bug me are the yellow exhaust for the KS-25, and they way the engines are oriented on it.
