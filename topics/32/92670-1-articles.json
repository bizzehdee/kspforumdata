So for example when you deploy your rover you just select a set to make active and now the rover has its own 0-9 actions that are different to what the lander had. Of-course you could achieve having different actions on a rover if you could edit them, but by having pre-defined sets that you setup in the VAB/SPH, you don\u0027t have to mess about editing them each time you deploy the rover.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WuphonsReach","CreatedById":130759,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-13T08:03:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe should be able to attach a short message to the \u0022Custom1 to Custom0\u0022 keys and have them displayed somewhere on the HUD.
