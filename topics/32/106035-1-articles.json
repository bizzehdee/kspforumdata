The problems as I see it are that the SAS is too aggressive, and that the fins have WAY too much travel and as a result incredibly high control authority, which leads to overcompensation and generally hard-to-fly craft.\n\nThe SAS is hard to fix, but the fins need some form of slider that adjusts traverse, like the one that FAR used to add back in 0.90.\n\nEDIT: This mainly concerns the all-moving fins and control surfaces.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T17:10:02Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 05:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tankbuster32**"}]}
