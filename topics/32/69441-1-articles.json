That said, I know there are other alternatives including sub-orbital flights, for which you also get a bonus for where the craft went that you might miss if you just do orbital missions all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what do you do...?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EUnlock techs/Go for glory?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOrbital/Sub-orbital?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWho\u0027s your first Kerbal in space?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll share a picture of my first-mission launcher later when I\u0027m home, but for know I\u0027m just curious if anyone has a set strategy or ritual they go through for this milestone?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RW-1","CreatedById":107278,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-15T16:29:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I can tell ... if you don\u0027t edit your crew and it\u0027s a single capsule, most end up launch Jeb first by default.
