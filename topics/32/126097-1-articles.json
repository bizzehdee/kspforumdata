That is they do neither float nor sink while standing still. This is achieved by adjusting the amount of ore in your tanks. Sadly it is not practical to refill the ore tanks, so as you use up your fuel, you will become buoyant again :(.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Make sure your center of buoyancy is above your center of mass, or you will be floating (or sinking) belly up.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taowulf","CreatedById":149037,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T01:11:54Z","Content":"\nI am trying to decide if \u0022subversives\u0022 or \u0022submirsives\u0022 would be a better way to describe \u0022submarine people\u0022. :D\n"}]}
