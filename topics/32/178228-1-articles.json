But my comp isn\u0027t great and will sometimes only last 2 hours of running KSP before it or the game needs a reboot. Sometimes I\u0027m lucky and get 6-8 hours, but not always. Add in the fact that the auto save only occurs at given points and you can go for days before suddenly loosing everything you\u0027ve just done, and I save a lot, even if I don\u0027t use it much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
