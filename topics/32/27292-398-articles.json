Jeb needed a transfer burn from Dres back to Kerbin and I had to set up an aerobraking for Bill after his rather failed landing attempt at Moho (not engough dV to circularize...). At least he got all the other science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter this I had to fight against two possible Kraken encounters. First a black screen ate my Eve/Gilly lander (and the save game) after that my Ike lander disassembled during flight with superluminous velocity. After some tries I could prevent the first one from occuring (no idea, why it was there and even less ideas, why it somehow wasn\u0027t there any more...). For the second one a small save game edit rescued Camwise and he started again with a new craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/GOzOs8g\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GOzOs8gl.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022GOzOs8gl.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Camwise broke the speed limit.

First Bob entered the Eve system with his ship. After a very hot aerobrake he could set up an Apoapsis at about the Periapsis of Gilly, his final destination. After raising his Pe a bit, he could start his two unmanned Eve landers. One to take readings of the upper atmosphere and landed and one to take the readings of the lower atmosphere and splashed down. Both worked fantastic and could send all there data back to Kerbin. Only the temperature scan splashed down did not work, because the device is under water and not selectable and SAS is not engough to rotate the vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith his first mission accomplished Bob could concentrate on his Gilly landing. After some waiting orbits he got a free intercept with Gilly. Circularizing and science from high orbit (20 km, high orbit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E) were no problem for the Kraken hardend veteran. Than came the science from low orbit. After the science Bob wanted to stay in this altitude till he is on the sun side and land there. Unfortunatly he did not know that the highest elevation of Gilly reaches into the high orbit altitude. Therefore his vessel smashed right into that mountain. But with a orbital velocity of about 20 m/s his craft survived more or less intact. He only lost his almost empty transfer fuel tank and 2 of his 4 landing legs. Failure is not an option, therefore he had to try to land is craft without landing gear. It worked. After skidding half over the surface due to the high rotation speed of Gilly Bob really manged to land on his two LV-Ns upright.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/tg7ldGc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tg7ldGcl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tg7ldGcl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Landing on 2 LV-Ns.
