It started to coast ahead of me, got to about 400 or so meters ahead of me in orbit. I thought hey, thats no biggie, it should dip lower as its on a high suborbital trajectory. Oh boy was I wrong!

As KSP cannot register collisions when physics is not enabled on a craft, it\u0027s impossible to generate true, self-exacerbating Kessler syndrome. Now, it can be recreated artificially by smamming a dedicated parking orbit with debris.
