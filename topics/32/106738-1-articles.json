The directly attached engine was much better, with its heat seemingly being dumped into the tank and dissipated well from there. \n\nA good solution also seems to be to use stack couplers. Before 1.0 I didn\u0027t use them because they were heavy and you could do a better job with some Cubic Octagonal Struts. \n\nHere the temp of the engines in the same time reached 820 and rising. So better than the other part-based attachment methods, with the coupler and tank dissipating heat. \n\n![U8ENObM.png](http://i.imgur.com/U8ENObM.png)\n\nBut the best way I\u0027ve found so far to manage heat (other than straight onto a coupling point) is like this. The temp only got to 640...\n\n![7x81g9i.png](http://i.imgur.com/7x81g9i.png)\n\nSo, if you are going to run nukes for a long time then I\u0027d suggest the following order as best for avoiding the engines blowing up through overheating:\n\n1. Directly attach to tank(s) coupling point. If you have, say, four engines then use four smaller tanks rather one big one to give four direct attachment points. \n\n2. Radially attach the engines to the side of a big tank with small tanks. \n\n3. Use a stack coupler.\n\n4. Use Cubic Octagonal Struts or BZ-52 Radial Attachment Points only if you must, as the temp could reach exploding point on a really long burn.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T00:55:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 12:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Foxster**"}]}
