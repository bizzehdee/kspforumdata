If your TWR is too small (but greater than 1 at lift-off), you\u0027ll end up needing more deltaV. For the flight to Kerbin orbit, the waste of deltaV is due to increased amount of time spent in low atmosphere, which meant low ISP for your engines and increased gravity loss. For orbit transfers, the waste of deltaV is due to long burn that occur in non-optimal points (for example, the theoretical minimal delta V using a Hohnman transfer is calculated with a instantaneous burn). But if TWR is big, it means you could have carried more fuel (thus more deltaV), and you\u0027re \u0022wasting\u0022 your engine\u0027s maximum thrust. Also if TWR is too high, the structural load may also be too high for your rocket / spacecrafts, which is why many real world rockets throttles downs during parts of their flight.
