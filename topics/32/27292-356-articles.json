I sent Munbles Kerman on a double-landing Minmus mission. He came back with a hefty dose of science! I want to say about 700. Not sure. Then, having unlocked the Gravioli detector I sent a ship piloted by Bob to swing round the Mun and then head to just outside Kerbin\u0027s SOI doing a lot more science. Currently, he is past the Mun. I think I have readings from \u0022high above\u0022 and \u0022just above\u0022 4 biomes. Something like 8 or 9 sitting in my crew module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob also did a few crew and EVA reports that it seems I had missed. With that science!

All leftover fuel was transferred into the CSM (about 205 liquid fuel, I think), and there was 166 left after the return burn. I think I\u0027ll take a bit off the ascent stage as well, which should bring the combined mass of CSM and LM under 50t, and possibly under 45t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven though it\u0027s overkill, I\u0027ll probably still launch it on the FiveByFive, though.
