I am in the section about flight tests, especially testing the escape mechanisms. This little passage caught my eye...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Saturday March 18, 1961, after a four-hour delay caused by checkout problems, Little Joe 5A roared and soared up from the beach at Wallops Island at 11 minutes before noon. The takeoff looked good, but 20 seconds later and 14 seconds too early the capsule escape rocket again fired without the capsule. Warren North described the flight graphically:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 35 seconds the normal abort signal released the capsule clamp ring. A single retrorocket, which was installed as an emergency separation device, received a premature firing signal at 43 seconds. The dynamic pressure at this point was 400psf - ten times as great as dynamic pressure at apogee where emergency capsule separation should have taken place. The capsule tumbled immediately upon separating and narrowly missed the booster as it decelerated. The retropack and escape tower were inadvertently jettisoned or torn off as the capsule tumbled. Apparently the centrifugal force and/or the escape tower removed the antenna cannister, deploying both the main and reserve parachutes. The capsule descended on both parachutes, which were only slightly damaged during high q deployment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHands up if you\u0027ve done something similar......\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T15:23:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI eject from the exploding rocket, forget to turn sideways, and eventually the rocket slamd into my descending capsule killing the three pilots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LaydeeDem","CreatedById":5984,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T15:23:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds EXACTLY like all of my test launches.
