Why are the Kerbals in every photo wearing helmets? Is it to protect them from the lack of air? **NO,** it\\\u0027s to protect them from the smell of mint or they\\\u0027d be too tempted to start *eating* Minmus! Have you ever seen a Kerman with a *spoon* in any official photo? **More evidence!**\n\nThe Kerbols diligent reporters say that it\\\u0027s *quite likely* the mysterious *Squad* like ice cream, the links just keep adding up! There\\\u0027s even telling reports from ex-kerbolnauts cleaners that they overheard the first ever Minmus landing took place in an *ice cream factory!*\n\nSo far the mysterious *Squad* have made no comment *confirming* or *denying* these allegations, yet more proof!\n\nNew evidence comes to light!
