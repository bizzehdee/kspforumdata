I made a post with some of my ideas for expanding career mode a while ago, I figured it\u0027s relevant to copy and paste here (with some modifications as my opinions have changed):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:22.4px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;margin-left:40px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\nThere should be a more managerial-y feel to career mode, like you\u0027re actually the head of the space program. One way that could help achieve this would be the addition of an extra building, or an addition to the administration building.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:22.4px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;margin-left:40px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\nIn this building, you can choose how you want the program to be run. You can choose between being public funded and private funded. With public funding, you will receive a certain amount of money every Kerbin year or so, the amount depends on your reputation. You can still do contracts but the rewards for them are lower than what they\u0027d be like if the program was privately funded. Most of the contacts you get will be ones like \u0027Retrieve science data from _____\u0027 or \u0027Set up a space station in orbit of _____\u0027, and less part testing and visual surveys. If you screw up a mission and a Kerbal gets killed or anything else happens that damages your reputation, be prepared to take a big reputation hit! Much larger than the reputation hit from being private funded. This in turn will affect the amount of money you get every year.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:22.4px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;margin-left:40px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\nIf you choose to be private funding, you get the full scope of contracts and much larger rewards for doing them, but you don\u0027t get the money every year that public funding gives you. Reputation hits from catastrophic failures are lower. Also with private funding, you can choose the sorts of contracts you want to do. If you want to focus on visual surveys, then you can do so, and the generated contracts at Mission Control will be 75% visual surveys. This way you can choose to do the types of missions you want without having to spam the decline button in order to find one you want to do.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:22.4px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;margin-left:40px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\nAnother feature of this building is something like a suggestions box that members of the Kerbal public can put their opinions of the space program into. These tips will help you improve the space program, and they\u0027d be more strict for public funded programs. For example, if you\u0027re been doing nothing but Kerbin system missions for 5 years, you\u0027ll get a lot of suggestions like \u0027What have these scientists and engineers been doing all this time? Isn\u0027t it time to go interplanetary now!?\u0027 or if you have lots of astronauts in the Astronaut Complex, but none of them have been on a mission in a while, you\u0027ll get a suggestion like \u0027What are these astronauts doing all day? Playing video games?\u0027. If your space program is doing well, the suggestions box will praise that too, but its main purpose will be to point the player in the right direction for what to do next.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:22.4px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;margin-left:40px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\n(Also, this would also give Squad an opportunity to introduce a new KSC staff member who runs the building, who could be female.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:22.4px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;margin-left:40px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\nAnother idea I had is one I already posted here, but I want to expand upon it. I like the outpost-building contracts because I like building space stations and stuff, but it sucks because...well, nobody actually uses them. I put this space station it orbit around Jool? Cool! ...Now what? I will get the occasional boring contract to adjust its orbit but\u00A0as far as I\u0027m concerned, it\u0027s useless space junk once it fulfils its contract parameters. It would be neat if you had contracts that would have you ferry tourists to these space stations and bases, dock to them and spend some time there, and then get \u0027em home again. It would be even cooler if these contracts had a time limit too - if they don\u0027t get there in time, or get home in time, you fail the contract. Not only could tourists visit these outposts but scientists from the agencies could want to use the science facilities of your outposts, and could yield a little science rewards too. You\u0027ll only get these types if you actually have an outpost set up, like if you don\u0027t even have a space station around Eve you won\u0027t get a contract asking to ferry people to an Eve outpost. I have some mods that let me do these kinds of contracts but they really should be stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hysterrics","CreatedById":151688,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-13T17:49:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222406055\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022106885\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455313772\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022135011\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022yorshee\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 hours ago, yorshee said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI only use Sandbox for testing crafts out, and Science mode is too grind-y for me.

I made a post with some of my ideas for expanding career mode a while ago, I figured it\u0027s relevant to copy and paste here (with some modifications as my opinions have changed):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:22.4px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;margin-left:40px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\nThere should be a more managerial-y feel to career mode, like you\u0027re actually the head of the space program. One way that could help achieve this would be the addition of an extra building, or an addition to the administration building.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:22.4px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;margin-left:40px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\nIn this building, you can choose how you want the program to be run. You can choose between being public funded and private funded. With public funding, you will receive a certain amount of money every Kerbin year or so, the amount depends on your reputation. You can still do contracts but the rewards for them are lower than what they\u0027d be like if the program was privately funded. Most of the contacts you get will be ones like \u0027Retrieve science data from _____\u0027 or \u0027Set up a space station in orbit of _____\u0027, and less part testing and visual surveys. If you screw up a mission and a Kerbal gets killed or anything else happens that damages your reputation, be prepared to take a big reputation hit! Much larger than the reputation hit from being private funded. This in turn will affect the amount of money you get every year.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:22.4px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;margin-left:40px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\nIf you choose to be private funding, you get the full scope of contracts and much larger rewards for doing them, but you don\u0027t get the money every year that public funding gives you. Reputation hits from catastrophic failures are lower. Also with private funding, you can choose the sorts of contracts you want to do. If you want to focus on visual surveys, then you can do so, and the generated contracts at Mission Control will be 75% visual surveys. This way you can choose to do the types of missions you want without having to spam the decline button in order to find one you want to do.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:22.4px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;margin-left:40px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\nAnother feature of this building is something like a suggestions box that members of the Kerbal public can put their opinions of the space program into. These tips will help you improve the space program, and they\u0027d be more strict for public funded programs. For example, if you\u0027re been doing nothing but Kerbin system missions for 5 years, you\u0027ll get a lot of suggestions like \u0027What have these scientists and engineers been doing all this time? Isn\u0027t it time to go interplanetary now!?\u0027 or if you have lots of astronauts in the Astronaut Complex, but none of them have been on a mission in a while, you\u0027ll get a suggestion like \u0027What are these astronauts doing all day? Playing video games?\u0027. If your space program is doing well, the suggestions box will praise that too, but its main purpose will be to point the player in the right direction for what to do next.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:22.4px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;margin-left:40px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\n(Also, this would also give Squad an opportunity to introduce a new KSC staff member who runs the building, who could be female.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:22.4px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;margin-left:40px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\nAnother idea I had is one I already posted here, but I want to expand upon it. I like the outpost-building contracts because I like building space stations and stuff, but it sucks because...well, nobody actually uses them. I put this space station it orbit around Jool? Cool! ...Now what? I will get the occasional boring contract to adjust its orbit but\u00A0as far as I\u0027m concerned, it\u0027s useless space junk once it fulfils its contract parameters. It would be neat if you had contracts that would have you ferry tourists to these space stations and bases, dock to them and spend some time there, and then get \u0027em home again. It would be even cooler if these contracts had a time limit too - if they don\u0027t get there in time, or get home in time, you fail the contract. Not only could tourists visit these outposts but scientists from the agencies could want to use the science facilities of your outposts, and could yield a little science rewards too. You\u0027ll only get these types if you actually have an outpost set up, like if you don\u0027t even have a space station around Eve you won\u0027t get a contract asking to ferry people to an Eve outpost. I have some mods that let me do these kinds of contracts but they really should be stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should come over to the Career Mode Fixes Discussion. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit: WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME ANDEM ;_;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-13T17:51:53Z\u0022 title=\u002202/13/2016 05:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 13, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Sequinox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
