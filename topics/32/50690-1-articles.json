This also shows the impact quicksaves have on progress with the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe peril of quicksaves any gamer can testify to, as an error can lead to having to do an entire campaign over again or even the entire game. I, among others, have fallen victim to hitting quicksave at a death point, where nothing can be done to rescue myself. I have actually handicapped myself a couple of times by using quicksave at a point in a landing that took out a few options. I was finally able to land the craft, but with greater difficulty than if I were able to go back to an earlier position of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t beat yourself up too much.

I\u0027ve used git for a long time to maintain version control on my space program but git is not user friendly (its programmer friendly!) so I\u0027m making an interface and a manager around it to automate the tracking and make reverting just a 2 click operation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027ve got so far will automatically track your craft files each time you launch a craft that has been changed (you can also force a version at any point) and it will automatically track every single quicksave and persistence change. You can wind a crafts design history back to any previous launch, either because you messed up or just to look at how it was before and you can wind your saves back to virtually any point in time. It\u0027s made me immune to save corruptions/glitches and accidental save overwrites (like the OP had) and my craft are always protected against the most destructive force; me! Even if you delete a craft file, you can just recover it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause it uses git under the hood its very efficient in the HD space it needs to maintain all these versions (only the difference between versions are stored). The tool runs as a web server on your KSP machine which allows you to interface with it in a browser on any machine on your local network. So if you have an ipad or 2nd machine you can use it from that and not have to tab out of KSP to revert your craft/save files. Or just run it in a browser on your KSP machine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGit also enables notes (or commit messages) to be written along with each version so you can write notes about the changes you have made (actually turned out to be the trickiest part of the system, who knew!). I\u0027ve not got the facility to write messages about the changes to saves in yet, but that\u0027s the next feature I\u0027m going to add. I\u0027m very near to being able to realise this, at least as a test version. I also still have to add the ability to load a past persistent file as a quicksave file so you can f9 load any past autosave (that will be easy thou).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will make a post about this when it\u0027s ready. soon I hope!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
