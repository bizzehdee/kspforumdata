The idea was to save delta V getting into orbit, since the atmosphere is thinner at higher altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI performed one test from the launch pad and one test from the mountains at an altitude of 5500 m. it was pretty difficult to land on the mountains and it took quite some effort to get the launching site good to go.the test from the mountains was approximately 100-200 delta v cheaper than launching from the Launchpad. I only performed one test and I have to admit that my ascent profiles were not optimal in both cases\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 So it would be inappropriate to draw any scientific conclusions out of this one test, but fudge it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunching from the mountains will save some delta v but isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t worth the effort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was commuting from work the other day when I came up with a brilliant idea: Why not build a launch platform on the highest mountain ridge on Kerbin?! The high altitude and thin atmosphere would potentially save tons of mass and delta v. The thinner atmosphere would also make the high efficiency engines more attractive as a first stage. I knew this probably has been tested many times in the past, but I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t care. I just wanted to do the test and deliberately didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t perform any search queries on the interwebs to avoid spoilers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I got home I did a small altitude scan of the surface of the planet and performed some math. The highest mountain on Kerbinis approximately 6000 m high\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 According to my excel-sheet, that would mean that I theoretically could save a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cwhopping\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 200 delta v getting into orbit. Needless to say, I was a bit disappointed. But still, I wanted to test if it could be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I built a small launching vehicle with 0,25t payload with approximately 3900 delta V budget and created a TurbJet tug to transport the vehicle to the nearest mountains. I landed on a plot at an altitude of 5500m, decoupled the tug and launched my vessel into an 80 km orbit. My ascend profile wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t very efficient and when I reached orbit I had 200 delta V left in the tanks. I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t feel like redoing the test because I knew it wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t worth the hassle. Next, I launched the same vessel but this time I launched it from the ksc launch pad. The ascend profile in this case was also a bit inefficient. I started my gravity turn a tad too late. I ended up in an 80km orbit with 10-20 delta v left in the tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cconclusion\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 I would say, launching from a mountain is viable option to reduce fuel requirements to get something into orbit. However, the gains do not outweigh the extra effort which is needed to transport your vessel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will upload some pictures from the mission later on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-16T02:49:13Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2015 02:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Vanamonde\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-15T12:07:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProbably one of the reasons Kennedy Space Center is at sea level, instead of high in the mountains: logistics.
