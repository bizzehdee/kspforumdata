No - if you have a ship that\u0027s got as much as one mod part that\u0027s no longer present (or even something docked to it that fits that description), the ship won\u0027t only \u003Cem\u003Enot load\u003C/em\u003E - it will be permanently removed from your persistence file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you rely entirely upon mods, you run the risk that one mod that\u0027s not updated or no longer works will lock you out of your save or lose you a ship. I love mods, they make my game more enjoyable... but that\u0027s the real risk.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T06:40:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Uml\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCx\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Uml\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCx\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethere is a 64bit linux KSP ??? \u003Cp\u003Ewell.. but i don\u0027t think mods with windows dll\u0027s would work? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot all mods work, but \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24529-The-Linux-compatibility-thread!?p=442158\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post442158\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emany (such as Mechjeb) do\u003C/a\u003E.

I thought the 64bit version still had some big issues. And how does the framerate and performance compare to windows? I have a ubuntu install but it is sadly just 32bit, so havent tested it out on linux yet.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStability on 0.21 seems fine. I did have a crash on 0.20. I noticed a bug last night where there are some strange artifacts in the background when docking, but they don\u0027t affect anything. Hard to say whether this is due to Linux, 64-bit Unity, or just general alpha-ness, but there are certainly no blockers to playing the game. Which is great for alpha software really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrame rate seems fine, I play at 1280x1024 and full detail, scatter, etc (Nvidia GTX650 on an old Core 2 Duo). No lag seen, but I don\u0027t tend to launch any really stupidly complicated ships so I\u0027m possibly not the best person to judge. Running 64-bit can\u0027t hurt to avoid lag, crunching big juicy numbers is exactly the kind of stuff 64-bit excels at.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
