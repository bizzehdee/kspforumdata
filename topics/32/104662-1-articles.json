So after years of Harv taking a hardline against including any kind of what he has referred to as \u0022time-based mechanics in the game (namely life support and long-term research labs), we see **this**:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This week, along with various other tweaks and fixes, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been having a look at the Science systems, specifically the purpose of the Lab module, which so far hasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t been very worthwhile in terms of effort spent vs. the rewards it brings. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve completely rethought how Science Labs work now. Instead of merely boosting the xmit factor of a science experiment for a small amount (something that scientists can do now), and allowing you to restore inoperable experiments (also something scientists can do now), the Lab now works much more like a long-term research facility. Now, when you run experiments, you can transfer data to the lab just as before, but instead of a quick process for a small boost in the xmit factor, the data fed to the lab will generate a steady output of Science for a very long time, ultimately yielding far more science than transmitting or even recovering. This, of course, requires the labs to be manned by scientists, and have a steady supply of electricity. It should greatly increase the benefits of setting up orbiting science stations and surface bases, however, and also give you good reason to visit them every now and then. (The data does decay after a while, and the labs can only hold so much processed data before having to transmit, so don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t expect to be able to timewarp your way to infinite science)\n\nIn the [latest DevNotes](https://kerbaldevteam.tumblr.com/post/117031055505/devnote-tuesday-thank-you).\n\nWait, I thought it was **impossible** for time-based mechanics to be fun? I thought the mere [existence of time-warp would completely negate such a mechanic](https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/2lyk29/a_massive_wishlist_of_features_for_future_versions/clzfwli)!?\n\nI know I\u0027m gonna get hate for this position, but it just drives me up the wall that, suddenly, this mechanic **can** be fun... It is just so frustrating to see the devs do a complete 180 on these topics without any kind of acknowledgement that of the shift. I really hope they implement this right, but I\u0027m getting really nervous about the quality of 1.0 with all these features being shoved in at the last minute without any time to test balance.\n\nAnd to be clear, I\u0027m all for time-based mechanics, and if we\u0027re including them, then I think life support systems are worth being re-evaluated.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-22T12:28:40Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2015 12:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LethalDose**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T12:26:22Z","Content":"Isn\u0027t this what a lot of people wanted?

Right?\n\nNow, lets suppose they start implementing time based mechanics from now on. Why would they change their minds like this? This is what I speculate:\n\n1- Now players can more easily customize the level of difficulty of almost all of the basic mechanics, including time based ones (if they ever get implemented in the stock version).\n\n2- SQUAD added a new function called \u0022warp to\u0022 or something (inthe 1.0 release). This function lets you warp instantly into a point in time. Without this function, life support could be too hard for newb players, as they could warp too much time before realizing their crew is dead. Maybe this new function is one of the reasons why SQUAD would start working on time based mechanics.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is: maybe only now KSP has features that would make time based mechanics viable enough to meet SQUAD standards of gameplay.\n\nStill, I don\u0027t see why get angry at the devs for changing their minds and, in the end, adding something you like to the game.\n\nThis is not a hate post."},{"CreatedByName":"The Czosnex","CreatedById":38038,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T13:34:32Z","Content":"The lab yielding science over time mechanic would make more sense if there was life support.
