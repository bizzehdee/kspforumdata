The principle of this type of trajectory is similar to a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_cycler\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMars cycler trajectory\u003C/a\u003E, even though it isn\u0027t a true cycler trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI intend to use this type of trajectory for my manned mission to Duna because it will give my Kerbals the best chance of getting home if something goes wrong en route to Duna, just as Apollo 13 took advantage of a similar contingency to get back to Earth. The only catch is that it will take them almost 180 days to get home if they do have to use this option. Another catch is that it is less fuel efficient than a simple Hohman transfer. I calculated that I needed 260 m/s more delta-V to get to Duna using this method than I would have if I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d used a simple Hohman transfer. And it will take even more fuel to align them for Duna capture when they arrive. That being said, the outbound trip to Duna took just shy of 33 days. This shorter trip has obvious benefits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd while some may question the practicality of this type of trajectory due to the high fuel burn, it was an interesting challenge to plan and execute. It requires a very high degree of precision that would not be possible without accurate navigation. Even so, I did not use any mods to help me navigate the mission. Only the command pod\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s part.cfg file was modified to set the crew capacity to zero. Instead, I planned the mission prior to launch and relied on rudimentary celestial navigation and ded reckoning for navigation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the screen shots for anyone who\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s interested:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe inter-planetary escape burn was timed to begin 28 seconds after Kerbol set.

The main advantage of the cycler concept is to provide comfort for repeated long journeys, something like an interplanetary cruise ship. It allows you to launch the crew and cargo on small shuttle crafts at the departure and arrival points. The hab modules, cabins, entertainment, kitchen, exercice equipment, zero-g swimming pool (!), and so on, go on the cycler ship and are only launched once and reused for many round trips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shuttle crafts still have to carry the same delta-v as the interplanetary cycler (because they have to rendez-vous on the cycler\u0027s interplanetary orbit), but they can be lighter and therefore use less fuel on each round trip.

And because you\u0027re crossing Duna\u0027s orbit at a significant angle, your relative speed is very high. As a result, the \u0022window\u0022 during which you\u0027re within range of Duna\u0027s SOI is quite short. During a Hohman transfer intercept, you have a fairly long period where you are basically flying parallel to the target\u0027s orbit, so you don\u0027t need to be as precise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the semi-major axis of the transfer orbit, it needs to be the (cube root of 32 divided by 2) times Kerbin\u0027s semi-major axis.

I am aware that this wasn\u0027t a true cycler trajectory and that they aren\u0027t very useful for a single trip to Duna. I just wan\u0027t sure what to call it because, as Vexx32 points out, it is unclear whether it is really called a free-return trajectory either. Instead, I called it a \u0022proof of concept Duna cycler trajectory\u0022, because it is that. It wouldn\u0027t take much fiddling with these initial conditions to turn it into a true cycler trajectory. But maybe someone out there knows the proper term for a trajectory like this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will use this trajectory when I send my Kerbals to Duna.
