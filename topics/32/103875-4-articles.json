Say it aint\u0027 so. If the fairings are limited to both separating at the same time then that would suck big time!\n\u003E  So, I\u0027m not a fan of the texture on the fairing. It looks cheap to me. I cannot wait to play with them though. I am very concerned about my above statement. It really does look like the fairings release from a single point and therfore will not be able to seperate one at a time.. This is a MAJOR shortcoming. Considering we can do this with stock already..\n\nWhat is it that people find unattractive about the new fairings? Is it the yellow stripe? The textures seem at least as good as the ones in Procedural Fairings, and they have some visual interest rather than being a big, plain white thing. Maybe Maxmaps lack of skill at creating fairings is making them look worse than they normally would.\n\nAs far as separation sequences, I would be surprised if it wasn\u0027t possible to separate fairing segments individually. Even if there are some shortcomings with the implementation of fairings, improvements may come later, or worst case, a mod is created that enhances their function while still remaining \u0022stock.\u0022 Kind of like how we use Editor Extensions now, which still creates stock craft which can be shared with anyone.

Yes, it\u0027s frustrating having to speculate about functionality rather than try it out ourselves, but that\u0027s where we are.\n\nIn the past, Squad had stated that once 1.0 was released the game was finished and development would halt. Now, obviously, they\u0027ve backed away from that claim, but I think there\u0027s still a lingering feeling that not too many updates will appear once 1.0 hits the shelves. So you\u0027d rather want 1.0 to be as good as can be, and not a half-baked product still in development. And with so many new features to be added it *is* going to be a half-baked product.\n\nSecond, in a world where many early access games disappointed or never came to full development, KSP is a shining example of \u0022early access done right\u0022 and is getting a good amount of attention in the gaming world. Going 1.0 is the moment where major gaming sites (and magazines. do they still exist?) will review the game. You can only do that once. Most of us rather see KSP get a glorious A\u002B\u002B review than a \u0022B-, it has potential but many features need work and are badly implemented\u0022 review. A better review means more sales, and more room for further development.\n\nThird, there\u0027s a whole bunch of features that\u0027s going to be in the 1.0 release that were not in the beta version. *Well, you have a point there, that\u0027s what a beta is for, to test out those new features*. Well, not really. That\u0027s what an *Alpha* version is for. In Beta you\u0027re supposed to stop adding features and focus on plugging bugs. And Squad\u0027s not even doing *that*.\n\nIt\u0027s like taking a road trip from Chicago to New York. Most of the trip has gone amazing. But passing the New Jersey state line (always a bad omen) your driver whips out a bottle of Grey Goose and starts drinking heavily while driving. \u0022*Hey, if we crash right now we\u0027ve come a long way, I\u0027m still happy with where we are!*\u0022 True, but seeing bad behavior at this point is still a reason for concern. *Especially* with the finish line in sight."},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T16:40:42Z","Content":"Am I the only one who actually likes the yellow stripe on the fairings?

How? Well, apart from scenery, craft orientation, designated launch site and camera behavior, there isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t anything else the SPH and VAB scenes have different from each other. In fact, about 90% of the scene logic is an exact copy on both of them, so instead of having two scenes with a lot of repeated components, there is now a single Editor scene, and the game moves into it by calling a method where you specify which Facility you want to head into.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [To add the new gizmos to the editor](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97766-Devnote-Tuesdays-The-KSPumpkin-Edition), I had to delve into one of the most convoluted areas of KSP code, the editor logic. That part of the code is very sensitive to small changes, so poorly-planned tweaks to it usually end up creating a heap of bugs.\n\u003E This time around though, I decided to put an end to it and take on a complete overhaul of the editor logic code. I undid the mess of switch statements and state logic we had, and replaced it completely by a proper finite state machine setup, using the same FSM system I wrote for the Kerbal EVAs for 0.16. The KerbalFSM system is generic and fully expandable, and allows us to have much more control over what is meant to happen and when.\n\u003E \n\u003E Of course, this meant chucking out a lot of working editor code, but it was for the best. If we had left it as it was, we wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be able to add new features without increasing even more the complexity of that already critically complex blob of code.

The terms \u0022alpha\u0022 and \u0022beta\u0022 never really applied to KSP, despite the last version being called \u0022Beta than Ever.\u0022 The reason we got all these early versions of this game is because we paid for it. We\u0027re customers, not testers. Sure, we can report bugs, but I guarantee you that the value of bug testing done by the consumer is close to nil. In fact, the work it takes to sift through duplicate bugs, or game suggestions disguised as bugs, probably far outweighs any benefit. I actually have a job as a game tester for a major company, and I know that there is a humongous difference between a consumer casually playing and reporting bugs they find, and a team of dedicated, experienced testers. The only reason companies do actual beta testing is for online games, where massive numbers of players are required for stress-testing and such.
