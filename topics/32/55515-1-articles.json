These are fairly simple in concept, you take two or three images from slightly different angles, align them and make a short, repeating gif. The resulting image can give you a pretty good sense of depth. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried this out with a few recent creations of mine. The best result came from, not surprisingly, the most time-consuming and painstaking method. For this image I cut out the craft from the second frame and overlaid it on the first frame. I used the clone stamp tool to cover up the exposed edges of the craft from the original frame. The fixed background really makes the craft stand out, I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Wiggles/3-nostromo-background.gif~original\u0022 alt=\u00223-nostromo-background.gif~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can compare this to another example with a moving background. It works ok, but it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not as good as the first image. This one uses three images (which comes out to four frames in the final gif), this tends to give better results. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Wiggles/1-nostromo-3-frame.gif~original\u0022 alt=\u00221-nostromo-3-frame.gif~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaking gifs for larger constructions is a bit trickier. For this base I can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t cut out the craft because it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s attached to the ground, trying to separate the base from the ground would just look strange. I also need to be more careful about aligning the frames, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s important to keep one central element in a fixed position in every frame, even a small change can ruin the effect. Having the craft take up such a large part of the screen also causes issues, the edges of the craft can be a little distracting because they move so much. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Wiggles/8-mun-3-frame.gif~original\u0022 alt=\u00228-mun-3-frame.gif~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Wiggles/17-mun-3-frame.gif~original\u0022 alt=\u002217-mun-3-frame.gif~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes you get a little of that popup book effect, where everything looks strangely flat. You can also see how using only two frames can make things look a little too shaky. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Wiggles/13-mun.gif~original\u0022 alt=\u002213-mun.gif~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd sometimes I can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really get it to work.

Within photoshop I can see a difference, and for some of them it is an improvement (the base pictures don\u0027t look as good though, the large movements between frames gets more distracting at faster transition speeds). But the gif save preview in photoshop is even faster, the screen starts to look warped if you look at it long enough, it\u0027s very strange and definitely too fast. Once they are saved I can\u0027t see a difference though, the gif playback seems to be dependent on the viewing software, there seems to be some minimum transition speed that makes faster transitions not work (they can be slowed down though). I\u0027ll see if I can find a way around that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T23:40:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI managed to get some images with faster transition times, but apparently browsers are stupid and cut off the minimum transition time.
