FRAPS \u0022was\u0022 a great program years ago. It still get the job done, but in my opinion, there is far superior software out there. Besides the darkness, I\u0027ve had problems with fraps including but not limited to dark colors being washed out, framerate issues, and audio/video syncing problems. I would recommend if you want to record gaming footage pick up \u0022Dxtory\u0022 here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://exkode.com/dxtory-features-en.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://exkode.com/dxtory-features-en.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s about $33.00 bucks in USD.
