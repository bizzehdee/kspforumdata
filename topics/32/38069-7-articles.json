It was an exciting read. I know very little of it is set in stone, but I hope a lot of it will end up in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the things I am looking forward to most is the ability to do science in space and return the data to Kerbin, and that evidently is coming in .22, so I\u0027m a little giddy about that already. Beyond that, some other possibilities (some from the \u0022planned features\u0022 page) that most excite me about KSP are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Re-entry heating and damage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Additional planet details, but most especially clouds and night side city lighting for Kerbin itself\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) More planets/moons/asteroids/comets/etc. in the solar system to visit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) An observatory where you go to actually discover such additional solar system objects - until then, they are still out there, but you can\u0027t see them on your navigational charts until you either find them with the observatory or else encounter them in an actual flight. (I can imagine flying a mission to the outer reaches of the solar system and suddenly happening upon some object I hadn\u0027t previously known was there ... exciting! Even moreso if you end up running right smack into it, hehe.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Krupski","CreatedById":80925,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T00:03:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Awass\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Awass\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI would love to have in a career mode little clips of news coverage of your launches, like actual footage of your launches, successes, and awesome explosions.

All that needs to be saved is a timeline, coordinates vs time and the parts that make up the vehicle. It would be easy to \u0022play back\u0022 that data into the game engine and replay what had already been done. I\u0027m sure it would even be easy to watch a recorded mission from another location (like watching a launch from the ground or seeing a lander coming in for a landing while watching from the destination planet).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the same thing that\u0027s done for multiplayer. Every player\u0027s coordinates are sent over the network and each client renders the remote players at their coordinates. Shooter games also send weapon and projectile vector data so that shots, hits and misses can be rendered on all clients.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly problem with multiplayer is that each client would need the same setup (or be able to download parts and textures for missing parts). Hacked parts (like fuel tanks with double the fuel) would need to some how be prevented (or replicated to all players).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, more realistic mass and fuel loads would be nice.
