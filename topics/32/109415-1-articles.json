Weird o\\_O\n\nI have wondered likewise of Moho, where in v0.90 my SCANsat probe disappeared into never-never-land before completing its scans. A few here in the forums had mentioned that orbits about Moho can be \u0027wonky\u0027. I\u0027ll find out soon enough if the same is true in v1.0.2, as I\u0027m preparing another SCANsat mission there soon (right after I\u0027m done with Eve and Gilly). I\u0027ll note that when I did a SCANsat mission for Pol in v0.90, I had no problems holding orbits of 250km and 750km the duration of the lo-res and hi-res scanning. The vessel for that mission was, also, an Ion probe."},{"CreatedByName":"NoPanShabuShabu","CreatedById":91327,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T07:10:19Z","Content":"That inability to save is the game getting ready to crash.

However, Pol is definitely bugged in other ways. The main problem is that the visible surface mesh and the invisible surface collider do not correspond, and the error in the surface collider is on the high side. Thus, as you\u0027re coming down for a landing and every instrument as well as your eyes are telling you you\u0027re still like anywhere from a few hundred to 1500m above the ground and thus going rather fast, BOOM!, and the F3 post mortem says you collided with Pol. Or, if you\u0027re coming down very slowly and cautiously, you can actually land safely on the invisible collider well above the visible ground. This bug seems concentrated in areas near the taller mountains so it\u0027s best to land in the more open regions.\n\nThis particular bug isn\u0027t unique to Pol.

It\u0027s gravity isn\u0027t huge and it\u0027s conveniently located next door to and coplane with Laythe, which will surely be the main focus of any Jool expedition. Sure, Vall\u0027s got more gravity than Pol but, due to the distance and inclination changes travelling to and from Pol, you actually have more efficiency (and less time wasted) using Vall. Plus, of course, Pol is horribly bugged while Vall has an interesting anomaly to investigate.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Does this apply to v1.0.2 or previous versions?\n\nI can\u0027t say from personal experience but I\u0027ve seen several posts lately talking about Pol\u0027s collider bug, so I\u0027m sure it\u0027s still there.

IE, the Explore Pol contract could not be completed because despite orbiting, collecting science, then landing (after dying) and then returning to Kerbin resulted only in completing the surface objectives.
