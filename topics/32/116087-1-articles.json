BUT I\u0027m having trouble orbiting efficiently, I\u0027m burning way to much fuel for what I\u0027m doing.. So assuming physics have changed a little and/or aerodynamics, what is the efficient launch trajectory? Thanks!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nSide note: haha looking at my forum join date it was almost 2 years ago :S"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T18:31:02Z","Content":"You have to fly like you would\u0027ve with FAR in 0.90 and below."},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T18:33:46Z","Content":"The atmosphere changed with 1.0, and then changed a few more times with subsequent panic patches.\n\nWhat to do now is to pitch 10 degrees after about 1km off the launchpad (sometimes less) to initiate a gravity turn into orbit. By 10-15km I am at 45 degrees, I burn out of the atmosphere and circularize. Atmo still stops at 70km. Its a little different than the ol straight up to 10k and turn, you have to watch your speed as heating can become a factor if you\u0027re too fast."},{"CreatedByName":"Dewm","CreatedById":76148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T18:40:19Z","Content":"Yeah I remember the 10K and turn, that\u0027s what I\u0027ve been doing, and like I said..its bad. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI appreciate the info, I\u0027ve been running into heat issues on the way up, and getting completely fried on the way down, I think I need more shallow re-entry trajectories. So things have definitely changed. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) but like I said, been having a blast."},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T18:49:56Z","Content":"Yup - shallow re-entries are the way forward now and Klesh has you covered for the new launch profile.\n\nThe new aerodynamics are great though - you can do proper gravity turns now, as in \u0027switch off SAS and let the rocket fly itself.\u0027 Well sort of - I tend to chicken out at about 45 degrees and fly the rest of the ascent manually. But it\u0027s still pretty cool to watch the first half of the launch!"},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T18:51:55Z","Content":"Indeed. Play with your thrust levels on boosters stages and such, so you don\u0027t go screaming up, you want to stay around 250m/sec or so for the first while, then you can get faster once you\u0027re through some of the thicker air. Also, I find I dont use SAS on the initial stages or you get too much wobble. Potentially limit engine gimbal as well. I\u0027ll turn it on when I am just about to go to my upper stage, higher up where there is less air for the gimbaling to fight against causing wobble. Re-entry can be tough too with the heat, and aerocapturing is vastly different now."},{"CreatedByName":"Dewm","CreatedById":76148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T18:57:00Z","Content":"Thanks for the info everyone!\n\nKlesh, I was looking at your pictures in your sig, you have one \u0022preparing a flyby of Vall on the way to Jool\u0022, are those stock graphics?

I use [Distant Object Enhancement](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/69907-0-24-Distant-Object-Enhancement-1-3-1-Planets-satellites-in-the-night-sky!-%287-29%29) too, but everything you\u0027re seeing there is loaded and probably not altered by it. I don\u0027t have any shadows mod, but I do think I have them cranked up in the settings maybe?"}]}
