I\u0027m interested to know what you guys like the most about KSP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMe, I like the premise of having a Space Program, and managing it to earn money/science through contracts and exploration. I pretty much use mechjeb for all my missions since I\u0027ve unlocked it, although I can manually fly ships if needed. I focus on the designing the crafts/missions aspect of the game, and letting the Kerbals do all the heavy maneuvering. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make it more immersive I installed Kerbal Construction Time so actual real time passes between missions, and it\u0027s working out pretty good so far.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pi_","CreatedById":37890,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T10:15:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like playing vanilla normal mode with reverts, because I can experiment with designs.
