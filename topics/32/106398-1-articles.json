Forgive me if this is a novice question, but for some reason I\u0027ve been staring at this for the last hour and am unable to see what is probably obvious:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to calculate specific impulse. In its simplest form, specific impulse is just \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E\u003Csub\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esp \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E\u003Cem\u003E= thrust in newtons / fuel consumption in kg/s\u003C/em\u003E, from Kerbal\u0027s wiki on the matter. Yet I can\u0027t seem to get that to work using the info on the parts wiki. For example, the max thrust of the Thumper is 275 kN and the consumption at 1 atm is 22.63 kg/s...yet 275/22.63 is 12.15, or an I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E in seconds of 12.15 x 9.80 = 119.09s. The wiki says the Thumper has a 165s I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E at 1 atm. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat am I missing here? Am I not suppose to use Max Thrust for F\u003Csub\u003ET\u003C/sub\u003E? Is there some conversion I was suppose to make? Hmmmm...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T22:41:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMany engines have been re-balanced, in later KSP versions, but even more important, the ISP relationship is now correct in KSP 1.0. The FF of the Thumper is 0.16995 U/s, that multiplied by the gravity (9.81 m/s^2) gives a weight of 1.667 kg/s. Yes the thrust at 0 ASL is 275 kN.
