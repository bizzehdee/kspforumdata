I too have tried, and am now testing the version by Rocket2Guns CSS 2.0 which is done very well, but flyability is in question. I am currently working on the SBR fuel tank separation. I have gotten the thrust systems working well enough. To any one working on the same project, the THRUST GIMBAL has to be set at 10.5 this is STS accurate, and it helps in the launch, however, you must jettison the Srbs when they are 98% exhausted. This prevents the nasty over thrust in a semi vacuum and prevents the shuttle from flipping over. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I get the numerical timing down, I shall post the sequence. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore to follow.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vade","CreatedById":48853,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T19:02:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy name the thread shuttle transport systems sytems\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boffinbox","CreatedById":64687,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T19:08:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERAID array\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EATM machine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPIN number\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECD disk\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERAS syndrome!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThePyrateCaptain","CreatedById":57208,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T19:58:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vade\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vade\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhy name the thread shuttle transport systems sytems\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually I put it in the wrong location.
