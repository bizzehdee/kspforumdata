( at least on low to medium settings ) ? I am sorry if I sound Stingy, but its all I can afford right now. besides, computer parts a bit cheaper in India, so I could get some good deals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-07T07:33:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would really try to upgrade that videocard a little bit.
