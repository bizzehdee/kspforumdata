The scroll wheel moves up and down, right clicking will move in a circle around the object, but how do you move the center of camera to in a horizontal way? If this were blender it would be similar to the shift \u002Bmiddle mouse wheel click. I cannot remember the way to do this in KSP, which is a shame because i use to use it a while back....
