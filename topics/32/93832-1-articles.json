Admittedly, a slide rule or calculator makes it a lot faster. The toughest things about Apollo mission planning were, in order: #1) TT\u0026amp;C (tracking, telemetry and control) - they used a worldwide network of ground stations, airplanes and ships to keep a lock on a carrier signal for Doppler measurements; those were used for very precise measurement of velocity and distance. And #2) iterative estimates for burns. As we all know from KSP, changing your orbit doesn\u0027t happen instantaneously - it changes with every impulsive event, and - again from KSP - we know that mass changes as we thrust due to propellant consumption. So this is a non-linear problem that has not simple formulaic solution. You have to use an iterative calculation to simulate how the orbit will change over the length of the burn. This is trivial now due to advances in computing power - it was NOT trivial in the 1960\u0027s. It required long, tedious calculations step by step on paper, or using a room-sized mainframe to do it in several minutes to several hours - the more precisely you want to simulate, the longer the calculations take. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyway, yeah - being able to simulate stuff like this in KSP more or less instantly is amazing to this guy - I learned to do it the hard way in college on paper and then used 16 bit PC\u0027s to iterate orbit maneuvers and thought it was magic when I got an answer after a couple minutes. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingPete","CreatedById":127384,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-20T15:25:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LameLefty\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LameLefty\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhy complicate with a gravity assist?
