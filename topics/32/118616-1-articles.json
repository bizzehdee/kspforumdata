All supplies were low - in fact my previous attempt had ran out of fuel on Duna orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I use everything I know for a nice, slow, economical approach and rendezvous. I make it near the station, pick a docking port, come in... I\u0027m low on monoprop so I\u0027m using this trick where I turn RCS off when I need to turn, and back on when I need to move.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy goal is right in front of me, visible in my lights as I make final adjustments, careful not to clip any of the station\u0027s solar panels. When suddenly the craft refuses to rotate and my lights dim, brown out! I was out of power!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know whether that was planned by Squad or just the result of the simulation, but it was perfect! This gave me goosebumps. It was the perfect reminder of how even at the last minute things may still go wrong.
