Because of this, I decided to have smaller ships on it that can land and return to it, but I don\u0026#39;t have too much experience with landers alone. Ideally I would want something that can land on and return to orbit from a planet with at atmosphere. It would require a delta-V of 8,000 in both directions to land on and take off of Eve, so that\u0026#39;s unlikely, but I\u0026#39;d like it to at least be able to return from Laythe which would be about 2,000.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDoes anybody have any good designs for a lander/return craft like this? Even if it isn\u0026#39;t exactly this, ideas would help me design something.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-27T07:30:26Z","Content":"\nHaven\u0026#39;t done any atmo landers in 1.05 yet, sorry.
