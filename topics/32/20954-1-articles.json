Such a device would probably be used in SLR cameras with some creative re-engineering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe serious problem is with the lens though. Tbh, we aren\u0027t all that great at making perfect lenses. Many SLR cameras today have sensors that easily out-resolve many of the best lenses. This thing can clearly out-resolve even the best lenses on the market...and that really defeats the purpose. In terms of creative application, I don\u0027t see this being all that useful, since to get the image a photographer would want, they\u0027d still need a medium- or large-format size lens to accommodate it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously though, for surveillance, science, and a few other specific applications, this kind of design is pretty awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough...where\u0027s the focus mechanism? We can make a sphere out of glass...that\u0027s not so bad. However, I don\u0027t know of any material off the top of my head that could deform the shape of a sphere like that, with the required optical properties. (It\u0027s possible to change the focus by moving the sensors, but I suspect that the reason such a system didn\u0027t arise out of natural evolution is the same reason we\u0027d try to avoid it: it\u0027s really, really complicated. Adjusting the lens is easier.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-01T01:13:25Z\u0022 title=\u002210/01/2012 01:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 1, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by phoenix_ca\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
