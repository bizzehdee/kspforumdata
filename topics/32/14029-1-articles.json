By this time I was on approach for encounter with Mun, but again, at over 4000\u002Bm/s I was on a course to be lost in space. After slowing tu under 1000m/s, I couldn\\\u0027t manage to get into orbit but was on course for a touchdown. Fast forward like 4 crashes later and I managed to come in for a safe approach, although it almost wasnt that way! There is an antenna that sticks out from the front of the craft and almost pole vaulted me right back into orbit! Be encouraged people! ;D\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
