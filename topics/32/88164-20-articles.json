The experience system doesn\u0027t make a lot of sense to me. It\u0027s been mocked in threads suggesting exactly this before so someone out there is happy about the news. Regardless, this is obvious a wait and see thing. For better or worse, I\u0027m interested in what it might mean for modding. Right now Kerbals are very static, and many people have wanted more of a reason to diversify Kerbals beyond putting another body in a seat. So that\u0027s fair and it is desired by a large portion of the community. This likely isn\u0027t going to affect sandbox, since no other career progression has, so it makes sense to assume that creative will stand static as it ever has.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, for Career progression I guess it just sounds a bit basic. The question to me is should it just be flat increase. It\u0027s not unreasonable to suggest some Kerbals are better suited to be pilots or scientists, it makes fine sense. The counter argument being it should be player skill and not Kerbal skill that determines craft performance. However, I know this is a highly unpopular idea, it would be more interesting to see them cause penalties in bad roles rather than bonuses. Instead of min-maxing, you\u0027d assemble a crew that provided the best experience for the right jobs. At the end of the day you are doing the same thing, but you aren\u0027t pushing the numbers up, you are just pushing them to the middle. Typically the player has a strong aversion to penalties, and as such we prefer bonuses. However, keeping with the theme of Kerbals, having those who AREN\u0027T suited for the job make the one that is extra valuable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of the day this will take the same cycle every new feature has: complaint, experience, acceptance, modding.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpenSpaceCorp","CreatedById":98977,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T20:21:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tend to disagree with the idea that individual Kerbals can affect part performance.
