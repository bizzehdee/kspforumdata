It makes any other design choice a mistake. Which I think is the opposite of what the game is about at his very core: problem solving. If you agree on this, you see that a 6000 SSTO solve all the problems the game throw at you. So it is game over, end of the game. And a game like KSP should not have a end.

Ok, i understand that SSTOs donw work in reality, and you aint gonna take one to jupiter (unless the government gives us the intergalactic UFOs they keep at area-51 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E). But why cant those of us that arent obsessed with reality to have our sci-fy and or fun craft back?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.0.4, was at least in my opinion pretty good for everyone. The heat stopped you from doing stupid stuff liek coming in straight at the center of kerbin from 30km/s speeds, but it did not really impose excessive limits, and allowed most designs to work reasonably well under most conditions. it was just perfect, you wouldnt really fry if you were careful about the ascent, and you could reach reasonable but not orbital velocities on jets (1600m/s could be done with very sleek designs, high TWR, and patience). As much as i loved the 0.90 jets, even i agree that getting to a 500km AP was complete bull without any space engines. Heat in 1.0.4 was just perfect, it felt balanced, challenging, but not annoying or excessively limiting for any particular design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the new drag, it seems to ONLY punish SSTO or spaceplane builds. At lower speeds and altitudes, i have experienced FAR LESS drag, and its easier to get even badly designed planes to supersonic or even hypersonic near seal level. As for rockets, most of teh time you just dont spend much time at those altitudes anyways (and most of teh time you have enough TWR that you just dont care about the somewhat higher drag). The only craft that needs to spend alot of time around 20-40km are spaceplanes as that is the region where you are doing most of your accelerating to orbital speeds, especially if you have lowish TWR. In 1.0.4, you could both get up to a higher speed before you needed to burn very inefficient rockets, and well, now you just cannot go the same speeds, so its ~150 or so less practical dV if you dont even count the losses you will take to drag as you slowly try to push through the atmo (which seems to have cut around 1.5K dV if not more from some extremely low TWR vessels that were like 30t pushed by a single nuke).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs herbal said, im also not too happy that every single update seems to break most of my craft. Pure space vessels aside (those just might need a redesign of the lifter at best), every atmospheric craft has needed to be rebuilt, some from ground up, to work at all in the new aero. Im not usually one to complain as i tend to just adapt and develop new methods to achieve the same things i had before, but this whole cycle of every update does major, and i mean major tweaks to the aerodynamics is getting a little annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually think ill take a break from SSTOs and focus on other craft. SSTOs were for me a real challenge and alot of fun, but until teh aero is one, somewhat consistent, and 2, arguably fun and balanced, i thing ill finish redesigning my latest good SSTO, and then just use it sparingly in combat since it was never particularly good at that anyways, given only 2 missiles that were mounted internally, and highish part counts too.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-12T21:21:09Z\u0022 title=\u002211/12/2015 09:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T21:21:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EStreetwind,\u003Cp\u003E According to my tech tree .cfg for 1.05, hypersonic flight is a tech level 7 node, which means that the Whiplash hasn\u0027t moved.

Long range SSTOs are something ive always enjoyed making, even if they would never exist in real life or whatever. If you gusy insist on everything realistic, go download RO, personally, its a boring mod since all it does is make getting anywhere harder, less fun, and it makes everything tedious. Its not a bad mod, but its not for me. So guys, if you are so strongly against SSTOs being capable of doing long range, or against SSTO in general as its \u0022unrealistic\u0022, then noone is forcing you to make SSTOs or cram 20 tons of fuel in one so it can do a laythe roundtrip. That said, i see no reason those of us that enjoy such a concept (and myself build more sci-fy then anything else in KSP), to be deprived of the ability to do so. Yeah, i know thats kinda opinionated, but im just as free to play how i want as anyone else, and what i do honestly feel, is that the new changes in 1.0.5 to heat and drag make the game LESS FUN overall for the way i play it, im not gonna go as far as to revert to 1.0.4, or start editing physics.cfg files, ill adapt as many will, but i still think the cganges to the aeor have made the game worse overall for any spaceplane or SSTO style builds, especially long range ones, and it doesnt make any other designs actually perform any better.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-13T07:32:56Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2015 07:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T12:05:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo you\u0027re right Panzer, everybody plays differently and that\u0027s part of what\u0027s killer about KSP.

Looking at the changelog, my impression is that the higher drag in the upper reaches of the atmo is not because they actually increased its density up there, but because they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re modeling turbulence, etc. differently now, and that produces more drag in thin air and less in thick air. I haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t actually checked this by taking up a barometer though. Also, if you are orbiting your ship with a relatively high TWR, like \u0026gt;= 0.5, then the new air really isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t going to hurt you that much because you can blow through it without losing much steam. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s really just the fine art of nudging a heavy, fuel-laden ship into orbit with a low TWR nuke engine that has suffered a grievous blow. These long-range designs were optimized to ship as little oxidizer as possible and make as much of the transition from air breathing to orbit as possible on the nukes. The way the air was in 1.0.4, their biggest hurdle was breaking the sound barrier. Now their biggest problem is their inability to push apoapsis up and out in the 30-40 km altitude zone against the increased drag. This can be straightforwardly fixed by shipping more oxidizer and/or less LF, but of course that way you end up losing quite a bit of range. That takes a number of really cool things one might have accomplished in 1.0.4 with fancy flying and good planning off the table. IMO these things were way too easy in 0.90, but in 1.0.4 I think they struck just the right balance of what was technically possible and what it took to achieve those things, making for some really rewarding challenges. Now the bar for those has been raised out of reach, which I guess some people regard as a good thing but it makes me sad.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tewpie","CreatedById":151920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T17:33:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis was going to be my stock payload challenge entry, I modified it to to carry LF instead of ore, and added two LV-Ns.

Of course that plane probably would have had 9km/s in the old aero system. Nonetheless, if I mentally put 4 more nukes on that plane to make it have a somewhat flyable TWR of 0.2 instead of a preposterous 0.067, hold my nose at the flagrant abuse of the cargo bay, put an actual Kerbal-containing cockpit on it, andgive it some solar panels, some reaction wheels, and some rcs, I expect you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll end up with somewhere close to 6km/s on orbit with that monster.
