But I don\u0027t want to go full Realism for some reasons: I don\u0027t want it to be overcomplicated and overtedious, its still a game. I don\u0027t need RealFuels or procedural tanks and I don\u0027t want to spent 10 min just to get into orbit in a full career game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I want some kind of Realism like FAR and DRE just to let the spaceflight still be difficult and give me engineering-challenges, just not overly long. And I like KSP to look somewhat good, which also rules out full RO since the ground is kinda flat. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally I definetly need some kind of RSS, since stock KSP became waay to easy for me and I really hate the high look from LKO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere the mods I will definitely use:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDRE\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKER\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKJR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAJE\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChatterer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKWRocketry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENavBallDockingAlignementIndicator\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Better Boyancy)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOPT Spaceplane Parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Atomic Age)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdjustable Landing Gear\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esome RSS config\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe RSS config will either be 3.2xRSS or 5xRSS, this is where I\u0027m most undecided: 5xRSS has really nice LKO\u0027s, has a challenging amount of DeltaV needed to Orbit (ca. 7km/s) and the Orbital manevers require a challenging amount to. 3.2xRSS has less from all just said (5.6km/s to Orbit), but It just looks A lot nicer on the ground, although the LKO looks a little less good(although miles better than stock).

If you\u0027re worried about it being not challenging enough, you can just install KIDS and nerf back all specific impulses.

Share your modlists.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne important mod is Claw\u0027s stock fixes. It takes care of many of the most annoying bugs in stock. No more buggy decouplers wrecking a ship even though the ejection force is ABOVE their CoM, and is a bit less heavy-handed than my own fix, and even fixes the long standing strut/decoupler bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS Build Aid is well made and very handy (my Horrible Nerf does away with 90% of reaction wheels). It\u0027s \u0022Engine\u0022 mode can be used even without RCS if you want to check the balance of a craft, and it\u0027s mass summary is quite nice. It pretty much did everything I hoped for, and then some. Oh, and it\u0027s \u0022average CoM\u0022 and \u0022dry CoM\u0022 markers are a very welcome addition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreciseNode is nice for delicate node adjustments. Prior to having it installed, doing fine adjustments in stock, or repeatedly clicking the orbit buttons often ended in grief, but with the correct settings (\u002710x UT values\u0027), I can now fine-tune nodes or advance entire orbits in one click without risking the node vanishing etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInFlightWaypoints is something that should have been stock (puts the waypoints for survey-class missions into the \u0027real world\u0027 view). It makes zeroing in on contract points much easier. No more staring at the navball. It also gives you a range-to-target and an ETA, quite nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve always considered KAS a must have. It adds real life to EVA - being able to do minor changes to ships outside of the VAB is awesome, and a KAS-enabled base is much neater with anchors and fuel lines etc. Winches can be handy as well. Changes EVA from a simple science-gathering/crew-transferring tool to WORKING in space. Added bonus: Current generation KAS seems a lot more stable than historical ones.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRex94","CreatedById":114868,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-30T20:44:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo about the RSS question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI couldn\u0027t decide, but decided to do my own config, based on latest WinterOwl Video, 3.2x and 5x Configs and my own wishes for an Improved Stock System.
