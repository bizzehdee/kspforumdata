My current game is heavily modded. My laptop would probably melt if not for the cooling fan unit beneath it. So, not sure if this is a game bug, mod bug, or some setting I fail to grasp - A while back I landed on a steep incline on Mun. EVA\u0027d and could not get back to the ship because the little green guy kept\u00A0sliding. IRL that would not happen but this is not RL. I accepted it. A few days ago I ditched a shuttle in the mountains just west\u00A0of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. I was\u00A0pretty pleased to land (on my own) intact on a gentle south facing slope. The shuttle would not stop sliding at 0.9 m/s. Exited to the tracking station where it allowed me to recover. Thought it odd but whatever. Now, I land\u00A0the shuttle on the runway (like a pro - okay \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E spaceplane guidance), cut the engines, locked the brakes, and flaps down. Plane kept a rollin\u0027 (all night long). Why? I have no idea. Check the settings on brakes, they were at stock position. Set them all the way up and made no difference. Any clues?
