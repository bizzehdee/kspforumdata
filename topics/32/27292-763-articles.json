Friday night was spent redesigning the \u003Cem\u003EOld Coot 7\u003C/em\u003E rescue plane (the one I was working on Thursday in which I made the mistake of ignoring my FAR design formulas). Bob snuck on board for the test flights; fortunately the redesign went well, and I had a successful launch, re-entry and landing. The design has a few bugs - it gets some pretty wicked Mach Tuck in the low trans-sonic and its not well area-ruled, but I still felt comfortable certifying it as \u0022Kerbal-rated: generally non-splody\u0022, and used the plane on Saturday night to successfully retrieve Seandard from Kerbin\u0027s orbit. I took a screenie of the \u003Cem\u003ECoot\u003C/em\u003E to show y\u0027all; unfortunately I forgot to post the thing, so it\u0027ll have to wait until later. Saturday also saw the final arrival of the \u003Cem\u003EBallista 7\u003C/em\u003E probe at Minmus as well as the Minmusport station. I ended the night by launching a \u003Cem\u003EStratofortress 7a\u003C/em\u003E towards Mun - this last flight was a moderate disaster, as I \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eneglected to\u003C/span\u003E forgot to set the alarm to put the thing in Mun orbit and didn\u0027t catch it until it was already out of Mun\u0027s SOI on its way back to Kerbin. I did a burn so that the thing would at least swing around the planet; I\u0027ll attempt another rendezvous later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the arrival of Minmusport, Bill in his \u003Cem\u003EProject Peacock 7\u003C/em\u003E could finally get underway with repairs to the \u003Cem\u003ESojourner 7\u003C/em\u003E survey probe. First part of that was to rendezvous with the newly-established space station to refuel; that was a touch tricky, but Bill did affect a successful rendezvous and docking - with 20 m/s of delta-V to spare. With the tanks topped off, he maneuvered to rendezvous with the probe, switching from an equatorial orbit to a polar one. Rendezvous was pretty standard and uneventful, and he was able to maneuver the \u003Cem\u003EPeacock\u003C/em\u003E within 10 meters of the probe. Then it was EVA time - having been equipped with extra EVA fuel, a screwdriver and his precious payload (a Communotron 16 antenna), he affected a successful repair of the probe, got back into the \u003Cem\u003EPeacock\u003C/em\u003E and then headed back to Minmusport, successfully docking with the station a second time. \u003Cem\u003ESojourner\u003C/em\u003E was finally able to scan Minmus for ore; good landing sites were logged and the \u003Cem\u003EMosquito 7\u003C/em\u003E drilling lander was placed on the surface to begin drilling operations. The \u003Cem\u003EWildcat 7\u003C/em\u003E, which held most of the ore tankage for the contract mission, then affected a landing next to Mosquito. That was a bit hairy (as are all close-proximity surface landings), but \u003Cem\u003EWildcat\u003C/em\u003E eventually set down within twenty meters of \u003Cem\u003EMosquito\u003C/em\u003E and the two craft were connected by winch cable. At the close of business last night, 400 units of ore had been extracted from Minmus; the goal is 2100 units.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking that at this point I need to add both refinery and fuel modules to the Munport and Minmusport stations - the two outposts would become relatively self-sufficient at that point, or at least could act as fully-functional fuel depots if nothing else. A refinery lander for the \u003Cem\u003EWildcat\u003C/em\u003E rig might also be useful; right now I\u0027m forecasting that \u003Cem\u003EWildcat\u003C/em\u003E will only have about 500 m/s of delta-V when it\u0027s fully loaded and whether or not she\u0027ll be able to affect a rendezvous with Minmusport is in question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb arrived with his tourist group at Minmus as well this weekend; since his group only wanted flybys, they\u0027re already headed back to Kerbin and should arrive in about six more days. I\u0027ve got a new batch of tourists ready to take up to Kerbinport at this point; the station only has one occupant at the moment, so I\u0027ll probably attend to that later today if I get a chance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T13:52:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI exceeded 1,000 hours of KSP playtime.
