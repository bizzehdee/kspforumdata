If you launch from a higher orbit, you need less dV to achieve escape velocity (and the losses from not using Oberth are usually made up by having it be fully fueled on launch IN the higher orbit, not before going up to said orbit), while you lose some velocity due to not utilizing the Oberth effect. All in all, it\u0027s usually not very practical. But this is KSP. You can take practicality and shove it out the window. As far as campaign, waste of time. At least for my designs, I have nearly the entire tree completed by the time I have what I need to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RSwordsman","CreatedById":78678,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T03:19:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a mod called Orbital Construction that basically works as an orbital VAB. You go into the normal VAB and add a certain part to the ship. Assuming you have an orbital shipyard (stocked with sufficient parts), the ship will be built there instead of at KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have it installed, but haven\u0027t messed around with it yet.

I also tried to make a space ship yard and tried to build one like the ones from StarTrek (I feel safe saying that with you guys), but yeah; looks cool, lags-a-lot. Main reason for having it was to have something that would illuminate the ship I was building so I didn\u0027t keep needing to timewarp to get daylight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried using the part welding mod to reduce the part count of the ship yard, but that just got buggy and weird. I\u0027d really like a large single or very low part section that could be a space dock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
