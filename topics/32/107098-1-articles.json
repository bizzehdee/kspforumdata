I toned down the thrust to 50% and it got me there ... for about 13 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt did not bother me then, but now when I did build inefficient craft to get 6 tourists around \u002B land on Mun and Minmus AND rescue kerbal\u002Bcraft from around the Mun it bothered me that my nukes and inner fuel tanks are glowing red and I had to babysit the temperatures, because decouplers were getting hot as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, Is there an option or a mod that will show me current and max temperatures of parts on right click ?

Don\u0027t even bother. The trick is to set up your nukes so they are directly attached to a large fuel tank so the heat doesn\u0027t get bottlenecked. Looked at your ship I can see exactly why yours blew up, decouplers transfer heat poorly, you can\u0027t use them for nukes with long burns. The way your ship was set each nuke could only dump heat into its own small tank. Stick them to the side or end of one big tank and you will have much better results.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mapoko","CreatedById":139980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T14:42:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, researching meta materials and having 2-3-4 nukes connected to 1 big tank is better than having 2-3-4 nukes on 2-3-4 small tanks ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pestilence","CreatedById":85018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T00:24:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlt-F12\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhysics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThermal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Display Thermal Data in Action Menus\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat adds the temps and heat flow stuff to the right-click pop-up on parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...oh and:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116993-Helpful-1-0-observations?p=1870791#post1870791\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116993-Helpful-1-0-observations\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETorham234 did some tests on what parts radiate heat the best.
