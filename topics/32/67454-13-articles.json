I\u0027ve been playing KSP a few weeks but I\u0027m new to the forum here. Unfortunately, I\u0027m having zero luck with getting the ARM patch in place. I\u0027m not entirely sure if this is the right place to post this, so apologies if I\u0027ve erred. I run Linux Mint 16 (32 bit) with Xfce4 as the desktop, on an old refurbished Dell Optiplex 745 which has 4GB of RAM, but the original graphics card (I think; it\u0027s an AMD/ATI RVI 516 Radeon X1300/X1550 series Dell \u0027half-height\u0027 card, anyway). First of all, I tried simply letting the launcher patch my main install (which has a lot of mods, including Interstellar, KW Rocketry, KAS, Kethane and several others) and this caused the graphics settings to be reset, the science tree to be somewhat reste, and when I checked available parts, I could see the grabber. However - nothing else whatsoever of the upgrade was apaprent - no asteroids, no new functionality in the Mission control section. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I then renamed that folder, and did a fresh install of the original zip file for 0.23, then asked the launcher to patch that. Nada. Then I thought to check the patch file and set its permissions to allow it to be executable - still nada. I\u0027m scratching my head over what else I can sensibly do.. Can provide the logfiles if need be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis evenings problems with the patch aside - (hey, it\u0027s alpha, and these things happen) - may I say what an excellent game KSP is! (and well done to all the modders, too!) I haven\u0027t had so much fun with a computer game for years! I\u0027ll refrain from gushing about bits and bobs I\u0027d like to see in KSP in future here..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATED: Just realised I can get the patch as a download from the Store. Doh! Will update with whether that does the trick for me. :-}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal update: The downloaded version has done the trick. Oooh, pretty lights! And bigger \u0027splosions, erm rockets, oooh! I can see the asteroids now, too, yay! :-)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-02T22:50:46Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2014 10:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Esme\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EProblem fixed\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T22:09:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LtHeckard\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LtHeckard\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have assembled an Asteroid Tracking Device (ATD.), and I hooked up to a Class B asteroid so that way I can keep tabs on where these Asteroids are even when I\u0027m not tracking them. Sure it sounds like a lot of work, but I am doing it because I think it would be interesting to see what course the Asteroids take. I still can\u0027t quite figure out how to stop an Asteroid from hitting Kerbin, but I did figure out how to rendezvous with one passing by. So yep, that\u0027s my story, what do you guys plan to do with the Claw?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeting one to miss is prety easy as long as you can figure out how to rendezvous while its still way out (aka in kerbol orbit not in kerbin SOI) If you can intercept it 50-60 days out a small nudge of a m/s or two in almost any direction will turn an impact into a miss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonaly I\u0027m probably going to make a few stations around asteroids with the claw. And van that SS proves you are one sick and twisted banana. Keep up the good work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
