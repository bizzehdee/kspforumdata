He\u0027s totally right (smart guy that Manley). With the exception of getting a good encounter, but hey I need practice/experience with that as well. Anyhow, I was wondering if there is any real benefit to practicing the lander style landings right on Kerbal? The higher gravity/atmosphere would make it harder, or is the space around Kerbal unique enough (compared to the other planets) that it wouldn\u0027t really translate to better skill on other planets?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"superm18","CreatedById":57755,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T08:54:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPractice on no atmosfere moons is good, i would prefere the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn to Minimus becouse of the higher gravety wich, in my oppinion makes it more real compared to other planets/moons.

Don\u0027t get me wrong, he NAILED IT. That said, he also nearly ran out of fuel because he had to pitch up and go long on the landing due to the original landing spot basically being a boulder field. I wouldn\u0027t exactly consider that no problem in regards to the landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso his practice on Earth wasn\u0027t a complication of the higher gravity, it was a complication of the test vehicle being used to practice landings had a malfunction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, practicing on Kerbin can be rather disspiriting. That said, if you can do it on Kerbin (without parachutes) then you can do it on almost any planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy test for landing vehicles for most planets is launch them direct from the pad, take it up to at least 5,000m and then bring it back down for a parachut-less landing. If I can do that and ge a smooth landing, then I know that the lander is capable of setting down on almost any planet (exception Tylo which would need a lot more dV). This is with no launch vehicle, this is just the internal fuel/engines of the lander itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I know I am putting the lander down on a very low gravity moon or some place I can use parachutes I only make sure I can take the lander up to 2,000m before setting it back down again (without parachutes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, this means my landers tend to be over built a little, but generally not by a significant amount. Its a valid test for Moho, the Mun, Minimus, Ike, Duna, Kerbin, Dres, Eve and Laythe. Others, dunno. I\u0027d assume so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it is a lander with an ascent stage, then I generally go for being able to boost to 5,000m, set back down and then launch my ascent stage and get up to at least 5,000m (Duna I go for 10,000m). I haven\u0027t bothered with an ascent stage for Eve or Laythe yet, so I am sure those tests aren\u0027t even remotely valid as both need significantly more dV than just climbing to 5/10km on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T11:33:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBasically, if you can do a powered landing without parachute on Kerbin, you will be able to do powered landings on every body in the Kerbolar system...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...except the dreaded Tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daze","CreatedById":57997,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T11:37:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo try my lander usally i use 2 methods:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1)Try it on Kerbin, if it can land on Kerbin it can land anywhere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2)Use HyperEdit to test it directly on the planet/moon\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T15:53:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse the Mun!
