Give it a high dry weight\n\nIssues: the rocket would work equally well at any speed. In real life, you\u0027d have a mach range, and for a ramrocket, you\u0027d get very little thrust augentation from a standstill... like with a normal ramjet, you need to pick up some speed first before it works. - Or you need a much more complicated engine, that is much like the turbojets on an SR-71 - with compressors used at low speed, and bypassed at high speed.\n\nOption #2: Take a rapier, cut its turbine engine Isp roughly in half, make it burn LF\u002BO in jet mode too. Add an \u0022IntakeAtm\u0022 (or similar) resource \u002B intakes for it, that are flagged not to check for the presence of oxygen (so it works in any atmosphere).\n\nIssue: Rapier Isp is constant, IRL, the ramrocket Isp would drop and drop as less air is sucked in, until its simply the vacuum Isp.\n\nIt would also pretty much never have its thrust drop below the thrust generated in vacuum (although stationary thrust in an atmosphere would be lower) - something that can\u0027t be accomplished (although one could get close) with the standard atmosphere and mach curves.\n\n-Can we still have the jet Isps vary with altitude?\n\nAnyone else have some suggestions for how to model a ramrocket in KSP?"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T13:27:48Z","Content":"I believe [OPT](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97525) includes an air-augmented rocket, not sure on the exact details of the implementation though."}]}
