Still was present and could drive around, but couldn\u0027t go back to the space center. Hm. I also crashed it for funsies going off a ramp, and crashes are now killing my computer - like two frames a second for the duration of the entire crash - when they weren\u0027t before. Hmm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I couldn\u0027t go back to the space center, I exited the game, came back in, and loaded up my old spaceplane design in the spaceplane hangar. Right away I noticed that things seemed more optimized and smoother frame-rate wise. The plane was more fragile than before, though, and shook apart rolling off the runway a few times before I got it into the air. It\u0027s a two-stage spaceplane, with the bottom \u0027delivery\u0027 plane detaching in high kerbin atmo to return to the surface while the \u0027plane\u0027 goes to burn into orbit. Unfortunately, when I separated the craft, the camera started to pan back to try and keep both ships in view, which wasn\u0027t what I wanted. When I tried to switch to the plane individually, I was able to select the delivery plane, but when I toggled back to the actual spaceplane that was supposed to get into orbit, it had become invisible. Hmmm. :\\\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDitching that, I decided to go try out the new VAB, and loaded one of my newer designs. This one didn\u0027t even make it to the launch pad. It loaded into the VAB, and then the game refused to let me pan the camera around the craft at all or interact with it in any way. Had to close and restart the game.

Except when I did it this time, the game started dumping extra engines down below the craft, unattached to anything. It didn\u0027t harm the rocket, but it WAS very weird.
