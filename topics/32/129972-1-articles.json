No, it wouldn\u0027t entirely replace them (especially if they were slower), but the mobility advantage of having legs is very real. Boston Dynamics (I think anyhow) has been developing a dog-like robot that could be used to carry supplies across terrain where wheeled and tracked vehicles of a similar scale would have difficulty. Also, as someone who uses the Kerbal Foundries mod, I can tell you that having the wrong suspension/torque settings for whatever world you are landing on sucks, and for tanks would require a bit of tinkering to accomplish, where with a bipedal machine it would merely be pressing a button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReal facts done, all I can say is that the Battletech wiki says that some of the guns in play are 203mm (the M1 Abrams uses 120mm), and the 100-ton Atlas Assault mech moves at 54km/h (the M1 Abrams has a top speed of 75km/h). Since MWO seems to be pretty accurate to the lore, I think its worth noting the Adder moves at nearly 90km/h and still manages to pack in a pair of ER PPCs, and still bests the power and range of most ballistic weapons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nE: Also, real tanks are just as much a target to a ground attack aircraft as a battlemech is. They are all just fodder to the glorious air-to-ground missile, or the glorious GAU-8 Avenger 30mm autocannon. Chances are a brush up against that for either mech or tank is going to leave them crippled, if not destroyed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-15T20:49:02Z\u0022 title=\u002201/15/2016 08:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by FungusForge\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wolfos31","CreatedById":61724,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-15T21:10:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/148313-fungusforge/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022148313\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/148313-fungusforge/\u0022\u003E@FungusForge\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I agree they\u0027d have their uses.
