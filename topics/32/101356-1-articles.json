I imagine that one will be fixed in 1.0, but I worry about that bug and others like it because it managed to persist from .24.2, to .25, and on to .90. If such a basic bug can persist through 3 versions, it\u0027s hard to be totally confident that others won\u0027t sneak through the testing process for the 1.0 release. Bugs that happen on the margins are easier to ignore.

Steam reviewers are folks that actually play the game and enjoy the type of game and leave positive reviews. Those that don\u0027t like this type of game either never buy it or are just ambivalent about it when they try it and decide it isnt right for them, often not careing enough to leave a review either way.\n\nPro reviewers on the other hand are being payed to review the game. They have to post a review weither they like this type of game or not and are much more likely to blast any faults they find if they dont like the game for any reason. Add that to the learning cliff and limited time for the reviewer to overcome that and you have a recipe for negative \u0022Professional reviews.\u0022 Seeing as how squad is not a huge company and is not likely to be buying positive reviews like some other companies do... well lets just say I wont be surprised by a mirror image of the review bias we often see on high budget titles such as EA games that get 9\u0027s and 10\u0027s from places like IGN but 3-4\u0027s from players.
