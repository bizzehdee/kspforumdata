I guess their winning case might be something tiny enough that a single 100kN engine works well for atmospheric flight.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the trade-off it that\u0027s it\u0027s impossible to get an asymetric flameout on the RAPIERs. You\u0027re gaining stability and ease-of-use in exchange for a performance hit. Which I think is fair. If you\u0027re comfortable using two engine types and swapping, then do that. For people like me, who hate having to monitor that (or have had no luck doing so), we can get SSTOs into orbit as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T19:09:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely the best thing to happen to spaceplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/space_duck.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022space_duck.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A vessel like this is far more complicated to pull off without the RAPIER engines, that\u0027s for sure!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vlk","CreatedById":57928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T19:11:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shiftyeyesshady\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Shiftyeyesshady\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe thing I\u0027ve discovered with it, and what a lot of people seem to have figured out as well, is that the RAPIER makes very small SSTOs possible when they really weren\u0027t before.
