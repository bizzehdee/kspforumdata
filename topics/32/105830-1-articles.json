And you can use in-line intakes too, which is basically shielded by crap in front. That or a stack of ablatives, stacking like 5 in a row ive managed to pull off over 1500 at sea level without tweaking heat amount.\n\nAlso, one thing thats AMAZING at blocking stuff in the mk1 pod, and the shielded port, both having incredible heat tolerances, with a precooler behind those you can pull off some insane speed. Stilll love the new rapiers (despite no more pure jet mode to 400km AP), 1000kn thrust at sea level FTW!"}]}
