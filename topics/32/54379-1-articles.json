In sandbox mode, the only practical reason to accept the rather large mass and bulk penalties that come with sending Kerbals is if you absolutely need the very limited amount of menial labor they can provide (fixing flats, pumping gas, etc.). For just flying rockets, probes are all you need and weigh a lot less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also the issue or bringing Kerbals home. I usually don\u0027t because my menial laborers are untrained, expendable galley slaves, but periodically I have to send out high-dollar brain for scientific purposes, which means I have to bring him home. Doing so requires a bigger ship than a 1-way trip, on top of the size penalty for having a Kerbal aboard in the 1st place, plus puts a time limit on the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what I usually do is make a flotilla of ships. Almost all of them are probes: stations, landers, Kethane rigs, the works. And somewhere in there will usually be a small, cramped can simply to carry a few Kerbals out to where they can keep the probes operating.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"samstarman5","CreatedById":12469,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T20:32:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022larsmaehlum\u0022 data-cite=\u0022larsmaehlum\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI play with RemoteTech so probes/rovers are a bit tricky.
