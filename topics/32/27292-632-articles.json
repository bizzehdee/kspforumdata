I also have a pair of empty landers in LKO, one for Mun and one for Minmus, so I\u0027m deciding whether or not to dock them to the station before sending them on their way. If they\u0027re going out without docking, Natatrice will return first, otherwise she\u0027ll wait to refill their monopropellant tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/tpwAKO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tpwAKO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/dfx83P.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dfx83P.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe test payload consists of an X200-32, with 90% liquid fuel and 100% oxidiser, an Okto, some batteries, and an AIS. This adds up to 17.5t. I guess that from the low remaining fuel and how my later, less-aerodynamic launch went, it\u0027s probably better dealing with smaller loads than the test payload. But if I ever need to put up most of an X200-32, I\u0027ve got a lifter for it now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/bcQUFX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bcQUFX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/xPFJNF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xPFJNF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch is straightforward. Starting with a little tilt eastwards, the seven Reliants and six Hammers fire. The Hammers run out and drop, and a few thousand metres later, so do the drop tanks. The central Reliant feeds from the radial tanks, too, and when those fall, the four outer Swivels fire. This burns off two of the control fins, but that\u0027s fine, as we have the gimballing of the Swivels. The core feeds the asparagused Swivels, and when it drops the central Swivel fires, then the radial Swivels drop in pairs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/CdFGwk.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CdFGwk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, the above FerrySix ship can\u0027t say the same of success. Despite massing the same, its vastly less aerodynamic shape and other drag-increasing qualities meant that it needed to burn with its Terriers to get orbit. Oh well. It needs to pick up its tourists from Stopover anyway, so I guess I\u0027ll just refuel it there. Even if it was inefficient, it\u0027d be less efficient now to send up the lighter, lower capacity, more streamlined FerryFour now that FerrySix is in orbit. Once I have considerably more money, perhaps I\u0027ll look into updating things up there.
