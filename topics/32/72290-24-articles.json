The FLT 200 costs 425, holds 90 fuel and 110 oxidizer. From the video we know that each unit of fuel is valued at .8, and each unit of oxidizer is valued at 0.18. This means that each fuel tank costs (425-{(90*0.8)\u002B(110*0.18)})= 149.6 empty, with 275.4 funds ate up in fuel. Since the tank is returned for 266.56, and the fuel in the tank is worth 275.4 on its own, that means a full tank will return about 541.6 funds. I thought maybe that the price of fuel wasn\u0027t included in the price of the tank; but upon adding all the costs of the individual parts together I did get the 3147 funds the rocket said it cost in the VAB, so fueling isn\u0027t an extra expense. Most likely this will get fixed when this gets pointed out, and the devs will make the return 80% of the EMPTY value of the tank. Indeed, the cost in the VAB should be the empty cost as well, and the fueling cost should be separate; after all tweakables mean that that tank won\u0027t always be full so why should I pay for a full load of fuel?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis all means that the 3 FLT200 tanks that were on that ship were carrying 826.2 value in fuel - about what the engine cost, yes. But the total rocket cost 3147, of which 826.2 is just about 26.2% or so. Yeah, that\u0027s a lot higher than SpaceX, but considering the fact that both tanks and engines in KSP are overweight in comparison to their real-world counterparts and not as effective, that\u0027s pretty much to be expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe really interesting thing about this is that the 80% return on recovered vessel parts will finally, finally, give practical gameplay value to those returnable-spaceplane-with-screwy-engineered-refueling-truck guys.
