Down is always down. Left is left and right is right no matter how much you rotate your ship.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T22:44:12Z","Content":"\nIt helps with docking and is the best camera mode for landing aircraft.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain H@dock","CreatedById":139017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T23:10:16Z","Content":"\nSame as above. Perfect for when you want to point at a direction relative to your craft: docking, flying a plane...\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnlike chase which often drift for no real reasons.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn top of it, RCS burns always make sense in locked mode, because the vertical and horizontal axis are matching the navball one. If you go to locked and put yourself behind your craft, I/K will do vertical burns that will move your craft toward the top (K) or the bottom (I) of your screen. Likewise for J/L (though looking at your craft from the front in locked mode will look like J/L are reversed).\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T23:24:31Z","Content":"\nPerfect for docking if you don\u0026#39;t use any of those docking cam mods.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T00:20:58Z","Content":"\nSame again here, locked is the choice for spaceplanes; especially landing.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mat2ch","CreatedById":139755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T19:26:46Z","Content":"\nFlying, all the time.

Locked mode is great, providing you\u0026#39;ve got a Kerbal pilot/driver... with a probe core piloting, it tends to flip the view upside-down. Locked mode with the rover can suck badly however if you flip the rover, the resulting tumbling view is very disorienting and makes it hard to get a grasp on \u0026#39;countermeasures\u0026#39; (if you\u0026#39;ve got them installed lol).\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T22:13:15Z","Content":"\nIt is very helpful for docking because it will \u0026#39;lock\u0026#39; your orientation, so up is always up etc.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hysterrics","CreatedById":151688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T02:09:45Z","Content":"\nThanks for shedding some light on the subject guys!\n"}]}
