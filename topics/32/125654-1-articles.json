I personally quite like the new update, the water physics are very cool, as seaplanes and submarines are now more possible than they were previously.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"quasarrgames","CreatedById":91692,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T20:49:28Z","Content":"\nGAH!

The Mk.I inline cockpit still has a bubble canopy and an at-least decent (depending on your tastes) fighter jet cockpit look, so use it if you like the look of a fighter jet cockpit on your crafts. In addition, if you enjoy fighter jets, the new Panther jet engine has many similar properties to that of a fighter jet engine, and it also functions as a middle ground between a low-speed subsonic turbofan engine and a high-speed turbo ramjet engine (when using the afterburner).\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kyrt Malthorn","CreatedById":149101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T22:37:17Z","Content":"\nI\u0026#39;m playing with 1.0.5 career mode now and here are my takes.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=#333333]-reentry heat is worse\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nReentry IS a lot trickier, I\u0026#39;ll admit, it has caused me to loose one kerbal in my hard mode game. It\u0026#39;s not that its hotter, its that the upper atmosphere is thicker - you get that heat higher up - but far more misguiding is that the atmosphere is actually thinner nearer ground level. It doesn\u0026#39;t slow heavy craft down enough to deploy parachutes on its own, so you end up needing an alternative; make lighter reentry craft, engine brake, or use drogue chutes or airbrakes. I like it, because it\u0026#39;s more realisitic and makes me work a little harder to design things, and to certify them kerbal-safe. :)\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/COLOR]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=#333333]-jet engines were pitifully nerfed AGAIN! [/COLOR]:mad:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nJets really don\u0026#39;t need to be super powerful to make a plane fly. Now the engines and intakes are optimized for different speeds - subsonic and supersonic. But they need far less intake air to work. So you can make really good supersonic jets without spamming shock cones. Space planes, if you\u0026#39;re into them, will be trickier, but mostly because of the thicker midrange atmosphere. Drag is more of a concern than ever, but it\u0026#39;s actually possible to build spaceplanes sooner because the panther is actually quite good, before you even unlock the ramjet. The ramjet and the aerospike now unlock together, and the aerospike is even better than it used to be.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=#333333]-no more fighter jet cockpit (or is there?)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey did replace that one cockpit with one that looks less like a fighter cockpit, true.

If you use a ton of mods, maybe, but I think that complaint is from the 10% of people who squeeze every iota of performance out of the game. It\u0026#39;s now got better heat physics and time-warp physics are more accurate. For casual gaming purposes I haven\u0026#39;t noticed anything slower at all.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/COLOR]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=#333333]-dont care for any of the \u0022new and slower!\u0022 jet engines\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMoar boosters. :) I like the progression of jet engines better, though.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nGive it a try. If you have the disk space, you can even copy your current game directory before you update, so you can have your old game still if you don\u0026#39;t like 1.0.5. Just r-click on the folder \u0022Kerbal Space Program\u0022, copy, and paste it somewhere else on your computer, rename it to KSP 1.0.4.

And surely there is or will very soon be a mod to restore it a la Kerbal Historical Society.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Game seems about the same for me. The difference is imperceptible. That said, computers vary and thus so does performance.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Admittedly the Panther doesn\u0026#39;t live up to the hype IMO, but the Juno has its uses, and the uh... what was the big one again?
