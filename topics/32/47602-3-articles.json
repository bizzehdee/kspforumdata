And from a practical perspective, this is completely pointless. In theory, a real skyhook could regain orbital energy by running current through the tether and work against the Earth\u0027s magnetic field. Since you can\u0027t do this in KSP (does Kerbal even have a magnetic field?) the station will loose a little energy every time it launches something. And you are getting very little extra boost. Being able to go from a 80 km orbit to a 82 km orbit isn\u0027t really that big of a help. Making the thing longer would be better, but the longest you can launch in one shot is about 200 m (I think, I forget the exact height), so a 2 km tether already involves 10 launches. And at some point I suspect KSP will have problems with structures that are too long. I decided I will return to the project after my docking skills are better.
