While building rockets themselves works absolutely fine now, they\u0027re not exactly aesthetically pleasing most of the time if you want to get any kind of payload into space. I\u0027d also love to see n-body gravity calculations (which will most likely never happen, but hey, we thought the same thing about official multiplayer, right?), proper aerodynamics and re-entry heat that is actual heat rather than pretty flashing lights.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T16:32:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENobody knows.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArmchairGravy","CreatedById":78526,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T21:12:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KvickFlygarn87\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KvickFlygarn87\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFeature wise, 60-70%, code wise, around 20%.
