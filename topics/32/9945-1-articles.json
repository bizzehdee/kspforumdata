If you wanna focus on flying, go for it. If you wanna focus on managing your flight and designing and more precise craft, you can do that to. Plug-ins just let you change the game to be what you want it to be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, getting to orbit was really thrilling at the start. With stock parts and not knowing what you\\\u0027re doing, it was a real challenge and you had a lot of excitement just getting up there. But now, when I\\\u0027m regularly running Munar orbit and landing mission, getting to orbit is just the tedious part before I get to the interesting stuff. So why not let Mechjeb get me to orbit if I don\\\u0027t wanna fly it? I know I can if I wanted to, I don\\\u0027t need to prove it to myself. Mechjeb also adds precision. Instead of getting stuff to orbit within 10% of what I wanted, I can get it to within 1% now, just from the data that it gives me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could go on, but at the end of the day this game will be different for everyone. To me more realistic is actually more computer controlled systems, because that\\\u0027s more realistic to real life. The shuttle could basically fly itself, every unmanned mission is controlled by a computer that humans monitor and make inputs to. So most of my flights are computer controlled. The beauty is in the design and execution. To me at least. Yea some parts of over-powered, but you can always just steer away from them.

I like to compare the performance of my rockets, and sometimes two of them are too similar in performance.

It\\\u0027s also the best choice if your goal is to use a rocket most efficiently so you can put a massive space station up or to dive the sun using the smallest ship possible. It\\\u0027s very good if the goal is to find out what is possible before bashing your skull against the computer trying to do something that just can\\\u0027t be done. It\\\u0027s also taught me better ascent trajectories (though even MechJeb\\\u0027s trajectories need A LOT of work) and as a result allowed me to design smaller, better rockets that are easier to fly--manually or automatically--than the behemoths I used to use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlying something manual is always the most fun, and I remember landing on the Mun using nothing but a single engine and ASAS for control and trying to land Buck Rodgers style without stranding Bill, Bob and Jeb.
