If you accept two here\u0027s what I can do:\n\n- Accept 2 satellite contracts\n\n- launch 1 satellite\n\n- position it for the required orbit (contract 1 completed)\n\n- change orbit and position it for the required orbit for contract 2 (contract 2 completed)\n\nSo It\u0027s like the company of the contract says, hey! as long as you bring it up there for 10 seconds you get tons of money..\n\nI think this isn\u0027t real.\n\nThe better way for instance is if you position a satellite for a contract, it fixes it path or just dissapears\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T11:49:41Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 11:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ferdoni**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rfmeijboom","CreatedById":91078,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T11:42:16Z","Content":"I will work the way you describe it.\n\nYou can use 1 satellite to fullfill multiple contracts, but to me it feels like cheating.\n\nIn my career games I just leave them in the requested orbit and mark it as debris, so it won\u0027t clutter my map view."},{"CreatedByName":"Secuas","CreatedById":126000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T11:45:15Z","Content":"I think it doesn\u0027t make any sense an example of improvement could be: The first satalite you launch would have to to stay up the required orbit, and if you change your reputation decreases a lot so that you have to launch 2 satellites anyway."},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T11:56:57Z","Content":"Contract specific parts popping up in the VAB for each satellite contract would help."},{"CreatedByName":"DarkGravity","CreatedById":143383,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T12:13:49Z","Content":"Some good ideas popping up here! I like what I\u0027m hearing. The contracts could definitely use a little polishing. So many of them ask you to build something for the company offering the contract, put it where they want it, then use it however you wish. Satellites, Stations, Bases. Pretty unreal. Right up there with the SPH and VAB being different biomes. Also completely unrealistic. But for contracts, having the item become locked (maybe for a month, maybe permanently) or disappear after completing the contract is a good idea.

It\u0027s not like RL space agencies launch rockets for single satellites (most of the time) either. \n\nGood thing about KSP is that if you feel something makes game too easy you can just avoid doing it. For example you can complete pretty much unlimited number of \u0022science from...\u0022 contracts as long as you just have something already at the required location. I just never do that since it feels kinda wrong.\n\nEdit.\n\nAnd I missed the point of OP by a mile... I guess RL space agencies won\u0027t use the SAME satellite for multiple customers. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThe second point still counts tho!"},{"CreatedByName":"LittleBlueGaming","CreatedById":144665,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T13:18:42Z","Content":"I don\u0027t really like those missions anyway.

I\u0027m not building a space station around Minmus for Derp-o-Engines Ltd., I\u0027m building it for my space program. The contracts are just a stimulus to incentivize the Department of Booms and Snacks to keep developing new technologies and increasing kerbalkind\u0027s presence among the stars star.\n\nIn the end, I agree with Varsi. Even in career mode, KSP is a sandbox game. Squad can\u0027t possibly make the perfect career mode for everybody, it\u0027s ultimately up to the player in a sandbox game to play the way they enjoy best. If you like those contracts, go ahead and do them.(Really it\u0027s not too unrealistic to think of kerbal companies paying you to put up a satellite for them, and then only using it for 10 seconds).

In fact it\u0027s almost worthless if KSP playtime is limited. It does depend what you need money for. As mentioned, i need to raise \u003E3.5 million and 70k is a mere trifle in that case.\n\nStacking multiple contracts on **one** craft was the main issue, and wheter or not that\u0027s cheating. I think it does feel a bit cheaty but on the rare occasion you use it, it\u0027s probably nice that the option exists. You are simply not likely to need to abuse the bug often enough, the oportunity is not likely to show up often enough nor is it profitable enough to try to earn a bunch of money that way. If you\u0027re going to cherry pick contracts to get 2-3 sats in neat, similar orbits, you could earn roughly 220k but the job would possibly take longer then had you launched 3 separate rockets to earn roughly 200k.\n\n[edit]\n\nIf you take the average worth of a sat contract to be 80k\n\nAverage cost of a sat that can be placed anywhere in the Kerbin system, including the pesky retrograde inclined or polar orbits is 10K\n\nThis gives you profit of 70k\n\nIf you stack two contracts the profit is 80\u002B80-10=150k but that\u0027s only if the orbits are somewhat similar, otherwise you may run out of fuel. Also, if one of the sats needs to reach Minmus while the other is aimed at a retrograde LKO, you may be on margin with fuel and cetrainly wont be able to use the same orbital injection vehicle for both.\n\nAll that rabbiting is just to show that if you used 2 rockets the final outcome would be 80\u002B80-10-10=140k. So did you just do a needlesly complex mission for 10k?\n\nEven with 3 sats, the difference only comes to 20k (230k with \u0022cheating\u0022 vs 210k earned by playing it straight.)\n\nThe difference is miserable which is interesting because it *feels* like a cheat despite not paying that well. I fully expected to lose control of the craft once the contract was completed. Sats and bases for other agencies are completely ridiculous if they are still mine to control, remove or whatever. I shouldn\u0027t be expected to pay maintenance, and would like an option to delete clutter, but the way it\u0027s been implemented is absurd.\n\nThe upshot is, that you can fully control what happens next, rather than the game forcing you. If you want to maintain foreign agency junk, you can do that. If you want to remove it manually, that\u0027s an option. Just delete it? Why not. Move the sat to another position and claim another contract? Up to you entirely. You do have the option...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T15:00:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 03:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by georgTF**\n  \nlolmaths"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T15:06:13Z","Content":"Of all the things to complain about \u0022satellite contracts are too easy\u0022, of course they\u0027re easy, they\u0027re not supposed to be hard in the first place.\n\nEDIT: If you don\u0027t want to control a satellite, station, or base after deploying it, just hit \u0022Terminate Flight\u0022 in the space center.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T15:09:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 03:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Guest**"},{"CreatedByName":"georgTF","CreatedById":57397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T15:08:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Of all the things to complain about \u0022satellite contracts are too easy\u0022, of course they\u0027re easy, they\u0027re not supposed to be hard in the first place.\n\nTo be fair the complaint was that it\u0027s too easy to stack multiple contracts, launch a single sat, and complete all contracts with it.\nThen again, it\u0027s just as easy to access the cheat menu and enable infinite fuel.\n\nAnd again it\u0027s just as easy not to do any of the above.
