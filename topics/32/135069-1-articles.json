The game is rich enough by itself \u00A0to encourage people to buy the full version anyway, and I think you\u2019ll get more players on board by making the demo playable instead of insanely hard (for those that never played the game before, which, I assume, is the target audience).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-27T22:39:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe landing legs are available in the sandbox part of the demo.
