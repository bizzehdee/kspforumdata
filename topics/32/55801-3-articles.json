At the moment, KSP space programmes are very much about \u0027footprints and flags\u0027. Unless you really enjoy driving around on a planet for hours on end (which I have done to be fair!), there\u0027s not much to do once you land anywhere. Resources don\u0027t really add much to that. They can certainly make it easier by letting you set up fuel depots without shipping the fuel all the way from Kerbin. It would also be fun to have a few more things to drop onto a planet. However, none of this is \u003Cem\u003Enecessary\u003C/em\u003E. It\u0027s perfectly possible to get anywhere in KSP using stock parts and a vanilla game. In other words, at the moment, resources are a nice-to-have feature - not having resources isn\u0027t hindering the core \u0027footprints and flags\u0027 part of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I have resources, I want to be able to \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E stuff with them other than refuelling ships. I want to build bases (build in place rather than dropping modules in from orbit) and keep them supplied with materials harvested in-situ. I want to mine and process metals on the Mun, manufacture basic structural parts and send them back into LKO. On-orbit construction to turn those parts into an orbital habitat, shipyard or whatever. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut all of this goes way beyond the current scope of the game. It would be fantastic to see it all in the release version but I don\u0027t think its very likely given the amount of time and effort it would take. Maybe a limited resource system (maybe a slightly more involved version of Kethane) at release and then an expansion pack with a much bigger and better resource system - and all the other stuff I was talking about too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResources provide the reason to drive around. A simple 1 resource system used for refueling such as Kethane doesn\u0027t really add much but it does some. The large robust and complex system with 10 plus resources to find and mine and use to make things other than fuel that Squad was working on would have add a heck of a lot of reason to spend time on the various planets and moons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquads stated goal before adding more planets and or other solar systems is to give us more to do on the planets we have. You said yourself that there is nothing to do. Having something to do is necessary to the continued playability of the game. Once exploring every nook and cranny of a planet is fun and serves a purpose in the base stock game... then I\u0027d call the base stock game done and look to expansions. Resources (and the buildings and things you can make with them) would be the final thing needed to finish off the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spike88","CreatedById":30351,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T20:14:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure someone already posted this, but:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI distinctively remember that they said this feature was too advanced for what they were aiming the main game to be about, and that it instead would come later as a paid DLC.
