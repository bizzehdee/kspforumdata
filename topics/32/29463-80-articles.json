Add lots of fins at the bottom. Add radially attached SRBs, drop tanks, or asparagus-staged liquid boosters if necessary; make sure they don\u0027t interfere with the fins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUseful tip: Engines always draw from the most distant tank first. For vertical rockets, this means they empty the tanks in their stack from the top down, which causes the CoM to move downwards making the rocket less stable in the atmosphere. Solution: in the VAB, lock fuel flow from all the tanks except the bottom one. During launch, keep an eye on the fuel levels in the bottom tank, and, just before it runs out, unlock the next tank up. Alternately, just install TAC fuel balancer and tell it to balance fuel between all the tanks in the stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption 2: Traditional Vertically-Stacked Multi-Stage Booster (i.e. Saturn V-Style)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution for stability is the same: fins at the bottom of the rocket. However, the vertical staging adds a complication: each time you ditch a stage, you have a new \u0027bottom of the rocket\u0027, which needs fins of it\u0027s own. But, since stock KSP doesn\u0027t have any deployable fins, fins at the bottom of your 3rd stage will be well above the CoM when you\u0027re burning the 1st stage, which makes them counter-productive. Thus you need to use successively larger sets of fins at each step, e.g. 2 small fins on your 3rd stage, 4 medium fins on the 2nd stage, and 6 large fins on the 1st stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless you\u0027re trying for a purely ballistic launch, any stage that fires off above 40km or so can probably dispense with fins entirely, and just use reaction wheels or RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption 3: Balanced Twin Boosters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of building one booster underneath the payload, use two boosters radially attached to the sides. Make sure the boosters extend up above the payload as much as they do below it, thus keeping the payload near the CoM. You\u0027ll still want a couple fins for control, but you don\u0027t have to compensate for payload drag just to maintain stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis solution also lets you asparagus stage the payload\u0027s engines off the boosters and use them during the launch, thus boosting TWR.
