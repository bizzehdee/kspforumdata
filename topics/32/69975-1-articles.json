Launch doing a large out of Kerbin SOI mission moving the science back in to the command pod and cleaning out the experiments as you finish so you can re-use them. When returning to Kerbin move the two from the lab in to the pod and land. Profit from all the retrieved science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt never clicked in my head to combine the re-useability of experiments of the mobile processing lab and the removal of experiments in to the command pod.
