With normal \u0022serious\u0022 play assumptions, focus on science instruments, with the occasional side path for critical equipment. Useful things like landing legs, radial parachutes, the LV-909, batteries, and solar panels are all along or next to the science branch(es). Off of those, the major things would be radial decouplers, a largish engine with TVC (typically the LV-T45), struts, and fuel lines.
