I was working a mission to Jool. An atmospheric probe to do probe things at Jool. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere it is nearing a deceleration burn to take it in even closer to Jool before making a deorbit burn into the atmosphere... at least that was the plan when this was taken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lJK6nnX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lJK6nnX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESO, prior to this picture, I knew something was wrong, my quick save button had died on me. I did have a node set up for an aerobreak at Laythe I think it was Laythe, anyway, the aerobreak would have slowed me down into a tight orbit at Jool, hey free DV is free DV right? So, I went to quick save when I had that awesome node, and nothing. I decided that something was amiss, so, I tweaked my node to avoid the aerobreak, and ended up in the orbit that picture was taken in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decide, okay, this is risky as all heck, but, lets roll. Little did I know that this silent kraken was slowly eating functions in my game. The final blow came during deceleration into a tight Jool orbit. I noticed my rocket suddenly throttle down \u0026lt;yes I use mechjeb\u0026gt; and went to check my fuel status, and all values went to 0. I tried to go to map mode, and the ship vanished from screen, leaving me an edge on map view of the Jool system. i tried to go back into \u0022normal\u0027 view and BAM game lock up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI alt F4d out of the game, reloaded and to my abject horror the game had NOT ONCE AUTOSAVED after reaching ORBIT OF KERBIN!! I was in orbit of KERBIN. a FULL YEAR AND CHANGE of game time LOST to this new silent kraken. I reloaded the game, like I said, and all functions had returned, auto-save, quick save, all working again, but, I was in parking orbit at Kerbin \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moss","CreatedById":106413,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-17T08:24:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo...

I\u0027ve had this specific one before, I\u0027ve had one where Kerbin gravity turned off, which forced me to find a backup save that had the gravity functioning properly (it also broke the revert function and made parts of my ship randomly disappear while moving up from the launch pad). Had another where the lights in my ship flickered on and off (with full power) then they suddenly disappeared and the game crashed. There was another where my ship wouldn\u0027t launch *at all*. Couldn\u0027t even move stages around. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dunno man, it\u0027s just a very buggy game at times.
