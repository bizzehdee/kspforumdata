Here\u0027s what I found:\n\nIn the VAB, there are 26 parts, ranging from SRBs to science parts.\n\n![Rrcnjo9.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Rrcnjo9.jpg)\n\nThe career tech tree is smaller to fit the 26 parts.\n\n![NNqUeai.png](http://i.imgur.com/NNqUeai.png)\n\nThere is only Kerbin, the Mun, and Minmis, interestingly the ore database is there, and a quick look at the game files shows that ore mechanics are completely functional, but no parts to mine it.\n\n![TuV57mj.png](http://i.imgur.com/TuV57mj.png)\n\nThe science archives still expects you to reach all planets (which don\u0027t exist)?\n\n![xvfaGZc.png](http://i.imgur.com/xvfaGZc.png)\n\nAll 3 tiers of all buildings in, but the SPH and runway are not available. The admin building has strategies, the Astro complex can hire kerbals, the mission control works, and even the flag pole works. All with complete interiors and exteriors.\n\n![QDyqelQ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/QDyqelQ.jpg)\n\nThe 1.0.0 aero is used since it was not updated to 1.0.2.\n\n![XpFeN0z.png](http://i.imgur.com/XpFeN0z.png)\n\nScience mechanics are also in, along with rep and money.\n\n![FGiUCqW.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/FGiUCqW.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T19:21:45Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 07:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RocketPilot573**"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T19:07:47Z","Content":"Could be that aerodynamics could be updated once they become properly adjusted for the sim.

Return from space is critical as well. Not much room to slow down enough to deploy chutes from a sub orbital. But, that issue is from the 1.0 atmosphere.\n\nOverall, with all of the changes since the old demo, the new one was badly needed. The flea reached 6,700 meters with two Goo pods. The RT-10 25,000 meters."},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T21:04:51Z","Content":"I think it would be to Squad\u0027s advantage to update the demo to the v1.0.2 fixes, but keep in mind ... it\u0027s just a demo."},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T21:07:04Z","Content":"I took a look at the new demo a few days ago.

Even a few big-name studios are releasing DRM-free content on GoG and the like. Really, the main reason why most studios don\u0027t do demos any longer is because demos actually are very hard to justify. A good demo for a good game helps, but any other scenario (good demo/bad game, bad demo/good game, bad demo/bad game) does not to varying degrees."},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T15:46:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Speaking of KSP being a different game...
