They are used in aircraft as well (which they are commonly used to tell what angle the aircraft is at, as well as a few other things).

See that red area on their ball? That\\\u0027s the gimbal lock range where two axis of the gimbal are aligned and will cause the loss of attitude reference for one degree of freedom. The Apollo crews are trained to always avoid pointing their ship in this area. If gimbal lock does happen the crew will have to move the ship out of gimbal lock range (blindly, without a working FDAI) and reset the FDAI using stars as reference. Has this happened on Apollo 13 they would have been stuffed since all the debris floating around prevented them from seeing the stars properly.\n\nThis problem could have been resolved with a 4th power driven redundant gimbal but MIT guys told NASA it wasn\\\u0027t worth the weight and complexity in their opinion.

If I understand correctly the ship is set so that gimbal lock range is set at the north and south poles of the ecliptic plane. That is the directly \u0027above\u0027 and \u0027below\u0027 the sun as viewed from the plane of earth\\\u0027s orbit around the sun. The idea is in a normal mission you should never need to point the Apollo spaceship directly \u0027up\u0027 and \u0027down\u0027 in respect to the ecliptic.\n\nOf course with Apollo 13 venting oxygen and RCS thrusters firing wildly trying to compensate for the venting the ship was tumbling all over the place. There\\\u0027s a scene where CAPCOM was telling Jim Lovell to \u0027watch that middle gimbal\u0027 and Jim who was frustrated trying to bring the ship under control was all \u0027Yes we\\\u0027re well aware of the GODDAMN gimbal, I\\\u0027ve got the damn thing right in front of me!\u0027\n\nFun fact: Jim Lovell, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, Michael Collins and a few other Apollo astronauts came from the Gemini program, and just like our own Command Pod Mk1 the Gemini spacecraft DID have a 4th gimbal so it didn\\\u0027t have this gimbal lock problem."},{"CreatedByName":"HarvesteR","CreatedById":4,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T14:48:10Z","Content":"In KSP, the NavBall is driven by [Quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion), so yeah, it\\\u0027s got 4 gimbals. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nCheers"},{"CreatedByName":"RC1062","CreatedById":10709,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T17:40:54Z","Content":"Do I sense the possibility of something that could be upgraded with research in campaign? ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"life_on_venus","CreatedById":28185,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-18T18:21:26Z","Content":"Commonly used on boats..."},{"CreatedByName":"AlternNocturn","CreatedById":17872,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-19T11:56:02Z","Content":"I have to admit, this thread caused me to do a bit more research on gimbals since I really love learning about gyroscope-based mechanisms.

In our KSP nav balls the Apollo gimbal lock ranges would be centered around 0 and 180 degrees at the horizon. You can see that by looking closely at the Apollo ball, the red circle is half on the white and half on the blue hemispheres. They did of course have a star sextant in place in the capsule for nav purposes but gimbal lock would never have been necessary.\n\nQuaternions are very un-intuitive but they would be represented on a nav-ball just like a 3-gimbal system"},{"CreatedByName":"DisarmingBaton5","CreatedById":68576,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T05:41:31Z","Content":"I wonder if it would have been more mass-efficient to carry a fourth gimbal instead of a sextant.
