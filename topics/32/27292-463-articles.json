The engineers behind the design decided to run with uninsulated tanks to squeeze more fuel into the rocket, so it was important that there was no delay between launch and the transfer burn.

Extraneous engines have been removed, as have unneeded solar panels.

A little tweaking before the encounter reduced relative inclination of the resultant orbit to Bastion, and a burn at Mun periapse lowered Kerbin periapse into the atmosphere. A final adjustment at the descending node matched inclinations and further lowered the periapse before the aerobrake.

The distance makes engine-only docking a little easier, so that was completed without trouble. The blue-tinted base light of Bastion clarified when the station was pointing at the Gosling, which also came in handy. Then, I filled up all Gosling tanks and launched the second version of the Sweeper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/k2yJ07.png\u0022 alt=\u0022k2yJ07.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/5USoLn.png\u0022 alt=\u00225USoLn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBilly-Bobley and Lomund were in the cockpit this time. I don\u0027t know which of those two did it (probably not Lomund, he seems sensible), but someone pulled back on the pitch control far too hard at takeoff. (Actually, I held the key too long, and once I\u0027d flipped to retrograde I decided to keep holding and hope for exactly what happened.) The plane did a vertical loop the instant it came off the runway, barely missing touching the runway a second time with its rear wheels (and the turbojet). Looked cool, though. Anyway ascent and docking were straightforward, and more efficient than the previous - perhaps in part because I disabled the 24-77s once I realised they were entirely superfluous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/Z21MqF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Z21MqF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/vzBphx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vzBphx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I transferred 600 units of LFO and topped off the station\u0027s monopropellant tank, Bob performed an EVA transfer with all the experiments. I don\u0027t think you can transfer those internally yet. Billy-Bobley and Lomund got onto the station, and Bill decided he wanted to come back to the surface, too. Lomund won the Rocket-Paper-Scissors tournament to get the right to sit in the Cupola rather than the crew cabins - apparently Rocket always wins.

The jet engine was only fired up once in the descent to fine-tune it, but I believe I might have been able to get away with just gliding back. The landing itself was also straightforward, bringing home over 400 science points and completing a couple of data-collection missions. I mean, I could have just performed transmissions for those, but a return is fine, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfterwards, I performed a couple of revisions to the design, removing the 24-77s and the OX-L panels and slightly reshuffling the OX-STAT ones. This brought the cost of the plane under 45k, not that that cost is the number that matters. The fuel cost is below 750 funds, IIRC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEdit: A quick couple of notes on the Sweeper - the front tank has half the oxidiser that it could, and the rear one has 90%. Both have all the LF they can carry, and the front one is disabled until after rocket engines are activated for CoM reasons. This is where the jet fuel comes from. The rear pair of tanks (with the fuel lines leading in) actually remain full for the entire flight, right up until they are emptied into the station. Also, the name comes from the slightly swept wings.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-10T13:13:50Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2014 01:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Concentric\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GloriousWater","CreatedById":128421,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-09T16:04:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESpent the last few hours redirecting a class D asteroid, which \u0027simulations\u0027 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E showed was on a collision course with KSC.
