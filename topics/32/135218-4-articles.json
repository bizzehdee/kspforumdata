What I want to do is game the system, so to speak. I want to try to find the best and most efficient ways to progress in the game and sandbox really doesn\u0027t have that in the same way since it has far less restrictions and fewer game mechanics in place. To me sandbox feels a bit like solving a Rubik\u0027s cube with a hammer and superglue - it\u0027s more about getting a nice looking cube than actually solving the puzzle. There\u0027s always the option to just brute-force your way through anything by making monster rockets and as many launches as you want to get where you want. And I don\u0027t mean this as condescending towards sandbox, I enjoy it from time to time a lot, but it\u0027s just a fact that there are fewer puzzles there to solve. Sandbox gives me the hammer and glue as legitimate options that I can use if I choose to and I\u0027m not breaking any rules.

If the solution to not breaking your gameplay is \u0022don\u0027t use it\u0022, it\u0027s a badly designed mechanic. I find it difficult to feel satisfaction in playing the game if I have to constantly and consciously stop myself from touching certain parts of the game. In terms of progressive gameplay, sandbox is a bad design for that (obviously since it\u0027s designed to be the exact opposite).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough it wouldn\u0027t have to be, had it been designed differently. Take RemoteTech for example. It\u0027s a good way to progress in sandbox environment. You really have to launch those relay satellites if you want the comms coverage. Or if you want to get rid of comms delay, use a manned control station. It doesn\u0027t help you at all no matter how many free monster rockets you can launch, you still have to do that.

Now mining is generally repetitive and somewhat dull, crafting on the other hand is where we get to be creative and stretch our imaginations. Some players for this very reason choose to play in \u0022creative\u0022 mode where resources are unlimited, there is no danger, and you can craft as you please. For me personally this is ignoring half the game, and anything constructed in \u0022creative\u0022 or \u0022sandbox\u0022 mode feels somehow hollow and devoid of any hard work or accomplishment. I\u0027m not impressed at all if you built a tower that\u0027s 10,000 blocks tall on creative because you didn\u0027t actually have to mine up any of those materials. Likewise, turning KSP on and having access to all of the best parts/level 3 buildings immediately feels cheap to me. It\u0027s not that it actually is cheap or cheating...just that it robs you of the experiences you might have had by being more limited, if you\u0027ve ever designed something that clearly needed a ladder without a ladder because you didn\u0027t have ladders yet, you know what I\u0027m talking about.\u00A0I guess this just boils down to personal character, some people just want to have free form fun, others want a goal to strive for. To use another example World of Warcraft, I have plenty of friends who \u0022bought\u0022 level 60,70,80,a million or whatever max level is nowadays, but personally I couldn\u0027t enjoy a character I didn\u0027t grind all the way up from level 1.\u00A0Maybe it\u0027s an old-school mentality, I got my first NES at 4 years old...to me a game needs to be able to be \u0022beaten\u0022 via clearly defined win parameters or it\u0027s not a game, maybe were just gluttons for punishment? Ultimately,\u00A0I don\u0027t\u00A0think either way is wrong, just different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that said... is\u00A0the career mode in KSP terribly good as far as career modes go?

On one hand it\u0027s 100% fair, since KSP career is KSP career. Unfortunately, KSP career is simply awful on multiple levels, and if a person\u0027s judgement on any notion of career is colored by how KSP does it, that\u0027s unfortunate, because career in KSP could actually be good with a decent paradigm in place. Not better, but actually really good. It\u0027s like at all the choice of focus branching points, they intentionally made the wrong decisions, lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFine Print addition is a great example. It was an excellent mod for what it did (playing along within the fundamentally broken system), but looked at objectively, it just adds more, random contracts to a career system that feels nothing like running a space program or private rocket company startup.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few posts mention Minecraft. I\u0027d make another analogy. My kids play creative, which to me is mind-numbing. It\u0027s 100% self-driven, so apparently I have no imagination (to those who make that claim regarding KSP Sandbox). Heck, my daughter likes flat worlds to build stuff, which makes creative even more mind-numbing, I prefer architecture to have a landscape context. Survival, OTOH, is also incredibly bad in MC, but when there is an update, and my kids convince me to try it, I always play survival, anyway. Partially because I like coming across cool scenes here and there (a village with a nearby temple half-buried in sand, for example).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBorrowing from this, is part of the reason I\u0027d prefer a randomized Kerbol system as an option. That sense of real exploration would add value in just getting someplace new... Even variants of existing worlds, new maps for the Mun that it can switch between, etc. Instead of frankly lame easter eggs, I\u0027d rather come across a unique, \u003Cem\u003Eplausible\u003C/em\u003E geographical feature now and again. This would add a lot to exploration, IMO. If this included a kind of \u0022fog of war,\u0022 where you only know what should be known by ground-based astronomy to start, then we instantly have a \u0022career\u0022 progression, even in a game that is strictly speaking \u0022sandbox\u0022 mode. Take atmospheres, for example. The range of possible values for Venus was huge until the Soviets actually sent a probe. In sandbox, with a random system and certain elements requiring \u0022science\u0022 acquired locally to nail down, a crewed mission might be a very bad idea without first sending a probe (or grossly overbuilding your lander/ascent vehicle).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-31T21:34:55Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2016 09:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vermil","CreatedById":122726,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-31T20:53:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222479428\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022135218\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221459281500\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002270807\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/29/2016 at 9:58 PM, regex said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOver the years here I\u0027ve seen many people on the forums (unironically) claim that playing Sandbox mode precludes goals, planning, and efficiency. \u00A0Is it because having everything available reduces all your design problems to \u0022MOAR BOOSTERS\u0022? \u00A0Is it a lack of personal goals in the game? \u00A0Do you feel there is no impetus to explore concepts, techniques, and places without artificial signposts and\u00A0point rewards? \u00A0Do you feel like personal restrictions aren\u0027t enough? \u00A0Do you feel the need for some sort of gated progression?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI generally have no problems building efficiently using personal restrictions\u00A0and following a plan to meet a\u00A0goal I\u0027ve set when playing in Sandbox mode, and\u00A0I\u0027m curious why you feel otherwise?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d say my ambitions originally carried me away.

I could bang out a quick map where my boat will come across a convoy, or the Kido Butai in certain waters, then play it to see how I manage. This to me is much like KSP sandbox, since I know the entire setup ahead of time, and I customize it to my liking. Once I\u0027m in range of the targets, however, SH4 is vastly superior to KSP in this regard, since I could play that setup 10 times, and have as many outcomes. Sometimes the escorts detect me early, sometimes they don\u0027t. Sometimes I evade the depth charges, sometimes they shack me. There is a little of this in KSP, certainly with atmospheres involved, but any fault/difference is only my fault, there is never a failure, nothing random. In campaign mode, it\u0027s even more complex, and I am constantly put in novel situations, and novel situations that compound on each other. A stray H8K spots me in shallow water, and damages the boat. I am now in the middle of a patrol, with a slightly impaired boat, but I don\u0027t want to come home empty-handed, so I deal with it. This latter example is exactly why I want a career system that is actually good. I don\u0027t need/want it to spam me with random goals, I want the game to result in novel problems to solve, which is a very different thing.
