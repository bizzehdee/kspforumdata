But while I was up there I suddenly realized I could get EVA reports above all the equatorial biomes as you can just right click and store the experiments on the command pod. The only draw back is you can\u0027t time warp with him on the ladder, but you just let go and free float a bit, grab another EVA report and then swan back over to the craft to store it! Rinse and repeat for an orbit. Got 8 experiments and ~50 sci from doing that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else done that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t have to deorbit with the poor guy clinging onto the ladder, it just seemed the kerbal thing to do, and I was able to get another report at 40km up (which given how risky that is, really should be worth more points!).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-20T00:02:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYea, now that some contracts only appear when you reach a certain level they should really do the same for the rescue one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-20T01:33:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr you could just use all the contract payments for getting to orbit to upgrade the astronaut complex and so allow EVA off-Kerbin in the first place ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETA for below - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/103878-18t-%28or-less%29-Returnable-Manned-Mun-Lander?p=1613524\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1613524\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/103878-18t-%28or-less%29-Returnable-Manned-Mun-Lander?p=1613524\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1613524\u003C/a\u003E and the posts that follow it in that thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-20T01:48:59Z\u0022 title=\u002212/20/2014 01:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Pecan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xacktar","CreatedById":88876,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-20T01:39:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is brilliant.
