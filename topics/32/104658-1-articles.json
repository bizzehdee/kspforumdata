Can you see all of these spots in the sky ? These are what we call stars...\u0022\n\n me: \u0022Stars, what is that ?\u0022\n\n dad: \u0022Some of them are planets like earth where we are living, some others are suns like the one who shine everyday, and some are other Galaxies...\n\n We are a small part of an amazing and complex systems that no one understand completely...\u0022\n\n me: \u0022Really ?! there are a tons of it everywhere, how is this possible ? Can we visit them ?\u0022\n\n dad: \u0022There are so many stars that you cannot imagine in your brain how many they are, they are so far away that you cannot imagine how many time you\u0027ll need to travel to them. Except for one, the moon !\u0022\n\n me: \u0022Is the moon a star ?\u0022\n\n dad: \u0022Yes, we can say that. This one is the closest from the earth. And man was able to visit it already.\u0022\n\n me: \u0022Wow it should be amazing ! One day it will be me ! I want to visit it !\u0022\n\n dad: \u0022ahahah ! Work hard at school and maybe a day you\u0027ll be able to visit it\u0022\n\n me :\u0022so cooooool !!\u0022\n\n This is a true discussion I had with my dad 25 years ago (with a little bit of romance i admit )... I never forget it, and since this exact moment, I allways had space goodies to play with. (even my duvet cover for my bed )\n\n It is pointless to say that I was not a good student or even more useless that I didn\u0027t have visited the moon ! But........\n\n .... One day, around the year 2012. \n\n While I was fetching for some fresh new game (since I\u0027m a player from age of 10). I eard about a game, I eard about something different, with green things Inside and Michael Bay special effects \n\n I was with a friend when I first discover Kerbal, he was (and still is), like me, fascinated by the universe.\n\n me: \u0022Look at this dude !! You can build your own rocket, fly it to space and land on planets. It looks amazing !! oh wait... there is a demo !!\u0022\n\n friend: \u0022Lol, a demo in 2012 ?? These guys are crazy\u0022\n\n me: \u0022... or they are proud of their game\u0022\n\n Starting from this moment to now, I spent around 500 hours on Kerbal doing stuff...\n\n Now, I said to my father :\n\n \u0022Hey dad, you know what ? I visited the mune !!\u0022\n\n**THANK YOU SQUAD.** \n\nFor realising my child dream.\n\nIMO, this game, is the best game ever. We maybe have it, our Citizen kane for video games...\n\nThis is fun, interesting, playful and entertaining.\n\nWhat about you, community ? \n\nWhat is your story behind Kerbal ? Share it with Squad ! \n\nI think they need all of our support for this latest straight line before the release !\n\n Love you all, fly safe (or not !)\n\n Ps : Can\u0027t wait for v1.0 !!!"}]}
