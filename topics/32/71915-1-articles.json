I only ever did this to Jeb, and everytime I did it he was absolutely teriified, of course most of the time this was because doing this bad stuff happened, I had to relaunch the mission a few times because it would sometimes Kill Jeb. One time He knocked a landing leg off of the spacecraft, but the engines were the orange ones that go on the sides, so I retracted the landing gear and it sat on it\u0027s fuel tank rather nicely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Random Tank","CreatedById":104325,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-10T21:36:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s a Mehroplane....\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAwful puns are awful.... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENEW EASTER EGG DISCOVERED!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MGCJerry","CreatedById":95202,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-10T22:05:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve scared Jeb with my kerbal kannon. 930m/s, 6km flight into the ocean...
