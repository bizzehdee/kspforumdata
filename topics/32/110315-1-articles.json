Just did a quick test with the temperature showing as well. Fortunately the numbers update in time warp. I used the same craft on the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, the temperature variation throughout the day is around 10 degrees, not all that much. In the morning the panels are cool and warming up. As the panels warm the energy flow goes up. About an hour before the sun is straight up the panels start to cool but the energy flow continues to rise. After the sun is directly overhead the energy flow and temperature are both falling until night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed the temperature jumped a bit when beginning time warp, around 2-3 degrees, so I let it settle to equilibrium at 1x a few times during the day. The same general trend was observed, the energy flow would increase from morning to noon, but the temperature would first rise, then fall. I believe it\u0027s cooling near noon since the central tank is absorbing less heat as the sun hits it directly above, and it\u0027s also shaded on top by the probe core. This gives the heat from the panels somewhere to go. I also paid close attention to the minimum and maximum this time. Just before the sun sets/after it rises the energy flow dips as low as 1.41, while it\u0027s 21.66 at max (sun directly overhead).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, it seems the energy flow has more going on than temperature and distance. Plus, I have a hard time believing a change of around 10-15 degrees would change the energy flow by so much. Atmospheric scattering is about all I can think of.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Korizan","CreatedById":142032,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T13:49:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EClouds - I know they are not shown but solar panels do have to deal with them and atmosphere scattering (dust / dirt on the panels and in the atmosphere and the sky is blue after all).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETemperature is should not be an issue on the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T13:57:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 01:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Korizan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T14:11:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it were temperature, you\u0027d expect them to produce less at mid day... but they produce less when the sun is low on the horizon (although I have no idea how well KSPs temperature system models this).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo the same experiment, but with Eve!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe my electric ducted fan plane won\u0027t fly so well there :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore gravity means more power is needed... if the power/gravity ratio is less than for Duna (which the design can barely fly at)... the plane is doomed, and I\u0027ll have to buff my mod-part \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Volix","CreatedById":144192,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T14:17:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Korizan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Korizan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EClouds - I know they are not shown but solar panels do have to deal with them and atmosphere scattering (dust / dirt on the panels and in the atmosphere and the sky is blue after all).\u003Cp\u003ETemperature is should not be an issue on the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to a mod, I do have clouds \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.

My little lander (nothing but a probe core, a small parachute, a 0.625m inline battery, four of the lightest legs, a thermometer, and an antenna) has four OX-STATs placed around the sides. Obviously these can\u0027t track the Sun, so they\u0027re not useful for this sort of test, but I was amazed to see how little energy they produced even at the optimum times of day. It took hours to refill the batteries from even a single thermometer reading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the astrophysics of this, it\u0027s pretty realistic if you look at total solar energy. On Earth, the Sun produces 1367 W/m^2 of energy. When directly overhead, about 83% gets through the atmosphere. Three hours before or after (45 degrees off-angle) and you\u0027re down to about 80% of THAT amount, i.e. 65ish%. Five hours before or after the peak (75 degrees off, or 15 degrees above the horizon) and you\u0027re down to about 25% of the total amount (30% of the in-atmosphere peak). The Kerbin numbers in the OP match this almost exactly, and it does explain Eve\u0027s horrible surface numbers (very thick atmosphere), which makes yet another reason to ditch solar panels and use RTGs as soon as you can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe catch is, solar panels don\u0027t absorb every wavelength of light equally well. Like a lot of other things (mirrors, digital cameras, the human eye, etc.), you\u0027d want something that was optimized for the types of radiation that do get through our atmosphere with less absorption, i.e. visible light, radio waves, and to a lesser extent infrared. So, the amounts might actually go up quite a bit depending on the chemistry involved, especially as you approach sunset. Although, this\u0027d be different for other planets with different atmospheres, so unless we want to assume the panels are \u0022tuned\u0022 for each body\u0027s particular absorption spectrum we should probably just stick with the numbers we have now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, it\u0027s yet another example of how the devs have done their physics homework.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bitbucket","CreatedById":6676,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T19:32:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETook some Gigantor XL panels to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TnFM7Cr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TnFM7Cr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarly morning landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rJs93Bp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rJs93Bp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMidday high sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NFPwFt7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NFPwFt7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELate evening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CRBVxOo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CRBVxOo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last glimmers of twilight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0prtXT7.png\u0022 alt=\u00220prtXT7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it\u0027s gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutput stayed around 26 right until sunset.

To keep the internal simulation running at a reasonable speed, they probably do things like have the solar panels stick to integer numbers of degrees of rotation, and there\u0027s probably some rounding on the solar angles as well. So, even though it says 1.00 Exposure, it might be varying by a percent or so simply based on the fact that internally it\u0027s actually varying from 0.995 to 1.005 (yes, I know it\u0027s physically impossible to go above 1.00, but internal rounding CAN do that). That\u0027d explain the 1% variation seen in those shots.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Volix","CreatedById":144192,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T20:09:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vicwarrior\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vicwarrior\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust to make sure, can someone test if solar panels produce more power if you heat them up, with a lets say, a few nukes?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat kind of scientist would I be if I left a variable unchecked?

However, in my previous test held in thermal equilibrium the temperature never rose above ~320 and I saw the energy flow dip as low as 1.5 right at sunset. The panels would probably blow up before the efficiency dropped to those levels from heat alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: A little off topic, but as a new member to the forum I\u0027ve greatly enjoyed this discussion.
