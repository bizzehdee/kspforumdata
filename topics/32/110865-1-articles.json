Putting a Mainsail directly beneath an orange tank always made it go BOOM, so you\u0027d stick a pancake tank in between. Also used to be, there\u0027d be these overheat bars in the staging list added on to the fuel bars. The Mainsail always had one of those and would itself explode if you filled the bar up, even if you\u0027d prevented it from exploding the orange tank. The bottom line was, you had to throttle Mainsails down to like 90% or they\u0027d explode during launch. Since 1.0, however, Mainsails haven\u0027t had any overheat problems at all. This is something nobody seems to talk about in all the arguments about LV-N overheating ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif).\n\nAnd to be a bit pedantic, parts transfer heat between each other via conduction, not convection. Conduction is the flow of heat through direct physical contact. Convection is the relative movement of bodies of fluids with different temperatures and AFAIK the game only really uses convection as a cooling mechanism, allowing parts to cool down faster if they\u0027re surrounded by air or water. I\u0027ve heard some folks say the nose of a rocket can heat up air, which then blows on and heats up other parts of the rocket, but that\u0027s really more conduction than convection. The game also appears only to deal with radiant heat transfer as a cooling mechanism, the default rate at which parts cool in vacuum. It ignores radiation for making things hotter, so that the flames of radially mounted engines have no effect on nearby parts."},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T08:47:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This game is so epic.

I haven\u0027t had a crash since using it regularly.\n\nAll that is doing is slowing KSP down by forcing the operating system to swap out less active pages of memory. It does absolutely nothing to help with the amount of per-process address space used by KSP. No tool of that nature can ever help with that, it\u0027s simply impossible. KSP will crash when total virtual address space usage hits 4GB (minus the Windows overhead), whether it has 500kB, 500MB, or 3.5GB in physical memory at the time. Your actions are actually harming the performance of KSP, as you are forcing it out to virtual memory (on disk), which means that when it needs to access a portion of code or data that wasn\u0027t active at the time of your last purge, there will be a big pause and delay as the operating system loads the needed pages of memory from disk.\n\nA relevant degree followed by decades of experience tells me that \u0022ramrush\u0022 is mostly placebo or snake oil, with most of its claimed features being dubious at best, or outright false claims or misrepresentation at worst. The claim it makes to \u0022remove memory leaks\u0022 is 100% snake oil, for example. The leaked memory is still allocated to the process that leaked it, it\u0027s just swapped out to disk, which is something the operating system does automatically when it is actually required and useful to do so (and absolutely does not need snake oil tools to help it)."}]}
