Putting a Mainsail directly beneath an orange tank always made it go BOOM, so you\u0027d stick a pancake tank in between. Also used to be, there\u0027d be these overheat bars in the staging list added on to the fuel bars. The Mainsail always had one of those and would itself explode if you filled the bar up, even if you\u0027d prevented it from exploding the orange tank. The bottom line was, you had to throttle Mainsails down to like 90% or they\u0027d explode during launch. Since 1.0, however, Mainsails haven\u0027t had any overheat problems at all. This is something nobody seems to talk about in all the arguments about LV-N overheating \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd to be a bit pedantic, parts transfer heat between each other via conduction, not convection. Conduction is the flow of heat through direct physical contact. Convection is the relative movement of bodies of fluids with different temperatures and AFAIK the game only really uses convection as a cooling mechanism, allowing parts to cool down faster if they\u0027re surrounded by air or water. I\u0027ve heard some folks say the nose of a rocket can heat up air, which then blows on and heats up other parts of the rocket, but that\u0027s really more conduction than convection. The game also appears only to deal with radiant heat transfer as a cooling mechanism, the default rate at which parts cool in vacuum. It ignores radiation for making things hotter, so that the flames of radially mounted engines have no effect on nearby parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T08:47:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kungfufishstick\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kungfufishstick\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis game is so epic.
