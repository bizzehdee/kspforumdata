When I came to build a space station the only standard-sized ports I had were the Mk 2 ones, so they were what I put on \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E In the event I never docked to them though, I only ever used the Jrs. I think a big part for me is I hate the 3-Kerbal pod, it\u0027s hugely overweight, so I got a mod 2-Kerb pod instead. When I update to 1.0.5 I\u0027ll probably roll something with the 1.25m cabin assuming it has decent crash tolerance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JedTech","CreatedById":104003,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T17:34:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI aim for Solar as soon as possible to enable longer missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I try to get science parts early to increase science gain for my missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI avoid the Aero tree all together as I don\u0027t use those parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"paul23","CreatedById":120544,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T17:52:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI play at a science level of 10% - so that means I\u0027m very hard pressed to actually get science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMakes everything more fun though: having to figure out how to get to duna with only 1.25m parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kuansenhama","CreatedById":114023,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T17:56:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the early game, the first solar panels and the LV-909 are quintessential to my play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the mid game, I really need the lab and the larger solar panels to grind out science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I get the late game, (L3 R\u0026amp;D) I usually beeline the IRSU converter and create reusable spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tomycj","CreatedById":158720,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-15T19:57:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy last game I completed the tech tree with kerbin system exploration (a mun mission and several to minmus) \u002B a mission to Duna and back (visiting 1 biome)\u00A0\u002B a mission to Ike and back (Landed in 2 biomes).
