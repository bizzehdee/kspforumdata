Please calm down. I\u0027ve had many troubles too but many are just with the controls. Technical support on the forums is very helpful ok. Give them time. QA can only do so much. They had ALREADY STATED they are working on a patch. It happens give them\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0time. I understand your frustration.

Just the controls are awful. Trim being a prime example. These stuff take time. Code is complicated. They can\u0027t scroll down to item 1\u00A0find the flaw and fix it. They need to first FIND IT and then furthur write a fix that doesn\u0027t have any bugs, AND that doesn\u0027t bug other areas of the game. Give them a little time. They said in the weeklies they are taking the criticism and working on it. I know its \u00A0hard to trust them after FTE. But give them a chance to fix it. This stuff takes TIME. Squad Developers don\u0027t eat breathe and live KSP. Give them time, they need to focus on Making History too. Ok to be blunt we are a priority but PC is the vast majority of players. They need to finish making History. SQUAD is going to most likely give a list of Bugs and then send it to Blitworks.

I know its a smaller team than AAA titles but just something along the lines of \u0027quite a few bugs, we\u0027ve picked out the biggest game affecting ones and will get a quick patch out to you by next week and keep you up to date with following patches\u00A0until weve got this right!\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut i\u0027m back to wondering do we start to have a fix in a few weeks or do we have a fix in 18 months? its seriously disheartening as i supported the game fully with the flying tiger port....provided work arounds\u00A0 for people and told people to have faith and that we will get the game we are owed....I was so excited when EE was released and I finally felt like my patience had been rewarded and now im back to where I was. checking the Kerbal Forums and Dev notes for news on when i can confidently play this game without the game breaking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nim tired, im heartbroken and i feel like an idiot as ive been pushing the KSP:EE facebook group to people and persuading people to buy the game on release as it would be relatively bug free.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW i\u0027m also melodramatic. but that comes with having twin baby girls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
