Will the three Kerbonauts aboard survive the vacuum of space - or each other?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E  The bright glow of Kerbol casts towering, negative images of the work of engineering art rolling along slowly as a snail upon the massive crawler. Struts glint in the sunshine like diamonds, and produce twinkles in the eyes of the aspiring children gazing in awe. Many are holding their prized models of the crew, including the legendary Jebediah Kerman, clutching them tightly, but taking care not to smudge the miniature Aviator sunglasses nestled upon the Kerbonaut\\\u0027s face. \n\u003E \n\u003E  A forest of eyes are glued to the electrical seductress that is the television, a radio positioned next to the tube providing live commentary. The calm tones and silver tongue of the reporter\\\u0027s voice quell every possible worry of safety, even from the cosmic adventurers\\\u0027 wives. The scent of buttery sweetness waft through every corner of every house, filling what seems all of Kerbin with this wonderful, palpable tension that seems almost pleasant to endure - if that\\\u0027s a proper term for it. Voices, young and old, chatter fervently with equal enthusiasm, preparing for this monumental moment. It seems so near, and so very real, and it is. It is pure happiness and pride and wonder. Today, Kerbalkind blasts off for the dusty, stony slate of peace and discovery, the dented ball so distant in the night sky. Today, Kerbalkind unites under one banner, held high by three of their brethren; their brothers, their sons, their husbands. Today, Kerbalkind takes a valiant leap to the Mun. The reflection on the plastic shades seem to glow brighter than ever before, hinting to a portal to its live counterpart...\n\nThis is all I have for now. (Hey, I did write this in 30 minutes!) Stay tuned, and please comment! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nWord count: 281"},{"CreatedByName":"Elven_sword","CreatedById":16427,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-06T04:31:26Z","Content":"Oh hot damn, this is really good."},{"CreatedByName":"capitan.dorko","CreatedById":24138,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-06T06:02:09Z","Content":"OH LOVE IT!
