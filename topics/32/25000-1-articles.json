Basically my experience went:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Build rocket\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Push a lot of buttons trying to get it to go\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Finally hit spacebar but the stages aren\u0027t set up right so you just separate the command module\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Do this several times until you get the stages figured out\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Launch rocket - it crashes and burns due to lack of control\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Re-launch rocket - it crashes and burns due to lack of control\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Discover SDS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Re-launch rocket - it crashes and burns because I forgot to turn the SDS on before launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Re-launch rocket - it fails because I jettisoned my liquid motor with the SRB\u0027s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10. Play with stages to get SRB\u0027s to jettison\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11. Put on too much extra junk, still can\u0027t reach orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12. Scale WAY back but release SRB\u0027s too soon and rocket fails\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13. Finally launch right but only sub-orbital flight achieved\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E14. Launched right and heading 135 degrees, only sub-orbital but for a longer distance!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E15. Re-launch, get everything right and HOOORAY! ORBIT!!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, my plan is to grow this similar to a country\u0027s space program. Step through meeting up with another space craft, docking with that space craft, using that to build a rocket to go to Mun.

I failed once before getting to orbit because I messed up the staging. I fixed it, and failed again while in orbit, again because I messed up staging. I fixed it again, made my rendezvous and did the docking I was trying to do. I was trying to do a double docking (2 ports) and it failed, because they were different distances. At this point I decided to scrap the ship I was docking with (didn\u0027t think it would work well anyway), so I went to return the fuel tank that brought up my payload. I found out I had messed up the stages for deorbiting junk as well! I had a probe on one part but the RTGs on the other part.
