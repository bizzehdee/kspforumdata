I\u0027ve been playing KSP relatively consistently since .13, and even considering the time not accounted for before it was added to Steam, I feel like 53 hours is really low for how much I enjoy the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main problem is that once I discovered mods I\u0027ve done mostly \u0022preparing\u0022 my game with mods. It\u0027s a problem I\u0027ve had with a lot of moddable games: I learn how to mod a game, become a extremely mod-heavy and then by the time I have my mods in place I\u0027ve burned myself out of the game. The same thing is happening with Kerbal Space Program. I cannot play without mods, and for the past month I\u0027ve been deciding what I want to do with the game, what mods I want and (most of the time spent is this) editing textures of space suits to specifically fit the space program I want to make. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know, I\u0027ve probably spent 150 hours on modding Kerbal Space Program, and I just feel like with all the joy and time spent KSP has brought me the number should be much greater.
