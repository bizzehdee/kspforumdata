Because each asteroid has negligible mass relative to both the Sun and Jupiter, it stays at the Lagrange point, until some other sufficient force (collision, what have you) causes it to leave. While it\u0027s technically possible for ANY body to have Trojans (and a few Martian ones have been identified), Jupiter\u0027s sheer mass relative to the rest of the Solar System, and position close to the asteroid belt, ensure that it has the largest Trojan clouds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile, yes, the OP\u0027s original suggestion is correct, it would be possible to implement a field of Trojans without having to resort to N-body physics (the orbital properties of the Trojans are decently well-understood - giving them slightly different orbits with apside differences of a few tens or hundreds of km would be sufficient - this is how it works in reality, more or less, and is a decent approximation of the path the rock takes as it orbits the Lagrange, as the Lagrange \u0022orbits\u0022 the Sun), I\u0027m pretty sure this would be a low priority for the devs, possibly even having to wait until after the implementation of a proper asteroid belt (if THAT ever happens, naturally).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECool idea, though.
