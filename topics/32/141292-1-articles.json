Everyone Is Saying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s harmful-- because it means that people who are getting bitten by a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edesign

for years, and if it got to a state where it was so badly broken I couldn\u0027t play it, then I\u0027d be upset, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, again, please be careful about laying blame.\u00A0 Lengthy explanation in spoiler section, but the TL;DR is:\u00A0 It\u0027s okay to be upset.\u00A0 But please don\u0027t blame Squad unless it\u0027s demonstrably their fault.\u00A0 And in many cases (e.g. your problem is game crashing, and you are running \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eany mods at all\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E), then that is not the case.\u00A0 Reproduce the crash in pure stock before you call it Squad\u0027s fault.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv

aggravating problem in which the game keeps crashing to desktop.\u00A0 How sure are you that it\u0027s actually Squad\u0027s fault?\u00A0 (Hint:\u00A0 If you\u0027re running any mods at all, then you\u0027re not.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eremarkably\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E stable experience with the game, post-1.1.\u00A0 Considerably fewer crashes than pre-1.1.\u00A0 Works great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then, I run pretty close to stock, compared with an awful lot of KSP players.\u00A0 I\u0027m not any kind of purist, I simply happen to like the stock experience and prefer to just gussy it up a little rather than completely overhaul it.\u00A0 I\u0027m running fewer than a dozen mods, and none of them are \u0022big\u0022.\u00A0 PlanetShine, Kopernicus, SpaceY \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:9px;\u0022\u003E(a parts pack with no code in it)\u003C/span\u003E, NavBall Docking Alignment Indicator.\u00A0 A half-dozen of my own mods (none of which are really huge).\u00A0 And that\u0027s about it.\u00A0 No MechJeb, no KER, none of the big mods that really get into the guts of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd running KSP with such a light mod load works just fine for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I see an awful lot of KSP players out there who routinely play with \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edozens\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of mods installed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd mods can cause crashes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if you\u0027re having crash problems, my first question is:\u00A0 are you running stock?\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003EPure\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E stock?\u00A0 Because unless you\u0027re running pure stock, how do you know that it wasn\u0027t the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emod\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E causing the crash, rather than KSP itself?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd, if you \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Earen\u0027t\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E running pure stock... you\u0027re not doing yourself or anyone else a favor to complain about crashes.\u00A0 Because not only is it not obvious whether the crash comes from KSP itself, but it\u0027s not \u0022actionable intelligence\u0022-- the KSP devs can\u0027t really do much with \u0022some random user running some random collection of mods that the KSP team didn\u0027t write had a crash.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you can reliably reproduce your crash in a stock game, then by all means report the bug to Squad in their bug tracker.\u00A0 Mention it in the forums, so other users know about the issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut until and unless you do that... you\u0027re not in any position to point the Finger Of Blame\u2122 at anyone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022It\u0027s Squad\u0027s fault that there are so many bugs, and we should be mad at them.\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve ranted at this at length elsewhere, so I\u0027ll skip much of it here, but my response to that boils down to:\u00A0 Bugs happen.\u00A0 It is mathematically impossible to ship software without bugs in it\u003Cem\u003E.\u00A0 \u003C/em\u003EIt\u0027s just a matter of how \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emany\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E you ship with.\u00A0 There are a lot of factors that go into that, but they come down to two things:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nPeople.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTime.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you can throw a couple of hundred engineers at the problem, with a comparably sized QA staff, then you can ship a really polished product.\u00A0 Or if you can spend years and years working on it, you can also get your bug count really low.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut when you\u0027re a tiny indie game company with like half a dozen developers, and you have to push things out in \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emonths\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E rather than years, there simply isn\u0027t the time to turn out software with six nines of reliability.\u00A0 Cannot be done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you shell out your US$20 or $40 or whatever, what you\u0027re buying is the result of a tiny team of passionate, dedicated, hard-working people who are doing the best they can.\u00A0 And I think they\u0027ve done a pretty good job.\u00A0 I say this as a professional software engineer with over 20 years of experience in the industry, in companies large and small.\u00A0 I have a pretty good idea of what \u0022crap\u0022 looks like, and I contend that KSP isn\u0027t it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are a professional software engineer\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E(and I know I\u0027m not the only one here!)\u003C/span\u003E and differ with this opinion, then great, let\u0027s have a discussion.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022

\u0022should\u0022 be able to do, and you\u0027re not helping anyone by pointing the Finger Of Blame.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E legitimately say that \u0022I don\u0027t like the experience I have as a player.\u0022\u00A0 You can vote with your wallet, and decide that US$20 or $40 or whatever was too steep a price to pay for the thousands of hours of entertainment you\u0027ve gotten from the game, and warn your friends away, if you like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022Okay, there are bugs, but they should have \u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;done something different than

but it boils down to:\u00A0 all the evidence indicates that these are smart, hard-working people who are doing their best.\u00A0 Software development is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehard\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, and shipping software requires dealing with many constraints that people outside the industry (or even outside the particular company) can\u0027t appreciate.\u00A0 So before playing armchair general and saying that Squad should have done something different than what they did, consider how it is that you know better than they do how to run their business.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv

this:\u00A0 If you believe that Squad\u0027s software management and release strategy is egregiously wrong-- and you think you know better than they do-- then on what do you base that assumption?\u00A0 Are you in the software industry?\u00A0 Do you work at Squad, and have visibility into all of their various constraints?\u00A0 It\u0027s easy to be an armchair general.\u00A0 It\u0027s easy to point a finger at what they did and say \u0022this thing they did here is bad, and they should have done this other thing instead.\u0022\u00A0 But if you have no insight into \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewhy\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E they did that \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E(hint: you don\u0027t)\u003C/span\u003E, then you\u0027re in no position to judge.\u00A0 The \u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;something different\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E you\u0027re proposing could have been \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eworse\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor you, me, or anyone who doesn\u0027t work at Squad to really be able to say \u0022they totally screwed up and should have done something different,\u0022 then essentially we\u0027d have to believe one of the following:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThey\u0027re masochists who enjoy

\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewants\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E to ship a buggy product.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#2 certainly exists in the world... but from the enthusiastic engagement that I\u0027ve seen from Squad staff here in the forums, I really don\u0027t think that\u0027s it.\u00A0 I\u0027ve never seen such a friendly, engaged company.\u00A0 Time and time again I\u0027ll see a player post a problem, and an \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eactual developer\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E will jump in and answer their question personally.\u00A0 That\u0027s not just refreshing, it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eastonishing\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 I\u0027ve never seen that level of commitment to users from any other software company.\u00A0 They\u0027re batting that one out of the frickin\u0027 \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Epark\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd as for #3... sure, there are incompetent coders out there in the world.\u00A0 But I have seen zero evidence to suggest that anybody at Squad fits that category; quite the contrary.\u00A0 For one thing, as a modder, I\u0027ve done a fair amount of poking around in KSP\u0027s internals, and I\u0027ve had a lot of technical discussions in which Squad devs joined in, and I have to say that they\u0027ve done a solid job.\u00A0 Not perfect, and sure there are some rough edges here and there where KSP shows that something had to be turned out in a hurry-- but by and large, they\u0027re technically very impressive people who do good work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook:\u00A0 Nobody\u0027s perfect, including Squad.\u00A0 I\u0027m not saying they never make mistakes.\u00A0 But they\u0027re skilled, smart, hard-working people who are operating under time and manpower constraints, and very often in software development there are hard choices where the best you can do is pick the lesser of two evils.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you don\u0027t know the reasons that went into particular decisions, you\u0027re really not in any position to judge.\u00A0 So maybe tone down the rhetoric a

do, like you, is look at the externally observable evidence and results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd what I\u0027ve seen looks like a company that\u0027s doing things just fine, given the
