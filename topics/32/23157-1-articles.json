All excess weight was trimmed, even including minimizing the number of wing surfaces and choosing the most weight efficient ones. Even different combinations of air intakes were played with to minimize intake drag. The number of engines was a fine tuning process also. 8 Turbojets doesn\u0027t provide quite enough thrust to reach Mach 1, and 10 run out of fuel before accelerating enough to reach it. (Also .5 intakes per engine \u002B 1 is the most efficient ratio in terms of most thrust per intake drag) We\u0027re basically tuned to a razor fine point here. Fly it below about 85 meters and there\u0027s too much drag to reach Mach 1 before you\u0027re out of fuel. Fly it above 100 and it fails my \u0022at sea level\u0027 requirement. And at Mach 1 you\u0027re above 97.3% of the planes total weight being dedicated to engines.
