Call it what you want, learning tool, game, simulator, lifestyle. It\u0027s beautiful. I love every single aspect of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I started playing KSP, I had no idea what an apoapsis was. For all I knew, the mechanics of Star Wars were 97% accurate. I know better now. I wouldn\u0027t want the game to have surrealistic orbital mechanics, not for a second. The game\u0027s learning curve (or rather, learning wall) is a great deal of its charm. If it was easy, what sense of accomplishment would it give to go to the Mun for the first time, how proud would you be the first time you dock? It\u0027s not that it\u0027s hard, it\u0027s that it\u0027s mentally, physically and emotionally demanding. And when you do manage to land on the Mun, you just want to scream \u0022YEAH BABY YEAH\u0022 and go hit a bottle of champagne.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you can\u0027t! The little guys depend on you - your trip has made you bond with little Jergas, Billy-bobler and Obzor. You can\u0027t just leave them there! Every time I crash a vessel, killing all crew, I feel guilty. Guilty because they had friends, wives and kids! I care about them, because they\u0027re living beings!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the graphics are awesome - not like realistic (they are, but that\u0027s not the reason), but because they just look super cool. The Joolrises on Laythe are breathtaking, and reentering makes you look 105% badass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game knows how to catch your attention - when docking you are in Zen Mode. It\u0027s you, the hab module and the station. Nothing else exists at that time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there\u0027s the devs. They\u0027re totally badass, Devnote Tuesdays are my all-favourite day of the week. And they are so nice, when I read \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/264-C7Studios-Recaps-the-LANfest-KSP-Tournament-at-SXSW-Gaming\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E I almost shed a tear. I can only imagine what being that kid is like, getting a signed shuttle, and even being featured in an article!

I mean, I was always interested in science and all and remember the Space Shuttle launches when I was younger, and used to read some books about the solar system, but KSP has taught me how it all works, and has emerged me deeper than ever before into the vast world of science. I\u0027ve been asking \u0022the big questions\u0022 since I starteds playing KSP. About how living things are even, well alive. What science has done for humanity, what reality is (and I\u0027m sure other KSP\u0027ers also think about this stuff as well).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also had somewhat severe anxiety which led me into problems with school and grades, and overall well being. I won\u0027t say more than that because I don\u0027t feel comfortable doing so, but KSP kept my mind sharp throughout, no matter what I went through (and yes, I\u0027m much healthier now thanks to good doctors and treatment).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo become an aerospace engineer and work at NASA is my goal, and hopefully I can reach it!
