It\u0027s sort of light on actual content. It is really the players that generate the content. By building crafts and setting themselves missions and challenges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother aspect is that it is more social than people think. People share crafts, and post pictures and stories of their missions and accomplishments.

Expect all sorts of these, of building/piloting/both/other nature. (Robot Wars with kOS would be pretty neat IMO).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Co-op missions, such as Mun return, Apollo style. With someone as Mission Control seeing map view and other data, and a pilot in the capsule with IVA only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* All that stuff about sharing crafts and collaborative design. That can actually happen in-game, in real time. Where you build and fly crafts of others and chat about it right there. (like, i\u0027ll be able to tell Vanamonde in person that his latest SSTO Spaceplane sucks like the last one)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Then there\u0027s the Mods!

Just think of this could-be scenario on gathering science...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou land on the Mun and hop out on EVA. You have a Geiger counter in hand, and a rover. You drive around listening to the ticks to locate some very radioactive rocks to collect. You bring them back to the science lab. Then you use a Gamma-Ray Spectrometer to do the analysis which works like a mini-game, where you have to pick the radioactive nuclides yourself. Then you transmit to Kerbin and get more science yield for higher radioactive samples and better analysis. (in multiplayer, your friend could ride shotgun and do the analysis since you keep botching it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for how science is used, i think the tech tree should just be one aspect. Science should be the lifeblood of your Space Agency in Career mode. The source of both money and reputation.

Besides, chances are that whatever vision you have for how much KSP is going to fail due to the lack of the resources system or the inclusion of multiplayer... well, to be honest, I\u0027d say the odds are quite decidedly weighing against either of these things actually making anything worse. They cut resources because the way it was going wasn\u0027t going to work, in their eyes. By the same token, if multiplayer was going to be a worthless waste of time, they won\u0027t go through with it. The developers here aren\u0027t machines. The \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E judgement. And yes, by the same token, they make mistakes, just like everyone else. That doesn\u0027t mean they can\u0027t fix their mistakes, though... but do also remember that what some of us may see as a mistake (most prominently here being scrapping the resources system) may not turn out to be a mistake after all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ComradeGoat","CreatedById":59041,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T12:17:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn overcomplicated resource system that made you *have* to micromanage life support for long missions would probably ruin the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne that allowed you to, with some skill, pilot down to a body and mine fuel to sustain those missions - that would enhance the game tremendously, IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
