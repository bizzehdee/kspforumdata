If that was the case, I think computers you play KSP on wouldn\u0027t exist. Microsoft and apple have done just as bad things as EA, if not worse.

The only way to reach a big audience is to smooth out the character of your product. Games lose their challenge because some people just don\u0027t have the attentionspan to play it for more than an hour, movies all look shiny and smooth because it\u0027s easier to be impressed by visuals instead of a story, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a reason why I prefer to play indie games or at least games from smaller companies. If you go for the money your product loses its character and that happens to be the thing that make people fall in love with. A game full of character certainly won\u0027t please everyone but the people that do will love it and I appreciate a company to rather goes for a game with character instead of a golden turd.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brabbit1987","CreatedById":65801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-23T16:09:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t think that a serious appraisal of their business policy would actually derive a result of of EA being objectively the worst company in America but you also have to consider the sector of the market that they operate in.
