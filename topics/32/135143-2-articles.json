I typically have five installs active, so that\u0027s five\u00A0instances of the core game, four instances of my \u0022must-have\u0022 mods, three instances of the VFX mods I use, etc. I run from an SSD where the supply of space is more limited than on a spinning disk, so this duplication pinches a bit. Being able to consolidate all of these into a single install where I choose the mod profile on initial load would be very welcome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI might be a bit of an edge case in maintaining so many installs though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne solution would to have a launcher that supported user defined \u0027profiles\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere the users could select which mods they wanted in that profile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPossibly including different save directories (or something like that).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it\u0027s very much a \u003Cem\u003Enice-to-have\u003C/em\u003E since most people only use one install, and those of us who use 2..n saves rarely have that much storage issues with the resulting bloat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-29T17:17:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2016 05:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Curveball Anders\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EGramar\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"officialmugi","CreatedById":147322,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-29T17:51:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use Realism Overhaul, it is one of the things that has kept me playing this game as I have lost interest in the stock game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hendrack","CreatedById":142754,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-29T17:55:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStock with stuff like RemoteTech, USI Life support to spice things up.
