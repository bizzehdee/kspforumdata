With\u00A0a gravity assist (or assists) from Eve\u00A0that number comes down, but then you have to try and time the launch and multiple encounters with moving targets which is arguably even harder. Landing, Tylo obviously because of the orbital velocity you need to brake off just using rockets, and getting back from is Eve without a doubt, although coming back from Laythe could also be challenging due to how deep inside Jool\u2019s gravity well it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ShuttlePilot","CreatedById":209278,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-09T11:39:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E Player, but for stock, my opinion is that the hardest destination would be a tour of the whole Kerbol system. Basically shoot for Kerbol itself and then visit all of the planets with it\u0027s moons. Any delta-V possible in the game is not even enough to do that.

Kerbalism, among other things, adds radiation belts, and laythe is deep inside jool\u0027s ones, so that while getting there is no harder than usual, getting a crew to laythe and running away before the radiations kill them is quite difficult\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-04-09T14:18:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/09/2021 02:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EApril 9, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by king of nowhere\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-09T16:47:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223951411\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022201560\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221617945929\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002264714\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gargamel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, Gargamel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSurface skimming Kerbol encounter. \u00A0 \u00A0 Insane \u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E to get there, and you\u2019ll probably melt before you do. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake a Jool encounter, then you can slide down to kerbol\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-10T16:27:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for ur responses.
