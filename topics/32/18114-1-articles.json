Goals, objectives, requirements, plans... all those things change as you advance in the project. You discover that some things work better than planned and that others don\u0027t. Some things that seemed cool in 0.15 might actually make things more complicated or less fun in 0.17 and have to be scrapped or redesigned. Some stuff is added, other stuff is removed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd sometimes, a dev says something at one point in the development cycle that is no longer true or relevant at a later point.
