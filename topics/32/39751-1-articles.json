I\u0027m fairly new to the game, so I feel that many of the challenges are beyond my skill level. I thought it would be interesting if some of the veteran players made a simple series of challenges to introduce newer players to challenges as well as guide them to different things to try and share ideas on how to do them. For example, one of them could be the fuel efficiency to Kerbin Orbit challenge, and others could be challenges involving the lightest craft to land 2 Kerbals on a certain object or whatnot. It would put beginners in challenges where they could feel competitive, and also put them in a position where veteran players could offer pointers without the players having to ask a specific question\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blacksheep1775","CreatedById":46759,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T00:45:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022corrylb19\u0022 data-cite=\u0022corrylb19\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m fairly new to the game, so I feel that many of the challenges are beyond my skill level.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue story! I went over to the challenges forum to maybe get some new goals in mind. I read through a couple then laughed and went back to General KSP Discussion. All the ones I looked at were entirely too advanced. Hopefully somewhere down the line there will be some official challenge stuff in the game A.K.A. achievements, trophies, stuff like that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"acealeam","CreatedById":61964,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T00:54:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, it would help to know what you\u0027re capable of.

I recently discovered them and am trying to go through them in order. The earliest challenges (over a year old, now) are not quite so challenging any more, as the game has grown since them. You can ramp the level of challenge up or down by deciding how closely to follow the spirit of the challenge (e.g., whether to use the more-recently added parts or mods).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough, the challenges that involve particular Easter eggs, such as week 4, can be difficult when the recent updates put them underground!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a list of past challenges here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/zfhn0/all_weekly_challenges/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/zfhn0/all_weekly_challenges/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
