Since every wing surface generates lift, if that surface encounters a moment wherein there is no longer any \u0022wind\u0022 passing underneath it (say, via steep angle of attack), that surface will stall. At the moment of stall, no matter what attitude your aircraft is in, it will start to descend, which can be deadly at low altitudes and if your aircraft is heavy. With lighter aircraft however, it\u0027s enjoyable to exploit this to enable your craft to perform a lot of nice aerobatic maneuvers. So I made a video to show you how easy it is to do stunts around KSC now. Mind you that I\u0027m using joysticks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/DIe55Qsd3OQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E \u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, the aerodynamic effects (such as approaching stall moments) do have audible and visible effects. For instance, when doing a very hard \u0022break turn\u0022 (this is pulling on the stick while banked left or right), you would hear a low-wooshing sound, and if you have camera shake effects turned on, there is a marked increase in the camera shake. While this is really cool, I still wish a STALL HORN or BEEP, or Bitching Betty (WARNING! STALL!) would sound hehe. It also turns out that since some engines\u0027 gimballing have been increased, the standard Jet Engine is now effectively one capable of Thrust Vectoring like the Su-37 and the F-22 Raptor, and aircraft at low speeds which uses this engine can perform maneuvers that the real world aircraft can do as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome might say that these might not have any practical value anyway, but as a flight simulation enthusiast, I really like the new aerodynamic effects in stock KSP now (I was never a FAR user, because I play mostly stock).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T15:53:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI made my first jet for new aero yesterday while recoding a Career Mode 1.0 Let\u0027s Play.
