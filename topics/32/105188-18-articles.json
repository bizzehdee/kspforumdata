As experienced players, we can work around these issues. We know just firing the jet engine will mark the contract completed, even without intakes. We know we can empty boosters and firing them will still complete the contract. These workarounds are unknown to new players, however, and can make the game very frustrating early on. The lack of science and illogical tech tree is a pain too.\n\nVery much this. How can Career be expected to train a new player if they don\u0027t know how to use the system yet, let alone work around its inaccuracies?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T16:07:01Z","Content":"Sandbox is good for that ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"m4inbrain","CreatedById":108770,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T16:16:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Sandbox is good for that ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIn all other games i know of, sandbox is \u0022the endgame\u0022.

I bet you alot of money that nobody would complain if the career actually had a learning curve instead of a wall. You don\u0027t need to make the career easy (which is what you imply that i said, which is obviously not what i actually said). You need to make it accessible. As i said somewhere else, my girlfriend (gamer, not rocket scientist) gave up on KSP after 1.0. Saying \u0022it\u0027s KSP\u0022 isn\u0027t even an argument, it\u0027s a game. The developers want to make money, and for that you need decent reviews. \n\nAnd just as a sidenote, since you seem to have very selective reading: most of what *i* read about the career is actually not positive. Starting from a completely ilogical techtree (and people are unisono there, so no \u0022most people like it\u0022), to the said learning wall, to ilogical contracts - well.\n\nWe\u0027re not talking features like aero etc - we\u0027re talking about the career and accessability.

In just the two days since 1.0 came out I\u0027ve already started and aborted a few careers because of the progression wall in the early game making the beginning a grind. I think the sweet spot is when you do your first few Mun landings and interplanetary probes, but after that it basically becomes sandbox. Career still really needs some work.\n\nOn another note, has anyone seen/heard anything about the ability to customize the upgradeable buildings?
