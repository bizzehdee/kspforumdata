For starters, Laythe has an atmosphere which allows you to areocapture directly from a Jool flyby into a Laythe orbit without having to spend a ton of fuel, or aerocapture at Jool. In addition, Laythe has strong gravity (as strong as Tylo) which makes it a prime target for gravity assists. You can also perform both a gravity assist AND an aerobrake to change your orbit in ways a regular gravity assist couldn\u0027t. This makes Laythe an incredibly useful planet for correcting inclined, hyperbolic Jool flyby orbits into Jool equatorial orbits. As mentioned before, Laythe also has oxygen in its atmosphere which means that you can use KSP\u0027s incredibly overpowered jet engines to land/lift heavy payloads with minimum fuel (not saying that this is a bad thing, I\u0027m guilty of it too). On top of all of that, Laythe is the most science rich celestial body in the Kerbol System. So there, Laythe OP volvo pls nerf.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite all this, I can\u0027t like Laythe as much as Pol. There\u0027s just something mysterious and captivating about Pol...

Laythe is pretty and the 02 atmosphere is very intriguing (and useful), but its hard to take off from and has a habit of eating my ships and kerbals Eve-style. It would probably be my favorite if I went there more, but every ship I send to Jool tends to get enticed by the siren song of Vall and lands there instead.
