For example, there are many planes which fly well but have problems with takeoff because the lift is too small or the thrust is too low, resulting in the runway being too short.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this topic, we will discuss the various possibilities of Takeoff Assist Systems (TAS) and their uses. Takeoff Assist Systems are any systems that are used to help the plane to smoothly and evenly traverse the planned runway distance, to shorten the runway distance needed to safely leave the ground, to allow the plane to safely and smoothly and quickly leave the ground and to prevent failure during the first moments of flight and while gaining altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EList of TAS systems:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) Takeoff assist engines or boosters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes, the plane is too weak to get off the ground with the runway length avaliable from the stock runway or from the modded runway which the craft is supposed to take off from. This may be caused by the plane having not enough lift or too small wings or by the plane having not enough thrust. In this case, engines or boosters (liquid, solid or jet) are engaged for the duration of the takeoff, which support the plane with additional thrust that is unneeded in cruise flight but may be vital while getting off the ground, accelerating and gaining altitude. The engines can either be reusable and be refueled after landing to prepare the next takeoff, or be jettisoned after leaving the ground to remove unneeded weight and drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWIP\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Levelord","CreatedById":57711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T13:10:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat about VTOL engines?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DunaRocketeer","CreatedById":103193,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T13:26:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve though about take-off assist, but I usually solve these sorts of problems with canards and/or making the nose gear a little taller than the rear landing gear.

I know this doesn\u0027t quite map 1:1 with KSP, but it\u0027s a point of reference. Here\u0027s my process:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen unable to get off the runway, try holding full nose up control to see if your craft can rotate (try not to blow it up). If not, try moving your landing gear closer to your CG (should be slightly behind the CG for tricycle gear) or adding more pitch control surfaces. If so, try taller landing gear to give your craft more AoA to achieve more lift or more wing to produce more lift with the AoA you can achieve. I rarely end up adding thrust for takeoff reasons alone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
