The station had it\u0027s own engine and plenty of fuel, and was intended to be put into a nice, high orbit or potentially do some plane changes. Jeb (being the crazy type) was too impatient for John Kitzgerald Kennedy to make his speech about going to the Mun, and, without any authorization, went straight for a Mun encounter, from LKO, with a space station. He got the periapse down to 5km above the surface, and happily made science along the way. Then, out of fuel, found himself en route to a solar orbit after some attempted return maneuvers. So, thinking quickly, he ditched the station in the return pod, pushed the FIRE button on the retrorockets, and found himself a few moments later still on an escape trajectory, albeit very close to a high orbit. He then used the classic Manley Kerman maneuver of pushing against the capsule, which worked well at first, but after a thruster misfired, he was spinning with just 5% fuel, going away from the ship, and in an attempt to reorient himself, became stranded. He was, however, in a stable high orbit above his home planet, and is sitting there, waiting for rescue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johno","CreatedById":1491,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T02:29:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently back in the Kerbonauts building, having just returned from being the first Kerb on Minimus.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neshma","CreatedById":93751,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T04:46:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally home, though somewhat medically compromised as depicted in my recent rescue mission! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59190-The-daring-rescue-of-Jebediah-stranded-first-Kerbal-in-space%21-%28Pic-Heavy%29?p=795688#post795688p\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe daring rescue of Jebediah, stranded first Kerbal in space!
