I\u0027m Kerbeorge (George) and I\u0027m new to the community. I\u0027ve bashed KSP for years, and as a hobby I\u0027ve done 3D design for quite a long time. My skills with modelling / texturing etc far surpass my modding abilities so I figured I would see if any capable modders would want to discuss\u00A0 a collaboration to create some great new content for KSP. Hopefully to commemorate KSP\u0027s upcoming 10th birthday. I would love for people to jump into this topic with ideas they might want to see in game. Hope you are all well!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-14T19:39:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTbh for parts mods, the modelling and texturing is like 99% of it unless you\u2019re adding special things like tracking the sun for example that need coding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you\u2019ve done the modelling/texturing it\u2019s just a case of importing and exporting to/from unity which can be learnt in 10 mins and then doing the cfg but just copy from an existing part and tweak accordingly (5 mins).
