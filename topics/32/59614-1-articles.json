I generally have a skipper as my service module engine to get the rendezvous. I kill that for a ring of 4-6 rockomax radials once i have that first intercept in map view since thrust is no longer my friend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider braking engines for large unwieldy modules.... I sometimes have an issue turning my module over its own length in a decent amount of time to perform gentle braking thrusts. If you overdo it you are then flipping again to put more speed back on. A ring of 4 orange rocko radials mounted backwards by the top of the module lets you make a braking burn while pointed prograde like a beefy RCS. I set the ring mentioned in the first tip to activate engines on action group 1(and skipper off) then both rings to toggle on action group 2. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis lets me hit 1 as soon as i have a decent intercept, and then 2 toggles between forward and reverse \u0027gear\u0027 for the fine-tuning. From 10m however im almost always pure RCS. A very very heavy module benefits again from the setup i mentioned where RCS is too weak to do anything in a reasonable time-frame.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeneral rule of thumb: Move really slowly for most of the close-in work. You have a timewarp and less than 1ms is just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArmchairGravy","CreatedById":78526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-11T10:30:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDocking is the hardest thing to master, but once you\u0027ve done a couple you\u0027ll know what to do.
