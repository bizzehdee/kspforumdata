It\u0027s why many, if not most mods work across Win/Mac/Linux without any additional mucking about.\n\nThe problem is that the PS4 is very much a locked down toy rather than a general purpose computer, and that\u0027s the way Sony like it. Allowing anybody to just shove a mono assembly/DLL into KSPS4 would be tantamount to allowing arbitrary code to run on the PS4. I\u0027m not sure what their per-title sandboxing is like. If the only thing a mod can see is KSP\u0027s \u0022sandbox\u0022 so to speak, then I can\u0027t see there being any massive security issues for Sony.\n\nIf however, a mod can ../../../../ its way across the filesystem and other similar wonderfulness, then expect there to be a big fat NOPE to any modding at all.\n\nOf course, this is all speculation.

Saying, \u0022I don\u0027t approve of this change because this and this and that\u0022 *should not be criticized*, as long as it is not meant to do anything but to improve the game we know and love. Often, though, the criticism SQUAD faces goes a bit beyond anything anyone could call \u0027helpful.\u0027\n\nThe problem seems to arise when:\n\n**1)** Some not-quite-level-minded soul comes on and starts loudly complaining. This is quite common amongst this Forum. It is also quite common in most other forums.\n\n**2)** A loud minority of people (or sometimes even a louder majority) agrees and starts parroting some of the earlier statements made. This is generally propagated by the misconception\\* that SQUAD listens if the entire community violently protests, whereas it won\u0027t listen if we make gentle statements about fixing KSP.\n\n\\*I\u0027m not entirely sure that the above is really a misconception: if maybe fifteen people asked politely to bring back the Round-8, would it have been done?

Forum users can say pretty much whatever they like about a topic, up until it conflicts with forum rules, and needs moderation. The only way I see to reduce 1-2-3 is for those types of people to change, or heavy-handed moderation. Heavy moderation leads to lots of arguing about edge cases. I don\u0027t think either is happening, so absent other options I\u0027m not thinking of, I don\u0027t see anything changing. \n\nIf the forum has 1000 active users online, and 50% decide to post about something... even if all is written calmly and reasonably, that is a lot of posts. Developers start wishing for a TL;DR, and probably stop reading and go back to trying to make the game better. \n\n**PS4**. There. I\u0027m on topic ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n###\n\nOK, I can do better than that. Almost a TL;DR for the thread.\n\nThe PS4 worries and negative opinions show a slight tug of war between:\n\n \u0022this is a cash grab, a sell-out\u0022 (as if: tons more people will buy it now, maybe Sony dumped a bucket of money on Squad.) \n\n- and -\n\n- worries that the port will be bad, (\u0027KSP is too complex to hand over to a primarily mobile developer\u0027),\n- PC development will suffer,\n- it can\u0027t be nearly as successful on consoles as it\u0027s been on PC/Mac/Linux,\n- too many keyboard commands to work well on a console controller,\n- mod difficulties - (\u0027the game I enjoy on PC is mainly thanks to great mods\u0027),\n\nThe \u0022cash grab\u0022 opinion seems to be in the minority, the others (which point out problems with the easy money theory, if that\u0027s what \u0022cash grab\u0022 means) have a lot more they can write about. The truth will probably end up somewhere in the middle, as it normally does. I\u0027ve written in other posts that I wish Squad success in this endeavor. Any additional income, if wisely reinvested in KSP development, should help make KSP better for everyone.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T04:27:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 04:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by basic.syntax**"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T04:38:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It is expected to come to PS4 as well: [http://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-4-pc-mods-will-be-playable-on-ps4-eventual/1100-6428239/](http://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-4-pc-mods-will-be-playable-on-ps4-eventual/1100-6428239/)\n\u003E Is the delay between XB1 mods and PS4 mods an exclusivity thing(microsoft paying bethesda so mods come to XB1 first?), or is it because the framework for a sony modding system is not in place?

Most of us who are skeptical about this project are worried that it will COST them money instead of profiting from it.\n\nI have so far only seen a few people ever mentioning they want a console port. This type of game is the kind of game that rarely do good on consoles and the controls and lack of mods will also make this game very limited compared to the pc version and that is if they somehow make it even run properly on such low end hardware.\n\nWe are also skeptical because the company behind the port has absolutely no trackrecord except for very simple and shady looking mobile games.\n\nSome of the games shown on the website even looks like they have been just reskinned and sold as a different game even though the gameplay looks the same.\n\nThe type of games they make is something you could easily make in gamemaker with no coding skills at all.\n\nEdit: I am not saying this is proof or anything that they are not capable of porting the game, but I think it is perfectly ok to be skeptical and critical when they have no track record with advanced games like this. I think the only thing that will help us relax a bit is them showing us that the game runs and that the controller actually works with editor, UI and things like action groups.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Sony have also said that mod support is coming for FFXIV:H (shortly after launch was the timeframe), so it sounds like some kind of mod framework is coming for PS4 (I doubt it would be exclusive to FFXIV)\n\nEither way it will be limited to mods that does not need any extra code/dlls to function. So it will still be a heavily stripped down version even if by some miracle they get it working as good with the ps4 controller.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T04:50:43Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 04:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by boxman**"},{"CreatedByName":"mordin86","CreatedById":29223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T07:17:09Z","Content":"No idea why would Squad do that.
