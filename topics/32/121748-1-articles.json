I knew the glitch but I did not know that a clipped decoupler will trigger the explosion. I found this out when I was testing my mobile base for other planets on kerbin I opened a service bay and the doors went into a clipped pod and the thing asploded instantly.

Then I laid a couple of them down near each other and they blew up. post thoughts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EladDv","CreatedById":118368,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T17:34:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA) i know that Arvin (Zamonivar) have created a Tank mine out of that - when it gets over it you press space and it explodes sending the tank(MBTs 25-30 mT) into the air up to 10 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E Pictures or even better videos please colour me interested\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T17:53:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought of that.
