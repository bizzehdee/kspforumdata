I want to land on Mun about 15 times (one landing for each group of students), and maybe (if I had enough time) to go back to Kerbin with my KWRocketry based rocket. But there is a trouble - what exactly should I present? In my actual plan I would like to say few words about orbiting (I\u0027m thinking, that there will be many kids, who still thinks, that flying in space is all about going up and then you\u0027re magically hanging above the earth), space programs (for example diffirences between Apollo program and mine), type of fuels, technical things etc. As I am in physics class I also decided to do some calculations, like escape velocity for Kerbin, work and power of rocket.

In a mission to the Mun, that would probably be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The gravity turn. Going into orbit doesn\u0027t involve going \u003Cem\u003Eup\u003C/em\u003E nearly as much as it does going \u003Cem\u003Esideways\u003C/em\u003E. You just need to go up high enough to clear the surface and the atmosphere. Explaining this during a launch will teach one of the most basic orbital mechanics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The transfer. Getting from Kerbin to the Mun doesn\u0027t mean you point your nose there and burn, it means pushing your apoapsis out far enough that you\u0027ll catch up the Mun. You will have demonstrated the basic apoapsis/periapsis mechanic during launch so it will make sense when you explain the transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The capture. Once you\u0027re over the Mun, you need to pull your apoapsis in so you stay in orbit there. Again it\u0027s the same basic mechanics but now you\u0027re orbiting a different body. You may want to mention that KSP\u0027s model of spheres of influence is an abstraction and that in reality the \u0022switch\u0022 would be a smooth transition, but don\u0027t go into n-body physics or people will zone out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. \u003Cem\u003EIf you have the time\u003C/em\u003E, do the landing. Explain that it\u0027s basically the same as the launch but in reverse - you\u0027re slowing down your sideways velocity mostly and spending relatively little time going straight down. Then run a happy little Kerbal around on the surface and plant a flag, that should make a great ending.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure you could talk about thrust-to-weight ratios, delta-v, turn gradients, free return trajectories and what not... But I\u0027d keep it simple. Basic orbital mechanics are almost completely unknown to most people and KSP represents them really nicely with those expanding ellipses on the screen so they\u0027re easy to understand. People will feel like they really learned something new \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E they got to watch flaming rockets and little green men.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEdit\u003C/strong\u003E: I wouldn\u0027t bother returning unless you have a lot of time.
