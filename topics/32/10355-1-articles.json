I came up with something I enjoy listening to while playing so much, I couldn\\\u0027t help but share it with you all. So load up itunes or whatever you like, put this on, and launch some rockets.\n\nI tried to capture the majesty and quirky humor of the game at once and I don\\\u0027t think I did too bad a job.\n\nWithout further ado, I give you \u0027The Few, The Proud, The Green\u0027.\n\nFeedback appreciated!"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-09T07:29:50Z","Content":"Hey, that\\\u0027s pretty good!

I currently have it on loop; it makes the whole experience going to the Mun that much more epic...although it was inadvertently hilarious to have this music on while I was bouncing all over the place trying to land..!"},{"CreatedByName":"Panichio","CreatedById":2858,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-09T12:11:45Z","Content":"Very nice, I like it.

I\\\u0027m not sure you should stop playing Benny Hill, because that pretty much encapsulates every time I try to land, at least...\n\nI\\\u0027m presently working on the next track in a series, an entire suite of music intended to capture the entirety of a there-and-back munar excursion:\n\n1. The Few, the Proud, the Green (launch)\n\n2. Moonrise over Kerbin (orbit)\n\n3. Onward and Upward (Trans-munar Injection)\n\n4. The Descent \n\n5. Surface of Mun\n\n6. The Journey Home/Splashdown\n\nA little ambitious, but what the hey, it\\\u0027s summer and I have some spare time."},{"CreatedByName":"iamwearingpants","CreatedById":27,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-10T00:19:34Z","Content":"Holy crap, you rock.
