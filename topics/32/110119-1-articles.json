Interim solution: Porkjet\u0027s stock fuel switch mod, or Nertea\u0027s Cryo Engines (which also adds arguably overpowered engines to the game; I love it)."},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T17:01:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E nukes have the worst ISP while in atmo so your high atmo to LKO transition would not work you still need regular rockets for the final push, once your in space though\n\nPSA: the atmo/vacuum ISP thing is not, RPT NOT a binary affair. Nukes work well in the upper atmosphere (or on Duna, for that matter).
