I was just hoping to strike up a discussion about your guys\u0027 preferred methods of lithobraking to decrease speed for landing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI usually use a combination of tactics -- connecting with the surface at proper angles so as to detatch spent fuel tanks (for combined mass reduction and deceleration), and angling the ship on initial high-speed landing so as to divert the command module (which usually comes free) into a more upward trajectory which will be cancelled out over time by gravity. I have not yet successfully used this method to perform an unpowered landing on any worlds without atmosphere, though I did come very close to an unpowered landing on Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts or suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T16:31:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve did it on Gilly and Minmus with some damage. Never on purpose. If there are enough stages, you can turn retrograde and falldown a huge mountain (essentially still orbiting), slowly touching the ground. Kinetic energy of the craft is tranferred to the last stage which explodes and you can end up with your lander rolling down the hill.

They tried to Lithobreak on Mun. The result was somewhat underwhelming because they had little to no control of where it would stop and it just continued bouncing almost at infinum. That being said, I think on a world with an atmosphere to slow you down somewhat it would make more sense. Still, the reason you see a dispraportionate amount of guides on Lithobreaking vs. Not-Lithobreaking is because, in KSP, it is often more difficult to build something that will not blow up when it crashes than it is to just make sure it doesn\u0027t crash in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T17:21:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI stand corrected, there actually are some lithobraking guides out there.
