KSP\u0027s patches up until now have just come when they are ready, but 1.0 seems like it will be a different kettle of fish. I believe they will have a release date that they will set pretty close to when they are ready to go. I figure maybe a week or so prior to that date we (the general public) will be told.\n\nI am curious what others think. One, will there be a release date given and, two, how far out from the release date might we be told about it? On a related note, did the asteroid mission get a release date?\n\nSpeculate away.\n\nC"},{"CreatedByName":"Greenfire32","CreatedById":36705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T23:02:03Z","Content":"I\u0027m thinking it\u0027ll be exactly like all the other releases.
