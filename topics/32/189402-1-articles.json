For example, what I am wanting to do is to track all asteroids, but I only want the ones with Kerbin intercepts within about 5 days to be visible so that I can capture or explore them. If I just remove the ones that have intercepts out at like 200 days, they will wander away if I just stop tracking them. Another question/feature would be to have the ability to split the asteroid group into classes. For instance, I have a mission to capture a previously unmolested Class A asteroid. I would like to filter such that only Class A asteroids are visible, but all the others that I am tracking can be toggled off like satellites or rovers or whatnot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. I am currently tracking 121 asteroids. This filtering would be very much appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.P.S.\u00A0 A somewhat related problem I am having is timing launches to minimize my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E. It would be excellent to have some sort of timer counting down to let you know when \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E (or another launch site) is coplanar with the asteroids orbit, much like you do when trying to intercept. My method thus far has been to maneuver my screen to get the Mun orbit lines collinear and the asteroid orbit lines collinear. This approximates the fact that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E lies on the equator and that the Mun\u0027s orbit is coplanar with the Kerbin equator. Having lined up the Mun orbit lines and the asteroid orbit lines in such a way, it is a matter of waiting until \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is at the virtual intesection of these two pairs of collinear lines. It just simple geometry. However, many times it is difficult to get this timing correct since the view distance to get both pairs of collinear lines on the screen puts the camera view very far from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and the crosshairs. It would be nice to have a timer of some sort to be able to time this intersection event and then up to the pilot to get the correct launch angle to get a starting orbit which is pretty close to coplanar with the asteroid orbit. Needless to say, this ultimately maximizes the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E available to manipulate the asteroid since very little \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E is wasted on large \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E orbital adjustments.
