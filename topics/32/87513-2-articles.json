These are very good additions sorely needed to core gameplay. To me the logical extension of this would be to include features from Kerbal Alarm clock (very well done), Kerbal Engineer (also very well done), and maybe RasterPropMonitors (really improves immersion).

The point is, that, KSP is a game where you run your space program. Until now, if you play stock, (and stock is good, already saw many people doing amazing things with stock parts) there aren\u0027t many options for a strategy game in terms of running a space program. So, by this logic, the game should be accurate in Newton laws and the same time it shouldn\u0027t ? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know Squad have a plan laid out for the development of the game, they must follow it, or at least, follow it 80% of time. The interesting thing is the imagination of what people consider to be realism or not. I bought the game because I want realism, stock KSP do not provide me that. Besides the so called \u0022physics\u0022 that we already know they are working of that part, there are more things I consider realism. Life support exist in any space mission. People have breath, eat, and do other things that probably get censured here \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E , thats why I use mods. I\u0027m not saying I do not like the stock game, or that is not good, but for me it lacks content and many other things.

Everyone should play the game the way they like more. I\u0027m just saying the game should provide more options for the ones that want more realism and a harder game. The 0.25 was a big thing for me, it added something already missing, difficulty levels and customization. The Administration building also was a great implementation for the ones (like me) that like to play career mode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand the game needs to have a balance for hardcore players, casual players and, lol, crazy players that wants to blow up stuff and trow Kerbals in the air!.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skeevy","CreatedById":110477,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T13:08:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t like that there was no mention of Unity 5.
