You really don\u0027t need more than 5 crew for ages but you have to upgrade to have 12 just to be able to go EVA.

The sub-orbital payouts are mostly sane, giving about 15k reward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2 - Three tiers of buildings is not enough. The jumps are too huge and the costs are too high as a result to go from one tier to the next. There needs to be six tiers and the last 2 tiers should be mostly optional. On normal mode it should cost 10k, 20k, 50k, 100k, 200k, 500k for the tiers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the VAB/SPH, that would mean part count limits of (30, 60, 90, 150, 300, unlimited). For the runway / launchpad mass limits of (20t, 40t, 80t, 200t, 400t, unlimited).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
