If you don\u0027t know it yet, give it a try. But be warned: It includes a build help HUD, that will calculate dV and TWR values for you, so if you don\u0027t want to spoil the fun of playing with spreadsheets while designing your rockets, don\u0027t use it or disable the build help HUD feature in the VOID settings. Also, the in-flight HUD shows you the remaining dV at any time, kind of removing the thrill of not knowing if a mission still has enough fuel to makes it back home. Furthermore, you don\u0027t need to use IVA any more to see the radar altitude reading, since VOID can show it in the HUD (also for unmanned probes, making landing those significantly easier). Of course you can hide this info as well, if you like.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T10:04:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEaster Eggs should be actual things I think, things that are fun to find and when you look at them you think \u0022Huh, that\u0027s cool I know that from whatever\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMovie references are a good example \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commissioner Tadpole","CreatedById":91993,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T22:26:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEaster Eggs should be actual things I think, things that are fun to find and when you look at them you think \u0022Huh, that\u0027s cool I know that from whatever\u0022.\u003Cp\u003EMovie references are a good example \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETechnically, those are \u003Ca href=\u0022http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EShout-Outs\u003C/a\u003E, not Easter Eggs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-30T01:07:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScansat.v8 on my .25 install says there\u0027s one anomaly on Minmus, but it\u0027s up north on a Highland slope... if it\u0027s even correct.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
