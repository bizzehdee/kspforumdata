Like on any invisionfree powered forum ever. Makes the dots under your name green and you can get more of them. The more green dots, the more rep people have given a user. Unfortunately nobody on this forum ever seems to use it. We\u0027re also missing the ability to give negative rep, which is retarded. You also can\u0027t give rep in the off topic board, which is even stupider than no negative rep.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"flightmaster","CreatedById":32617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T04:34:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool, cheers!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cykyrios","CreatedById":17639,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T05:48:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuestion was answered, thread locked per user request \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
