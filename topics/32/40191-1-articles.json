KSP, too, is a fairly new game - technically it\u0027s not even feature complete and we\u0027re not out of early access yet. So if KSP was entered into a Humble Bundle, it would probably be a tier 3 game, with a fairly high minimum bid. $15-$20 sound like pretty good numbers, since that\u0027s what most discounted sales price the game at.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rowsdower","CreatedById":91811,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-20T20:03:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat would you want to see KSP paired with if it ever were to happen?
