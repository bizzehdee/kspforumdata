A pressure difference is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E in fact what causes lift. It\u0027s commonly taught, but it\u0027s incorrect -- go on, look it up. I had to, after making the same mistake many times. Lift is created because the curved upper surface \u003Cem\u003Edeflects air downwards\u003C/em\u003E, and by the Second Law of Motion, that results in an upward force on the wing. It works because air clings to the surface of the wing, a bit of an odd quirk of fluid dynamics.\u003Cp\u003EIf they \u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C/em\u003E work on pressure difference, stunt planes wouldn\u0027t work, since both lower and upper wing surfaces have the same curved surface (so that the plane can fly just as well upside down).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s actually quite correct that the classic aerofoil shape generates lift via differential pressure, just it\u0027s not the only way of designing a wing. Classic non-aerobatic, non-supersonic planes (e.g. big passenger \u0026amp; transport planes) make significant use of it to generate far more lift than mere deflection alone could generate. It\u0027s taught by the RAF, amongst other people, and I\u0027m quite inclined to trust their opinion on the matter. Stunt planes and supersonic planes are very much a different case.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Amram","CreatedById":8067,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T07:43:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eim just going to leave this here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://home.fnal.gov/~dcc/lift.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EA Physical description of Flight, David Anderson(\u003Cem\u003EFermi National Accelerator Laboratory\u003C/em\u003E) and Scott Eberhardt(\u003Cem\u003EDept. of Aeronautics and Astronautics, University of Washington\u003C/em\u003E)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETake the case of a Cessna 172, which is a popular, high-winged, four-seat airplane.....\u003Cp\u003E....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the Popular Description of lift, the wing would develop only about 2% of the needed lift at 65mph(104km/h), which is \u0022slow flight\u0022 for this airplane.

The theory then invokes Bernoulli\u0027s equation to explain lower pressure on the upper surface and higher pressure on the lower surface resulting in a lift force. The error in this theory involves the specification of the velocity on the upper surface. In reality, the velocity on the upper surface of a lifting wing is much higher than the velocity which produces an equal transit time. If we know the correct velocity distribution, we can use Bernoulli\u0027s equation to get the pressure, then use the pressure to determine the force.

Electric flaps took several seconds to deploy, but I could change my flaps in a fraction of a second. The VGs enhanced flap effectiveness hugely, to the point where I could essentially turn low-speed lift on and off like a light switch and with practice, I could plant the wheels within a foot of my target almost every time.
