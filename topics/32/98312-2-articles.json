My only concern is the parameter constants perhaps being skewed, to keep stock parts semi-compatible (but then again, in a way they already backtracked twice on the compatibility promise: First because of the sheer scope of part rebalancing, since it means parts can be biased towards new aero, instead of the other way around. Second, because they just dropped the bomb that some stock craft - while still flyable - might actually lose some of their abilities - like reaching orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther topic: Heatshields. I know many people want them, but i\u0027m not really a fan of this. Extra parts add more complexity to crafts, and there are already too many stock parts in the game - the part catalog needs simplification, i.e. via procedurals. For the stock game, i\u0027d prefer an \u0022unrealistic\u0022 reentry-heat system that doesn\u0027t require extra parts, but instead simply is about angles and speeds. Okay, a global craft-wide property called \u0022extra thermal shielding\u0022 might be an idea - basically trading weight for extra reentry safety. But extra parts.... not really a fan of that in stock. On the upside, this technically will probably just be a variable/module in the partfiles, so i could just go and remove the parts, then add the module to all stockparts with an MM configfile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Anyways, things seem to be shaping up well overall.
