If you can re-board the rover then it sorts the phantom forces out, but you gotta catch it first! With the breaks on, the forces will still make it twitch and move a bit, but you can still easily get back into it. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI had a hilarious incident with a rover I was testing at KSC. After repairing a wheel it started driving off in a large circular path, with Jeb in hot pursuit. After a few futile attempts to catch up with it, I tried to head it off as it came round for another pass. Turns out running in front of an out of control vehicle isn\u0026#39;t an effective way of stopping it! The rover just mowed Jeb down and carried on oblivious. \u003Cbr\u003E\n(Found out later that switching to the out of control rover will also sort the phantom forces out, but that\u0026#39;s much less fun than trying to chase it down).\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xiej","CreatedById":152168,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T21:20:15Z","Content":"\nSame here.
