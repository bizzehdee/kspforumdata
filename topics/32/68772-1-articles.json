Watching everyday new bunch of threads about pure fantasies of people who think about what it will be for them, already creating missions around the incoming update, asking already for parts following the new size(s), crafts using those parts, and so on... just make me feel very disgusted by this attitude which seems to have put an incredible amount of pressure upon Squad team shoulders, make them released an unfinished product. I know it\u0027s again an early alpha/beta/whatever release but it\u0027s appear to be less polished than 0.23, with what was appear to be some/many balance issues (from many of those users perspective) and some/many bugs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe funny thing is that is mostly the same people whose asked (not directly) for the 0.23.5 to be released ASAP, when they have it, they complain about engine balance and tons of bugs !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShoot me if you wish but I truly believe if you are one of those people who was absolutely shaking out of patience to get this ARM \u0022patch\u0022, KSP is not for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are people doing the unfinished/drafty career mode in 2 missions, what was the goal here ? You complete it, you have everything available and so what ? You get bored, you have no aim, no purpose, nothing to do with the game, you are just waiting for your new shot of things to do, again and again, like any addicts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, players have been fed those past years with almost only GTA style sandbox game, which are in fact quite poorly designed overall because apart from the missions and some repetitive activities, you have nothing fun to do in the long run, and while you have the narrative to support you, it\u0027s ok, you can play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut when you complete the story, it\u0027s game over, you get bored, you need the next release to start over the exact same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(it\u0027s the same with all title from GTA3, Saints Row serie, Red Faction Guerilla, and others).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, I really hope KSP will never become something like that, the sandbox mode, at least, need to remain as it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t claim to know every single game released since Pong, but IMHO, I\u0027ve only seen one similar sandbox game in video game history, strangely, it\u0027s in space too: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://gamesdbase.com/game/commodore-64/echelon.aspx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEchelon\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBriefly, in this 3D wireframe \u0022simulation\u0022 game you have to decypher a code with the help of clues you find in many places around the Isis planet, you can activate fighting on demand, to explore peacefully or fight like hell, there is also shooting range to practice and many things to discover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same angle is used in KSP as I understand it, you can do whatever you want, however you want, at your own pace.

Without someone/something telling them \u0022do this, do that\u0022 like in GTA style game, they\u0027re stuck like a powerless robot or a frozen terminator.

They are, for all intents and purposes, \u003Cem\u003Epress\u003C/em\u003E. Think of their experimentals access as a review copy. They are \u0022paid\u0022 (through the revenue on their work) to promote the game, just like, say, IGN would be. Fundamentally, there\u0027s no difference, aside from the fact that \u003Cem\u003Eenthusiast press\u003C/em\u003E is indeed people who are closer to the consumer side of things (as opposed to an outside perspective).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExperimental testing has also, for a long time, been part of KSP\u0027s development. The experimentals team contributes detailed issue reports and checks out every tiny piece of the update while the update is still in a state where it crashes on an hourly basis (and that\u0027s if you\u0027re lucky). These people bear with it and commit to the task, and that\u0027s commendable. I\u0027m sure there are also a lot of people that \u003Cem\u003Earen\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E in the experimentals team that would be able to do this as well, but at the end of the day you won\u0027t get a \u0022public experimentals\u0022 version, simply because the results are bad PR, lots of people freaking out about crashes, and in general a much more hostile environment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe experimentals team channels the good and avoids the bad, with only one downside: Other users will have to wait a bit longer to try out the new stuff.

While there must be some space given for purposes like focus and concentration, calling it an ivory tower is a bit of a misnomer. Though their individual presence may not be as prominent as it was in years past, members of the KSP team are apt to check in to see what the community\u0027s up to. There\u0027s also the hard working mod team and myself who do our best to tap the pulse of the community and make sure it\u0027s in their face.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nimbim","CreatedById":66497,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T01:45:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t get it.
