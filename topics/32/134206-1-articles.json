It goes up when you complete contracts or break records or do things that have yet to be done in that save (i.e. land on the mun for the first time). But if for example you accept a contract but fail or just don\u0027t do it before the expiration time then your reputation goes down. A lot of people thing that it is useless but actually the contracts you receive, along with\u00A0other factors, depend on this.\u00A0Hope this helps\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tourist","CreatedById":143403,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-16T02:51:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou know, if you only go out with good boys or girls, you treat them right, never kiss on a first date, you call you mother/father/favorite aunt frequently, keep you word.. then you\u0027ll get a good reputation.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"max_creative","CreatedById":159640,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-16T03:40:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny going to say how to do this on a mobile site?
