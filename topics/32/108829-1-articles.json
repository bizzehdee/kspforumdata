There was simply noone like him. But then, Valentina came along, being, too, a pilot and harbouring a pre-set badass flag, who also quickly rose to fame and got fans of her own.\n\nDespite that, the community appears to consider the two as a pair - if not romantic, then at least best friends. Am I the only one who thinks Jeb feels his reputation is in danger when Val is around? While I don\u0027t imagine the two constantly bickering, I think each would try to outdo the other to prove their \u0022superior skillz\u0022. (And I think Jeb may have some choice words for me since Val\u0027s now my craft tester)"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T22:37:52Z","Content":"I never considered Val any more special than the other orange Kerbals.
