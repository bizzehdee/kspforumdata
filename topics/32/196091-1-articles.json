At that time Kerbin was lush, filled with Jungles, and swamps, but completely devoid of any animal life. Over time, they gained distinct plant and animal traits. For example, their chlorophyll on their bodies synthesize enough glucose in order to survive, but just barely, if a kerbal conserves their energy enough by basically not moving at all, they can survive. This explains why they can sit in capsules for years without needing any life support. But they also need food for their metabolism if they expend energy by walking around. So the food kerbals are most fond of are high-sugar high-energy foods such as fruit, and later Snacks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOver time, Kerbals formed a civilization thousands of years ago, that eventually began to leave their homeworld. Over time, they colonized the solar system, leaving behind the various anomalies and monoliths in KSP. In order to signal other planets, they would use SSTV signals like the one on Duna. The civilization thrived, right up until 40,000 years ago when a large comet struck Kerbin, destroying most life on Kerbin instantly and creating the large crater. The only survivors were the kerbals on other planets and the very few that escaped into underground bunkers. The remaining planets split into factions over the few resources left to sustain their civilization, resulting in a massive interplanetary war. Various crashed ships on Kerbin and the Mun lie on the surface, relics of ancient battles. The SSTV signal sent the last distress signal 39,000 years ago, a message about the current status of the war, and one word who\u0027s meaning is now lost to the ages. Eventually, all the Kerbals killed each other, leaving the survivors on Kerbin the only ones remaining.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOver time they lost all knowledge of their technology and reverted to a primitive existence, utterly dependent on the ancient systems in the bunkers. About 20,000 years ago, Kerbin became habitable again and the automated systems in the bunkers shut down. Driven out, they gradually began their civilization, gradually rediscovering technology. By that time Kerbin was mostly covered in moss and small grass, the only plants that could survive, and small trees scattered around which is the way Kerbin looks like today. Finally, almost 20,000 years later, they had formed some semblance of nation states, around 2 dozen across Kerbin. At that point, other nations colonized the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E continent (the continent where the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is located), which finally became independent at 43,246 AC (After Great Catastrophe). Over the next 100 years, it became increasingly imperialist, attacking smaller nations while the 2 largest alliances, the Eastern and Western Union looked on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E continent declared war on all the other nations, causing a war that would last for the next century. The war began with enormous battles, echoing the previous interplanetary wars, but after around 30 years into the war, most of kerbin was destroyed and so the Great Turning Point began, causing most nations to fall into anarchy and decadence. The war dragged on, lasting for the next 70 years. Technology was gradually lost, going back another 30 years. The war now wasn\u0027t as coherent, the East and West had fallen, and now the war was various factions fighting locally for dominance. The last 3 nations, the leader made up of an island chain far away from the fighting, signed an economic and military union among themselves, calling themselves the Kerbin Peace Keeping Union. They stopped the fighting in less than 10 years, eventually the KPKU evolved into the Kerbin Federation, which encompassed the entire planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe early days of the Kerbin Federation were frought with danger. The millitary almost reached a total control of the government, breaking the various remnants and rebellions that cropped up. It took 10 years for things to settle down. Instilled with an absolute hatred of suffering, the so called \u0022Federation Generation\u0022 was born. Kerbin devoted itself to learning, embarking in failed experiments at the Second \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E Launch Site and the island Airfield, which both atrophied with lack of use. 20 years later, Jebediah and Gene together formed the Kerbal Space Program, rebuilding an old fortress into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. After wowing the globe, the KSP came under the direction of the Kerbin Science Centers, a government agency. Using their own companies to finance it, Rockomax and Jebediah\u0027s Junkyard, they embarked on a mission to explore space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhew! And there you have it folks.

Fighting is as alien to them as it is inherent to us. They almost lack even the ability to deceive and argue, but they are able to disagree. They are also quite hardy and heal quickly, so evolved a cavalier attitude to danger. \u0022The Whoopsies\u0022 is the #1 cause of death on Kerbin, and has been throughout their entire recorded history.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen they invented gunpowder, their first thought was that it makes things go up, so how high up can we shoot someone? When they found that they couldn\u0027t shoot someone up high enough to see anything new before killing them, Kerbals invented parachutes and shock plates. When they found that gunpowder just wasn\u0027t efficient enough to do much better even with the safeguards, they invented Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and the Scientific Method.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt took them a long time to figure out why some Kerbals died even though the craft rose slowly enough to not crush them, and parachuted down safely. It wasn\u0027t until they invented writing - and thought to bring a pad and pencil along - that Kerbals discovered that the air thins out as you rise. Then they invented air tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt wasn\u0027t long after that they invented space suits. Like Humans, they had figured out long before that their world was round and orbited their sun. While they had invented math late in the game in regards to rocketry, that was more due to their inventing rocketry quickly, and less due to inventing math late. To roughly compare with Humans, the first Kerbal reached space at about the time in their development that we in our development were burning down Rome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn entire industry evolved around space flight, and multiple mega-corporations spawned to create parts for ships. They competed - fairly and on merit - for the new Kerbal Space Program\u0027s attention. The Kerbals built a Space Center in a convenient spot on their equator, bought the licensing rights to a pod that could probably withstand the vacuum of space, a parachute to bring it down again, a booster with solid fuel in it (but there were rumors that a liquid version was in the works, which would make throttling and restarting engines possible) and a container to hold this green stuff they found that might react oddly in different situations. They hired a few hundred Kerbals to run the operation and 4 of those were chosen to be the pilots, engineer, and scientist for the first few missions - until they could find more to either replace them (rest in peace) or augment the ranks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, they hired you to run it all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-08-04T02:18:57Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2020 02:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Superfluous J\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James M","CreatedById":167171,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-04T03:21:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223831234\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022196091\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221596507148\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002273725\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Superfluous J\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Superfluous J said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na container to hold this green stuff they found that might react oddly in different situations\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm.

The planet was inhabited by more than a billion Kerbals, the atmosphere was thick with various greenhouse gases, and the threat of nuclear war was constant. A few of Kerbin\u0027s largest superpowers did have space programs, but no Kerbal had ever been into space, and rocket technology was entirely geared toward launching military satellites and delivering nuclear warheads. As a result, when a large asteroid on a direct collision course with Kerbin was detected, there was absolutely no way to redirect it in time. As the entire planet\u0027s population panicked, nearly every country sank a huge fraction of their resources into building underground bunkers\u00A0to hopefully save at least a fraction of their populations from doomsday.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, supplies for these bunkers were limited, and arguments between world leaders on their allocation quickly escalated into a full nuclear exchange. Consequently, Kerbin endured a double apocalypse - asteroid impact and nuclear fallout. Only a tiny fraction of Kerbin\u0027s population survived, with some bunkers being destroyed outright due to being too close to the surface or having inadequate life-support systems. The mark of Kerbin\u0027s Great Impact remains to this day in the giant crater on the planet\u0027s equator.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the survivors\u0027\u00A0remote descendants emerged from the bunkers four\u00A0thousand years later, they found a planet wiped clean of every mark of civilisation. Resolving to never repeat the mistakes of their ancestors, the Kerbals\u00A0realised that the only way to truly and permanently protect their species from complete extinction was to expand beyond Kerbin and explore space.

The way they can organize and socialize, the ways they can risk it for \u0022the greater good,\u0022 just their conduct looks like cartoonish human behavior. But it\u0027s a little deeper than their conduct. Something else about them seems decidedly human. The way they design things. I\u0027m not going to argue that humanity figured out the answers to everything and that all intelligent life follows are path because we\u0027re right. What I am going to say is that like-minded people often problem solve in similar ways. People that have similar experience, mental capacity and \u0022mental parameters\u0022 (the way they think), often will give similar answers to an issue. That\u0027s just how it works between humans. I\u0027m saying that since Kerbals produce nearly exact copies, or convincing effigies of human tech, they, in some way or on some level, do mirror humans in a mental way. What makes sense to them would make sense to us. What we think are good solutions and good approaches would be considered good by Kerbals too. They think like humans to an extent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter all, a creation is a reflection of its creator.

Everyone basically disregarded Robert Godard\u0027s rockets in spite of how revolutionary they were. The NYT even mocked him at one point. However, everyone took note when Werner Von Braun started landing ballistic missiles in Britain. The first Soviet spacecraft were refitted ICBMs. Still to this day, the biggest innovations in rocket and aerospace technology remain rooted in military equipment. In fairness, what would the civilian use be for vectored thrust? What would the domestic market need afterburners for? We all forget that science truly takes off when it becomes practical. Einstein\u0027s famous equation relating energy and mass was only famous with the scientific community until it was put to work creating a WMD. So rocket science never took off until it had an immediately practical use. Where else would such things be practical beyond a military? What would the average person gain from gigantic rockets? Not much when rockets were crude. But a military definitely could gain from even the most crude rockets. Do you see the direction I\u0027m going? Extreme equipment is designed for extreme uses. Militaries have plenty of extreme cases for extreme equipment.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the Kerbals don\u0027t show any signs of military capacity in stock KSP. There are no \u0022other guys\u0022 to compete against. It seems like the Kerbals designed rockets just to aimlessly wander through the stars. The Kerbals don\u0027t even see rockets as a means to an end. It\u0027s like they see the rockets as the endgame. That doesn\u0027t seem right. You can\u0027t get that kind of success without immense focus and direction. Anyone here do real science? I don\u0027t, yet. But, what I can say for certain is that nothing works out if you don\u0027t have a goal in mind. Sure, you can create some nice trinkets along the way, but they stay trinkets until you have an end goal for those trinkets. Then they go from novelties to tools. So, in short, most major innovations are made in a military context because that\u0027s what you need in a military context. But there\u0027s no competition on Kerbin. Kerbin\u0027s so inactive, you wouldn\u0027t expect much to come from it. Innovation comes from competition because why fix what is already working fine. Kerbals appear to have some concept of competition since they have businesses, but somehow that doesn\u0027t translate to the big picture on Kerbin, which is just odd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe scientific data you gather doesn\u0027t even seem to be consistent with the tech you develop. I know we know nothing about that weird Mystery Goo, but, that doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s magical. That doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s just a magic wand that somehow gets you complex electronics and nuclear power. The atmosphere tests make sense in a scientific context for developing wings, but some of the other science doesn\u0027t quite seem to line up. How does one get solar panels from seismic tests?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust... So many things aren\u0027t right with the Kerbal\u0027s tech progress...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EI\u0027ll just sum it up any future paragraphs quickly: Kerbals demonstrate no signs that would normally indicate innovation and tech development, yet they have technology on-par with human technology.

If military development has no effect on scientific development, how come it took until the Gulf War for GPS networks to actually take off? How come it took until V-2s started hitting Britain for the idea of rocketry to spread around and become what it is today? How come it took a rivalry between the USSR and US for either power to develop good rockets? Surely everyone shares the same idealistic notions about space, right? Surely everything\u0027s done out of the good of the human heart, right?\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook, regardless of the organization, government, nation, people, or whatever else, the only reason technology takes off is if you can either kill someone with it, save someone with it, or sell it as a consumer product. That\u0027s how it is in any human nation. There\u0027s tons of neat scientific developments around that have never seen the light of day after being designed? Why? Because no one found a practical use for it.\u00A0If it isn\u0027t practical, it isn\u0027t\u00A0used.\u00A0Sure, you can pin that on any number of things to shift the blame. Sure, you can say how that\u0027s wrong and everything. At the end of the day, the only reason anything gets done is for practical reasons.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCool, starry-eyed idealism is a beautiful thing. But, countless people were blinded by that idealism to the point where they lost track of practicality. Their motivations go \u0022beyond human concepts\u0022 (even though, being human, they are still human concepts) is a nice way of saying they\u0027re doing something that basically only useful to a handful of people. The space races and all the space programs around the world were great, not just because of where we sent our rockets, but rather the \u0022trickle down\u0022 tech, if you may. Not just the beautiful notion of putting your flag on another world, but also the treasures you get along the way. If it weren\u0027t for that \u0022paycheck motivation,\u0022 where exactly would we all be? If everyone took the \u0022pretty jobs\u0022 of just making really neat stuff just because it was neat, where would we be? If you didn\u0027t basically bribe those kinds of people into making something for the at-large population, where would we be? Still think it\u0027s evil to make sharp minds develop things for the rest of us? It evil? No more evil than making people load trucks, or any of the other monotonous jobs out there. You have to motivate people to do that stuff because without it, where are we? Believe it or not, even the sharpest of us can go in the wrong direction. No one is above that. Neither politicians nor scientists. No one has that perfect compass. That\u0027s why you have to leverage people around. You have to motivate dreamers to do not dreamy things because, at the end of the day, reality is not optional. Better to economically coerce someone into practicality instead physically locking them up and into it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027d all love to escape to some dream-verse and do random cool things all the time. That\u0027s a terrible foundation for progress. I\u0027ll just assume you\u0027re familiar with goal setting. That ultimate endgame of limitless exploration isn\u0027t realistic. In fact, it\u0027s so open-ended that it\u0027s almost not a goal. If your ultimate objective is just wandering, you\u0027re never going to finish.\u00A0So, we\u0027re here again. You need to create practical goals with an end in order to go somewhere. You know when you make progress. You know when your efforts pay off. You know when you\u0027re really effecting the public at large.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223834731\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022196091\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221596958277\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022179192\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Boyster\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 hours ago, Boyster said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience is not meant to be funded by military, just because thats we have right now on Earth\u00A0doesnt make it the right and the only way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I threw a few clauses in for that.
