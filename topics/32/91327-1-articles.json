The bigger one has all the science equipment and has proven itself on the Mun, Minmus, Duna, Ike, Gilly, Bop, Vall, Pol, Dres, and Eeloo. The smaller one can only do Minmus, Bop, and Gilly I think. I also have an emergency return system that can get 4 Kerbals from the Jool system back to KSC from the Jool system, albeit, only in command chairs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecently, I have constructed 2 large VTOL rovers from the MK2 parts as well.
