This doesn\u0027t seem like a useful thing at first, but it lets you overcome those annoying times when the camera just doesn\u0027t let you move the rocket to where you want to inside the VAB. Or...you can do this:\n\n![Ot3AVsB.png](http://i.imgur.com/Ot3AVsB.png)\n\nYes, this is a craft offset almost **15 kilometers** away from the KSC, which is pretty far away^[^*^citation needed^*^]^. It\u0027s amazing, and offers tons of possibilities (like starting a boat, barge, etc. in the water). The way you do this is by selecting the offset tool (obviously), clicking on the root part, then \u0022grabbing\u0022 an axis of the tool and moving the mouse up, perpendicular to where the axis is pointing. Done correctly, it should let you offset whatever craft a ridiculous distance away (it clips through the VAB or SPH walls). I don\u0027t know if it allows you to start a craft in the air, but theoretically it should be possible.\n\nTL;DR: You can offset a craft\u0027s root part to move it really far away, holmes.\n\n\\*I discovered this quite a while ago, but I was too shy to post it until now\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-29T01:33:12Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2015 01:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mythbusters844**"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T01:23:22Z","Content":"Oh my god, this is awesome.
