This would seem to be a minor issue, but when fulfilling part-based contracts, it doesn\u0027t specify which part version (v1 or v2)\u00A0it wants me to use. This results in a 50/50 chance that I hauled the wrong part to the location, and the entire launch was for nothing. Is there any way to get rid of this, or to make the v1/v2 parts respond the same for contracts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShould I just go through the parts list and manually kill off all of the duplicates (non _v2 pairs)?
