Also for a 64k game you should consider the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/109027-105-custom-barn-kit-113-november-16th-no-instruction-leaflet-edition/\u0026amp;page=1\u0022\u003ECustom Barn Kit\u003C/a\u003E, mod, this will allow you to adjust the progression steps of the KSC buildings in career. Increasing the part count and max mass allowed on the starting launch pad/VAB would be a very good idea. (I dont have this on my 0.90 game, it is new to 1.0.x)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSETI was an all aspect mod that hit just about all parts of the game, the developer had a very specific style and outcome he was aiming for. When you try to apply that in addition to a mod like 64k which already ramps up the difficulty and makes you play in a different style to stock then they can clash and you end up between rock and hard place. (\u0022Better Than Starting Manned\u0022 was another, if more extreme version)\u003Cbr\u003E\nRP-0 again is tailored to specifically cater to a full RSS/RO game (and full modlist), and such could be too restrictive for someone not wanting to follow in the footsteps of reality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
