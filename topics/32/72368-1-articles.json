My goal is to use the smallest possible plane to do this. Since I\u0027ll have to rely on rocket thrust to get the plane into the atmosphere, it would be grand if I could do the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Land without using any fuel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Take off using tiny engines, say two 30KN thrust ones, with as small a fuel tank as I can for each\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Use the wings of the plane to get me *as high into the atmosphere as possible* using those two engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Once the apogee (apoeve?) is reached in my suborbital atmospheric flight, drop the wings and ignite the second stage to do the large majority of the orbital insertion\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) If this is still impossible, I\u0027ll probably make the final stage an ion powered, very light booster that can get to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel that this task should be possible with a very small spaceplane, rather than the \u0022MOAR FUEL\u0022 rockets I\u0027ve seen for most Eve return missions. I want to know how to compute the delta-v to orbit from a given height in Eve\u0027s atmosphere, so that I can figure out the best design to use. It\u0027s a big trade-off between the first stage, powered by rockets whose sole purpose is to get my high into the atmosphere, and the final stage, which needs to be orbital.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts? Does anyone think my idea is possible?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T18:32:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe big advantage of planes on Kerbin (and Laythe) is that they can use very fuel-efficient jets. This does not apply in Eve\u0027s atmosphere which has no oxygen. That just leaves the wings for lift and they are usually not worth their mass - you\u0027re better off with a conventional rocket launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no way to compute \u003Cem\u003Ethe\u003C/em\u003E deltaV requirements in an atmosphere and especially using wings since so much depends on the vehicle\u0027s TWR, your ascent profile, drag, etc. etc. You may like to look at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76153-Lightest-Eve-Lander\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76153-Lightest-Eve-Lander\u003C/a\u003E for what other people have done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MockKnizzle","CreatedById":59616,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T21:33:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA rocketplane on Eve is generally a terrible idea, since you\u0027re gonna spend even longer inside the soupy atmosphere than a normal launch, and your rocket engines are gonna be getting terrible Isp the entire time.
