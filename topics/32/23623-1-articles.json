For example controlling a large, heavy rocket with a tiny probe core can make turning even a few degrees a chore. If you use RCS to assist turning, the placement of your thrusters can make all the difference. I always try to put port linear thrusters as far away from the center of mass as possible, usually with four symmetry. If that \u003Cstrong\u003Estill\u003C/strong\u003E isn\u0027t enough, I\u0027ve had some success using pairs of small radial liquid engines instead of port linear thrusters and controlling them with action groups, but it can be overkill even with large heavy cruisers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother cool tip is to use the physical time warp. The regular time warp puts the craft on rails, but if you hold alt while advancing time warp you can still apply torque and use engines. It can only go up to 4x speed, but for large craft or space stations, it can help a bunch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chainedlupine","CreatedById":57775,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T01:46:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProbe bodies.

That\u0027s what I do. I stick a probe bodies (and SAS modules) on practically every part my rocket which is discarded on its way to the LKO. That way I don\u0027t have to bother with finicky aerodynamic surfaces that might slam into each other when separated... Only down-side is that the probe bodies sometimes cause boosters to glitch and not be automatically deleted when they fall below 25km. At least, I believe that is what I am seeing at times.
