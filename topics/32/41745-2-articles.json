My typical orbit is probably around 120-150km. I generally put stations at around 250-300km to take advantage of 100x time warp. For interplanetary missions I generally assemble things around 150km. I generally consider anything at 300km or under as LKO. I rarely park anything at a higher orbit though, unless I am doing a really big mission with really low thrust to weight ratio. Then sometimes I\u0027ll have elipticals that can stretch out to 4, 5, 600\u002Bkm with PE down around 90-100km. That said, those aren\u0027t really stable orbits so much as transfer orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll get my ship from around 120-150km circular assembly orbit and drop PE to around 100km for an Oberth boost and then I\u0027ll start accelerating and pumping my AP higher on each successive orbit.
