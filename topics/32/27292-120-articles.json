However, Jeb, confronted with a jet pack that would have run dry about 3 or 4 km from the rescue craft elected to exceed safe speeds rather than walk for 4km. Unfortunately I lost him in an 53m/s impact against the sub crater rim. So close to surviving too. However I know he would have wanted Bill and Bob to continue on with the science mission, and they are busy sampling and testing various regions of the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar surface. If all goes well they should return with enough science to unlock a few more scientific instruments and maybe the NERVA engine to improve the efficiency of the scientific work. So far I sent 3 tankers flying to M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar orbit to support Bill and Bob in their mission.
