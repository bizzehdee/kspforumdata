But im pretty sure it was somewhere around March 25-30th?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it did go down I could not reach it. But I had the forums as a favorite. So everyday i would log on and check the KSP forums. So for the past Month and a half I\u0027ve been doing this. And it hasn\u0027t been up. All it said that the Forums and the Spaceport were under maintence and i could not reach them no matter what!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo on May 5th (today) I decided for the first time to see if the main website was down... and to my excitement it wasn\u0027t! I looked at the articles and found a article that stated that the forums and spaceport were up (April 18) so I was like WTF! I could not connect to it and neither the spaceport. The twitch live stream has never updated besides that special Wednesday live stream. I was all confused!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo with my doubt I decided to click on the tab that said (Forums) on the main page, because I really thought that KSP was never to come back. Then BOOOM the website came alive!!!!! and so did the spaceport! So I was thinking from the last time I checked the forums it was down like 30 mins ago.... and now its up! I quickly read the new .20 update review blog posted by Harv. And then i felt stupid. This hole TIME THE FORUMS WERE UP AND FOR THE PAST 1 MONTH, 1 WEEK, AND 2 DAYS IVE BEEN MISSING IT! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anywho... im glad that im now able to join KSP again \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd thank god i didn\u0027t miss out on the .20 release. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone has an solution on what might of happened to me or something plz say so.
