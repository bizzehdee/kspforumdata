What this post is really about is a specific type of engine - the larger liquid rocket for main stages. Do they rip themselves apart at maximum thrust for anyone else? If I\\\u0027m sufficiently far through the atmosphere or in space and throttle even one of them up, it breaks off and shoots through the remainder of my rocket.

So, the rescuers are stranded in orbit while Jeb\\\u0027s twiddling his thumbs in a crater somewhere. :\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A Fat Pokemon","CreatedById":29245,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-28T03:50:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you using struts?

I had the same troubles as you describe. My rockets would fly up good and then suddenly, when the atmosphere thins and the speeds pick up, the bottom would ram through the top of the rocket. The decouplers are too weak for keeping your rocket intact alone. Put struts that connect the top of lower fuel tanks to the top ones, criss cross them and just put a ton of struts. If your top stage is as wide as the bottom one, making connecting struts awkward, add wings and connect the struts to those. As an example, my current best rocket has 36 engines and 120 struts. I kind of wish the struts wouldn\\\u0027t appear in the stage assignment ui \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also find that the old decouplers, which are longer, make design easier than the new flat ones. Last note, decouplers should be put in the middle of the connected stacks. If you have 3 tanks, the decoupler connects to the middle one. In pre-0.16, I\\\u0027d put my decouplers on the top part of the stack and it would work fine.

For my rocket for each large tank I added to the ship I needed to have two struts holding it to adjacent parts, and one to two more to hold it to the inner/outer stages. An example of a recurring problem I had with my design was the decoupler and engine that connected the upper stages (lander) and the lower stages. The lander was so heavy that when the lower stages were near empty they\\\u0027d just crush the decoupler and engine, and destroy the rest of the ship as it collided with the debris remaining. For this specific decoupler, I had to use eight struts going from the bottom connection (fuel tank) to the decoupler, another eight struts going from the fuel tank above the engine on the lander to the decoupler, three struts on each wing of the lander to the fuel tanks on the outer ring of the lower stages, and finally, three struts from the outside stages on the lander to the decoupler on below the lander\\\u0027s engine.

It is very easy with the new engines to clear your launch tower in a very timely fashion and if all those new engines are still burning when you get past that first atmospheric layer you can easily break 4 or 5 G\\\u0027s, which causes all kinds of bad things to happen. You are working with a lot more thrust and mass than before, so yeah, throttle that baby back and keep it around 2 G\\\u0027s for safe, happy, and still living, Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI -LOVE- the new SRB\\\u0027s.
