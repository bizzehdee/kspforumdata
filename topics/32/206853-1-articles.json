It needs wheels. When I attach a wheel it sticks into the ground and then the whole rover goes shooting into the sky spinning uncontrollably (in spite of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E being on). Maybe it lands right side up... maybe upside down... maybe a fuel tank explodes. Maybe the engineer can push it back upright. Maybe pushing it just sends it off spinning into the sky again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a way to avoid this problem? Or is this just repeat from a save point 100 times till I\u0027m lucky enough to have a usable rover at the end of the process?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vodostar","CreatedById":218924,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-10T22:46:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK so I took landing legs off the lander and used them as jacks.
