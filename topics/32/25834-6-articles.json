I think its safe to assume that Kerbals have discovered that e=mc2, but there are still experiments going on today to confirm the implications of general relativity. kerbals could be busy doing things like that in campaign mode, that is launching satellites to detect and confirm the existence of predicted subatomic particles, gravity waves et cetera.

The whole game is built around a semirealistic solar system space program. Adding even a single other star, it\u0027s planets and moons, and all the technology to get there (and presumably set up a brand new space program, as you would need to) would probably take about as much time and effort as the entire game has so far, unless of course, they just want to half-arse interstellar travel, make it simple, and make colonising a new system and setting up a new space centre including all the infrastructure and more sophisticated resource gathering and part construction a really basic procedure as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd to me, at least, it\u0027s not worth it. The time they will work on this game is finite, I\u0027d rather see that time put into many other things within the single system, including but not limited to - the currently planned resource system, the expansion of the existing solar system with asteroids and more gas giants and distant planets or dwarf planets, space habitat and planetary base construction, adding more detail to the planets, scientific study that actually means something in-game, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-27T04:08:12Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2013 04:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbface\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EmissionGeneration","CreatedById":71859,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-27T04:55:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I\u0027m not with this idea of Traveling to different Solar Systems, I think the Number 1 Priority needs to be to finish off our own first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been thinking though, and seeing though KSP tries to Relate to our own Solar System as much as they can and still keep it within the \u0022Fun Kerbal Action\u0022 a possible way around this [which some people will hate, others might not] is... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure many have heard of this Brown Dwarf Star that has some Orbital Bodies that comes around once every 360000 or what ever years it is.. Well to keep the people who want a new Solar System happy, aswell as keeping the people who don\u0027t want Interstellar Travel to be in KSP, this might be a viable option to implement at a very later date. As this Mythical Solar System has no proof of it\u0027s existence apart from what Archeologists have found from the Ancient Sumerians, then we will not see it on our Map View in KSP until it enters. Instead, when it approaches, it will be well within our Reach to fly to using the current Technology we already have in the Game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople will have the Option to Ignore it and just admire it\u0027s passing, or go build some Satelites, Bases, Stations on it. However this would be a 1 way trip. Once it leaves our Solar System then any Kerbals left in it\u0027s Orbits will have to cope themseves, making their own Fuel, Parts ect until it\u0027s next passing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand this can be a very touchy Subject to most, so please keep it clean and understand that KSP is a GAME, and there is nothing wrong with imagination and creation.
