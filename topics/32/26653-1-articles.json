If the payload has enough thrust to do the job of finalizing your orbit, then it will almost surely be more efficient than a mainsail. This will mean less orbital refueling for you later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe staging process is a trick to increase your effective mass ratio in the rocket equation, thereby giving you more dV. Drop as much dead weight as soon as possible. Ideally, you would drop every tank as soon as it is emptied, and drop every engine as soon as your TWR without it is around 1.5 to 2.0 (during the vertical ascent portion).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with asparagus staging is that when you drop engines you are increasing the fuel fraction of the remaining vehicle. That\u0027s good for overall dV, but bad for TWR right after staging, and the lower your TWR, the more gravity losses you incur. The trick is to find the balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom my experience, the ideal ascent profile goes like this (ignoring noble objectives like not raining death on the launchsite):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch: High TWR first stage should sprint up to terminal velocity and then run out of fuel immediately afterwards and be dropped. This is where solids come in handy, but the first stage of a large asparagus stack does this job just as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClimb: To maintain terminal velocity, you only need a TWR of about 1.5 or higher in the lower atmosphere. This is when you can dump engines and tanks to save weight because you don\u0027t need the thrust until you pass 10 km or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravity Turn: I usually use an actual gravity turn where I learn when to tilt over and follow the prograde vector (first surface for aerodynamic reasons, then gradually shifting to orbital as drag diminishes) and still end up with a nice ascent profile. Here you want high TWR again because the atmosphere stops being important and you really just want to be going as fast as possible as soon as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApoapsis tuning and Circularization: At this point, I\u0027m usually moving at 70 to 80% orbital velocity or higher and TWR is no longer important. If I did my gravity turn right, I should have plenty of time to apoapsis so I usually just use an LV-T45 or 30 for this stage, or maybe a poodle if it\u0027s heavy enough that weight is not a factor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are my methods.

This is assuming same ISP, if you have ie: LV-N at the last stage, making it longer is ok.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also important to design in such way that you use 100% thrust of your engines all the time. If not then you just flying with dead engine weight. What that means for a rocket, especially one with long stage burn time is that starting TWR as low as 1.6 can be used and then it can go above 2.5 just before burnout. It\u0027s also important to Keep thrust at 100% even above terminal velocity if the next stage has low starting TWR (something MechJeb fails to do).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the TWR ascent profile, for me it mailny goes like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) as much as resonable for initial acceleration, so if you have short 15-30s first stage 2.0 TWR and even more is good. (longer stages do well with 1,7-1,8)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) ascent until 8-10km (start of gravity turn) around 2,0 TWR mid stage (that means 1,8 TWR at the start)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) gravity turn (from 220m/s to 1100m/s or even 1600m/s if you use low thrust LV-N for last stage) needs actually the biggest TWR of around 2-3. This isn\u0027t a \u0022hard\u0022 requirement and you will only shave 20-50m/s of Dv compared to standard 1,8 TWR but it\u0027s just something to look at, as i\u0027ve seen and flown some really underpowered rockets during gravity turn loosing more than 100-200 Dv by that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) last stage up to orbit, TWR should be enough to complete circularization in one burn - usually 0.5-1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last thing i would point out that Dv isn\u0027t 100% best way to judge rocket efficiency. Dv only shows current rocket capability. For example you can have a rocket that can deliver 10 ton load to LKO using 4200m/s Dv with every stage having 2.0 TWR. That\u0027s great but it would be possible to construct a 1.6 TWR rocket that would send 10 ton load in 4500m/s (seems worse) and having less takeoff mass. This is because engines weight a lot in KSP and even by burning more fuel you need to haul to space a lot less mass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch weight isn\u0027t that important for Kerbin ascent\u0027s but its critical for landers. I would take a lander that uses more fuel (and Dv) any day if it were lighter for the same payload and mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother interesting element of ascent is how TWR can change the attitude angle in relation to velocity vector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course the most fuel efficient way to ascent is to keep the ship pointed as close to velocity vector as possible. But as the ship has finite number of stages that have different thrust and ISP\u0027s so its often not possible to follow the best path exactly, and a ship that can usually is heavier since its part\u0027s arent working at 100% all the time. This means that for a more tightly designed ship it can be beneficial to burn in other directions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example: Using an general design with low TWR LV-N last stage and LV-T30 gravity turn stage. You can use LV-T30 up to 1700m/s, stage and use LV-N low TWR to circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you can set up ship and flight profile in another way: use LV-T30 up to only 1300m/s (using less fuel) and then burn with low power LV-N at an high attitude angle (60deg angle will still be more fuel efficient in adding horizontal velocity since 800s ISP * cos60 = 400s -\u0026gt; more than 370s of LV-T30). The LV-N stage will slowly accelerate into orbit and burn more fuel itself but the net fuel used can be similar or lower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere will be a Dv difference for the designs as the second one will have much more of it (longer burning LV-N stage) but it will use more to ascent to orbit, so the resulting Dv in orbit will also be similar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis relation allows for more varied designs while still maintaining efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelp that was a lot of text, hope you can use something from it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Cheers!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(i hope i\u0027t was bearable for native english users, sorry for any mistakes)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EasyAce","CreatedById":62958,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T13:10:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ComradeGoat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ComradeGoat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou want to go slow nearer the ground as air resistance increases with the square of the velocity.
