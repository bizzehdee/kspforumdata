You don\u0027t have to use the new parts if you don\u0027t want to (Squad please don\u0027t nerf them, I need them). I love everything about this patch. Just ignore the asteroids, they will go away.

Again, I took astronomy in college, and I\u0027m an amateur astronomer, yes, these size asteroids are as common as the game is showing them. The one that went over Russia last year was probably an E. These aren\u0027t that large. E type events are fairly common, one every four or five years. And don\u0027t worry about were kerbals all dying.
