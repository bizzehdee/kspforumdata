Adding more and more planets to the System can lower the value of the indivual bodies in Kerbol. I tend to like more the idea of somewhat little Solar Systems, with a variety of features each. In fact, I would already save GP2 for other Star Sytem, while tweaking what is already present here. Since Kerbin and his moons serves as a tutorials. Then is fair to think the entire Kerbol System as a tutorial also for other Stars Exploration. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere you would find somewhat unexpected stuff. If you put almost eveything in Kerbol System, there\u0027s little incentive to travel all the way there just to see another bunch of spheres. :/ BUT a ringed Gas Giant that it cannot be found in Kerbol... well that\u0027s something else!. I suppose the main reason to travel further and further, is because in some other planets there\u0027s exotique materials that need to be collected, or the placement offers unique chances to discover new Solar Systems, make science that cannot be made anywhere. etc. Idk you guys, but is pretty apparent to me that more planets is not equal to make KSP better.
