It\u0027s clean, fun, educational, and definitely mom-approved. :-) Anyway, we\u0027ve downloaded a number of addons, but the computer we use is a bit short on memory. (I agree something needs to be done about the way *all* parts are loaded in memory at startup.. Maybe load \u0022thumbnail\u0022 versions unless/until actually used at the VAB or in a persistent ship?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E As a work-around, I was hoping this addon manager I\u0027ve seen mentioned a couple times would help (see: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/2526-Suggestion-Add-on-Selection-and-Challenge-Scenarios?p=26965\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post26965\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/2526-Suggestion-Add-on-Selection-and-Challenge-Scenarios?p=26965\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post26965\u003C/a\u003E ). But this and nearly all the forum links are broken (argh!). No name of the manager was mentioned, so I can\u0027t even search it. All I know is that it used to be at \u0022topic 997\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Can anyone direct me to it? Also, is there a way to find old threads here by their former topic numbers, so we can manually overcome the broken links?
