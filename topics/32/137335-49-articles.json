One particular contract was to haul \u00A0TT38 to 10 to 12k at 1,100 to 1,400m/s. As a general rule you should try not to be at mach 3.5 at ~ 30,000 or so feet unless you are in an SR71 blackbird, and near as i can tell there is nothing even close to that aerodynamic early game. I found my reputation taking a hit early game because of all the contracts I was declining, simply because the were idiot traps. These do nothing more than slow the game down and spread out play over more days.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still find the early game areodynamics and the lack of a simple wheel early game annoying, though\u00A0\u00A0with fewer bugs it was less annoying. There seems to be somewhat more visible high spped effects at low altitude than previous. At least one aerodynamic ff1 to ff0 adapter or fuel tank should be in the game, my added part increases performance with fewer roll overs.

Chutes in general are working better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne very obvious bug, the staging icons are not reporting the correct number or radial distributed parts when their ordering in the numbering sustem is moved.

You could make it so that when you land a plane or helicopter you can take the kerbals\u00A0and go with them to these doors and then they get placed back into the selection menu but the vessels stay outside. That would be a cool feature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qoonpooka","CreatedById":134904,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-22T15:01:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222691101\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022137335\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221469496612\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022167029\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PandaCheese\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/25/2016 at 9:30 PM, PandaCheese said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone else find it very difficult to tell contract orbit\u0027s direction (clockwise or counter)? 1.1.3 is my first intro to the game.
