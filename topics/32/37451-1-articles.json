So that we had to manage our resources and race against computer to achieve the best results in the shortest amount of time, or something. It would be logical if that rivalry reflected the real space race between the US and the USSR.

Now, if we were to deconstruct the english-translated word Kerman, it would likely be \u0022Kerbin man\u0022 (or Kerbin human), which doesn\u0027t really match with astronaut, but it could be a term to say \u0022Man \u003Cem\u003Efrom\u003C/em\u003E Kerbin\u0022 which may also imply that they left Kerbin, in the sense that they are from a place that they were at previously. Their grammar may be different and hold different meanings that our rough English interpretations don\u0027t convey, so it\u0027s fair game to say that Kerman is a title for astronauts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, in the case of the Tutorial\u0027s Gene Kerman, he would be the analogue of Gene Cernan. Apart from working at mission control, Cernan also travelled to space. Werner von Kerman however, is an issue, but one resolve would be to use the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalcomics.com/cast/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EIt\u0027s hardly Rocket Science\u003C/a\u003E name for him, Lernher von Gr\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. Or maybe, in this universe, Werner von Kerman actually fulfilled his dream of going to space, or even the moon. Who knows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnder this rule for astronauts however, a title for the russian-analogue of astronauts could be devised. Since Astronaut is considered to be a general english-speaking term, and since Kerbin presumably would be the same in both languages (there is no kerbal-russian language as of yet), man would become the russian counterpart, \u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u20AC\u00A1\u00C3\u00C2\u00B5\u00C3\u00C2\u00BB\u00C3\u00C2\u00BE\u00C3\u00C2\u00B2\u00C3\u00C2\u00B5\u00C3\u00C2\u00BA (chelovek, which is the term for man, that refers to humans in general).
