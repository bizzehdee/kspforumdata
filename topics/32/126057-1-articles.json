Avoid them at all if possible. If you have to have them then attach them from the back of the craft to the front, this lowers their drag for exactly the same looking strut. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nExample:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis craft will make orbit...\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/d9KkwF7.jpg[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis will flip and not make orbit...\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/FDXzFTt.jpg[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe only difference is two struts near the top.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAttach struts from the first-used stage to a later one. When a strut breaks, the mass remains on the part you first attached a strut to. This way you will be throwing away the mass of your struts as you stage, not leaving a massy stub on your remaining craft.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-21T11:55:36Z\u0022 title=\u002211/21/2015 11:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Foxster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
