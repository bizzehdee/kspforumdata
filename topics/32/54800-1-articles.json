Earth\u0027s atmosphere reaches nine or ten orders of magnitude denser than that in terms of number density (and the fact that our atmosphere is nitrogen/oxygen instead of hydrogen/helium adds another order of magnitude to the mass density ratio). Once you start working in astrophysics, you have to stop looking at numbers like 10^10 as being automatically big. Pretty much every number in astrophysics is huge, so you have to look at them all in context. I mean, it\u0027s 6.02*10^23 atoms of hydrogen per gram, so 10^10 per cm^3 means one gram of hydrogen per ~6*10^13 cm^3. That\u0027s a cube 400 meters on a side, containing a single gram of gas on average. In astronomical terms, yes, that\u0027s pretty close to vacuum; sure, it\u0027s still a lot thicker than interstellar space, but that\u0027s not saying a whole lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now, look at the effect on a rocket flying through that layer of gas, which was the original point of the thread. A plane flying through the air on Earth worries about frictional heating or compression, NOT heat transfer from the molecules it passes through, so the temperature of the gas is basically irrelevant to the discussion. Now extrapolate that to a gas that\u0027s less than a BILLIONTH of that density; it doesn\u0027t matter if the gas molecules are moving with a temperature of a million degrees, it just won\u0027t have any real impact on the temperature of the rocket.

Anything that has a temperature above absolute zero produces a full array of \u0022black body\u0022 photons, with the distribution of photon energies depending on the temperature. (The plot of photons vs. wavelength looks a lot like the Rock of Gibraltar, with the peak\u0027s frequency directly proportional to the surface temperature, a steep dropoff on one side, and a shallow dropoff on the other.) The million-degree inner layers of the Sun would produce quite a large number of gamma photons; the catch is that nearly all of those photons interact with the opaque outer layers of the Sun before reaching the surface, so the number that escape from the surface is extremely small. The thing about radiative astrophysics is that there are very few absolutes in these sorts of interactions; it\u0027s more like a half-life relationship. A photon might have an X% chance to interact with matter every Y kilometers it travels, and if enough of those scale lengths are inside the star it\u0027s very unlikely a given photon can escape without interacting along the way. But there\u0027s no way, in a finite distance, to raise the odds to 100%, so some WILL escape over time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternately, the cooler 6000-degree surface layer would produce a much smaller number of gamma rays, but they\u0027d have less distance to travel before escaping so their odds are a bit better. I think the few that escape from our own Sun are from the first group, ones made deep inside the star that managed to make it all the way out, but Kerbin\u0027s Sun might be different. (More on that below.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in a Sun-sized star the total gamma emission is admittedly very small. But if you\u0027re getting within a couple thousand METERS of the surface (like in the original post), even that small number might still be enough to kill you. For big stars, the number goes way up; the main difference between big stars and little stars is the number of high-energy photons that were produced in the first place. The larger stars produce far more total photons (energy output scaling as the FOURTH power of mass), AND their black-body curves are shifted to where the high-energy photons make up a larger fraction of the initial output. So, even if those stars also require the photons to travel a larger distance before reaching the surface, they\u0027ll still output much more ionizing radiation. (The largest stars are about 100 times the mass of our own Sun, so if 100 million times more photons are being created per second, and a much higher fraction of those are gamma/X-ray/far-UV, the fact that they have to travel ~5 times as far to reach the surface is not going to be significant.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s where Kerbin\u0027s Sun comes in; due to the 10:1 scaling that star is physically impossible. It\u0027s 10 times denser than our own Sun, while maintaining the same surface temperature, but with a mass far too low to undergo fusion at all. A star like that just can\u0027t exist in the real world, and therefore we can\u0027t definitively state how it\u0027d behave. With that density, it might act more like a large star than a small one, or it might produce almost no gamma rays at all due to the low mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, the X-rays and hard UV photons DO escape pretty easily, and those\u0027d fry you as well. So we don\u0027t really NEED to include gamma rays in our discussion; I just didn\u0027t want to leave them out entirely. Those other wavelengths would also do a number on inorganic parts; a UV photon with wavelength below 912 Angstroms will ionize atomic hydrogen, for instance, which would probably do bad things to a hydrogen-oxygen fuel system...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for radiation pressure, it\u0027d depend on exactly how you planned to get close to the surface. Real-world ion drives, for instance, would be so low in acceleration that these effects might actually make a difference even out at planetary distances. But again, we\u0027re talking about objects coming right up to the visible surface... light pressures that are negligible at 1 AU might be significant at those distances. I\u0027d have to run the numbers, but (again) Kerbin\u0027s sun is simply impossible, so a lot of the physics can\u0027t be derived by using real-world relationships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGuys, if I recall correctly, Spatzimaus is a real-life space scientist.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue, but my recent work is all in far-infrared observations, mainly of large nearby galaxies (mostly quasars).

The million-degree inner layers of the Sun would produce quite a large number of gamma photons; the catch is that nearly all of those photons interact with the opaque outer layers of the Sun before reaching the surface, so the number that escape from the surface is extremely small. The thing about radiative astrophysics is that there are very few absolutes in these sorts of interactions; it\u0027s more like a half-life relationship. A photon might have an X% chance to interact with matter every Y kilometers it travels, and if enough of those scale lengths are inside the star it\u0027s very unlikely a given photon can escape without interacting along the way. But there\u0027s no way, in a finite distance, to raise the odds to 100%, so some WILL escape over time\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are indeed vast numbers of gamma ray photons produced by the nuclear reactions in the Sun\u0027s core. But the mean free path of those photons is way below 0.1 cm. The mean free path of a diffusing photon is the inverse of the product of the opacity and density in the Sun\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6and it stays below 0.1 cm within the inner 50% of the Sun\u0027s radius (see Mitalas, R. \u0026amp; Sills, K. R., Astrophysical Journal, Part 1 (ISSN 0004-637X), vol. 401, no. 2, p. 759, 760.). These gamma ray photons have to work their way out from the Sun\u0027s interior by random walk to the base of the convection layer (at about 70% of the Sun\u0027s radius, from which point the convective transfer is comparatively quick). A photon from the core would need to take about 10^25 steps during its random walk out, and the photon\u0027s energy is down-scattered to keep the photon\u0027s energy in line with the thermal equilibrium temperature of the plasma inside the Sun at the current position of the photon. So it typically takes the energy from a gamma ray photon formed in the core 1.7 x 10^5 years to reach the base of the convection zone (yes\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6over one hundred thousand years). And although you could calculate a number for the likelihood that a gamma ray photon could make it from the center of the Sun to its surface in one hop through that huge optical depth, the result would be so tiny as to be completely insignificant for any practical discussion. Just because something is POSSIBLE does not mean it is anywhere near likely enough to worry about. It\u0027s POSSIBLE that all the atoms in my body will suddenly end up moving upwards and smash me through the roof of my house, but that\u0027s also so amazingly insignificant of a probability that there\u0027s no point in worrying about it. The X-ray flux from the Sun\u0027s corona would be worth worrying about -- the possibility of gamma rays getting out from the center is not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs for radiation pressure, it\u0027d depend on exactly how you planned to get close to the surface. Real-world ion drives, for instance, would be so low in acceleration that these effects might actually make a difference even out at planetary distances. But again, we\u0027re talking about objects coming right up to the visible surface... light pressures that are negligible at 1 AU might be significant at those distances. I\u0027d have to run the numbers, but (again) Kerbin\u0027s sun is simply impossible, so a lot of the physics can\u0027t be derived by using real-world relationships.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to get close to the surface of the Sun is to boost far out in the solar system, then kill your speed and drop in. Even better to get a gravity assist from Jupiter to slow you down. The radiation pressure from the Sun at one AU is about 9.08 microNewtons per square meter (just using the values given on the Wikipedia page about radiation pressure). This simply scales inversely as the square of the distance, so it\u0027s 227 microNewtons per square meter at 0.2 AU. We don\u0027t need to worry about the physics of how Kerbol produces its energy to use that same information for the Kerbol system -- if we assume that the devs want Kerbin to have Earth-like illumination, it would have a similar photon flux and radiation pressure at its orbit, and the radiation pressure at other distances can be found from the inverse square law using the distances in terms of the \u0022Kerbin AU.\u0022 So you needn\u0027t waste a lot of fuel even if you wanted to crash your probe into Kerbol.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SoldierHair","CreatedById":62167,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-01T19:34:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vexx32\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vexx32\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, basically... the thermometer isn\u0027t broken, it\u0027s just that there\u0027s no enough stuff there to heat the rocket up appreciably.

Convection is a non-issue; that\u0027s a function of the gas density in contact with the vessel itself. Radiation from the surface could only get a nearby insulated object to about 6000 degrees, the same temperature as the surface of the Sun; at that point the object\u0027s thermal black-body emission would exactly balance the incoming energy. Thermal conduction within the object would DECREASE that; the more parts of the vessel that aren\u0027t getting heated directly, the cooler the average would be. (For a perfect sphere, the equilibrium would be about 4000 degrees.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe part that\u0027s in shadow is really important, because heat is transferring to that area from the parts directly lit by the Sun, but the entire surface (shadowed and lit parts alike) are emitting energy to stay in equilibrium. Take Earth as an example; the night side of Earth isn\u0027t much colder than the day side (if the day temperature averages 300K, the night might only be 290K), because energy is transferred to it to keep it from freezing overnight. Some energy is stored by the rocks and water, some is carried by atmosphere movements. The net result is that a lit, nonconductive object at Earth distance would have a temperature close to the boiling point of water, but by transferring energy to the \u0022cold\u0022 side, the \u0022hot\u0022 side of an object ends up quite a bit cooler.

And that has nothing to do with whether it\u0027s an IR telescope, UV telescope, etc; the detector is the same for all, only the optics and filters really differ. (One of Hubble\u0027s instruments has dozens of filters ranging from far-UV to mid-IR, using the same detector for all.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou see, in electronics you get what we call \u0022thermal noise\u0022, where the random thermal motion of the atoms in the wires and such create interference. The colder the wires, the lower the noise (scaling as the square root of the temperature in Kelvin). For the hypersensitive detectors used by modern telescopes (ground-based or space-based), the electronics are usually chilled with liquid nitrogen or liquid helium (usually cheap nitrogen for ground-based ones and more expensive helium for space) to much, much colder temperatures than they\u0027d reach otherwise. When you\u0027re trying to detect very faint galaxies and such, that lower noise is an absolute necessity. For something like a manned spaceship, it\u0027s not important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEver since the Spitzer telescope it\u0027s become standard practice to put a \u0022sun shield\u0022 on one side of a space telescope, to minimize how much coolant you have to expend in normal operation; in the case of Spitzer, this change extended its original designed 3-year mission out to about 6.5 before it ran out (early 2003 to mid-2009). Basically, those shields keep the temperature well below the \u0022typical\u0022 temperature for that distance from the Sun, without having to expend a constant amount of coolant. Spitzer continued to function for a couple years after that (what was called the \u0022warm mission\u0022), but the much higher thermal noise meant that only two out of the seven wavelength bands were useable at all during that period, and only for purposes that didn\u0027t need as high of precision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of the Webb telescope, those extensive shields are going to be the primary way to keep cold, with little or no coolant needed at all. That\u0027s a necessity since the Webb won\u0027t be in Earth orbit like the Hubble was; a good thing, too, since a Hubble-type orbit can\u0027t really use a shield like that in the first place. Basically, it\u0027s designed to operate at about 53 K (-220 C), whereas without a shield it\u0027d be at more like 350 K.
