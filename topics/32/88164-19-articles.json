Geting a bit more or less responsivenes out of reaction wheels/RCS is one thing. a skilled hand on the stick so to speak will be able to control the same system to a greater degree and get more performance than someone touching it for the first time. Possibly have ASAS not wobble so much with a skilled pilot. However no amount of skill is going to make a rocket that provides 500kN of thrust max provide 510kN. Playing around with the fuel flow or whatever to get more thrust is best left to the guys on the ground who actualy know how they work, not the pilot who\u0027s flying it.\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I\u0027d rather have a limited amount of autopilot options that are tied to kerbal skill. Tell the kerbal to point the ship prograde or at a node and he\u0027ll do his best to line up on that orientation and hold it. Better pilots will be more accurate and do a better job. If allowd to auto fly a planed node a better pilot will fly it more accurately and with less wasted fuel. A lesser pilot may be off on the node or spend more fuel correcting for mistakes.

They could also be better at repairing the ship, if Squad ever adds more detailed damage mechanisms to the game.

I\u0027m fine with some science buffs, as you do become more capable and knowledgeable as you undertake more work and do more research; this is true of anyone, not just our little green friends. As for the variances in the thrust and ISP, I can see what they are trying to emulate; a new guy may be a little nervous and jittery with the joystick while Jeb is sipping on a brew and handling the ship using just his feet in an epic display of spaceflight aerobatics (astrobatics?), but I don\u0027t think implementing differences in how an engine performs is the best way to do that. If you want to emulate Dumbwise Kerman at the helm, introduce a little bit of a jitter on the throttle as you throttle up and a little tiny sway on the heading.

A Kerbal who specialises in Science will be able to collect more science points from the field and analyse data more effectively in the lab. Perhaps they could also provide more detailed descriptions in the sample details and reports instead of just saying \u0027Definitely not mint ice cream\u0027. Such simple descriptions can be reserved for non-scientists or wannabes. They also utilise in-field equipment more effectively, should any of that ever appear (I suppose the Goo pods and Materials Bays count, but I mean things like hammers and core drills).\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#B22222;\u0022\u003EEngineering\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#B22222;\u0022\u003E is probably the most detailed aspect of this whole thing, simply for the fact that there is a lot of stuff that can be done here. Engineers will be able to improve their experience and abilities through the repair of various items on EVA. Wheels and landing legs are all that can be fixed for now, as far as I can recall (repacking parachutes doesn\u0027t count; you don\u0027t need a doctorate to fold a tent back up), but this system would be much expanded to include practically every part in the game, and some parts would yield more experience from their repair than others would (a truss vs. an LV-N, for instance). As an engineer accumulates more time working on fixing things, they\u0027ll eventually find that they can start successfully tinkering with parts to make upgrades, which is where I think this whole \u0027boost your thrust and ISP\u0027 thing should really come from; you\u0027d have to have components aboard your ship, in a pod somewhere, and you\u0027d need to go on EVA, head to the part you want to upgrade, and upgrade it, so long as such an upgrade is within reason; no expanding fuel tanks, but maybe just an adjustment to the De Laval nozzle on that engine over there to improve the ISP in that manner, or possibly a tweak to the reaction wheels to improve their ability to stop a ship from overshooting an orientation as well as keeping you pointing the right way better. This would undoubtedly have to come with an element of risk; if your upgrade goes wrong, it can either just kill the boost you made or damage the part, requiring it to be fixed before it will operate again. Also, new engineers who apply upgrades will not have their upgrades prove to be very successful most of the time, nor will upgrades be as effective as those applied by a pro. In fact, non-professional upgrades could risk damage to surrounding parts if the upgraded part has explosive potential.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF8C00;\u0022\u003ENavigators\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF8C00;\u0022\u003E will focus on improving how orbital trajectories are displayed in the map view, and provide much more detail on manoeuvre nodes than any newbies would be able to.

Let\u0027s just speed that up a bit, says the epic technician. Are we wasting electricity anywhere? Not any more, thanks to the glorious work of our technician (electricity use goes down slightly for everything bar ion engines). Systems guys could also look after the hydroponics/aeroponics skill set, which would be the least important aspect until life support measures are implemented, in which case it rapidly becomes a top priority as not only do plants provide food, but they provide oxygen. A skilled biologist/systems tech should be able to keep the non-mobile green organisms in good condition for the mobile green organisms to use, while an amateur green thumb will likely do more harm than good to any greenhouses.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003EMedics\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E can operate within the ship and, perhaps to a less effective extent, out in the field.

A guy who carelessly waves around scalpels will probably take forever to get someone back on their feet, but a proper doctor can get a someone back to health in comparatively little time. Any Kerbal who is unable to move after being injured on EVA will need treatment in the field and then some further work back in a base or ship.

This ties into the mission duration aspect, as short missions will not need much space and thus the crew will be fine with a command pod and maybe a lander cabin for a week before things start going downhill, but interplanetary cruisers or stations/bases with lots of space will likely not see any penalties for a long time. A Kerbal who has plenty of space to themselves will likely be in a better mood than one who doesn\u0027t have quite so much space.

On the other hand overiding safeties all the time just because your a BadS is just asking for something to explode, not a good thing when your flying a controlled explosion already. I wouldnt mind if there was an option to tell your kerbal to \u0022Punch it\u0022 and they override the maximum fuel flow. A kerbal skilled with that procedure might get more out of the engiens without explodifying them while an unskilled either plays it too safe or overdoes it and blows up.
