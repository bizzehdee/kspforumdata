There are contracts that will get you *some* science, but you run contracts for the money. And use that money to finance science (or manage to do some science while fulfilling contracts--but that\u0027s merely reducing the cost of your science experiments and not really \u0022getting science from a contract\u0022).\n- Career modeTourist contracts doesn\u0027t get you a lot of money but it does get you reputation, thus getting you better contracts\n- IMHO the gravy train is in rescueing Kerbals. Rescueing a Kerbal from Munar orbit yields about $150,000 or more, *and* gets you an extra crew member, while you can run these missions for about $20,000 each. I also use these missions to ferry Mun science experiments back to Kerbin (but I digress). In my current career game I haven\u0027t even set foot on Minmus yet, and I\u0027ve ungraded all buildings to their max level and have about a million bucks... BRING ON THE SCIENCE ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIf you fly a few more missions your contracts will probably getting more varied. If all you did was get into orbit, then most contracts will cater to just that.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T20:58:40Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 08:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbart**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vorg","CreatedById":74652,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T22:46:37Z","Content":"Use what ever parts you can cobble together to run around to the buildings and collect science. You could just drop a pod on the pad and have the kerbal run around on foot, but that takes too long and he has to run back each time. Use the landing gear you get to make a rocket car to tool around. You\u0027ll get enough science to unlock the better parts which will in turn unlock other missions. Don\u0027t forget, there are acheavment rewards you get just for doing things like reaching higher or getting into orbit that don\u0027t show up as missions you take."},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T01:16:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve had an early career mode save going, and got to the point of suborbital flight (basically a sounding rocket that clears the atmosphere).

I stuck some basic jets on a srb and made a single-stage suborbital craft. It goes straight up and comes straight down again, landing close to the KSC for 97% recovery. It cost peanuts to operate and did a fair amount of science too. It was great for tourist hops and for the various equipment testing missions.\n\nI waited until I had a fully recoverable space-plane before doing the orbital tourist/testing missions. My current design can lift 6 kerbals and two small (or one large) satellites into LKO. I\u0027ve lost count of the missions I\u0027ve flown this way, and by now I\u0027m nailing the un-powered runway landings every time. It\u0027s amazing how far you can take an octo core with a single Oscar-B tank and a 48-7s spark engine once it\u0027s in LKO.
