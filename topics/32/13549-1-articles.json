The pipeline climbs gentlly in a straight line towards the east, up the side of a tall mountain near the equator - the sci-fi book used \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimborazo_%28volcano%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EChimborazo\u003C/a\u003E, I think.

The engine has no outer casing or fuel lines - just what\\\u0027s needed to turn a fuel/air mixture into thrust. It\\\u0027s also built to be able to handle the shock wave of going through the atmosphere at launch speeds, starting at the altitude where the high end of the pipe is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou fill each section of the pipeline with the ideal fuel/air mixture and pressure for the exact speed that the engine will be travelling when it passes through that section. Stick the engine\u002Bpayload in at the low end , seal the pipeline on that end, fill the pipeline, and light that baby up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe beauty of it is that this way, you never have to accelerate the fuel to orbital speeds, just the payload \u002B engine. The drawback is when it leaves the pipe, it has to be going way higher speed than what\\\u0027s actually needed, and transitions to huge air resistance in a split second right as it loses all active thrust. That\\\u0027s going to be your max Q for sure, but a highly aerodynamic craft can minimize the strain at 6 km altitude. This is a way to get most of the advantages of the \u0027gun\u0027 style launcher, while still limiting the G forces that your payload has to withstand - you can tune the thrust of the engine and length of the gun to never exceed the G\\\u0027s that will happen when it exits the pipe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, you wouldn\\\u0027t be launching people this way. ;D\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cardgame","CreatedById":12317,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-03T04:08:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMass drivers with electromagnets are the way to go. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phoenix Aerospace","CreatedById":26120,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-03T04:25:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E Even better, you\\\u0027d have a Lostrom Loop.

The idea is that you\\\u0027d tether the upper part of the loop to the ground, spin up the magnetically levitated rotor, and have centripetal forces push the upper part of the loop 80 kilometres up into the air; above the majority of the atmosphere.

Naturally, as it trades velocity, and due to drag, its orbit will gradually decay.
