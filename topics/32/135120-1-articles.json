I\u0027m creating a series of aircraft for KSP and want them to be know about. I will treat it like an aircraft designing\u00A0company for KSP, with different variants. The Spitray was an idea that I\u00A0came up with some time ago but never was able to share the designs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the future I hope to upload the aircraft designed by me and my friends.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will start making and uploading the craft when the 1.1 update comes out and will hope to have many different types of ships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in short, I am head of the \u0022Company\u0022 and I shall start designing the ships as soon as possible. Me and my friend will create as many good aircraft as we can, we shall compare and only upload ones that are exceptionally good.\u00A0Any aircraft submitted by my friend will be verified by me because I\u00A0have had the game since 0.23 and I consider myself to be quite good at the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-28T12:37:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome board, Spitray5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe have a rule against roleplay here on the forum, so please do not form a \u0022company\u0022.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d encourage you to start a new thread for sharing your craft over in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/forum/21-the-spacecraft-exchange/\u0022\u003ESpacecraft Exchange\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
