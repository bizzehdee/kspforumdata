This was with a stock install. I tested it several times and it crashed every time. When I jettisoned the lower part of the lander (with exposed parts) I only gained about 200Mb of memory during re-entry. The problem appears to occur when you have multiple parts overheating.\n\nUPDATE - Using F10 to disable the temperature gauges minimizes/eliminates the memory leak.\n\nSupport thread post on same issue: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118658-New-Heat-System-causes-memory-leak](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118658-New-Heat-System-causes-memory-leak)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T19:00:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 07:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tarheel1999**"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T15:04:12Z","Content":"I thought I was noticing something wrong with the memory again..."},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T15:24:30Z","Content":"So that explains my 2 OoM crahes. Rather strange, especially since stock 1.0 is actually smaller than 0.9 thanks to fixes and magic textures.\n\nHave to say tho, I love the gauges and heat effects. Those tools are incredible usefull.

Considering i ONLY touch 3 types of craft right now, airplanes(SSTOs too but they are space airplanes technically), land vehicles, and capital ships, ive yet to actually find any practical use for parachutes (airplanes when built properly dont need them as i can um land horizontally, capital ships are never intended to come back down, and land vehicles, well you get the idea).\n\nAnyways, until they fix such a stupid memory leak, im sticking to 1.0, i see no reason to upgrade to 1.0.2 just for some minor features (and the whole occlusion bug is a matter of whether you choose to abuse it, i still had plenty of legit non-cheat planes flying in 1.0)."},{"CreatedByName":"Redshift OTF","CreatedById":78679,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T16:05:32Z","Content":"Yeah I\u0027m getting a lot of crashes as well.
