This has been addressed in the case of the mini ISRU - it is optimized for relatively short operation cycles - i.e. it\u0027s the wrong bit to use for your mining base because it cannot operate for years on end without a break. But it\u0027s excellent if you just need to do short-term conversions (i.e. refueling a biome hopper, etc.).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadiators will be important - critical - for ISRUs and drills. That being said, if you have one of the 2.5m ones out there on a ship with no radiators, you will still be able to operate, but the efficiency will be very low since it will overheat quickly (but not down to zero in the case of the 2.5m ones - they will tend to hit equilibrium with a net positive in processing capabilities).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe design choice here is to provide two very clear options with each one having it\u0027s benefits and drawbacks.

Hopefully they won\u0027t add some shameful engines, running on ore only.

Mass is at a premium IRL, so making things smaller and lighter is the way to go. Current ISRU concepts are based on that premise.

I imagine it\u0027ll end up kind of useless but open up the door for people who enjoy replicas or creating current ISRU concepts in a gamey sort of way. There really isn\u0027t any compelling reason \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E to add smaller or larger ISRU parts considering the lack of constraints. Again, if you don\u0027t like that sort of gameplay, don\u0027t use the parts. There are plenty of other parts you can use to construct your mission and feel good about doing it without \u0022cheating\u0022 or being \u0022overpowered\u0022.
