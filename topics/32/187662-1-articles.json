This is important because all celestial bodies rotate.

This means you can set up a low circular orbit that will get you a close pass over the canyon every time, but you won\u0027t have to worry about smacking into the surface somewhere else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"It\u0026#039;snorocketscience","CreatedById":83289,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-26T15:15:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223660206\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187662\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221566830466\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022125662\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snark\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n35 minutes ago, Snark said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Mun is actually a pretty good place for canyon barnstorming.
