I usually try to send up my crazy landers and interplanetary behemoths with a little probe core attached to them so that they can be launched empty. This usually comes in handy, anyway, since it lets me more easily take the whole crew down to the surface without having to leave a sad Mike Collins-Kerman minding the orbital stage while Jeb and crew bomb around on the surface on awesome rovers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat takes care of most launches, which is where I see probably 90% of my fatalities otherwise. Sometimes I will have to send a vessel up with a crew, like the Eve return lander which was so critically weight-sensitive. Those times I will just do a few tests and call them \u0022simulations\u0022 since I don\u0027t have access to wind tunnels, CFD software, or accurate FEM analysis for the structural performance. I always fly the final mission \u0022live\u0022 though, and if possible I have some abort mechanisms I\u0027ve developed which have saved a handful of crews from stack collapses and such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the other places where I can lose crew are botched landings/ascents on other bodies and running out of fuel. There really is no perfect abort scenario for these situations. If the landing is going awry, the best thing to do is to just abort to orbit, but if you\u0027ve lost control that might not be possible. The trick is to use very conservative designs that you are dead certain will be stable, and then be ready to abort the landing when the time comes. Obviously, there is no abort scenario for a failed ascent, so I tend to give my ascent stages a very hefty margin of extra dV to make sure I don\u0027t screw up. If I run out of fuel, I will always go get the crew if they have enough living quarters that I deem them capable of surviving the wait. Even this can be very terrifying if the fuel were to run out, say, halfway through a burn from Jool back to Kerbin.
