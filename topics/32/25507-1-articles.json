Detaching from that booster reset the counter on the timer on the upper half, and the remainder of the journey (a quick jaunt to Moho and then back to Kerbin) took only 175 days, bringing my total mission time to 5929 days (~16.5 years).

They\u0027re jet engines that work in any atmosphere, but burn raw kethane instead of liquid fuel. Each of the 1.25m stacks on the lower half is made of a turbine and two tanks of raw kethane. (I was also careful to land on the highest point I could find.) It\u0027d be a long, long ascent, but the ISP on those engines is high enough that the total delta-V would be enough to get out of the thick part of the atmosphere; once I was in the upper regions I could dump the booster half and activate the hybrid ions in the upper stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, you\u0027ll note that my phrasing there is awkward. It didn\u0027t actually work; I landed just fine, and the ascent worked fine up until about ~10km, with plenty of fuel still onboard, but at that point SAS started freaking out for no reason I could see. It might have just been that I had too few flaps for that air density, but it wasn\u0027t exactly the easiest thing to test since I\u0027d have to fly a prospective design out to Eve, latch it to my main vessel, and make the attempt, so I really only had a couple tries. It just wouldn\u0027t stay stable, unless I turned on infinite RCS to force it to stay vertical; the thing is, the vectoring on my main liquid-fuel engine just wasn\u0027t doing what it was supposed to. So it didn\u0027t really count towards my grand tour; I later went back with a spaceplane that also used those Kethane engines, transferred Jeb over, and that one had a much easier time getting up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"teutoburg1","CreatedById":49386,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T06:43:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBack in .16 when there weren\u0027t any planets I sent ship on a 3,000 year mission that ended when .17 came out.
