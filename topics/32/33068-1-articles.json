Once I\u0027m as sure as I can be that they payload will work, I discard the test launcher and build proper a transit stage under the payload, then a launch stage under that, etc., as needed. Once I am sure that the delivery vehicle is MORE than big enough to get the payload where I want it to go (so that I don\u0027t waste time flying it half-way there and having the mission fail before I\u0027ve even had a chance to verify that the payload works), I then fly the intentionally over-sized version of the design to the destination and perform the mission.
