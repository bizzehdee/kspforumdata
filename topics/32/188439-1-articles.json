Did they remove their ability to gain speed before 30k? They get some speed at low altitude but never fast enough to punch up. I\u0027m flying a plane that I used to stack nukes and rapiers on and it can\u0027t get past 300-350km/s?! Same frame same design. When were these removed and why have space planes been eliminated?!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave they modified rapiers since 1.3/1.4. I know I was playing then.

I believe it is likely that you are pitched up too much. If you pitch close to 0 degrees and get past 400m/s you will begin to increase thrust and speed. Make a single-RAPIER plane out of a shock cone intake, a FLT-800 and a cockpit and pitch close to the horizon.

So once you got to 400 m/s then accelerating even more becomes comparatively easy. But accelerating through the sound barrier from 300 m/s to 400 m/s can be a bit of a hurdle, so pitching down can (maybe even trading height for speed) can be needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Signo","CreatedById":103766,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-23T08:34:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do not think so.
