However, it\u0027s not the same thing as what happens in KSP. In KSP, the game engine moves the universe around your own stationary bubble of space. An Alcubierre drive (in theory) does the exact opposite; it moves the bubble of space surrounding the ship through the rest of the universe. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T02:30:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs this a science question or a game observation or what?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T15:49:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*plays that sound from Inception*\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alizerin","CreatedById":126590,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T17:21:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo be fair, according to special relativity, it could be argued that our motion in the universe behaves exactly like KSP handles moving ships around.
