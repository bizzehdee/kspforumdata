Its like hoping that the Girl you just started dating will break up with you in a couple of years, but then you\u0027ll run in to her a few years later, she\u0027ll throw herself at you and it\u0027ll be just like old times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow about you worry about the relationship you have now and not some hypothetical many years from now thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP has been around, for what? 2 odd years (or is it 3? Sorry, I\u0027ve only been around for a little over a year). It is going strong and growing both as a community and as a game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESQUAD hasn\u0027t really talked recently much about their long view of KSP in terms of where they think they\u0027ll be when the game is \u0022finished\u0022. Some of the last discussions they had about it seemed like they are probably at least a good year away from where they think the game will need to be to hit Beta and I\u0027d expect probably at least a few months of it being in Beta before they feel they\u0027ve quashed enough bugs and done enough game balancing and optimization before I think they\u0027d consider it \u0022done\u0022. They\u0027ve already talked about (and gotten undeserved backlash) future expansion plans to KSP once they feel they\u0027ve delivered the final game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think SQUAD has concrete and ephimeral plans for KSP that are going to keep it in fairly active development for at least then next couple of years and possibly/probably longer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Epthelyn","CreatedById":57970,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T14:53:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe reason Terraria\u0027s update is getting a lot of attention was because Redigit just suddenly declared that they would no longer be updating the game and would be doing other things. Terraria has a fairly replayability but since there are relatively few mods for it and it does get slightly repetitive after the first 60 hours it\u0027s nice to see an \u0027overhaul\u0027 which will add content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP, however:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It\u0027s not finished, and it will no doubt be a considerably long time before it is \u0022finished\u0022, yet people have played KSP for hundreds of hours and are STILL coming up with crazy new ideas and having fun with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- As long as Squad add more places to go to (and perhaps randomly generated space) there will be more and more things to do. Think of all the things you can do on Duna, and then rewrite that list for each new planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The modding community in an unfinished game is a million times better and more active than Terraria\u0027s is and was. Mods make games last for much, much longer, at least as long as they are developed in an active community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simple fact is that \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eall\u003C/span\u003E most games eventually die, even the best ones. Squad could develop a perfect game and people could be playing KSP actively with a community for over a decade, or it could slowly diminish after a few years and become something people play to remember the past. The only major overhaul you can do to a perfect game is to tell people to play something else until they regain interest \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
