Since 23.5 I have encountered the hell Kraken for the first time, had another Kraken attack a rover\u0027s wheels, fuel tanks and command capsule at very unspecific speeds and angles, and to top it off I seem to have found some other strange Kraken that applies phantom forces to my plane after taking off from sea, causing me to drift sideways, upwards and well, everywhere. This is with stock aerodynamics too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI managed to get all this in around 10 hours or so whereas within my other 190 hours I have only encountered it twice.

It must have something to do with the new joint connections that came with the Unity update. It gives Ships better connections, which allowed us to have the much larger NASA SLS parts. It also gave us much firmer connections between parts, which eliminated a lot of wobble. But because its changes to joints, the kraken is back as it is related to part connections and physics calculations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIve already had a few snags already and hope to see some of it fixed next update or soon \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T02:35:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey did do some pretty major things as far as the physics engine is concerned when they added asteroids.

The true Kraken, (imagine me with a big beard, a pegleg, a missing eye and a glass of rum) the original Kraken was a beast surfacing in low-speed orbits that attacked vessels.
