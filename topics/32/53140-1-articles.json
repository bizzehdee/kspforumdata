When I tried to exit the space center screen, I could not hit \u0022exit to main menu\u0022 because my windowed verson of KSP would not move up. Silly Windows! I couldn\u0027t change the size either so I had to exit the game entirely. When I tried to change the game back to full screen, I couldn\u0027t click the \u0022accept\u0022 button!

I thought I would be trapped out of full screen forever! I can admit there could have been a better use of \u0022I almost pooped my space diaper\u0022.

I like to have the Wiki open on another monitor while playing and it drove me batty that KSP minimized every time I clicked on the wiki.
