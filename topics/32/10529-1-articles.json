That meant we couldn\\\u0027t use it anymore as a measure for anything really. Add to that the fact that there many mirrors of the demo download, and the download count becomes a truly meaningless number.\n\nWe\\\u0027ve been keeping track of other statistics now. Most frequently,I go by the number of registered forum members. It\\\u0027s not a true count of the number of players, but it does give a nice indication of how KSP has grown over time. We are currently at 24,700 members, IIRC, which is really good, considering we were topping the 10,000 member mark on October last year. We\\\u0027ve more than doubled in community size in six months.
