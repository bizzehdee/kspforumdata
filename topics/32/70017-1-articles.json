Maybe actual LV-N designs do things differently, but I at least pretend it\u0027s perfectly possible to make the exhaust clean. See, just like in a typical nuclear power plant, the hot nuclear stuff is in its sealed containment vessel and if it needs any cooling fluid, that\u0027s also in a close system separate from the fuel/exhaust system. So, the fuel never comes into contact with anything radioactive. Either it flows over the outside of the containmente vessel, or it goes through a heat exchanger where it picks up the heat from the cooling fluid. But either way, the exhaust gases at exit contain no more radioactive atoms when they come out the nozzle than they did in the fuel tanks. And because no radioactive particles are coming out the back, there\u0027s no reflecting of them back at ship, so no need for a \u0022shadow shield\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the whole engine itself is of course a radiation source. But it\u0027s got enough shielding inside (which is why the engine is so heavy) to keep that from causing any problems. I mean, space is totally filled up with huge amounts of extremely nasty hard radiation from Kerbol and all the other stars in the sky. Any ship that has enough shielding to deal with this radiation on a long-term mission can easily shrug off what little comes from its LV-Ns. And even if it can\u0027t, from the crew\u0027s POV, the LV-N\u0027s radiation is the LEAST of their problems \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, in my game, LV-Ns pose no problems to the crew or planets during normal operation.

Analysis showed this was pretty close to what you could expect from a crash. Anyway, IIRC, it only contaminated an area about 1/2 an acre, and this was cleaned up fairly easily.
