Craft like the Saturn V had fully automated ascent sequences in order to more accurately control the process and respond faster to situations. The space shuttle was mostly automated as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut both vessels had their crews highly trained to fly the ship in the event anything went wrong beyond what the automation could tolerate. They still had to knwo how to fly, and at all times they manually cross-checked everything the automation did to make sure it was working correctly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, historical accuracy aside, KSP is meant to be played however you see fit. And just like in real life, automation is all well and good until it messes up, or your ship messes up in a way the computer can\u0027t handle. Then you\u0027d better know how to fly or the mission will not be completed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is a single player game. The only standards for cheating that it maintains would be using the builtin debug menu for such fun as infinite fuel- and even then some people who just want to build things and don\u0027t care for the flight aspect might have more fun flying in infinite fuel mode all the time stationbuilding. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny argument beyond that over the legitimacy of game mods is purely a matter of personal preference. Squad provided a modding API for people to use, they intended for KSP to make use of game mods as the player sees fit. Berating someone else for their opinions is unacceptable behavior, and only contributes to hard feelings in the community. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately the problem is not Mechjeb. It is the human factor- people disagreeing and choosing to disrespect other people about their opinions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut since the time is not yet right for these discussions as people insist on getting heated, I\u0027ll be closing this thread now rather than waiting for it to go down that road and continue the cycle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
