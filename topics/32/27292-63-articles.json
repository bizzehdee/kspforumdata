I landed on a bit too much of a slope and toppled. I figured I could right it, but I wanted to drop the rover first. Big mistake, I didn\u0027t get a Kerbal on it first...so it slid down the slope for 2km periodically breaking pieces off and blowing them up \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then righted the lander and took jetted up the mountain I landed nearby (that big double crater with the trench right around the Munar terminator with the far side to the left looking at the Mun, smaller/top crater rim wall was my landing spot). I got to the top, planet my flag on top of \u0022Mons Adaquetus\u0022 and went to return to the lander. Since I couldn\u0027t see Kerbin from the top because a higher peak was nearby, I figured jetting up higher. I got to about 1km high and Kerbin rose behind the mountain peak. Beautiful view...and then I came in WAY too fast landing next to the lander and snuffed a Kerbal. Apparently as I switched back to the lander I accidently still had my finger on the shift button desperately trying to save my kerbal...well it was just enough thrust I couldn\u0027t recover and the lander tipped over and rolled down the slope breaking apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edang.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did at least return my one orbiting Kerbal in my CSM above the Mun to Kerbin safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime to redo the mission tonight/tomorrow.
