Like how the corners of a high speed race track are tilted in, the SAS tries to tilt your ship the same way if your control is straight up. If your control is forwards, it tries and makes the front of your car/plane spin flat - which could help with turning.

Its acceleration was pretty slow, but I\u0027d regularly cruise along at ~20m/s on Mun. The only real headache was when it\u0027d throw a tire, but since it was a manned rover it wasn\u0027t hard to fix. I could drive it all over Mun, and use it to refill landed vessels; this isn\u0027t really necessary for Mun, but I\u0027d intended it for use on places like Pol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese days, I have two different rovers. One is a 500-ton behemoth version of the above rover (\u003Cstrong\u003EMun Unit Zappa\u003C/strong\u003E), but I\u0027m in the process of switching it to caterpillar treads since it was destroying tires constantly. The other is a much smaller 25-ton rover (the \u003Cstrong\u003EIguana 1b\u003C/strong\u003E), shown here leaving Kerbin orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RM5aK3F.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RM5aK3F.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, the fact that it\u0027s got more than four wheels makes a big difference. (The VTOL engine pods on the side means it can fly itself to Mun if need be, but I mainly use them for jumping crater walls and such.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo again, you don\u0027t need to keep it small if you don\u0027t want to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-14T23:16:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Avera9eJoe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Avera9eJoe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...Does this make sense?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith three dimensions of freedom it does, but not when SAS can\u0027t do much except, maybe, lift some wheels off the ground in two dimensions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry pointing the right way; you\u0027ll find everything not only makes more sense but also works almost like you\u0027d want it to.
