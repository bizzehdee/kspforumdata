What do you guys do when you know that a crew is going to be lost with no hope of recovery? (Things like running out of fuel in the middle of a landing or you p[arachutes failing on reentry.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T17:57:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 05:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ototcon**"},{"CreatedByName":"7499275","CreatedById":70640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T17:07:25Z","Content":"Still try my best to save them, always try to save your crew even if you know there is a 0.0001 percent chance of saving them."},{"CreatedByName":"luizopiloto","CreatedById":97503,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T17:12:18Z","Content":"no possibilities to change orbital trajectory at Ap to a free return to kerbin?\n\nOr at last close enough so you can rendezvous a rescue ship?"},{"CreatedByName":"ototcon","CreatedById":116434,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T17:15:44Z","Content":"I\u0027m using TAC LS and they crew doesn\u0027t have enough supplies to last until a rescue ship comes.\n\nOh, and my current plan is to send a ship to recover the ship and send it back to Kerbin.

Several other sci-fi tales, including the movie *Avatar* use a similar setup with a coast phase in between burns. THis is probably the more practical method, rather than burning continuously (which could yield some rather insane velocities on the way to Eeloo!)"},{"CreatedByName":"Camaron","CreatedById":100218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T18:45:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E well... you can make a fast craft to reach your kerbals before they die... just need fuel and 4 mainsails...\n\nIt\u0027s not mainsails you would need.
