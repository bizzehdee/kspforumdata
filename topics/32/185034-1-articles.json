It seems you\u00A0need to slam something massive and fast into the ground as close to the sensor as possible. I took along an extra little craft just for this purpose to Minmus and got lots of science. On Duna I relied on dropping some spare stuff just after lift-off and this gave zero science.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach experiment, the antenna and the control box all use one unit of power. Meaning you need 5 units of power for a full suite. The deployable solar panel and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E each produce 4 units of power when deployed by a 5* engineer, so you need two (assuming you have Comm Network turned on and so need the antenna and you deploy 3 experiments).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know how often the science gets generated and sent back. During the transfer from Duna (2 years?) I got several science return messages and these dried up by the time I got\u00A0back.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know if I\u0027ll get the extra missing science from the experiments over time e.g. I only have about 50% return on the weather experiment on Duna.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also deployed the experiments in all the biomes on Kerbin. As you\u0027d expect the returns were much less, typically around 12-25 science per experiment in total. Worth the effort?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverall I\u0027d say they have made an interesting alternative way to generate science. They don\u0027t seem \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
