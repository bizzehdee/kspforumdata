Put some fins on the bottom stage and add RCS thrusters at the top of the craft as well as near the bottom of each stage. The idea with RCS thrusters is to always have a set sitting at either end of the craft (the middle doesn\\\u0027t matter in this case) so the craft can be turned by applying force at the ends of the craft. BY putting at the bottom of each stage, when you separate you will still have a set at the new bottom of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wired2thenet","CreatedById":18275,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-29T17:23:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI regularly launch heavy ships, and the Capt\\\u0027n here is absolutely 100% correct. Note that the amount of thrusters on the top (at least it works best for me) is to add a few more than on a the middle and lower stages, to get the rocket moving just a little quicker. Also note that it is sometimes better to \u0027burst\u0027 RCS thrust, not leave it on constantly (ie, tap thrust, pause, tap thrust, pause) for the heavier ships.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
