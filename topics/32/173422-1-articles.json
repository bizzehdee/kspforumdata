Before I start talking, please notice that I\u0027m no good at English. If I made any English errors, please forgive me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFew days ago, it\u0027s the April Fool\u0027s Day. That day, the president of the forum \u0027Hoya\u0027 noticed that he(I don\u0027t know his/her gender, but I\u0027ll use he) fired all of the staffs in forum\u00A0without him. At first, the members\u00A0thought he was\u00A0doing the fool thing. But later he noticed again about it, the situation has becoem worse. Also he abolished all election system of the forum. It\u0027s been 3 days that his dictatorship has started. He hasn\u0027t explained enough for the whole members why he stared the dictatorship. \u00A0In addition, before the dictatocrship, he didn\u0027t use his power that much. Also some members including me has thought that the forum is becoming like S.Korea in 2016 when Rasputin Scandle in Korea started. Many memebers are complaining about the lack of explanation. But Hoya hasn\u0027t answered to anyone in the forum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany members are worried about when Hoya sold the forum to other person. Also there is a fear about that the member who has complained can be\u00A0forced to leave the forum by him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just want all players of KSP\u00A0to notice that Korean Forum is out of control including\u00A0Hoya. The members hope that the forum becomes normal as before April 1st. The members want democracy, just like Korean tried to fight with the corrupted president during candle rally during 2016-2017 and democratic election of the staffs. I hope everything becomes as normal. Have a nice day.:(\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-03T11:07:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wasn\u0027t aware that there was an official Korean KSP forum?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAren\u0027t all the language sub-forums right here on this one?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this is an un-official forum, then whomever \u0022owns\u0022 it has every right to delete all his staff and become a dictator.

It has over 5 years long history. Also the most of them doesn\u0027t see that the forum is owned by him. He didn\u0027t work at all until few days ago. So you can see that the forum has been grown by 12000 normal members. Also the forum is leading Korean players of KSP\u00A0in S.Korea. The forum has similar system with this forum but it is also democratic system.\u00A0The members are making Korean language pack for KSP. In addition, I heard the they sent the pack to the development team of KSP. The forum had worked well with democratic system by the members until his dictatorship started. You should know that Koreans has thought the democracy VERY VERY important since 1960 when the\u00A0first president of S.Korea stepped down by democratic rally. I hope the whole players to notice that even Korean forum isn\u0027t as\u00A0big as this forum, but it is the biggest democratic KSP forum in S.Korea which has 12000 members and it\u0027s not owned by any person.
