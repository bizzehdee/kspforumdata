In my career mode, I\u0027ve landed on the mun 3 times, and minmus twice. And the scince I\u0027m earning for doing so is just getting smaller and smaller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel as though I need a big move to bring in those science points. So I\u0027m thinking of trying for duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly trouble is, I don\u0027t have Nuclear engines, or aerospikes. So I don\u0027t see getting to duna as realistic w/out either one of them. My question is, how long did you wait before going for broke, and just getting out of kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you wait till you unlocked docking ports and nuclear engines?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you fire up the game for the first time, and build a rocket for duna and back out of nothing but a command pod and srb\u0027s?
