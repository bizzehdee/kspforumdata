I go through all the mods and pick out the few pieces I\\\u0027d need but I still find that as my parts folder grows, even with smaller rockets there seems to be more lag than before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is normal I\\\u0027ll have to go through and sort out all the parts that I thought I\\\u0027d use that I\\\u0027ll have to live without.

Due to the programming of Unity (the engine KSP is built on), it cannot load parts on-the-fly. They all have to be loaded and kept in memory from the very start. As such, the more parts you have in the parts folder, the slower your game gets, to the point of running out of memory on some systems when too many are installed for the system to handle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least, last time I saw this explained, that was roughly how the Devs explained it, IIRC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, there are plans to try to change this in future, with workarounds and all that.
