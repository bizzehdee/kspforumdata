No it isn\u0027t! That\u0027s how NASA faked the Moon landings: they put a TON of air intakes on a flight of P-51D Mustangs and flew them to the Moon with a bunch of props. It cost about $3.2 million altogether in 60s money. A real Moon landing would have been $24 billion, and just lying about it would have been about $135 billion.\n\n(As everybody knows, rockets don\u0027t work in space due to Newton\u0027s Third Law.

The idea is two-fold. 1) Even in thin air, you are decreasing your drop rate slightly, giving you more time before getting to thicker atmosphere 2) Being angled up means you are creating more drag and thus decreasing your speed faster. This way when you reach those very hot altitudes, you\u0027ll have less speed. I also use two air brakes on the top rear of my plane and deploy them to decrease speed and help keep the nose pitched up.\n\nSecondly, when you burn retrograde, don\u0027t drop your periapsis very far. I would say no further than 60km. You want to spend as much time in the upper atmosphere slowing down. Burning retrograde to a very low periapsis means you are going to enter the atmosphere with alot more vertical drop rate, thus getting down to thick atmosphere wile you are still going very fast."},{"CreatedByName":"SelectHalfling0","CreatedById":105051,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T21:14:01Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been able to build successful spaceplanes from the start, but my planes intakes (RAM intakes) keep exploding due to heating on reentry.

They basically heat up quickly and theres only one point behind it to transfer the heat to. If that point is also the same part thats attached to the engine, it\u0027ll be receiving heat on both ends during ascent, making things quite toasty."}]}
