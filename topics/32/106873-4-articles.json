I loved abusing the hell out of it. Basic planes and how the handled. I do agree I hate them. Still could make and fly them. Just way to much work to keep up in the air. Rockets are well rockets. Always fun regardless of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.0 Changes to the lift made it nicer to play with place that is for sure. Never got the chance to really try and make SSTO planes. The few times I tried did not go to well due to the runways being bumpy and was only playing that version with mainly rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.0.2 Very fun to fly planes. Did some flying with stock plane with basic engine and could keep it at close to the same altitude with almost no input needed by me for 30\u002B minutes. I have the feling if I was not trying to do contracts at the time. The plane would just stay up in the air as long as it has fuel. Like how the engines drain fuel evenly even though that is a pain for when I was trying to make SSTO planes. They kept eating at the fuel and had no way to transfer the fuel back. No fuel lines or reasorce transfers yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, over all. The thing I find most odd about the aero update is. That the first basic intake still had plenty of air in it, think about 0.17 to 0.23 left in it when the engine (only using one) cut out. At least my way of thinking. The basic should have flamed out a lot closer to 0.01 since the drain was about that. I understand that my thrust out put should be very little at high up due to lack of air going in. But, when placing 2 intakes the engine (using one still) shutting down is still about the same with the intakes having even more stored air in them. Which is what I find very very weird. While not expecting much gain. It is just weird that the engine still cuts out around the same altitude. Can accept that there will be some air still there as that is the pressure point for flame out. Just not when there is a tiny bit moar air left in. I do realize moar testing needs to be done. I\u0027ll try 3, 4, 5, 6, and up when I get the chance to. Certainly don\u0027t feel like playing in sandbox mode to find out nor redoing it over and over to find out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther then that.

My rocket flipping problem also turned out to be happening at a Mach number of 0.98-1.02. It would be fine at 0.95, but then at 0.98 it would start to tip and once past 10 degrees or so it would flip backwards...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E^^THIS is what I found out as well. The increase of drag in the transonic region was having a BIG effect on my vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith spaceplanes, my plane would get stuck bumping up against that drag-increase spike and simply couldn\u0027t push through to the promised land where the drag coefficient drops again. But, by getting to the correct altitude and flying horizontally (some planes can benefit from a bit of a dive here, especially if their TWR is low), I could get the plane through the barrier and speed would increase rapidly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor rockets, I found that the drag bump in the transonic region was causing my rockets to tumble because the drag forces on the nose that are the cause of the tumble increase rapidly then. So, after launch (upon hitting 80 m/s) I pitch over pretty aggressively (still keeping the heading pointer close to the prograde marker). But as the ship reaches the mid-300 m/s speed, I pull back my heading pointer close to the center of the prograde marker until the rocket\u0027s speed has gotten up into the 400\u002B m/s region and increasing...then I go back to increasing pitchover.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T17:52:54Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 05:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fleb","CreatedById":63851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T18:28:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.02 feels more like what I have experienced in most flight sims so far. 1.0 was ridiculous, it was like there was hardly any atmosphere at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"foxkill2342","CreatedById":120834,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T18:35:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you ever pitched down 25 degrees in a plane?
