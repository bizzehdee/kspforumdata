The last post on the thread was from 2013, so let\u0027s not necro-post there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nWhat I\u0027m thinking about is whether there\u0027s interest in the community to create something similar to that. Now that we have 1.0 out, a reasonably stable Realism Overhaul mod, and projects such as the\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/124561-apollo-mission-recreation-and-more-requesting-ground-crew-aid/\u0026amp;page=1\u0022\u003EApollo Mission Recreation\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0one, I think that it\u0027s a great time to do that. The only thing left to decide is if people are interested (please vote in the poll!).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSo here\u0027s my plan:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThis magazine would be a PDF posted here in the forums with a few articles relating to space, science, and technology neatly edited together. To make sure it doesn\u0027t feel like a job and have articles actually be completed, I think a monthly cycle would be best, as well as the inclusion of many types of articles. Some ideas:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003EKerbin Scientific Journal\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAn article about some scientific investigation within the game (for example: finding the size of the Kerbin crater and estimating the impact that caused it). This section would be a scientific article written with some scientific rigor (I mean, it\u0027s a game after all), and the published ones would be the most interesting or the most scientific of submissions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbin Innovation and Achievement Records\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nA write-up about a mission within KSP that was important in some way, such as a submarine mission to Eve with return. Articles would be chosen based on how well it\u0027s written as well as how cool or novel the mission was. In this section there could be competitions, such as a Red Bull Air Race styled one with the same plane for everyone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EReal-Life Space Column\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nColumns about some piece of news, personal opinion, or discussion on some topic relating to real life aerospace technology, astrophysics, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nIt\u0027s really up to how much the community is interested in it, though.
