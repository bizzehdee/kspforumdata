It\u0027s not so much a space station as a starship, because it\u0027s battleship-shaped and has its own propulsion. I\u0027m obviously going to construct it in orbit. The question is, what orbit? Would it be easier to build my whole starship in Kerbin orbit, then send it to eve, or to send the pieces individually and assemble them there?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhyunix","CreatedById":59383,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T20:46:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou want a low orbit around Kerbin to start your construction. Make sure that you can easily get to the orbit without dipping into the atmosphere to catch up with the construction site.

Then, once in Eve orbit, arrange and dock them, then move the whole thing to a different orbit to escape the debris (of transfer stages).

Imagine this: the super important propulsion module for the ship has arrived. Preparing to dock! Oh $%#\u0026amp; the ASAS chewed up the RCS mid transfer!. That would really suck. Assemble it, refuel, and head to Eve.

Instead of changing your ships orbit to get out of the debris field from your launchers, do what I do for my single use tugs (final stage that docks the part to station/ship). Stick a probe core and a battery on the tug. Its light so the added weight wont prevent you from reaching orbit and it will allow you to control that stage so you can de orbit it yourself and get it out of your ship/stations way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, if you are building a station, build it in eve orbit, those things can be ridiculously hard to move! If a ship build it in Kerbin orbit since you don\u0027t want to fly it all the way to Eve only to realize you forgot a part necessary for the return trip.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
