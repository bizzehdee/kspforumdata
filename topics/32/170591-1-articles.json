We had an observing night on the Keck telescope, MOSFIRE I think, and the weather was bad. High humidity, precipitation at the summit; the telescope operator was never even able to move the telescope and open the dome. Myself and one of the grad students in our group were in the remote observing facility, and were playing around with some browser games or something.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe asked if I\u0027d ever played KSP. I didn\u0027t know what he was talking about (at the time, I wasn\u0027t really using Steam much to discover games like I do now). He had played around but never really seriously played, so we booted it up, mod-free. It took us 2-3 hours to get something to space. I had taken an orbital mechanics class in undergrad but surprisingly I don\u0027t think we had ever calculated transfer orbits, or burn directions, etc. Just deriving equations and calculating orbital properties; it wasn\u0027t orbital\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edynamics\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0after all \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter getting a Kerbal to space, we decided to EVA. We immediately lost control of the Kerbal and sent him hurtling irretrievably into space. This game was making me re-think controls in gaming in a way that I had never experienced, in 25 years of gaming. Eventually before the sun came up (in Hawaii), we had sent a Kerbal to a fly-by of the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNormally after an observing night I come home and crash, but I was pumped up to buy KSP. I bought it and\u00A0started digging into mods (I was a heavy WoW mod-user, so I loved that KSP had an active mod community, it was a big selling point for me). That first day I had mechjeb and Kerbal Engineer and a few parts mods with engines; I was on my way. I did my first rendezvous and botched the docking, of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end I was up ~32 hours straight, the last ~20 of them playing KSP.
