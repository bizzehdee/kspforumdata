I looked at my mun station, which didn\u0027t even have enough LF to fully fuel the lander (with a capacity equivalent to 1x FL-T400)\n\n- They all looked very uneasy. It set the mood: that ISRU payload needs to set down safely, it needs to go to a spot with ore (indeed, some spots have 0, and no amount of timewarp will help), or they were out of luck (err... well, actualy or I\u0027d need to send another ship, but whatever).\n\nIf Jeb was there, laughing, it would break immersion: lol, Kerbals can just wait decades for rescue, they photosynthesize or something."},{"CreatedByName":"vicwarrior","CreatedById":120410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T17:36:48Z","Content":"My only kerbal to reach Jeb\u0027s level is Val.\n\nThe amount of times she should have been rescued and the amount of times she has been rescued is uncanny."},{"CreatedByName":"luizopiloto","CreatedById":97503,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T19:36:44Z","Content":"Bob...\n\nhe did this:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/obfhJNB8hfo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T19:44:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Bob...\n\u003E he did this:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/obfhJNB8hfo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nOh my god...."},{"CreatedByName":"polan","CreatedById":131811,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T21:22:11Z","Content":"We found it"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T22:08:56Z","Content":"My \u0022boss\u0022 Kerbals:\n\n- Lola Kerman, the first to go to Pol - or at least convince Mission Control that she\u0027d gone to Pol when really she\u0027d just gone to the Flag **Pol**e.
