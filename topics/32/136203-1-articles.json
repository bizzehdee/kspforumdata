Have one player limited to IVA view, and one being in mission control with more info, and they both need to actually play together to get things done. Make time-warp at the discretion of one person in mission control, maybe make it so that multiple people can be in mission control, and make it so that each other player controls a vessel. There are some way to make KSP a truly meaningful MP game, but I don\u0027t think just having multiple people play their own space program in the same world benefits KSP much.

Sure, as others have noted, you can dogfight... but at its core that is not what KSP is about. \u00A0The core of the game is about designing your own ships, flying them into space, and going places with them on journeys spanning a\u00A0minimum of virtual hours, up to journeys of\u00A0virtual years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMultiplayer really only serves atmospheric flights in Kerbin.\u00A0\u00A0Once your in LKO, what does multiplayer bring.... essentially somebody else gets to service your spacestation. Maneuvering in space is easy.... point in the right direction and burn (planning the maneuvers is the real skill, not point the craft and pressing Lshift). Does doing this in formation with a friend really gain you much... docking them for the burn would make more sense anyway. Also does arriving at a planet where your friend has previously placed his/her ship really gain you much either?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it feels like Squad is forced to include it because very few games have no multiplayer, its virtually a requirement to publish a game nowadays. Which is probably why it has been so far down the priority list... even Squad can\u0027t see how it be benefits the core game\u00A0but know they have to do it eventually anyway.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact, putting my conspiracy theorist tin-foil hat on for a moment, I\u0027d not be surprised if the deal to get it onto the consoles requires multiplayer either to be implemented, or plans to do so to be well advanced.

I particularly like the co-operative space program idea, where a player is the pilot, another is mission control etc.... athougth it runs the risk of being boring for anyone other than mission control. Think about it, \u0022Pilot, point prograde now and burn till I say stop....\u0022\u00A0The idea of the rival space program could be good to. Essentially it could be a first to place a flag on (planet). The game clock determining the winner. Permanent infrastructure (space stations, bases, flags) appearing in both players games (not necessarily active ships) could give a sense of being in the same world (although time warp still creates problems with this too, including the possibility for time\u00A0paradoxes).\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-06T23:21:22Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2016 11:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Tourist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CattyNebulart","CreatedById":79428,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-06T23:24:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just want multiplayer to play coop with my girlfriend...

One player would send up the core module, then send the save file to the next, where they would add a laboratory, and then so on. \u00A0Even Danny2462 chipped in with a mass relay and a fighter, the latter being quite ridiculous but I definitely like his idea for the mass relay on a space station. It proved to be more stable than the rest of the station, once he got it up there. \u00A0It is projects like these I would like to see more of, myself. \u00A0KSP may seem a bit single-player oriented, but this\u00A0community shows that there are plenty of ways around that. \u00A0Between projects like the IYMSS and all the challenge submissions on the forum here, we already have a strong multiplayer component to the game. We should take more advantage of that while we await to see what Squad has in mind for a stock multiplayer game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"max_creative","CreatedById":159640,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-09T00:08:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMultiplayer would be awesome.
