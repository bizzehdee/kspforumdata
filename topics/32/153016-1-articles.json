At normal time wrap (not phys-) - even mild 5x, \u0027\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0027 - collisions between near craft/objects don\u0027t work. Two ships can\u00A0 literally phase through each other. The moment you come out of warp, physics kicks in, and current \u0027conflicts\u0027 get resolved - sometimes in an explosive manner. If your kerbals happened to \u0027phase\u0027 into the shift, and you came out of time warp - kerbals are softer than ship parts; Poof-Poof, gone!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
