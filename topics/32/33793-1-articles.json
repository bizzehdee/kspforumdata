This means it has no internal heat source, and it\u0027s simply radiating energy left over from it\u0027s formation. Therefore its temperature and thus color change with its age, becoming more cooler and more and more infrared in color as time goes by. Given it\u0027s mass it would probably be considered a sub-brown dwarf. I can\u0027t find any good models for calculating the temperature of such an object, so I\u0027ll just go with an example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=%404057946\u0026amp;name=ULAS%20J003402.77-005206.7\u0026amp;-c=00%2034%2002.8200%20-00%2052%2005.700#lab_notes\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EULAS J003402.77\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u2122005206.7\u003C/a\u003E is a brown dwarf discovered in 2007 that is estimated to be between 500 and 700K in temperature and between 15 to 36 Jupiter masses. So it\u0027s still a bit larger than our Kerbol. Using Wien\u0027s displacement law to calculate color from temperature, we find it would be about 5.8 micrometers wavelength of light. This puts it in the infrared area of the spectrum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s just assume that Kerbol has this star\u0027s temperature, and see where that puts us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s use the wiki values for the radius of Kerbol and Kerbin, and assume there\u0027s no albedo (because I don\u0027t know what it is).

Use the measured radius of Kerbol ingame, or use the theoretical radius of an M2 star on the main sequence. Since very careful observations by our Kerbal astronomers (written down in \u003Cem\u003Epen\u003C/em\u003E no less) have confirmed Kerbol\u0027s radius to be 261,600 km I\u0027m going to go with that, as it\u0027d be pointless to do this for a wrong value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame calc as before, gives 345 K, or about 72 degrees C. Conceivable considering I didn\u0027t factor in albedo of Kerbin which would cool this temperature down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut.... If you used the theoretical values, you get approximately 390 K , or 117 degrees C. A bit too hot to save with albedo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this is all pointless since we \u003Cem\u003Eknow\u003C/em\u003E the values for Kerbol\u0027s mass and radius (again, written down in pen no less)! So let\u0027s drop this arbitrary fixing of Kerbol\u0027s parameters and figure out just what this object is and how it works like true scientists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can work this equation backwards to estimate Kerbol\u0027s effective temperature. Assuming Kerbin has an average temperature of 20 C (or 293 K), we can find Kerbol\u0027s effective surface temperature:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ET(Kerbin) / sqr( Radius(Kerbol) / 2D) = T(Kerbol)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat gives me an effective temperature of 2988 K (or just about 3000 K considering this is just a rough approximation). So it\u0027s an object with 0.009 solar mass, 0.38 solar radii, and a temperature of about 3000 K. That puts it way off the main sequence, but that just makes it more interesting. Let\u0027s figure out what materials / heat source could make an object such as that. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-19T17:19:49Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2013 05:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by AceMgy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheTriniFlyer","CreatedById":63334,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T20:30:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I just did some \u0027rudimentary\u0027 calculations (Very Rudimentary, to the Effect that I can be wrong, so please correct me if I am) and I figured out that Kerbol\u0027s \u003Cem\u003ECircumstellar\u003C/em\u003E Habitable zone According to:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMass: ! \u003Cem\u003EKerbol cannot support nuclear fusion\u003C/em\u003E !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadius: About 19 500 000 KM which is near Duna\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuminosity: About 1.2 AU which past Eeloo\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-19T20:37:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2013 08:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by TheTriniFlyer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T23:52:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, seeing it this way, I can only come to the conclusion Kerbol isn\u0027t a natural object.

Technically, given the universe is big enough, if we go a Googol LY in one direction, we will start seeing repetitions, because after this distance, literally every possible molecular position has been achieved.
