I\u0027ve already started a sandbox playthrough. But I\u0027m still having second thoughts, because I\u0027m abandoning everything I\u0027ve built. Again. Which is my own fault, but still... So I\u0027ll bother you with a summary first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve completed the tech tree on easy-, on medium-, on hard-ish difficulty, and that suffix is there because I play with quicksaves on. And I\u0027ve had the game crash in a way that corrupted the persistent savefile, so I\u0027m not turning them off. I\u0027ve landed on every stock body one can actually land on (and made it back to Kerbin), I\u0027ve been inside Jool\u0027s atmosphere, I\u0027ve been in low Kerbol orbit, I\u0027ve landed an asteroid at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, I\u0027ve hitched a ride on a comet. I\u0027ve been to Mohole, seen the dead kraken, parked a mobile base next to the face on Duna... I\u0027ve built a fully-reusable fleet that can ferry tourists to Duna and back. Am I a great KSP player? Not in the slightest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I\u0027ve (again) gotten to a point where money is not an issue. I have in effect an unlimited amount of money, all I have to do to gain more is fulfill contracts that offer no challenge and no fun. I\u0027m (again) at a point where I have no new tech to discover. All that remains is having fun and getting better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can switch to sandbox and do just that, but that means an empty tracking station. Again. Sure, I can have fun and build whatever I feel like and I don\u0027t have to waste time grinding for money. But all the infrastructure I\u0027ve built in career is gone. All the relays, all the mining ships,all the bases... Everything. So...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose of you who have experience similar to mine, what late-game do you find more rewarding? Continuing with the career mode, with all the grind to finance the fun stuff? Or the sandbox mode with no grind, but you have to start from scratch and you might feel you\u0027re getting stuff for free now?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lemon cup","CreatedById":199693,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-08T03:28:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m not exactly sure whether mentioning the Alt\u002BF12 menu around here\u00A0is a social faux pas or what, but have you ever thought about using it to cheat funds?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat way you can stay in your current game with all of your hard work in the form of bases and stations still in place, without having to worry about grinding for cash.
