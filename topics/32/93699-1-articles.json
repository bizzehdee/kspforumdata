Then, having read about people putting multiple rockets on a single asteroid, decided to try it. Got two ships clamped onto the same asteroid! Woohoo! Only problem is that they were pointed 90 degrees to each other. So I tried moving both of them to a \u0027flatter\u0027 spot on the asteroid where hopefully I could get both pointing sort of the same direction. When moving one of them (the original one I had attached to the asteroid), I found that if I had both RCS and SAS engaged at the same time, the ship would shake violently and RCS would fire lots of directions trying to control it. The shaking got worse the farther I was away from the asteroid/other ship. This makes sense based on what I saw in HarvesteR\u0027s talk at unity 2013, as an example of compounding floating point variations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/mXTxQko-JH0?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got both rockets moved around and pointed at about 20 degrees from each other, both aimed roughly at the center of mass. Firing both at the same time was controllable and looked pretty cool in a wacky kind of way. Looked even more cool to have this thing flying over Kerbin\u0027s south pole. I wanted to take a screenshot, had to look up how to take a screenshot, went to remap the keys (function keys don\u0027t work quite right on my Mac for OS reasons), switched back to my ship.... and suddenly the Mechjeb dialogs all go away and when I look at the map view my ship weighs 0.1t and there\u0027s a string of debris there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOops. Guess I should have learned about savefiles sooner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy ship (admittedly the more structurally unsound one) was reduced to its probe core. the rest of it was in a string of debris across several hunded km. The \u0027explosion\u0027 was violent enough to cause most of the debris to almost stop in its orbit and start falling toward the planet. Somehow it even slowed the whole asteroid and put it on a suborbital trajectory! (Tho not quite as straight toward the planet as some of the other stuff, the periapsis was lowered from ~90km to ~53km).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s not good. I\u0027ve spent too much time nudging this thing around, I\u0027m not giving up on it. Is any of this debris a usable ship? Yes! One of the rockets (the second and sturdier one) is still functional. So I try to re-capture the asteroid with the working ship. Crap, the grabber seems to be \u0027jammed\u0027 and won\u0027t clamp onto anything and can\u0027t be disarmed/pivoted (no such options visible in the right-click dialog for the part).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuit game, restart game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAha! Grabber can be \u0027reset\u0027 now by disarming and rearming it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy won\u0027t SAS hold a pointing at the target now? It\u0027ll stabilize, point prograde, retrograde, normal, antinormal, radial, antiradial, but won\u0027t point towards the target (button isn\u0027t available, even tho it was working before). Oh well. Grabbed the asteroid again with manual pointing. Nudged it back up into an orbit that won\u0027t decay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot pointing exactly at the center of mass. Navball is screwed up, says I\u0027m pointing near opposite the center of mass. Unclamp from the asteroid... now SAS is working properly again. Reattach to asteroid. Not perfectly lined up, but as long as I don\u0027t thrust too hard it\u0027s controllable now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it was a bit of an adventure... but that\u0027s what real spaceflight is like. Stuff goes wrong and you have to figure out how to fix it with limited tools and limited time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redchrome","CreatedById":132090,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T19:51:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the saying goes, \u0022Folks, this ain\u0027t normal\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECouldn\u0027t have made a prettier debris cloud if I tried tho.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that some parts stayed sort of on their original orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm12/redchrome/kraken-bites-asteroid-grabber-2014-12-18.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kraken-bites-asteroid-grabber-2014-12-18.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-20T01:40:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Klaw is the buggiest thing in KSP. If you get hit with that kind of kraken, which I hate more than Satan, (makes unintelligible ranting grunting sound) your best bet is to check your craft for clipped parts. An RTG or the sort clipped inside can cause that. I really don\u0027t know the real cause of it, I do know that on crafts that have a high part count and lots of \u003Cstrong\u003Eradial \u003C/strong\u003Econnections tend to do this more often.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcedural Fairings seems to cause issues as well...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redchrome","CreatedById":132090,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-20T13:19:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the advice @waterlubber.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket that came apart did indeed have a couple of RTGs around a probe core, along with an antenna and a gravioli detector. Unfortunately I had put a Tiny probe core in line with a grabber (which is a Small) and some Small tanks. So it was pretty floppy to begin with. Once I used all Small-diameter parts for my probes, it got much stiffer. I eventually got a few more rockets stuck to it (and my docking skills have gotten much better!), nudging it closer to the equatorial plane every time (and thus making the next launch easier). It flies better than you might think, really. Now let\u0027s see if the Kraken bites me again when I try to tie this to another asteroid or five. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm12/redchrome/porcupine-asteroid-0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022porcupine-asteroid-0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
