Now these sats all launch on lifters designed to leave no debris, i dont drop boosters in stable orbits, specifically to reduce Kessler Syndrome. What I didn\u0027t allow for however was the disposal of aerodynamic parts added to stabilise the launches with FAR. So I got a swarm of nosecones blitzing round Kerbin in a variety of stable orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo sweat I think, I\u0027ve played enough KSP to know the likelihood of collision is slim, even when shooting for the same orbit all the time around the little planet of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I had entirely forgotten was that one of the career save\u0027s very early flights was launched westwards into a retrograde orbit.

Chuckling to myself I aligned for my circularisation burn, lit the engines and started to stabilise the orbit, and suddenly \u0027BANG\u0027, bits of junk spinning everywhere. The aerodynamic nosecone from that westward sat had passed close enough to tear a radiator off the piloted ship. Im now very glad that KSP isnt doing impact energy calculations; the debris massed about 150kg but struck with a relative velocity of approx 5kms. Feels like I should have been instantly vaporised.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately I was forced to abort the launch of the reactors entirely. The loss of 1 radiator wasnt going to be enough to cause catastrophic overheating, but it did hammer the efficiency of the generators to the point where there wasnt much point in having them up there.

I staggered all the launches so that although each vehicle was in the same orbit, they were all well spaced out. The second stage of the launcher had roughly 300m/s left in the tanks after getting to that parking orbit, so when the transfer windows opened, the first stage was pretty much enough to create an elliptical Kerbin orbit before jettison and continuing with the transfer stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hadn\u0027t considered that this would place those spent boosters in an orbit with a pe of ~100km but different orbital period, so the intersect processes with time. One of the last probes to depart came within 2km of a sister probe\u0027s spent booster (albeit with very little closing speed). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMade me wonder what happens if a non-active ship collides with debris.
