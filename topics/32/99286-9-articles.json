For me, it started with the announcement that Curse would be the official mod repository. This decision was made behind closed doors and the community was only informed once it was a done deal, appearing to indicate that Squad didn\u0027t really care what the community (who would actually be using the service) thought about it. Then there was the announcement that the next release will be 1.0. Long story short, I feel the game isn\u0027t even really ready for beta given the number of new features and systems being planned for a supposed 1.0 release. There have been many posts echoing this sentiment, and the lack of response on the issue leaves me (and likely many others based on what I\u0027ve seen) feeling yet again that the devs have decided to basically do what they want, regardless of the community concerns. The devnotes that started this particular fiasco not only seemed to reinforced the point that the team is still dead set on making the next version 1.0, but went further with the infamous reddit poll, seeming to indicate that the devs aren\u0027t really interested in what the forum community has to say.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said, I really want to see this game succeed, and I\u0027m certain that the current frustrations are due more to poor communication than any kind of ill-will toward the forum community, but I would like to see Squad take a little more time to at least be a little more consistent in informing the community as to what is going on (as per the poll that started this thread) and also acknowledge the community concerns instead of appearing to ignore them.
