Some mods come with a license that allows you to redistribute and repackage, some don\u0027t. And, including the whole GameData folder with the Squad assets would definitely be a no-no.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for suggestions, I\u0027ll suggest keeping the total amount of extra parts to a minimum so that people without supercomputers can run the game without massive start times. Beautification mods like the clouds and planet texture enhancements can usually be optional and definitely worth adding, but for instance, allowing the Novapunch2 parts pack (as good as it is) means everyone wanting to use the server needs a huge mass of extra parts to load up before the game starts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I\u0027ve also moved the thread to General Discussion. It doesn\u0027t belong in Rocket Builders, and for now GD is about the most suitable place.
