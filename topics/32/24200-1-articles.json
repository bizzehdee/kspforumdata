This means I completely understand the way the timings work for each update. They do not even attempt to estimate the times between each update. I am on this forum every morning (I\u0027m in Australia, so morning seems the best time for up-to-date news), eagerly awaiting ANY sort of news regarding a new update because I have absolutely no idea when it will be out. I agree that Squad is an incredible game developer in the sense that they refuse to be swayed by other, large, gaming corporations, but I wish that they would give us some sort of estimated timing for the next update. The times between each update seemed to be consistent up until 0.18 where, until then, there had been a 2 month wait between updates. After 0.18 there was a FOUR month wait for 0.19, from hence they announced smaller times betweens updates. It\u0027s been over 1 month now, almost 2 months, since 0.19 has been released and no sign of an update. They say they\u0027re still working on things but they don\u0027t even seem to be nearing a release. No mention of resources has been made since the GFC (Great Forum Crash) and they have kept us, disappointingly, in the dark. I know I said they\u0027re good because they aren\u0027t influenced by big game devs, however, I believe they could take a leaf out of their books and give an estimate of timings for the next update. Even if they say \u0022it is still weeks, if not months, away\u0022 I would be happy. I could then not wake up eagerly anticipating a new post saying \u00220.20 IS OUT!\u0022 and getting really excited. I could think, \u0022it\u0027s still a while away, there\u0027s no sense me getting too excited over this, I\u0027ll check in a couple of weeks\u0022. I understand they don\u0027t want to get our hopes up and I agree with that, however, some sort of vague time frame would be greatly appreciated. I do love this game to bits and I believe there are SO many directions in which it could head but I just wish the devs would release a bit more information regarding the next updates. I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s a selfish request but I think there are many people in the same boat as me and that we deserve a touch more information, given that we have supported the game with our own, hard earned, cash (many of us, multiple times).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bbwonder","CreatedById":57941,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-26T15:26:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suppose if they gave weekly % progress reports on the next features to be released, it would give us an idea of an upcoming release... rather than just \u0027in progress\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027m a software developer, and it is notoriously difficult to give estimates.. you could be at what you consider 90% but then hit a bug that makes the last 10% take as long as the first 90%.. meaning you were really only 50% in time..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you should get involved in an add-on, give you something to explore / test / code while KSP is progressing?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-26T15:28:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see where you\u0027re coming from, it would be nice to have a more detailed schedule of update releases. However, I\u0027m guessing the Great Forum Crash took a lot of their resources away from developing the game to fixing the problem. I\u0027m assuming that they\u0027re putting a lot of work into the 0.20 release, as if it was something minor, then they could just release it in a 0.19.x format. I\u0027m looking forward to the resources, flag planting, and UI magic by Romfarer, as well as some of the new parts they were hinting at before the GFC. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the game itself is absolutely fantastic as is.

I managed to find a small bug in an IBM mainframe OS when I was beta testing. That little bug put back the release by about 6 months IIRC. Trying to locate bugs is more art than science at times. When I was in my prime I could find a bug and close my eyes and backtrack the bug back to the location in a million line program. Now, I have problems finding bugs in a 10 line program lol. This is my brain on drugs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EForced estimates and release dates is what has led to incomplete games being released and fixed after launch. It\u0027s all about the cash flow. In the past the developers could put the release back as many times as required to get the game completed. There were still ones that were bug ridden but that was because the development was probably flawed. Todays mentality is \u0022Let the users beta test the code but don\u0027t let them know it\u0027s a beta.\u0022 Microshaft started this with Windows 98 I think. First edition was a nightmare.
