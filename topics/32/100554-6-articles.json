The idea is a beacon is landed first, before you land the first base elements.

I can\u0027t speak for anyone else, but I don\u0027t think any less of people because they use MechJeb, or vice versa. But by the very nature of MechJeb - an autopilot - you gradually learn the various techniques from it, to the point that you no longer need the autopilots. Of course you can continue to use them if you want (to save time and effort), and there\u0027s nothing wrong with that, but you don\u0027t really need them any more. It just feels nice to be able to remove a mod you originally used as a training tool; it gives you some sense of accomplishment. (For me anyway, and doubtless many others)\n\nAnd the reason so many people keep mentioning about not using MechJeb is because the OP specifically mentioned \u0022without an autopilot\u0022 (i.e. MechJeb)\n\nEDIT: Which is what you just said.
