Finally, I get a super-elliptical orbit (apokee outside Minmus\u0027 orbit) and am able to push the spacecraft to a successful de-orbit with my jetpack, bringing Jeb to a safe landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater, I did a Minmus mission that got loads of science (over 1000 points, if memory serves) from 3 biomes (Midlands, Slopes, and Lesser Flats, if I\u0027m right.) Be careful while walking on the Slopes - on my first mission to the Slopes, I slid down a mountain 1 or 2 kilometers in altitude. I had to go to each biome twice (I needed to get EVA reports from flying and on ground, but you can only hold one EVA report at once.) My lander was in the Lesser Flats, I believe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also did a one-way Eve mission with a Stayputnik core. Now I have a mission to PLANT A FLAG ON EVE. I don\u0027t like stranding Kerbals with no hope of rescue. But this will get me a lot of cash... what to do... Has anybody made an Eve return vehicle using the new powerful SLS parts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BJ Quest","CreatedById":58716,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T23:24:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUsed the contract system on version 24. My spaceships and aircraft were a bit different because of it. Last two flights were Bill to Duna and Bob to Eve for flyby science and partial contract completion. Bill flew by Ike and Duna with just enough fuel in the vehicle to get back to Kerbin. Bob fley by Eve then Gilly for exploration and all most did not make it back.
