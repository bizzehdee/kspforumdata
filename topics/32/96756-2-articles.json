I totally agree with your statement that \u0022Certain elements of realism at the very least are fundamental to a good gameplay experience\u0022. However, when too many of those elements are used to make a game more realistic, to me, it becomes less fun and that is what links the two concepts. Its the level of \u0022realism\u0022 and the definition of what is \u0022realistic\u0022 that differs between people and makes this an issue. Everyones definition will be different and in my case, it does affect the fun I have.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehave you tried any playing with NEAR/FAR installed? i ask because i initially had reservations about changing the stock aerodynamics, however once i installed NEAR i found it to be quite helpful. it actually makes it easier getting rockets into orbit, imo. also, i didn\u0027t notice many drastic changes from stock. i had to apply a little more discretion with regard to speed in atmosphere, but with a little throttling you can actually get all kinds of insane designs into orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei guess my point is that the changes to a more \u0022realistic\u0022 design with regard to aerodynamics are barely noticeable, imo. just curious about what particular aspects of the realistic aero designs you find \u0022unfun\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PDCWolf","CreatedById":58026,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-15T16:39:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Parkaboy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Parkaboy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt was a poorly phrased statement.

If Orbiter was marketed and managed in the same manor of KSP ( and if you could build your own rockets like in ksp ) then I\u0027d bet the Orbiter devs would be giving Squad a run for their money. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot the case. I\u0027m one of the few that aspires to see KSP become just as realistic as Orbiter when it comes to design and flight. That\u0027ll never happen in the vanilla game. I understand that. But basic rocket and plane fundemetals are currently missing or are downright backwards. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t why... Or at what point people became so scarred of the word \u0022realism\u0022, but a game thats fun and realistic to the point of it being used as a teaching tool is not so farfetched. It\u0027s hard to add to what\u0027s already been beatin\u0027 out of this dead horse. What I\u0027m trying to get at ( and what I\u0027ve been trying to get at in all the other threads ). Is that realism and fun can be on the same side of one coin. If realism is approached in the silly, modular mannor ksp entails then it can thrive. Realism approached in Orbiters manner is like reading a txt book. Very black and white. Very boring. ( Orbiter vets please don\u0027t hit me lol )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the OP said... If KSP was modeled closer to real life then your designs will become even more grand and varied. And the added complexity makes for more eye candy and more joy when you complete your missions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngine Ignitor. Love that mod. Could do without limited ignitions for the sake of the argument, but ulage is a beautiful thing. Seeing retro motors pull a depleted stage away and ulage motors firing just before the engines ( and actually have it become practical ) is an awesome sight. Having to fire RCS before resarting your engines in orbit is also a very neat thing to perform and have to design for not to mention giving rcs a greater role ( seeing is how rcs is completely useless with the op reaction wheels less your docking ). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s little things like that. Not just aero... Little realistic elements that inspire MORE gameplay and design variety cannot possibly be a bad thing. And it IS fun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd imo seeing my rocket break up into pieces after it rolls over at 2kms IS fun, lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-15T18:10:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022klgraham1013\u0022 data-cite=\u0022klgraham1013\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...and now Ferram (the almighty) has me questioning the validity of your statement.
