One of my first attempts on a munar landing, no pictures, so you\u0027ll have to imagine. After numerous failed attempts to get into a stable orbit around the mun with a manned lander, i finally manage to establish one. So, being all exited, I lower the orbit. Now, here\u0027s where things went wrong. First of all, I wanted a really close orbit (I think I wanted to reproduce those TV images where the moon is rotating above the capsule and you get the feeling you would almost be able to touch it). Second, I somehow got the impression that the height of the orbit was measured from actual ground level and not from \u0022sea level\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the orbit gets closer, and closer, and I also managed to get it in a nice shape. I\u0027m flying towards the night side, so I decide to keep the orbit at around 6-7k, sit back and wait until the sun rises again. Stars are pretty, and I still can somehow guess the silhouette of the craters. Speaking of the landscape, all of a sudden a black wall is coming towards my lander at breakneck speed, so I panic, zoom out, and - I just missed some munar mountain by roughly 10 meters(?). And because I couldn\u0027t believe that the little kerbal guy nearly died (and why the hell are those height values wrong?!), I literally turn the camera to take a look at that thing I nearly crashed into. After having it checked, I turn the camera back with some kind of satisfied grin (YOU DIDN\u0027T GET ME, PUNK!), and OH SHI-. I missed a another mountain top by 10 meters.
