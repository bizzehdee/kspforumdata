Experiments with interstellar travel resulted in the homeworld of this \u0022precursor civilization\u0022 being flung out into an extremely distant orbit. Before they froze to death, they launched monoliths and other messages onto many planets and moons in hopes of seeding intelligent life. Instead, they created Kerbals, not-so-intelligent life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#222222;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nThe planet would not show up in any map and would be too distant to be observed with a telescope, making locating it by chance nearly impossible. However, players would be able to find transmitters beaming out SSTV signals on various bodies, each one of which would provide part of the orbital parameters necessary to locate it.

Had the narrative story been completed, it would also have contained part of the orbital parameters. Because the story was never implemented into the game, this explanation for the SSTV signal\u0027s imagery is arguably non-canon.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI was just playing KSP, when suddenly I thought of something which is pretty big. On Duna, there is a camera arm hidden underground similar to that of the Curiosity Mars rover. This led me to believe that this ancient precursor race, was in fact, the human race. Since almost the whole Kerbol System resembles our\u00A0Solar System, I believe that humans had advanced very far, and then accidentally warped themselves to oblivion, and long after, Kerbalkind was born. On Duna, the camera arm which is similar to the Curiosity rover, could actually be the Curiosity rover\u0027s arm, covered by years of dust and Duna/Mars sand. In the SSTV transmission on Duna, the 4 precursor members resemble humanoid figures, in my opinion, so this precursor race, is almost definitely the human race.
