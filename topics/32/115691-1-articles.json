What is it? Well, the part is the 25 meter, 250 TON Stanford Torus from the BioDomes part pack (last updated for 0.24). It may or may not (probably may not) have functional attachment nodes in 1.0.x, but since it is basically, just a part, plus an IVA, with no animations, and no active .dll elements, it seems to play nice with the new version without being terribly glitchy. It has no parameters for the new aero, drag, or thermal stuff. I would love to see this part pack updated to 1.0.4, but all work has shifted to the Civilian Population mod... And I\u0027m sorry, I just don\u0027t like the parts in that one as much. This has such a lovely IVA, with up to 44 Kerbals sitting at tables and chairs, sipping on koffee mugs, likely filled with top quality Kolumbian brew. A small stream runs around the torus, with a grove of trees enjoying the sunlight of space.

The satisfaction of actually launching one of these is INCREDIBLE!!! In 0.25, I got two of these into orbit, and in 0.90 I succeeded in LANDING one on Minmus! (I am aware that my Minmus base makes NO sense... Torus is for space, biodomes are sideways, and at that, backwards, if it WERE in space). The Asparagus staging on these was intense... For the orbital stations, i launched on 13 stacks of the big Kerbodyne tanks! The stacks were literally so far apart from one another that I had to use structural girders on the outer stages to \u0022hang\u0022 oscar-b tanks in mid air, cause I couldn\u0027t get fuel lines to stretch far enough to reach between stacks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/541889954009821867/FA1FEDF660BC741A4EA104780B25BF1062F1E0D1/\u0022 alt=\u0022FA1FEDF660BC741A4EA104780B25BF1062F1E0D1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright, so part and history details aside, the real issue...

It\u0027s so ridonkulously heavy, and no heat shield could ever protect it. I am thinking of leaving it in space to build an orbital station with, but my question is, when the contract expires, will IT expire?

I\u0027d put klaw parachute modules (drogue and full, of course) around the ring with klaw heat shield modules under those, plus another heat shield klaw\u0027d to the core, and an array of large active radiators klaw\u0027d to the back of the core. The heat shields should help mitigate the overall re-entry heat at least a little, and actively defend the parachute and radiator modules. The radiators should hopefully siphon heat from all over the craft, making up for sections the heat shields can\u0027t protect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever you wind up doing it, rest assured we\u0027d all love to see screenshots or a video of the insanity.
