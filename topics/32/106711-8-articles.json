LV-909s just don\u0027t provide enough thrust... maybe for really small SSTO... but I wouldn\u0027t count on it. The Rapiers get you going faster, and then you get rockets with good thrust without adding to your frontal area... unless you part clip, your rockets aren\u0027t inline with your jets-\u003E draggier...\n\nRapier-Nuclear hybrids are good, because you can go very heavy on the liquid fuel, without worrying about carrying a lot of useless mass in orbit.\n\nI\u0027d like to do a Jet\u002BLV-N only SSTO, so that it only uses liquid fuel, but I don\u0027t think that is workable with the even lower LV-N TWR.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E They realy need to add scramjet..\n\nNo, they don\u0027t... Jets already get you to over half orbital velocity. IRL, a Scramjet won\u0027t get you anywhere close to there.

I\u0027m still waiting to hear that 1.01 has been released,what the heck happened?!\n\nYea, it came out fast, when I saw the complaints, I hesitated in upgrading, but I prefer it... overheating is much less of a concern now, which was the limiting factor on my 1.0 SSTOs. Drag has been increased, but so has lift.

To me the Rapiers just seem plain better. Sure, they are slightly heavier, and their Isp is 6400 instead of 8,000... but when you start getting high payload fractions, that doesn\u0027t really matter... its like if the liquid fuel is 5% or 7% of your total mass... who cares? The mass lost to jet fuel is recovered in the gain from less expended rocket fuel. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m kinda surprised that design deorbits safely, but this is my point.

I don\u0027t want to deorbit and recover halfway around the world, and lose massive amounts of funds relative to recovery on the runway.\n\nEvery design should come back to KSC. And that becomes just a matter or repetition... fly to the same orbital height each time... and figure out where to deorbit to arrive at KSC. Once that is figured out... its routine:\n\nAchieve a set orbit (ex: 80x80)\n\nCross landmark: (ex: eastern most shore of the big desert)\n\nPeform deorbit burn of X m/s (example: always 200 m/s)\n\nKeep pitch at X until Y altitude (example: 30 degrees until 15 km)\n\nLand at KSC.\n\nMore generally, I\u0027ve found that you can just figure out where to have the blue line intersect the ground east of KSC.... sure sometimes you come in steeper or shallower... but I\u0027ve found its close enough.\n\njust use the island airfield as a reference point, and you can come in close enough to have a short flight to KSC and a safe landing.\n\nThat 33% design can fly super slow when empty, its easy to have a safe landing when toughing down at 50 m/s\n\nIf my design breaks apart in the desert and I have to recover the pieces individually, or if it lands in one piece... it still loses massive amounts due to the recovery %.\n\nI can deorbit it with plenty of jet fuel to fly to KSC.... my preivous story was just one of when I was impatient, and going too fast too low, after deorbiting, and then climbing and accelerating again.\n\nI have no doubt it can be reliably landed at KSC for full recovery (plus, there is always quicksaving and quickloading)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T11:15:24Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 11:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm**"},{"CreatedByName":"Octa","CreatedById":140058,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T11:21:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The LV-909 isn\u0027t really a good choice, due to the fact that you still need about 1,000 dV after your jets die out. LV-909s just don\u0027t provide enough thrust... maybe for really small SSTO... but I wouldn\u0027t count on it. The Rapiers get you going faster, and then you get rockets with good thrust without adding to your frontal area... unless you part clip, your rockets aren\u0027t inline with your jets-\u003E draggier...\n\u003E Rapier-Nuclear hybrids are good, because you can go very heavy on the liquid fuel, without worrying about carrying a lot of useless mass in orbit.\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d like to do a Jet\u002BLV-N only SSTO, so that it only uses liquid fuel, but I don\u0027t think that is workable with the even lower LV-N TWR.\n\nAs i mentioned, i assume (without any testing in 1.0) that the combination of RAPIERs and LV-909 might work. The Rapiers take the plane as fast and high as possible in jet mode and they have enough thrust for the time critical final kick in rocket mode. As soon as the time critical phase is over, the LV-909 can do the rest of the trip.\n\nI still assume that the poodle and 909 are rather good and fuel saving choices in vacuum as they were in 0.90....i haven\u0027t compared the exact changes yet."},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T11:29:45Z","Content":"Yes, the rapiers get 305 Isp, whereas the 909 get 345.\n\nThe poodle gets 350.\n\nKeep in mind Isps have been nerefed on most engines (The LV-N escaped a Isp nerf, but now weighs more for the same thrust, and uses only liquid fuel, which is a pain until you get mk3 liquid fuel tanks)\n\nRapiers \u002B LV-909 works.
