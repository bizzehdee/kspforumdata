I love that aspect of the game. I would, however, radically change Career mode, to the point that it might turn off a lot of people. Please bare with me. I like me some Sandbox gaming, but honestly, a scripted story with set goals can be very fun too. I wish for a KSP \u0022Story\u0022\u00A0mode would actually give missions that need to be accomplished to progress an overarching story... that is the discovery of a Stargate like thing at the edge of space!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe campaign should be roughly aligned with the discovery of new technology. At first, you are doing simple things like reaching orbit, putting satelites, etc. But, as you start exploring the planets, you can really unlock the secrets of those planets. This is where the idea of Outer Wilds comes in. It\u0027s sandbox, but there is still obviously something behind the scenes going on. As the career progresses you might find, say, a cave in Minmus. To enter the cave, you have to build a rover that allows you to move into the cave and explore it. Within it, you discover some ancient artifact or whatever that\u0027s a map to something on Duna. Doesn\u0027t have to be something like that, but it should lead you in that way. Obviously, at no point should you be stopped from diverging from the \u0022story mode\u0022; you can do as you please. In some ways, I want there to be soft \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBridge\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ebroken bridges\u003C/a\u003E\u0022 of sorts to encourage the players to continue the story mode... I mean, that\u0027s why you are playing story mode as opposed to the other modes, but it should in no way lock you into it.

It\u0027s late and I\u0027m up on Insomnia and I don\u0027t have pictures to illustrate what I mean, but I\u0027ll do my best.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what we have now is a list of predefined shapes.\u00A0 Fuel tanks, structural elements, braces, pylons, wings, etc.\u00A0 Each comes from a different menu, and has predefined roles in building rockets and SSTOs and rovers and aaaaaall the other stuff we can build.\u00A0 And it is great.\u00A0 But it is also limited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my vision of KSP 2.0, shapes would not be tied to function - for instance, you\u0027d have cylinders, cubes, pyramids, cones...lots of different shapes.\u00A0 Theyd be empty, allowing you to come up with whatever shape of craft you desire, using a snap and tweak sytem much like the current one.\u00A0 Once the desired form is created, an \u0027outer skin\u0027 would be created, which you could then fill with fuel tanks, machinery, electrics, gyros, science (SCIENCE!), crew spaces and command center, and all the other googahs and gizmos and widgets that make a mission happen.\u00A0 A center of mass/lift indicator would help with placement.\u00A0 Varying tech levels would give more variety and late-game increasing capability.\u00A0 Engines would still be placed in much the same way as now, or if someone thinks up a better way for them, do that instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis came about from reading the back and forth on the forums from the \u0027clipping/no-clipping\u0027 camps about balance vs. \u0027but it looks so cool like this!\u0027.\u00A0 If the form is not tied to the function, we could create cool looking AND balanced vehicles (only so much internal volume to play with).\u00A0 Add in some form of procedural texturing, to make a unified look for each vessel, with varied texture sets and even community-mod texture sets.\u00A0 Add in the ability to say \u0027this is an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, put re-entry ablation plating on surfaces that will face into the descent/aerobraking.\u0027\u00A0 Have what direction that is be user-defined, even.\u00A0 Put a \u0027in-hangar flight simulator\u0027 to help define this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game would also feature a wider range of parts of all types.\u00A0 More cockpits, more wings, or something like a procedural wing generator, because the way wings are built of structural wings and slants right now is awkward, frustrating, and requires lots of strut-bracing to really work.\u00A0 More lights.\u00A0 A functional in-atmosphere autopilot that can hold consistant altitude and course and speed.\u00A0 More arrangements of landing gear, including side-drop, front and rear drop, more fixed gear types, skids...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s basically it.\u00A0 Mostly the \u0027build a vehicle shape, then fill it with useful components\u0027 design goal is what I want.\u00A0 The rest is icing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-21T11:05:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy is everyone trying to come up with an idea for a new game based on \u0022KSP \u002B some other game \u002B multuplayer sequel\u0022?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWouldn\u0027t it be cool to have something that would be more of a prequel to the current game?
