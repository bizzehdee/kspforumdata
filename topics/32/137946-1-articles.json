It is a minor issue but I need to get it out of my system. Maybe this has been discussed previously but a quick search did not get me any result so bear with me please. Quite frankly it bothers me that Valentina is by her lonesome self on the start game screen. Her facial expression also says this is kind of meh. She clearly doesn\u0027t enjoy herself. Having her seperated from Jeb, Bill and Bob who are on the mainmenu and all have slight smiles always gives me the feeling that she is some sort of ostracized loner. Like that one person who always gets bullied by the aholes in highschool. Of course this is not at all how it is represented in the rest of the game and shouldn\u0027t be. That is why I feel the disconnect is all the stronger at that point. Personally I think she should be surrounded by the boys on her screen like a welcome to the new team member. \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/40700-kaspervld/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002240700\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/40700-kaspervld/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@KasperVld\u003C/a\u003E why did Valentina end up alone and somewhat lost looking on her own screen?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rodrigoelp","CreatedById":129314,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-24T10:48:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuite possibly she was added to the home screen as an after thought and was cheap to add her on that screen without any other animation?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean, I do get your point, it looks as if she was abandoned by the rest of the team and it could be nicer if she is on mun, laying on a chair having sun... sort of like chilling out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-24T11:58:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClearly she was added after the image was already made.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHer visor doesn\u0027t even have the same yellowish tint that the others do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, if you are implying some sort of chauvinism on Squads part, I think you are reading into it a little bit too much.
