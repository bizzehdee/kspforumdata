I had no idea what a gravity turn was and didn\u0027t make it to space for a week. When I first got it, my massive rocket had a kraken attack and shot my kerbals 6 kilometers up and then for DAYS I tried making big explosions with a load of fuel tanks to launch my kerbals into space, it was an orion drive exploiting the kraken. Later, I got excited about my \u0022Satellite\u0022 that was a probe core\u00A0 with some solar panels and an ion engine I shot on an escape trajectory.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWHat are the best memories you all have of playing this game?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-07T01:14:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy 2 favorite are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy very first mun landing, in the 0.16 (or 0.18 I don\u0027t recall) demo back in 2013.
