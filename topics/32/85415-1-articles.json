After an idea gets 10,000 people to back, or support, it LEGO will consider the idea for actual production. Thanks largely to reddit, this Kerbal X project has nearly achieved 1,000 supports, but we\u0027re going to need 10,000 more to get this to the review stage, where LEGO will consider it for a real set. Of course, Squad would have to agree to this and would get compensation like any other company that has a LEGO set made based on their IP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been involved with an Ideas product before, and being familiar with the process I personally think that KSP would indeed pass the review and become an actual set if we can show LEGO that there\u0027s enough people that would buy it.
