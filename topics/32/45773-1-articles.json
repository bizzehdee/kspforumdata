Maybe you could call that more difficult, although I prefer not to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main thing is that there\u0027s practically zero smooth ground on Mun anymore. Used to be, Mun was a mostly a mosaic of triangular tiles hundreds of meters wide. These tiles were often cocked at slight angles but they were flat all across. No big deal. But these days, small, steep-sided craters are everywhere and at least on my machine, they don\u0027t become visible until I\u0027m at very low altitude and firmly committed to landing in that general area. IOW, what looked like a fairly flat area from 10km up turns out to be all jagged at 2km, and even then it\u0027s often hard to tell how much slope there is until I\u0027m much lower. Thus, some last minute side-steps are often required now, whereas before that was a rare occurrence. And even then, I usually end up landing on slopes of about 30^. So, I had to redesign my standard Munar lander to add RCS, which I\u0027d never found necessary before, and to be lower and wider to cope with the steeper hillsides I usually end up on. But having done those things, Munar landings are once again routine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s landing itself. But IMHO the new terrain has had its greatest effect on rovers, both in operation and design. Most rovers can climb much steeper hills than they can safely descend, and the inner top edges of crater rims are pretty steep. Thus, if you land in a crater, you can probably get the rover out of it and go elsewhere, but returning to the lander intact is often problematic. Now, if your mission isn\u0027t long-term and you never expect to use the lander again, no big deal. But if your dispersed base relies on rovers continually moving around between units, you can\u0027t be wrecking rovers, so all your base units need to be on the same side of crater rims. So, either all your base units need to be inside the same big crater, or they all need to be on contiguous patches of relatively crater-free ground. This requirement complicates the landing process and is another reason for needing to do last-minute side-steps during descent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T14:25:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually landing isn\u0027t any more difficult, but finding somewhere flat to land is.
