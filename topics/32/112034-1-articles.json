It was quite a heavy vehicle and it was pretty hard to judge the directions without navball.\n\nThe hardest thing I have done (quite recently) was dock with a jet inside the atmosphere on a suborbital trajectory and push it to orbit. I jumped up a jet only plane out of the atmosphere so it had a suborbital trajectory with a few minutes in space. I had a capsule waiting in orbit to rendezvous and dock with it, only problem was I forgot the docking port on the plane so I had to guess the center of mass and push it. When I intercepted the plane we were just about to fall into the atmosphere so I didn\u0027t have much time. It was really hard to find the right spot to push the craft so I lost more altitude than I had hoped. Once I found the right spot we were around 55km and I was sweating like a teenager talking to a girl with my heart racing in my chest. I gently built up the thrust to 100 so I wouldn\u0027t lose the spot and managed to push it out of the atmosphere to a 200\u002B apoapsis(there was no time to check the map view). Now the hard part was over and just had to push the periapsis out of the atmoshere, a much easier job as there was plenty of time.\n\nI did it because I wanted to make a challenge out of it, but I was too lazy to post it, and 1.0 makes it harder for jets to jump out of the atmosphere, although it could still be done with a rapier jet of course."},{"CreatedByName":"Enkiel","CreatedById":145063,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T13:35:38Z","Content":"landing on duna... it was a one way trip, but at least now i know i can do it."},{"CreatedByName":"timsfitz","CreatedById":104387,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T13:47:54Z","Content":"Landing and returning a Jeb from Eve in .23.5.

It\u0027s like your first kiss with a super-hot girl.\n\nA few weeks ago though, I had another huge thrill, a deep-space rendezvous with a broken ship, to replace a command module that had broken off due to my own bad placement of a service bay. I have copied the thread I made about it below...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I have a story to tell, but it\u0027s long. So here\u0027s the point form, and you can check out the spoilers for the details if you have nothing better to do:\n\u003E \n\u003E 1) Accept contracts for Ike exploration, satellite around Duna and science around Kerbol\n\u003E \n\u003E 2) Build and launch ship\n\u003E \n\u003E 3) Ship breaks in deep space\n\u003E \n\u003E 4) Send mission to rendezvous\n\u003E \n\u003E 5) Game starts glitching\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E In my new career (hard settings but with revert \u002B quicksaves) I got the Explore Ike contract, and at the same time a contract to set up a probe around Duna. A third contract was there to collect science around the sun. Perfect, I can kill three birds with one rocket, and make about a million kerbitsBucksUnits doing it. I spent a lot of time designing and testing the vessel, deciding it should be a science base. I don\u0027t have any docking ports unlocked yet, so it wouldn\u0027t be feasible, or at least easy, to do a return mission. But why not make it a permanent base, I haven\u0027t tried out the new daily remote science thingy. And then it would beg for another mission to go get the dudes at a later date; always fun.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E So I built this ship. Just before I launched it, I said to myself: \u0022self, why not slap on some tanks and engines onto the top part where the lander can and sciency bits are and make it detachable, so it can hop around Ike and gather science, returning it to the lab?\u0022. A good last minute addition. And on top of that is the probe that will handle the Duna contract. Three ships in one, good to go.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E ![Screen-Shot-2015-05-23-at-5.55.46-PM.png](http://jscript.ca/ksp-images/v1-0/career/Ike%20Mission/Screen-Shot-2015-05-23-at-5.55.46-PM.png)\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E ![Screen-Shot-2015-05-23-at-6.08.14-PM.png](http://jscript.ca/ksp-images/v1-0/career/Ike%20Mission/Screen-Shot-2015-05-23-at-6.08.14-PM.png)\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E I got to orbit with a fantastic gravity turn (perhaps my best ever - you can really save a lot of delta-V!), plotted a gravity slingshot around the moon (Ike was not lined up for a good transition but I didn\u0027t want to wait), and found myself in deep space with an inclination matching Duna (after a very small adjustment), and pushed my apoapsis to intersect Duna\u0027s orbit. All good, I may have to wait a full orbit to get to a point where I can plot an intercept, but Kerbals would rather wait in space for that kind of thing than on the ground. But while I\u0027m waiting, why not fulfill that contract to collect science around Kerbol. So, I open container that holds the little sciency bits on the hopper, and notice that it clips through the tanks I added last minute. It shakes and shudders, but holds together. Darn it, I hate that. That\u0027s what you get for last minute additions; that is management doing something without consulting the engineering section, bypassing quality control. But I perform the experiments and send out Bob to collect the data and reset the instruments. All good.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![Screen-Shot-2015-05-23-at-6.32.09-PM.png](http://jscript.ca/ksp-images/v1-0/career/Ike%20Mission/Screen-Shot-2015-05-23-at-6.32.09-PM.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E So, I says to myself I says \u0022self, why not see what other missions I can get going while I wait to set up the Duna encounter?\u0022 Quicksave. Back to mission control I go, to administration, the tracking station, etc. But after further contemplation, \u0022nah, one mission at a time is enough for me. Although rockets here are built in a day, Rome wasn\u0027t, so\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u0022 Enter tracking station, focus on Ike mission, fly vessel. Ka-BLAM!!! What the? Crap, I guess the clipped container blew things apart! Maybe if I reload the quicksave; hold F9\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 Ka-BLAM!!! Megacrap. Rage, rage, rage-quit against the dying of the mission\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 no. No I will not rage-quit. Ok, what can I salvage? The main ship is mostly intact, including the main engines, gas tanks, science module and habitat. But the lander-can with batteries and experiments have disassembled, and are slowly floating away. Jeb, exit the lander-can and make your way back to the ship - good thing there\u0027s two free bunks in the habitat! Oh look, the Duna probe is still intact, in one piece and totally functional! It\u0027ll be able to rendezvous with Duna but I have no idea if it has the delta-V to slow down into orbit. Probably, but I\u0027m too lazy to break out the calculator right now. I\u0027ll just see when the time comes. But what to do about the Ike mission???\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Now, once before in my KSP history have I attempted to intercept with another ship in deep space. Couldn\u0027t do it, impossible. Like, needle on another planet\u0027s haystack sort of impossible. But I found a willing rookie one-star pilot willing to sacrifice her life. Or at least her free time. So, with the remaining science I had saved up (I don\u0027t always spend it in one place) I researched the Claw. Built a simple ship: lots of gas, and a section that will detach with a new lander can and sciency bits. Launch. Get to orbit, plan trajectory and full-throttle. Upon leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI, I plan and execute a trajectory that gets me to within 12,000 km but at about a 30\\* angle of the Ike mission ship. But we\u0027re learning stuff here, lets try it. About halfway through the plotted course I make some little adjustments along the 6 axises. Intercept is now ~9,000 km away. And so on and so forth. I would stop time-warping every time I reached halfway through the remaining course, stop the time-warp, and rotate to prograde and see if going forward or backward would get the intercept any closer, and do the same with normal-antinormal and the other axis (the light blue one) as well. And wouldn\u0027t you know it, by the time the intercept was a few days away, I got it to within 5 kilometres! The relative velocity was still rather extreme, like 2,200 m/s, but I had just enough delta-V to pull that off.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![Screen-Shot-2015-05-23-at-8.07.50-PM.png](http://jscript.ca/ksp-images/v1-0/career/Ike%20Mission/Screen-Shot-2015-05-23-at-8.07.50-PM.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E I haven\u0027t felt this proud of a KSP accomplishment since the very early days, perhaps my first Mun landing. Crazy stuff! The Claw docking went without a hitch, I placed it right at the front of the Ike mission vessel, basically replacing the same bits that blew off.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![Screen-Shot-2015-05-23-at-8.14.13-PM.png](http://jscript.ca/ksp-images/v1-0/career/Ike%20Mission/Screen-Shot-2015-05-23-at-8.14.13-PM.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![Screen-Shot-2015-05-23-at-8.15.00-PM.png](http://jscript.ca/ksp-images/v1-0/career/Ike%20Mission/Screen-Shot-2015-05-23-at-8.15.00-PM.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E So, my mission can resume, after almost an entire Kerbal year passed waiting for the rescue ship. The mission is now two ships: the fixed-up original and the spontaneously separated probe. But all is not well, at least from the gameplay perspective. The story part is fine, things are progressing nicely. I have managed to get both the ship and the probe almost into stable Duna orbits. Doing this, however, has been very frustrating as switching from the one vessel to the other is causing my game to glitch. If I adjust the course of one vessel and time-warp, this vessel stays stationary in the map while the other proceeds normally. I have to quit the game and reload, then it works for a bit, then starts to glitch again. It\u0027s very strange and makes me want to give up. I won\u0027t, but I\u0027ll probably wait a few days to simmer down.\n\u003E \n\u003E I have to get the probe into the correct orbit in respect to the contract\u0027s specifications, then I have to land the Ike mission on the ground. But the way the game is handling this it will take me hours and hours of setting a course, executing it, exiting the game and restarting. I will submit a bug report if this keeps happening.\n\u003E \n\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T16:03:38Z","Content":"I might think it is my Tylo landing perhaps?
