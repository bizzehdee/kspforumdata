I didn\\\u0027t really blame them, after all, I figured it was a combination of resource and budget constraints. Squad has proven me wrong, and Squad continues to prove me wrong every day. Almost every time I log in, I see new features that would make game studios like EA or Valve murderously jealous of Squad, and rightfully so. Even more amazing, the short time this game has been available has allowed it to amass an enormous community of fervant fans, most of which are fervantly fanatical in their love for the game and the company. Even Minecraft has managed to lose most of its original shine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad doesn\\\u0027t bathe in the glory and just eat up the money; They put it back into the community by churning out a huge amount of updates and features. They also don\\\u0027t ignore bugs; Many bugs are fixed every release, and these fixes occasionally tackle deep, tough issues that take a lot of time and effort to fix. Many companies put such bugs off until the next release of the series. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, we\\\u0027re lucky to have a company as awesome as Squad, and Squad is lucky to have HarvesteR and all the other devs and other un-named, behind-the-scenes figures tirelessly working on this incredible undertaking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jgjiscool","CreatedById":5044,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-03T06:56:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;Bows modestly toward the KSP Dev team, Mod team, Test team\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for making our lives amusing by being interactive, breaking things, giving us broken stuff to find uses for, working incredibly hard to make something work and doing your best to make OUR (the other forum users\\\u0027) experience better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OtherDalfite","CreatedById":8317,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-03T07:03:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI must thank the devs of the game for not only providing me with a fantastic game, but also teaching me and awakening my inner calling, rocket science.

I\\\u0027m a nuclear engineering major just wrapping up my bachelors degree, which means that I don\\\u0027t have a lot of time to play games. That means that I have to choose the games I do play based on what I get out of them, and one subject that has always been near and dear to my heart is manned space flight. In fact, I can attribute my desire to eventually take part in future space exploration efforts to my choice of degree!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, the \u0027space flight sim\u0027 genre is essentially dominated by Orbiter, which I really get a lot of enjoyment out of (don\\\u0027t get me wrong), but hardly provides the kind of entertaining \u0027pure gaming\u0027 experience that KSP provides. In many ways the squad family has filled a void in my life left behind by the lack of a decent space flight sim that is realistic enough to not insult my intelligence but fun enough to not bore me or make me feel like I\\\u0027m playing through an interactive physics lesson. You guys have really come through!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore I\\\u0027d like to state that you are in NO way obligated to give anyone a free demo, access to experimentals for playtesting purposes, an online community, or even a game for that matter! Not only that, but you\\\u0027ve provided one of the most comprehensive-yet-accessible flight sim experiences that I\\\u0027ve ever played through for a mere 7 dollars! Honestly, when you first opened up preordering I didn\\\u0027t feel like you were asking enough, so I donated 10, and if you keep up the good work I\\\u0027m honestly feeling like I could donate 10 dollars more and still feel a little guilty for robbing you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you Harvester, and thank you squad!
