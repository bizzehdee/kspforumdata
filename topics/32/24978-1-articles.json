My justification is that autopilots are very much a real-world thing. As are navigation computers that can optimize things better than a human can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, I\u0027m loving it. Worth it alone just for the info displays, and the course plotting -- especially things like timing a launch so that you end up close to an orbiting target. While it can do some things completely automatically, it\u0027s best to treat it like a co-pilot. It handles small craft fine, but doesn\u0027t seem to be very good at piloting slow-turning behemoths. Often it plots a course that\u0027s so tight that it can\u0027t turn the ship toward the next maneuver node in time, then has to adjust the burn. Then it doesn\u0027t quite make it, and wastes a ton of time turning and chasing the node to try to get that last 0.4m/s of the maneuver, putting it even further behind for the next one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAuto-dock is nice to be lazy, but it wastes a ton of monopropellant making all the tiny adjustments. If there\u0027s any wobble in the ship at all, it tends to overcorrect and make the oscillations worse. So I mostly use it to help get lined up and do the final approach by hand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe RCS balancer in 2.x is a really good idea, though not perfect yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly I\u0027m amazed at the ascent autopilot. Most real world autopilots have the benefit of knowing what vehicle they\u0027ll be used in and can be tuned to its particular performance characteristics. MechJeb manages to launch \u003Cem\u003Ecompletely arbitrary\u003C/em\u003E rockets into precise orbits, and can even automatically separate the stages at the right time. I\u0027ll still manually control ones I\u0027m testing designs for, but for repeated launches of stuff like resupply ships it\u0027s a real time-saver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s totally a personal preference thing, though. There are things I\u0027ll always do by hand, and there are mods I won\u0027t use because they\u0027re unrealistic (Kethane; Quantum Struts) regardless of how useful they might be. So if you want an early 1960s experimental space program feel instead of a somewhat refined 1980s space program, then I\u0027d avoid it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Dulas","CreatedById":59172,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T14:43:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI feel like it would be a slippery slope for me.

And I feel completely justified in doing so. I\u0027ve been here since 0.14 (possibly 0.15) and have done everything manually - to the point where it started getting dull. After you launch a couple hundred ships the appeal seriously starts to wane. When you\u0027re launching a fuel tank that you\u0027ve launched dozens of times before and can predict, to the litre, how much fuel you\u0027ll have left when you circularise at 100km then we\u0027re in to boredom territory. Any game that has boredom as a component is doomed to failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, fellow Kerbanauts I suggest you all buckle up for MORE automation. It\u0027s going to have to come or the game will quickly lose its appeal. This is a game about a developing space program. One of the essential elements of any space program is that space-flight starts to become routine. As you push further out into space and as you have increasing amounts of assets in space so a greater proportion of your flights are going to be simply routine and what\u0027s worse, if consumables become part of the game and if you insist on running those missions personally without automation you\u0027re going to hit a stall point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy that I mean you\u0027ll be spending Almost all your game time just servicing your orbital assets and almost no time forging ever deeper into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink about it. To launch, rendezvous, dock, transfer whatever, de-orbit and land takes how long in total? The stiff end of half an hour. Say, 20 minutes if you\u0027re on the ball. If I\u0027ve got a refuelling station that\u0027s got 5 red tanks that I\u0027ve stupidly let run dry then I\u0027m going to have to invest and hour-an-a-half of my gaming time to run 5 entirely routine missions to top the tanks off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere\u0027s the fun in that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, you might say, but we\u0027re getting resources in 0.2 you want have to launch from Kerbin! That\u0027s true, but now I have to supervise a miner mining, a refinery refining and then run a tanker from the Mun surface, transfer to Kerbin orbit where I\u0027ll have to spend 10 minutes watching the smegger aerobrake before organising a rendezvous and then docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReources out there in the solar system may be cheaper to get to Kerbin orbit in terms of launch costs but they won\u0027t be more time efficient in terms of YOUR time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo before you know it you\u0027re three hours in and you\u0027ve basically spent it keeping the plates spinning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and last word on automation. I have a big beast of a ship - 300\u002B tonnes. It takes a full minute to rotate 180 degrees. Without Mechjeb that would be me sitting with my finger on the D or A key (or whatever) waiting for the frigger to complete its turn. That IS NOT stimulating gameplay.

When I first started KSP, MechJeb didn\u0027t really exist. (If it did, I sure as heck didn\u0027t know about it!) By the time I was aware of everyone\u0027s favorite autopiloting and information tool, I had already worked out pretty much everything it did and was getting progressively better at everything it did too. So I never bothered, and odds are good I never will.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Certain other tools, by contrast, I have no problem using since they really are just saving me some manual calculations. The Kerbal Engineer Redux non-flight chip, for example, saves me the tedious process of calculating TWR and dV for my various stages. I used to do it by hand, and it sucked a lot of the fun out of rocket design. Similarly, I\u0027ve got no problem with Protractor. I can calculate the phase angles manually, and usually know pretty well when one is coming up, but it\u0027s nice to have a little rover off near the radar station I can switch to for fine-tuning my intercepts with planets.
