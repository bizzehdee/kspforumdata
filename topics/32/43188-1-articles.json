I haven\u0027t yet tried dropping from 200KM without manually staging the tank. It just keeps coming down and not dropping it with the little bit of fuel left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a several revisions past version of BLB3 or Big Light Booster 3. By now it should be BLB5 or BLB6. Stacking two of the orange tanks with a mainsail on the bottom and a skipper in the middle requires some inventive design to keep the rocket together through shock of launch then the gravity turn. After that the thing will stay together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI finally decided BLB3 was Kerbal-rated and it\u0027ll go to at least a 200KM orbit with fuel left in the upper orange tank, with a three Kerbal pod and associated accessories. I\u0027ll post a launchpad pic of it here later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBLB1 and BLB2 were tests to see what could be done, trying to make a large yet fairly lightweight booster. The answer? Not without a much stronger automatically created coupling between the stack separator and between the skipper engine and the tank above it. Try it without struts and it falls apart on launch. Even with struts it folds in half about half the time in the gravity turn. Struts just don\u0027t seem to cross over engines from one tank to another very well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BostLabs","CreatedById":57527,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T14:33:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is pretty interesting. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebtw; what rifle is that.

The lander engine is a Poodle. I flipped the couplers upside down for BLB3b so they\u0027d go with the upper tank sections to drop more weight. The four liquids daisy chain the fuel top to bottom and the top two levels get tossed as they empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe small liquids on the bottom drop quickly. Later the topmost tanks drop followed immediately by the big solids, partway into the gravity turn. Those tanks are structurally important,with their struts they keep it from coming apart between the Rokomax 64s. I\u0027d like to be able to also toss the second from the bottom tank sections but there are struts from them to the bottom of the top 64. Lose those and it goes to pieces in the turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s still one glitch with it in MechJeb. It doesn\u0027t like to stage off the upper 64 automatically. The deorbit burn from a 200KM, zero incline orbit takes *exactly* the amount of fuel left in the upper 64. I should just let it go and see if autoland will pop it off or crash it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
