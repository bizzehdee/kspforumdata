It was a trusty but primitive plane, since I\u0027m still low in the tech tree, but I had flown a couple of missions on that bird with Jeb. When I tried to reach the last objective on a contract, which was doing a crew report above 19500 m altitude, I learned that my little plane could only reach around 13000 m. So I decided to reload a quicksave (so I wouldn\u0027t have to fly half the continent back to the KSC), and suddenly... flameout!\n\nMy engines were air deprived. My air intake wasn\u0027t getting anything, even though I was at that point only at 1000m high. I tried closing and opening the intake, shutting down and turning on the engines, and nothing. And so I decided to do an emergency landing. But the plane had too little electric charge - since the engines were off and I couldn\u0027t recharge the batteries, and I still had no access to solar panels. My power went out while I was still 100m above the surface, and the plane nosedived into the ground. A couple of meters before crashing, though, Valentina bailed out of the cockpit, and bounced maniacally across the grasslands. \n\nWith a smile in her face."},{"CreatedByName":"CelticCossack51","CreatedById":127600,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T22:53:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Wait, if this update is called 0.9, then that means...
