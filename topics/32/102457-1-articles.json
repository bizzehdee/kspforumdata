With over 50(!) active flights, the strain was unbearable. So, it was decided to abandon ALL current activities. Probes where deorbited, stations and bases where abandoned and shut down.\n\nNo, seriously, I finished the tech tree. Built [an enormous monument on Minmus](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111299-Minmus-Lighthouse) to celebrate. Then I lost inspiration for what to do next. Also, I noticed the game began to feel a bit sluggish. With not too many mods installed, I concluded my PC had trouble with keeping track of all those active flights.\n\nIt took me 4 weeks (in real life) and another 2.000.000 credits to accomplish this. But all kerbonauts are back home for the first time in 46 years. I have a feeling the sluggishness described earlier has gone too."},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T14:50:07Z","Content":"Now do it all again in RSS.
