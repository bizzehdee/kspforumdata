I don\u0027t really have a problem with this, personally. I also find them pretty easy to work with once I got the hang of it.\n\nMy issues with fairings\n\n1. I don\u0027t really understand how to create interstage fairings. I\u0027ve been putting all the non-aerodynamic stuff on top to minimize the size of the fairing I need to make. Sometimes I\u0027d like to hide stuff in the middle, in which case I use the service bay, but it would be nice to use fairings.\n\n2. Is all the mass still contained in the base? Fairings get pretty heavy and if ejecting them doesn\u0027t shed the mass then that\u0027s a real problem (bug?)."},{"CreatedByName":"Caelib","CreatedById":59329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T14:10:01Z","Content":"I think saying they \u0022suck\u0022 is a bit unfair.

It\u0027s not a common use case but I it\u0027s something that I used to do a lot; on a horizontal lander coming into an atmo planet, I\u0027d have it encased in a 3 segment fairing and just jettison the upper segments so that the underside of the lander was still shielded, but chutes could be deployed out of the top (constellation mission style, here\u0027s what I mean - [https://youtu.be/Tp6yj2k0Fpc?t=5m22s](https://youtu.be/Tp6yj2k0Fpc?t=5m22s))\n\nIt\u0027s also a pity that interstage fairings can only be created against something that is round ie a tank. If you have a shape made of multiple parts, like this for example;\n\n[![2UoCAICm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2UoCAICm.jpg)](http://imgur.com/2UoCAIC)\n\nthen you can\u0027t build an interstage fairing to it. \n\nWhat I\u0027d like to see is a kind of \u0022shrink wrap\u0022 ability where the fairing molds itself to whatever shape you have. I\u0027d also like to have choices to the number of degrees of symmetry that it follows, ie so you could have a fairing that is not the same radius all the way round but rather have two degrees of symmetry so you could encase something with small wings. \n\nAnd then there is the cluster bomb effect, which is just nasty. Having fairings separate as whole panels that come away with the same force, resulting in a nice geometric pattern was so pleasing. The current way is just a mess!\n\nNot 100% sure about them not being persistent debris either. Making sure you remembered to stage your fairings so they de-orbited seemed like a nice feature of maintaining a clean space (or not, if you wanted to create a debris field). But with the cluster bomb effect I can see why they went with not making them persistent. (persistent fairings should be an option)"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T14:29:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E KSP is not a designed to simulate every last detail of historic Human spaceflight.\n\nThat second picture should be enough to make anyone mad.
