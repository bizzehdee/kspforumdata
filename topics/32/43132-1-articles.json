I\u0027m not sure why it happened and I never was able to solve it. I had to give up on the design since it wouldn\u0027t fly straight with the missing engines. I think the issue is that connection strength doesn\u0027t seem to scale up with part size; compact landers and probes can survive impacts that would destroy any real ship, but large rockets fall apart like wet tissue paper even when they appear to be solidly constructed and thoroughly strutted. I\u0027m sure the issue is being worked on for future updates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also had my final stage engines get ejected when using Mechjeb. It happens if MJ is allowed to auto-warp; it will go to 4x physics warp while in the atmosphere waiting to get to apoapsis, which invariably causes my orbital insertion stage to shake off its engines and become quite useless. If I disable auto-warp, I don\u0027t have the problem.

However I completely avoid using the Rockomax Jumbo-64 Fuel Tanks and always use the the Rockomax X200-32 Fuel Tanks instead because of previous overheating issues I\u0027ve had, not sure if maybe that\u0027s what\u0027s causing your problem or if it actually is something to do with MechJeb?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have MechJeb, but all I use from it is the Smart A.S.S. so I\u0027m not sure if that would be the problem or not, I don\u0027t think that it would be an issue with throttling up to 100% at once though because most of my launches ignite the engines at 100% thrust.
