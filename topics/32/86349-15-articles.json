Sorry to see that this thread hasn\u0027t gone further. Running RemoteTech and Life support on 24.2 I found that balancing funds started to become an issue if you launch a lot of stuff outside of the missions availible, even with fine print, so I\u0027ll probable tune up the funds, but this will be my first no-revert save, so expecting to lose some cash that way too. Can\u0027t wait for KAS and KW to update so I can toss them into the mix later on.

To wit: I set up a simple Research Outsourcing plan at 25% funds to science as soon as I could reasonably afford it, and suddenly discovered that I never needed to go anywhere to collect science ever again. Even low-end contracts with that setup give you a solid 50 to 100 science, and the absurdly valuable ones (my favorite being \u0022launch an S3 KS25x4 on a sub-orbital trajectory\u0022; can do!) can give you as much as 3000 (!) science cumulative for completing them.
