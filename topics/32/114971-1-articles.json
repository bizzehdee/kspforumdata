I don\u0027t want to send a boat out, because it will take ages to get there, and my poor kerbonaut is probably hungry/freezing cold. Heck maybe even the capsule will flood and sink. (I know none of those things are in the game, but I am playing pseudo-realism mode, so I account for these things)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I need to get to them fast, which means flying there is the only viable way, as I don\u0027t have any boats at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERescue operation overview:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Get from KSC -\u0026gt; landing zone, with a vehicle that has a spare seat to get the stranded kerbonaut\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Rendevous with splashed down vessle, and pick up the stranded kerbonaut\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Return to KSC, or at least make it to a land mass, where landing a better suited craft would be easier\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you see with the last part of the mission, I don\u0027t mind if on return instead of heading to the KSC ~200KM (NE) I fly to the nearest landmass, ~75KM (N)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Yellow Dart","CreatedById":107172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T17:58:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like you need a VTOL. Scott Manley had a video on how to build a basic one. You may need a slightly larger one to cross that distance, as well as two crew spots, or one and a probe core. You\u0027ll also need to practice landing on water to make sure you don\u0027t end up with 2 stranded Kerbals.
