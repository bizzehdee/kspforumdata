The shuttle wings carry just enough jet fuel (1,800 units) to cover the air- breathing portion of the flight.\n\n Each engine requires 1 ram air intake.\n\n The 6 engines will need a total of 3,510 units of rocket fuel and 4,290 units of oxidizer.\n\nThis is a working ratio of parts. It\u0027s up to you to decide how to put them together and you can scale as desired.\n\nAll together, this is a 105 tonne spaceplane to deliver 25 tonnes of cargo; a 23% payload fraction.\n\n Of course, you can reduce payload capacity as necessary to increase DV on orbit.\n\n Being so close to the limit, it is important to fly it as efficiently as possible during the ascent.\n\n-Engage SAS and full throttle \n\n-Climb to 12km altitude at 200m/sec airspeed.\n\n-Let the nose settle to 5\\* pitch, which will place you in a very shallow dive\n\n-Let the nose drift up on it\u0027s own as speed builds\n\n-At 450 m/sec, gently raise the nose to 20\\* pitch\n\n-at 19 km altitude, lower the nose to 5\\* pitch and build speed\n\n-Let the nose drift up on it\u0027s own as speed builds\n\n-Once acceleration has stopped, switch to closed cycle and pitch carefully to 20\\*\n\n-Once prograde is 10\\* up, reduce pitch as necessary to hold 10\\* climb\n\n-at 30km altitude, engage SAS hold prograde and throttle as necessary to establish apoapsis\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T20:52:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 08:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27**"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T21:31:16Z","Content":"I would subscribe to Slashy\u0027s newsletter.\n\nBut will his new designs go well with mustard?"},{"CreatedByName":"Xyphos","CreatedById":139010,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T21:42:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Look at the Stock Bug Fixes sticky in Add-On Releases.
