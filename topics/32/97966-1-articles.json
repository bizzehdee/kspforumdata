Like Streetwind said Squad is a marketing company so I figure the first logical step would be to consider making a gaming division. I think KSP proved the talent and vision the development team has. So that\u0027s why for me the first step would be to have a spin-off company like Squad-Games (or something like that) still owned by the parent company (squad) but being more focused on game development.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond step would be to make one more game to establish a good IP base. Since KSP turned out to be such a great space sim maybe focusing on other sim games (although it\u0027s a genre a bit overpopulated). But since there are sim games for just about anything (farming sim, train sim, truck driving sim, bus driving sim, goat sim, rock sim, etc.) it could be hard to find a topic worth the time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI definitely think that having a portfolio with two titles (and subsequent iterations) would be beneficial. The launch schedule could be one game launch every three years which would mean KSP2 would be launched in 2021 but development would be supported by that one other magical title which would be launched in 2018. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I think would be a step in the wrong direction is to announce a KSP sequel (which seems inevitable) too soon. They could milk this game for a good 5 years (probably longer) before anyone could feel a need for anything new.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand I think their team is too small to be working on more then two titles. This would work better if, like blizzard for example, they had only a small number of very good titles (Diablo, Warcraft and Starcraft). And not like other developers (of the hydraulic regulation variety) that have a ton of games on the second iteration but can\u0027t seem to figure how to give half a game a third sequel..... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_sleep.png\u0022 alt=\u0022-_-\u0022\u003E\u0027 *\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skyace65","CreatedById":71431,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T14:01:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E(being half serious here) making other games from other genre\u0027s using kerbals. a Kerbal FPS, city builder, strategy game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T14:18:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre there Unity ports to consoles like PS4?
