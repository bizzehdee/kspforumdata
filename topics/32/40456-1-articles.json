The key to efficiency is waiting for the most efficient orbital encounter window and hitting Duna\u0027s influence prograde. The key here is just touching the Duna orbit at apogee and find the intercept. Plan in a couple of small course corrections to fine tune the intercept. Just a couple of seconds of thruster translation burns midway to Duna can make a huge difference on such intercepts.That might take a year or two in Kerbal time to get the ideal window. You can then parachute to the surface while using a small burn for landing. That same design has reached the Jool system and landed probes on Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPractice this intercept on Mun from Kerbal before trying it on the other planets in the Kerbal system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T11:42:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy standard tug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1184.photobucket.com/albums/z335/annallia92/ScreenShot068_zps5b766055.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ScreenShot068_zps5b766055.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside from mechjeb completely stock, if I were building this to go interplanetary though I would ditch the trip engines in the middle and just go off the side mounted ones (but keep the fuel tank).
