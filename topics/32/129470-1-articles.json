In real life, nothing would happen at that velocity except for mild mach effects, but Squad has to induce ultrasonic effects on reentering objects (I think you guys know why). Therefore, reentry effects start taking place at very low speeds. On Kerbin, 3000m/s is synonymous with 10,000m/s on Earth.

What that means is that even though you might see flaming effects on ascent, it doesn\u0027t necessarily mean that you\u0027ve gone past terminal velocity, just that things are getting hot. The general rule of thumb that I\u0027ve seen around the forums is to limit your speed (not acceleration) to less than mach 1 until you get above 10km. After that drag reduces drastically, and you can pretty much go as fast as possible. This is also the reason that a too-high periapsis when you\u0027re reentering can be bad, because there\u0027s not much drag to slow you down, but there is enough air present to cause you to heat up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tend to design my launch stages with a pad TWR of 1.2-1.4, which usually keeps me under mach 1 until about 12km.

My launch profile is a 65% turn starting at 100m/s and ending level at 45k.\u00A0 Orbital insertion is usually about 140m/s.\u00A0 I\u0027ve found this method to give a pretty solid 3,300 vacuum dV to orbit. When building my ships, I use the liquid engines to build the bulk of the dV needed, then supplement the TWR with SRBs, limiting their thrust so they show a TWR of 2.0 at launch.\u00A0 This 2.0 is with both the first stage SRB and liquid engines burning together.\u00A0 This setup allows you to throttle the liquids down with the SRBs running to maintain the 18m/s.\u00A0 This pattern also keeps the ship pointing along the velocity vector up to around 25k, reducing drag and the chance of a tumble.\u00A0 Keeping the balance between the engines is very important.\u00A0 You need to be able to keep the ship at 18m/s for almost all of the profile.\u00A0 Going over speed by having to much of the thrust as SRBs and/or ending up to slow after they shutdown because the liquids haven\u0027t burned off enough propellant to be able to run at 1.8TWR can be equally problematic.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are probably much more efficient ways, but I stick to this one because it provides a consistent dV and profile to orbit.\u00A0 One other benefit that this provides comes when running stage recovery.\u00A0 I build all of my sections with big expensive engines and parts to cut off about 2,900 dV.\u00A0 This allows them to drop back in the atmosphere and be recovered relatively close to KSC, providing a pretty good return on those really expensive stages.\u00A0 I launched a heavy science rover today that cost 323,000 to build and got about 80,000 of that back on the first stage recovery.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis launch profile works equally well with stock and FAR.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-08T11:16:03Z\u0022 title=\u002201/08/2016 11:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by icedown\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nefrums","CreatedById":145422,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-08T12:13:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving more TWR\u00A0is almost always better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing that saves a lot of dV is the initial acceleration of the pad, Getting to\u00A0~200 m/s fast helps. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso start the gravity turn right of the pad. \u00A0Just do an small initial turn to 85-80 right after launch how\u00A0much depends on you twr.

At launch all engines ignite, the core sometimes being throttled back; by the time the boosters drop the fuel burn and improved thrust with height mean the core can come to full power and manage decent TWR.
