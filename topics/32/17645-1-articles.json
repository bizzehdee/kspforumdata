I\u0027m not opposed to the general idea, but I think it would be nice if the stargates and other remnants of past civilizations were somewhat difficult to reach and operate for a fairly experienced player. If I recall correctly, the warp drive to be implemented by HarvesteR may be a similar case, only becoming usable in the late game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorrect me if I\u0027m wrong, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-24T07:21:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom memory, the idea behind the warp drive was akin to the function of the Alcubierre drive, and due to the method of warp, it could only be used once well away from any planets, and stars.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BurningSky93","CreatedById":2316,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-24T13:29:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I dont think they have any place in KSP.

The concept of discovering and exploring new star systems or other-wordly, sci fi or theoretical physics based technologies and phenomena just doesn\u0027t fit the atmosphere, to me at least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think its important to remember that KSP is, in general, based firmly in real world physics except were it serves the \u0022fun and quirky\u0022 element (like Kerbin\u0027s density, the fact that we\u0027re controlling little green men etc etc).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-24T15:05:51Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2012 03:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by BurningSky93\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Baleur","CreatedById":9954,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-24T16:06:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vexx32\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vexx32\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe point? simple.

But in KSP it\u0027s like..... The point of the game is to build rockets and vehicles, and find your way to pilot them to the other planets or stars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith stargates, you\u0027d just have to pilot to the gate, you wouldn\u0027t have to worry about the trajectories to being captured by another star anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s like, putting a gate on Kerbin Space Center that instantly teleports you to Minmus. What would be the point of the game then?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the game does evolve in a way that does conform to such things however, i\u0027d love to see it added. Perhaps as easter egg connections to the other side of the galaxy without first having to research warp drives or whatever. Then i\u0027d love it too. But as KSP is TODAY, it doesn\u0027t fit at all, given how limited the universe is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could see one thing though, if the tech level system in KSP advances far enough into the realm of stargates, perhaps we could BUILD stargates, and maneuver them to a distant star.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen once we built 2 and put them in place, we could use them as a shortcut for easy colonization or whatever on the other end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHAT i can agree with, because then the whole kerbal building element still comes into play without having the thing just be a \u0022cheatmode\u0022 to reach distant places.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaiier","CreatedById":22833,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-24T16:35:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat if the mun arch gate was only activated after finding/activating all the munoliths?
