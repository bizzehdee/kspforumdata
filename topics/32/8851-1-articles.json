With some simple orbital mechanics, most of us know how to get to the mun and land on it. While drawing up diagrams on how I thought I might make it to Mars, I realized that it will be more difficult than previously believed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mun orbits Kerbin. You can make Trans-Lunar Injection from just about anywhere on Kerbin, as long as the Mun is in the right spot, but with Mars, this will NOT be the case. The situation will be much different, in the sense that Mars will be orbiting Kerbol, not Kerbin. We have probably about a 100 degree wedge in which Mars will even be in an okay place to shot for it. I\\\u0027d have to measure the exact orbit, and of course, I can\\\u0027t, because they game doesn\\\u0027t have Mars yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a couple of ideas that may work and I wanted to get some feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have decided that the best way to treat the Martian missions will be like a rendezvous situation! Really, how much different could it be than that? Think of it this way. Kerbol is Kerbin, Kerbin is our docking vehicle and Mars is our target vehicle. Our ship simply represents the transfer. I was thinking that we could use a parking orbit around Kerbin, wait until Mars is directly in front of us and shoot outward, away from Kerbin at around 20 degrees. Mars will orbit slower than the Mun so there will be times when Martian missions will be ideal -- when the two planets are almost lined up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this does result in the question: How do we get back? I don\\\u0027t know. And that\\\u0027s what I\\\u0027m working on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy second idea is slightly more dangerous. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is to shoot straight away from Kerbin until we break into a Solar orbit. Then, from there, we use a Hohmann transfer to get our orbit around the Sun to be just a few hundred kilometers short of Mars\\\u0027s orbit and then wait several orbits until we meet up. This, of course, will take forever, and we\\\u0027d have to shoot at the right time to be closest to Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone thinks of any other methods, draws any diagrams etc. Please post here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-29T18:19:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is just like orbital rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWaiting until the two planets are lined up with the sun is waiting too late.

So Stanley instead went with Jupiter for the movie, while Arthur opted to keep Saturn as the destination in the book. It was only after all was said and done and people wondered what the hell they watched that the special effects guy, Douglas Trumbull, came forward and declared he could have been able to render Saturn in all its wonderful ringed glory, and even had done the model to show it.

I think that adding a heavy module called a \u0027miner module\u0027 or something similar, that would create fuel when in contact with the ground in certain areas of planets or asteroids, would work the best.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AD-Edge","CreatedById":1045,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-02T08:07:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou wont need a rocket all that much larger than one youd use for the Mun really. In fact my first challenge when the Mars planet is added will be to get to it using my current Munar rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts a similar trip, you just have a lot longer between the take off and landing, so youll be drifting for a long time with the engines off (hopefully we\\\u0027ll get some vanilla ion engines or something to make the trip quicker). I guess predicting where the planet will be so you can get into its orbit and not miss it will be somewhat more difficult, but I imagine it wouldnt be impossible doing simply from line of sight and in the map view. Youd just need to make a bunch of corrections on the way to the planet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe part I can foresee as being a real issue is the landing, since the gravity and atmosphere will be similar to Kerbin so youll use a but more fuel (or perhaps just parachute down?).
