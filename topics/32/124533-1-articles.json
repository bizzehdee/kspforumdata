Guess what - you\u0027ll soon be going Southwest, just like a miniature orbit. Equatorial headings - 90 or 270 degrees - are constant, polar ones - 0 or 180 - flip as you pass the poles (North, 0 degrees to the pole, then South 180 and back again at the South pole). Anything in between will oscillate \u002B/- around 90/270, so; 315 - 270 = 45, 270 - 45 = 225. Your compass heading will vary \u002B/- 45 degrees, across the range 225 to 315.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pandemic","CreatedById":144101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T18:34:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks High Guard.
