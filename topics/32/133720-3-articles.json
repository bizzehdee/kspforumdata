The aimless contract system kills the game from boredom, similar to what many others have noted here. The only reasonable way to deal with the contract system is to spam decline until you get something interesting and meaningful for whatever stage you\u0027re at. Mods can improve that some, but the system is\u00A0aimless and doesn\u0027t contribute much to the game once you\u0027ve played it enough to recognize that it\u0027s just a random number generator with no connection to useful goals.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have small quibbles with the tech tree, (like, why put a science-producing part at the very end of a tech tree, where, by definition, you\u0027re almost done collecting science)\u00A0but really it\u0027s the contract system that drags things down.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIndividually, the contracts are fine, they just don\u0027t work together toward any cohesive whole.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome\u00A0of the best-considered forum challenge threads (like the\u00A0Stock Payload Fraction Challenge and Renewable Space Program Challenge) create\u00A0up the kind of goal-driven challenge that\u00A0could serve as inspiration for contract system improvements.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HorusKol","CreatedById":117326,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T04:56:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222450189\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133720\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221457577146\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002278020\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AlamoVampire\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, AlamoVampire said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nlet me ask you this. would it be nice to have a reason to play career mode? To have a way for what you are doing to mean something more than: take this contract and do x, y, z and then move on? Would it not be nice to have a reason to emotionally invest yourself in your space program? Would it not be nice to have things to do come at you in a logical and linear way rather than, oh, you hit this point on your tree, here have all these contracts, even tho, it does not make sense to be told: fly to eeloo and set up X even tho, gotten past duna isnt a thing yet?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee, the way career is now, it provides NONE of that. Its not logical, its not linear, it makes absolutely zero sense in the way contracts are generated. See, right now, I may only be in year 7 of my current sandbox, but, it has a rich story built into it. I have an emotional investment in the goings on in my program there, I can do things in a logical progression that career mode just flat out lacks. I am not sure why career is so emotionally dead and illogical \u0026lt;i have my theories of course\u0026gt; but, it has given me no reason beyond: did they polish it? no? ok, back to the sandbox with my shovel and pale and the stories i can dream up.
