That is equal to \u0022Do you know what a sun is?\u0022 or if someone thought I said Kerbal \u0022Do you know what a human is?\u0022. That works perfectly fine. Kerbal is not the name of a particular individual. So I really am not sure why you showed me an example with my name and someone else name.\u003Cp\u003EThen you say there is little help for me? You the one who just messed up rofl.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second sentence I can see your point, however, my sentences still work as well. \u0022Oh look at that sun!\u0022 or \u0022Oh look at that human!\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you stated yourself, it\u0027s all about context. It can easily be mistaken. If you wanna make a bet, tell someone kerbal means a species and kerbol means their sun, then construct a test and see how many sentences they understand.

Do you see where the flaw is? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother good example is how people misuse there, their and the\u0027re. The only reason it works so well even though so many people get it wrong is because we are aware of the context already. Those who are unfamiliar though, will be confused.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another point, what if I started calling a cat .. a poolisomen. Would anyone else know what I am talking about? If you showed someone KSP for the first time and said, take a look at Kerbol. Do you think they are going to look at the sun? I bet they will be confused. Then when you tell them the green men are kerbals, they will be even more confused.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust so you know, you will not win this argument, because you are wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re the one not getting it.
