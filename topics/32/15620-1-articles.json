My mission for this time was to bring two ground vehicles to the surface of the moon, and relatively close to my Long Stay Solar Base so that I didn\\\u0027t have to walk too far. After all, if I have to walk long distances there\\\u0027s no point!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI set out and came up with a good design:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img696.imageshack.us/img696/3299/screenshot124m.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot124m.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe testing went like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img191.imageshack.us/img191/5833/screenshot117z.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot117z.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt actually went relatively well, and I got to the moon and was prepared to land, but then I discovered a fatal flaw: the point of thrust was imbalanced and the craft spun end over end. As expected I crashed, and had to start over. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI gutted my original design and simplified it, and changed the point of thrust. It worked! I tested during the day and all systems worked as intended.

I now have getting to the moon down to a science, and getting there was simple. Just had to wait until I landed to see if the VTOL engines would behave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img213.imageshack.us/img213/6822/screenshot168m.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot168m.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReady!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img442.imageshack.us/img442/7060/screenshot169.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot169.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice action shot of takeoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img525.imageshack.us/img525/8796/screenshot172.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot172.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn orbit awaiting injection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img864.imageshack.us/img864/2710/screenshot174.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot174.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img4.imageshack.us/img4/3438/screenshot178.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot178.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMissed!
