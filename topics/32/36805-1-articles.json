After a while I quicky realized I tend to build bigger and bigger rockets and bigger and bigger stations and I tend to do these monolithic missions supposed to prove something or plant a flag. I also sort of stopped really enjoying the little things in the game, like just landing on the moon manually, instead of MJ, or just getting a very small satellite to Laythe without aerocapture on Jool (which is basically a cheat, because aerocapture has never been done this way in real life). I also installed more and more mods to allow me to do more things, then I spend a lot of time getting around their bugs, exploiting bugs in the original game etc. I just stopped enjoying the game really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I decided to start anew, this time going slow and enjoying every milestone. I wrote some rules for my game and I want to stick to them. Can some of you longtime players tell me if they are gonna work or where I might run into problems? For the people that simply don\u0027t agree with my point of view about how to play this game, please keep it mind that it\u0027s just my opinion and this thread is not addressed to you. I am rather asking the oldtimers who have tried to play the game this way before. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E----- 10 RULES FOR PLAYING KSP -----\u003Cp\u003E by Jack\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) KEEP THINGS SMALL!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo play the game as the authors intended, no vessel is allowed to have more than 200 parts during launch. 100 parts is optimum. Also no station with multiple docked spacecraft can have more than 400 parts. Same goes for fully developed surface bases with adjacent lifters and rovers. Interplanetary spaceships fully assembled in orbit can still have only 200 parts. Try to use smaller craft and multiple ships with modular designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) USE TWO ACCOUNTS!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne account is a sandbox for testing and development. You may use this account to test your reusable space program vehicles, general pilot training and for trying out new concepts in the game. The other account is the main account for the actual continuous game. You can do anything you want in the testing account, but once you are done, no transfer of save files or persistent files to the game account is allowed. You are allowed to move your ship designs freely, that\u0027s what the development account is for. In the game account, every launch is final, so prepare yourself well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) KEEP AUTOMATION TO A MINIMUM!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENever use Mechjeb\u0027s autopilots in your gaming account. You may use its statistical and info features. You can also use it to check what maneuvers it plots for a certain target and compare them with your own. Use it to learn from it, not play the game for you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) KEEP TIME WARP TO A MINIMUM!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is to play the game continuously and not skip ahead. So use time warp with caution and only in small chunks if really necessary. No warping for planetary transfer windows. Use Kerbal Alarm Clock instead and put every coming transfer window to maximum use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) DON\u0027T ABUSE THE SAVE FILE!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn your game account, the save files are sacred. They cannot be moved, copied or modified. Use your quicksave only when absolutely necessary, when you are very unsure of handling your next maneuver. Otherwise keep it to a minimum. Failure is part of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) NO WEIRD MULTIPLE DOCKING!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have to create a modular ship that multiple docks, use a design that doesn\u0027t force you to assess the alignment of your ports by eye. That means only simple symmetrical designs. It\u0027s the way the game was designed, trying to outsmart it will frustrate you and reduce your enjoyment of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) DON\u0027T LEAVE DEBRIS IN ORBIT!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry to design your spacecraft to not jettison stages in orbit. Detach your used parts to burn in atmosphere or crash into hard surface. Naturally, the ships that you intend to use in your reusable space program can\u0027t detach any parts at all outside Kerbin suborbit. For one-time spacecraft, you may leave stages behind sometimes, but keep in mind that it will clutter the orbit forever unless you clean it, which you have to do manually in-game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) DON\u0027T \u0022END FLIGHT\u0022!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot in your game account. You may never end unsuccessful flights, you have to learn to live with the sad result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) NO AEROCAPTURE!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo keep things realistic you may not use aerocapture maneuvers on large ships that would never survive aerocapture in real life. You can still do aerobraking iteratively to circularize an elliptical orbit, but don\u0027t use Mechjeb\u0027s aerobraking predictions in that case. In real life aerobraking is also very difficult to predict and has to be done mostly with trial and error. You may still do aerocapture and reentry with craft carrying a heatshild (basically only some of the pods and maybe some rovers analogous to Curiosity-Skycrane).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10) USE STOCK PARTS!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo enjoy the game in the way the authors intended, reduce the number of mods used. The allowed ones are Mechjeb for DeltaV stats and other info, Kerbal Alarm Clock to allow continuous gaming and planning of planetary transfers, Kethane because I am passionate about In-situ Resource Utilization and it\u0027s a nice motivation for building bases and orbital refueling stations, and MapSat as a motivation to build satellites and send rovers to artifacts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-12T17:14:41Z\u0022 title=\u002207/12/2013 05:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Jackissimus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EEdit: CODE doesn\u0026#039;t do wordwrap?\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gniuz","CreatedById":57846,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T15:09:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with some of your rules.

Though I will admit, I also think some of those rules are a bit ridiculous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I agree, though only to a point where it makes sense. Anything in orbit can really be as large as you want it, as long as it was taken up in realistic sizes. I don\u0027t see why there has to be a limit for a space station. The only legit reason is for performance in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I can most certainly agree to that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Again, I can agree. I don\u0027t find anything wrong with using automation, but as a rule for yourself, it\u0027s certainly a nice challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. I do not agree with this one, it\u0027s a bit to harsh. This a game, not an actual space agency. First and for most, you should have fun. If that means using time warp, I suggest you do so. It\u0027s actually a fairly important mechanic for the game. It would not be there if it wasn\u0027t needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Agree, I myself would never modify my save files. I also try and keep quick saving to a minimum since I actually enjoy the failures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Why? Also, saying it\u0027s the way the game was designed feels like an incorrect assumption. The design of the game is only limited to your creativity really. Using multiple docking ports is actually a great idea and would probably even work in real life. Don\u0027t see anything wrong with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Again, why? I say if you happen to mess up and Debris is left everywhere, just leave it. It seems less realistic to not have any debris at all when a mission fails. Of course if you build a mission to retrieve the debris, I find that fine. I actually keep my debris on infinite or max or whatever it is. I like to keep debris left alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Agreed, end flight should only be used when you land back on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Agreed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10. I actually do not agree with this. I don\u0027t mind mods that are within reason. My general rule on this is, if it fits within the game, it is fine. The reason I follow this rule is because the game is incomplete, meaning the parts are actually fairly limited as of right now. Chances are any part you use from a mod that fits within the game, is likely to eventually be added by squad anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, that is my opinion. Overall, good luck. I don\u0027t play the game all the time currently because I don\u0027t want to over play it before it\u0027s final release. I have played to many alpha and beta games to know, it\u0027s a mistake to do that. I just play it enough to test the new feature, and to have a little fun, but I do not do anything major, like actual missions and such that I take serious.

And then when a window comes up to go to Eve, send another rocket there and then do something else in the meantime. Then set up more kethane bases on Minmus and maybe start building a large interplanetary mothership around Minmus (to lower the required deltav for interplanetary transfer). Then there will be a window to go to Moho, so I send a mapsat probe there and then my Duna sat arrived, so I have to perform an injection maneuver into elliptical orbit, then several aerobraking maneuvers to lower the orbit spaced several days apart. I don\u0027t know if this will work yet, but the idea is to not do it like this: Launch it into Kerbin orbit / huge warp to transfer window / launch it to Duna / huge warp to Duna / aerocapture.

Although I don\u0027t consider myself a veteran, I do have a lot of experience. I truly believe that much of the enjoyment for me has been accomplishing things without any mods. When you get to a planet and land there, it was 100% you. This game is made around the user building creations and flying them on their own. I believe anything that takes away from that will ultimately end in unsatisfaction. When you do a low flyby of the mun and see something sparkle on the surface it is the most exciting thing to plan a mission there and find out what it is. Try a few landings using only the IVA view. Then try it at night! With atmosphere and without! Or design two stage landers so the second stage is lift-off return stage. Or build a space station and use it as a port with a dedicated lander for whatever body it\u0027s orbiting. New kerbals will fly to the station, then switch to the lander to land. Make a two stage rover so that when the rover runs out of fuel, there is another command pod which detatches and returns to orbit (to your awesome station) and goes back to kerbin. Or you could plan all your missions to return to not only kerbin, but right at KSC within 1km. Or maybe a kerbal is stranded on the north pole of Eeloo and needs rescue. Or you could build a landing platform and take it to another planet and try to land on it! Maybe the platform has wheels so you can move it. Or it could be like a massive rover that just needs a command pod to connect to it so it can drive! and the only way to do that is land on top! Or maybe you want to drop 3 landers on duna at different spots from one insertion! Then drive a rover and pick up all the kerbals and return to kerbin! OR you recieve word that a kerbal on duna actually wanted to go to laythe, so you have to go there, pick him up, then fly to laythe and return! Keep it all vanilla so the satisfaction factor is highest. I am still creating ships better and more efficiently and thinking of ways to work around problems and ideas for missions that I come up with.
