For some reason, The first mission went fine, and i got to duna, however, the symple tasks like rendevousing and stuff seem to be harder. Mj is not working good, Have to do manual, and ya know, with the new planets, its easy getting there, yet usually the perfect ship seems to have a flaw. Another thing is, it seems it takes forever now to get from the VAB to the launchpad, idk why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont know why, but for some reason, 0.17 has been harder, more frusterating, and made me ragequit many times. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about you guys?

You can also try to start your gravity turn later (less fuel efficient, but it might solve the problem.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Topic: I love this update. KSP is becoming more complicated. As new parts and objectives were being added, I was expecting this to happen. I was quite looking forward to it in fact. There is always a bit of a learning curve every time KSP updates but the game is definitely improving all the time.
