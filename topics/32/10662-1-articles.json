However, there are some other things I would like to clarify for you that your post indicates you may have confused.\n\nFirst, the 13 trillion meters you see is the distance from the star (Kerbol) not the planet where you launched. Since kerbin orbits kerbol at this distance, as soon as you break out of Kerbin\\\u0027s sphere of influence, you are at this distance from the star, so it is not too crazy to consider getting to this distance.\n\nThis brings me to my next point, spheres of influence. The way gravity is coded in this game is that, instead of having the gravity from all bodies simultaneously affecting your craft, only one body will affect you at once. The body that is affecting you is determined by your distances to each body, and their relative mass. You will always be affected by the one that would have the greatest effect, ie, close to Kerbin you are in its SOI, but because Kerbol is so much heavier, once you go some distance from Kerbin you fall out of its SOI.\n\nEscape velocity: This is the velocity required to escape to infinity from a body in the absence of any other bodies gravitational pull. You can read more about it on wikipedia if you wish, but the essential point is that the further you get away, the lower the gravitational pull, so if you get moving fast enough the gravitational pull will decrease quickly enough that you just keep going. Mathematically, you can get this by comparing your kinetic energy to your gravitational potential energy. I don\\\u0027t know offhand the escape velocity of kerbin, but I believe its around 6000m/s. Further, because Kerbol exists, the velocity to break free of kerbins SOI is acually somewhat lower, as you can put yourself in a highly eliptical orbit that will leave Kerbin\\\u0027s SOI, while not breaking the escape velocity. \n\nAnother point: Stating \u0027I only expected to go 100,000m\u0027 doesn\\\u0027t really mean much in an orbital sandbox like this. Most rockets can potentially go infinite distance, as you can set them in stable orbits and just leave them. A much more sensible statement is \u0027I only expected to be able to get into a 100,000m circular orbit\u0027 or \u0027I only expected to reach 100,000m altitude and not get into an orbit\u0027.\n\nFinally, in order to get into orbit around kerbin, you have to actually turn over at some point. If you just thrust straight up you will either a) Reach escape velocity and begin to orbit Kerbol (As you did) or ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) Reach some altitude and fall back to the surface.\n\nI hope this post has enlightened you somewhat, and I apologize if you knew some of this already.\n\nBy the way, can you post a screenshot of your ship prelaunch, and perhaps the craft file?\n\nAs per your latest post, it will be better off to just leave your brave kerbals to bask in the eternal light of the sun until their air runs out. Sacrifices are expected in such a new space program."},{"CreatedByName":"Skivvaxlare","CreatedById":25536,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-16T01:59:16Z","Content":"Here\\\u0027s the ship in the assembly building.

I had it set up so that the bottom four would decouple and then the bottom middle engine would fire off, but I had to decouple the four on the launch pad and they pushed me upwards as they were still running at full power."},{"CreatedByName":"Bluejayek","CreatedById":18471,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-16T02:19:09Z","Content":"Nice craft.\n\nAs per aiming at moon, the moon is not a very massive body. Therefore, its SOI is very small. Further, even if you aimed directly at it when you launched, it is moving as well. By the time you get to where it was, it has probably moved out of the way, so you miss it and enter the suns SOI instead.\n\nIf you are trying to launch to the moon you must take into account this motion and aim ahead of it. I find the most foolproof method is using Hohmman Transfer orbits. To do this, you first set up a circular(ish) orbit around kerbin in the same plane as the moon. Then, when you are oposite about 20 degrees ahead of the moon (the point where the moon will be when you get there) you do another burn until you are in an eliptical orbit intersecting the moons orbit. When you get there, hopefully you are in the moons SOI and can slow down to an orbit or (crash) landing.\n\nWelcome to KSP and happy flying ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nPS: Craft file is in KSP \u003E ships \u003E (shipname.craft)\n\nPPS: In terms of your issue with the bottom stage being too small, it can be helpful to add a few solid boosters around it. You can set them up to fire at the same time, and they will give it the little boost it needs to leave the ground. It would make your nice ship a bit less symetrical though.\n\nAlso, afaik the seconds A.S.A.S. module you have there does absolutely nothing. Deleting it would increase your performance noticeably even if it is a small portion of the total weight of your craft, simply because it is on the final stage. With some rockets, you can even get 100\\\u0027s of m/s of extra delta v by removing your parachute. This however is not recomended if you want your kerbals to survive and are not an expert pilot. Powered landings on kerbin can be very dicey."},{"CreatedByName":"thorfinn","CreatedById":8349,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-16T02:23:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Here\\\u0027s the ship in the assembly building.

It in principle has enough first stage thrust, but wasn\\\u0027t lifting off due the the \u0027stick pad\u0027 bug. Raising the first stage up on decouplers is a sufficient workaround at this time. Alternatively, drag the engine from stage 6 to stage 8, giving a bit more thrust in the early part of the flight. Also, you may as well remove one of the ASAS modules. There\\\u0027s no real need for more than 1 per ship.

It is very close to being able to achieve kerbol escape velocity in fact. It probably can, but I would have to do a more fuel efficient launch. \n\nYou\\\u0027ll see that it really is very small. Total of 4.5 units of liquid fuel. \n\nIncidentally, this is also easily capable of making it to the mun, but landing is a real pain without landign struts, and I have not yet made a succesful landing in a state that I could take off again. \n\nA final comment I will make at this time.. To achieve orbit, it is ALWAYS most efficient to turn towards the 90 degrees marker on the navball. The reason for this is Kerbins spin. The spin on its axis gives you a bit of a boost (~200m/s iirc) which significantly reduces your fuel requirements."}]}
