I had 5 Kerbals in that station in three separate pods. The explosion just sent everything flying, making the map view of the Mun look like a mini Saturn (the station was over 100 parts, and only a few were destroyed). So, now I got 5 very frighted Kerbals in a field of debris orbiting the Mun. I quickly modified my Lunar lander with a hitchhiker can, and sent Jeb up all by himself to go and pick these poor saps up. The hardest part was Han Solo-ing it through the debris field to get close enough to each pod to have the Kerbals EVA to the rescue ship. We got them all picked up though, and they headed back home. Upon further inspection, the space station had suffered from an \u0022Apollo 13\u0022 style catastrophic failure. The Xenon gas tanks in the service bay shorted out, causing an explosive decompression of the service bay. The force of the explosion caused the command pod with station commander Dunfee to separate from the science lab, where Bill and Segwick were. the service bay was in between the lab and the sleeping quarters, where Herman and Wingrad were sleeping at the time. That station was set to be a staging area for Minimus mining operations, but that cataclysmic event erased any hopes of that plan. (I.E.
