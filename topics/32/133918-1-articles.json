I\u0027m writing this to get help from anyone out there who feels the same way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is my story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI bought the game when it was in \u0027Beta Than Ever\u0027 0.9 release. That means I\u0027ve been playing for a bit more than a year now. I\u0027ve known the game since 2013 and I distinctly remember watching the \u0027Special Delivery Package\u0027 video featured on the front page of the KSP site(that may have been a bit later on). I remember watching KSP videos and getting hyped about it. I remember my first mun rocket that overshot and ended up in orbit between Jool and Eeloo, I remember my first Mun landing, Duna landing, and docking. Eventually, through career mode I managed to land on Moho and Eve, Gilly. Now it seems I\u0027ve lost all purpose to play the game. I want to, but every time I design a rocket, search launch windows, train my crew, download mods, something makes me stop. I stop in the middle of constructing ships. I\u0027ve tried out other career modes, ones with specific purposes like great Parkaboy\u0027s Plan Kappa. Nothing makes me have a purpose for playing KSP anymore, and yet I desperately want to, too.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there anyone out there who feels the same way?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boxman","CreatedById":61559,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T14:58:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have gone through the same myself and sadly I cannot offer anything positve as even after a year\u002B break I am still in this very same situation.
