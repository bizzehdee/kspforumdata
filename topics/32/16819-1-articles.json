They are moderators; that is their job. You may notice my phrasing above: \u0022fulfillment of duties\u0022. They have been selected for their roles, and if they were deemed unsuitable, they would no longer have these roles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, there are people above them, who ultimately hand down major decisions; one example is the mandatory posting of sourcecode for plugins. Each of these decisions is made for a good reason, and if you don\u0027t like that, the developers do not need you on their forums, which these most certainly are. In spite of the minority opinion, I have not yet seen a moderator action that I found unreasonable, and I am sure that if one of the moderators did something which truly was, appealing for a review by a superior would be a far better decision than complaining about it to the world. There\u0027s no call for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short: Cool off, people.
