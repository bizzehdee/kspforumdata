I tried to build Mulbin\u0027s fairings for my Saturn Apollo missions a few weeks ago, but I couldn\u0027t get the space craft to the Mun because too much weight. I tried cutting down weight on everything but failed to get it right. This resulted in me having to build a Saturn V from scratch with a lot more dV. And what do you do with more dV launch bigger things \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9346020/141019%20Saturn%20V%20day/saturn%20v%20day%20%281%29.png\u0022 alt=\u0022saturn%20v%20day%20%281%29.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting rid of the first stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9346020/141019%20Saturn%20V%20day/saturn%20v%20day%20%282%29.png\u0022 alt=\u0022saturn%20v%20day%20%282%29.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYay fairings! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9346020/141019%20Saturn%20V%20day/saturn%20v%20day%20%283%29.png\u0022 alt=\u0022saturn%20v%20day%20%283%29.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI Present thee .. the Mun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9346020/141019%20Saturn%20V%20day/saturn%20v%20day%20%284%29.png\u0022 alt=\u0022saturn%20v%20day%20%284%29.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso started to build an interplanetary drive for a Von Braun type Duna mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9346020/141019%20Saturn%20V%20day/saturn%20v%20day%20%285%29.png\u0022 alt=\u0022saturn%20v%20day%20%285%29.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe drive is more or less complete but I still need to design the CTV and the lander\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9346020/141019%20Saturn%20V%20day/saturn%20v%20day%20%286%29.png\u0022 alt=\u0022saturn%20v%20day%20%286%29.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd a new Saturn demands a bigger Skylab.
