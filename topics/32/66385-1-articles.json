I\u0027d start with the 2-man lander can as my command pod. Then stick any number of hitchhiker cans immedietly below as your passenger area. For a bus, each Kerbal has their own seat. For a luxury cruiser, a maximum of 2 kerbals per 4-man hitchhiker-can. For long term living, 1 kerbal per hitchhiker. But for your bus, command pod on top: and again, either the 2-man lander can or even the 3-man pod, but only have 2 drivers. Or a pilot \u002B co-pilot with a little room to stretch their legs. Then 2 hitchhiker pods would mean 8 passengers. Thats a pretty good bus at that point. Docking port on top, cause you never know when that will come in handy.
