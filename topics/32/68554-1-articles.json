While this has caused many people to jump to the conclusion that the parts are OP, I have decided to conduct experiments in-game with the parts to see just how these numbers compare to the actual results of a flight. This is due in part to the fact that I only view \u0022overpoweredness\u0022 by the results of an object\u0027s application.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis experiment tests the balancing of the parts by making what is essentially the same craft in a 2.5 meter and 3.75 meter scale.
