If I roll a rover with a command chair and the occupant of the chair hits the ground they go limp, can\u0027t really blame them for that, but once the rover has been righted I can\u0027t wake them up. I can\u0027t do anything with them, they are just slumped in the chair and won\u0027t move. I can\u0027t click on them to make them leave the chair, when I right click on them I just get their name, no option to leave chair. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the chair breaks away from the rover then nothing can rouse them. But if its still connected when I start to drive the rover again they suddenly wake up, sometimes causing a major physics freak-out which can rip the rover to bits, or sometimes just shakes it about. Then it gets odd, as I drive the rover they walk, but they\u0027re still trapped in the chair, so as the rover drives forward they try to walk forward and when the rover turns they turn. This also generates some odd physics as it seems the trapped kerbal is also exerting a directional force. But still I can\u0027t make them leave the chair. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/wL8ffBO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wL8ffBOm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wL8ffBOm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/SAWPGc8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SAWPGc8m.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SAWPGc8m.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is taken after a roll where one of the kerbals bashed his head and you can see him slumped forward. The other pic is shortly later where he is standing up in his seat and walking as the rover drives. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have the crew manifest mod present so I thought I might be able to use that to move them from the chair into the rovers command pod (this rover has a command pod too) but that only causes an entirely new and socially confusing problem (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/36602-Kerbal-Cloning-Machine\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esee thread on cloning machine\u003C/a\u003E) but doesn\u0027t get them out of the chair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried pretty much everything I can think of, including getting another kerbal to kick the trapped kerbal (this used to be a solution to being passed out on panel parts) and trying to make another one board the occupied chair but no option is shown to enable that. I\u0027ve even tried to \u0027carefully\u0027 cut the unconscious kerbal out of the chair with a lazer (I\u0027ll leave you to guess how that went). Nothing I\u0027ve tried can get them out of the chair once this happens, so it leaves someone forever trapped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else seen this happen? Are there any solutions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess the best pre-emptive thing to do is have a roll cage around the command chair, but in the case of the rover I\u0027m using atm I simply don\u0027t have room for a roll cage.

I\u0027ve tried switching on RCS thrusters, but they won\u0027t come on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried switching craft, but they still appear to be part of the craft with the command chair. I think you\u0027re right thou, it is like they are stuck between connected and not, but the chair still considers that it has an occupant and if I open the crew manifest up the passed out kerbal is listed in the crafts crew. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etbh Vanamonde I\u0027m not doing anything too crazy (by my standards anyway). This particular rover does have a fairly odd construction thou, and as no-one recognises this as a familiar issue I guess it must down to the crafts design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rover has a movable arm with a KAS winch on it that can take a couple of different attachments, one of which is a module that has a command chair. Ok so that does sound a little nuts, but I had this problem before I made the modular command chair attachment, the command chair used to just be on the side of the rover. So I don\u0027t think I can blame the KAS attached command chair module or the DR movable arm. The idea of the command chair being a modular component was partly a work around for this problem, the DR arm does provide some degree of head protection to the occupant in the event of rolling the rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that issue aside it works great and is a pretty versatile little rover.

It fires the grab part up the hill and it locks into the ground and then the rover can pull itself up very steep hills, the small modular section on the back (which is a tiny science rover) helps it from tipping back over when the grab is released from the ground. In climbing mode the command chair module gets left at the bottom of the hill and the 3rd guy just hangs onto ladders. On steep climbs like this any mistake and its game over for the whole thing anyway!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"L.J.
