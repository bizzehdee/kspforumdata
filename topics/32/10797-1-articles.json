I ran test on all my boosters from fast accelerating light lifters to lumbering heavy weights and in all cases replacing LV-T30 with aerospike noticeably improve rocket performance. That extra bit of weight is nothing when you look at its thrust and fuel efficiency.\n\nThen I thought maybe this engine is suppose to be hard to place since it can\\\u0027t sit on top of decouplers, rendering it only useful for parallel stage side boosters or very cleverly engineered rockets, turns out my 12-tanks-to-LKO orbital tanker was perfectly happy sitting on the pad on top of 6 needle thin spikes.\n\nIt would seem possible also to setup aerospike engines for upper stages for giant rockets too by using decoupler only in the center stack and have the aerospike engines clustered around it and attached to the below stage with struts (might get a bit hairy during staging), so what\\\u0027s the point of LV-T30 now?"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T13:51:29Z","Content":"The aerospike engine is intended for spaceplanes.\n\nThe LVT-30 still has the Rule Of Cool on its side.

Currently, there is no use for the regular jet engine as the scram jet fills that role and more. The scram jet is very much overpowered. Try putting some on your rocket and you get to 10km with using very little fuel (also, the scram jet isn\\\u0027t supposed to function at low altitudes).\n\nOne thing that the regular rocket parts have over the C7 parts is the fuel tank.

The reason for the divide between the two was that the US military\\\u0027s original JP-1 fuel standard was very broad to ensure a ready supply from refineries, but resulted in a wide range of fuel characteristics. RP-1 was developed as a more restricted standard for the much tighter tolerances required by rocket engines, which also didn\\\u0027t need nearly as secure a supply. It\\\u0027s basically a very refined kerosene, and could certainly be pumped through a jet turbine engine.\n\nTL:DR - rocket fuel = jet fuel, for certain definitions of both."},{"CreatedByName":"trbinsc","CreatedById":10144,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T19:54:28Z","Content":"But the Rocket fuel tanks also carry oxidizer, and I\\\u0027m sure a jet engine would have no use for that."},{"CreatedByName":"Tosh","CreatedById":11055,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T10:19:52Z","Content":"Well, areospikes are *believed* to be more effective than \u0027regular\u0027 LFEs (although there\\\u0027s no one flew to space for this moment, they\\\u0027re only passing ground tests).
