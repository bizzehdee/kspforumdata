The game took this and mirrored it, they flipped East and West. But unfortunately it\u0027s the old terrain, which was replaced in 0.18 I think. But it\u0027s a start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe there\u0027s some way to get the configs out using reverse-Copernicus? I\u0027m not sure how that would work, but it might involve reverse engineering or decompiling KSP code, which is against the terms of service and potentially illegal, but don\u0027t quote me on that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is HarvestR\u0027s comment on that map:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nThat map is an example provided in one of the Libnoise tutorials, which is an opensource numerical noise library we still use to generate terrain in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nThe very earliest versions of Kerbin were using the map as a placeholder, and after the game went public people started founding countries and creating all sorts of stories around it.
