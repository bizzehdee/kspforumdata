Very useful for rendezvous - but it also got me thinking.

This a major issue becuase you can\u0027t launch one plane then swap to one on the runway and launch that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolution: Get your 1st plane moving down the runway and trimmed so it will take off, then swap to the 2nd plane before it acctually leaves the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem 3) This is a really wierd one. Anything moving on the ground will stop dead once it gets 350m from the active ship. As if the game freezes it. The engines still burn but it just sticks there. Once you move back within 350m it has to accelerate from 0 again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolution: Make a plane which can take off within 350m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem 4) The throttle and trim settings carry across when you swap planes. Annoying because this sometimes makes a plane spin out of control when you swap to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolution: Have two similar (or even better identicle) planes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope someone else tries this out and has some fun with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kevinlacht","CreatedById":14955,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-05T18:40:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis belongs in challenges.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-05T18:43:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExcept it\u0027s not a Challenge, it\u0027s a novel observation, Fuzzy Dunlop could make it a Challenge though \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nori","CreatedById":41334,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-05T19:43:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is just crazy...
