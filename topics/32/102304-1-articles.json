So, obviously, I have quicksave\\quickload off on my career save, and I play with all the \u0022hardcore\u0022 houserules, such as no \u0022simulations\u0022 in sandbox and no debug. But this is the first time I\u0027ve ever actually lost a Kerbal I really cared about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI already lost Bob on the far side of the moon, underestimating how much fuel it would take to land. Jeb\u0027s death though, smacks even harder of hubris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe was my pilot for the first trip to Minmus. I had a contract to do some EVA work in addition to the general exploration contract, and my rocket had performed unexpectedly well - so well, in fact, that my transfer stage was still half full on landing. So instead of dumping it, I landed a while from the EVA site on the engine, figuring I would just jetpack myself to the top of the cliff. Back in (0.16? 0.17? Not sure, whenever EVA and Minmus first existed together) I used to jetpack people 15km a hop, and I got pretty good at it. So I thought I would do just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImmediately I figured out something was wrong. First, EVA zones are really small, and I was doing a lot of hunting around on my way down trying to stay in the zone. When I landed, I had 2.10 mono left in the jetpack. I was sweating at this point - I was 16km away from my ship - farther than I thought I would be. I was cursing myself silently - there were \u0022above such altitude\u0022 hovers on the contract as well, and I \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E have done those first and burnt that transfer stage. Had I done this, I could have landed on the landing legs, which could probably handle the incline on top of the cliff in question, which probably would have been no more than an 800m hop to the EVA site. Why did I push so hard? As I lined up Jeb to the 16km marker, I let the question drop and assured myself that it didn\u0027t matter if I had used more than half the fuel; I would be more efficient on the way back because I wouldn\u0027t have to hunt around, I had a clear target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I started the hop. I almost thought I had it, until I started the landing phase. I ran out of fuel at 600m. As Jeb fell I flailed for solutions - put him on his helmet! - but not, there\u0027s no fuel - and was left with nothing to do but watch as he fell to become one with the dust of Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, today, I am trying to recruit some candidates to replace Jeb. I figure I\u0027ll do this by loading up my Kerbin exploration airplane - small, high performance, very Kerbal safety! (ie you die in it.) No Kerbal seems up to it, they all freak out, all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my question to the forum is - have you killed your Jeb in a no-quickload game? And what\u0027s it like carrying on without him? Are there other Kerbals who can approach his level of fearlessness? Has anyone figured out what combination of courageous\\stupid makes a Kerbal fearless? I fear many KIA\u0027s in the quest to find out for myself :\\\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T07:35:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJeb has the badS flag in his config making him fearless-you gan get it randomly on other kerbals thoough\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Overland","CreatedById":119812,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T11:29:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EName a ship after him. plant a flag in his honor.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm not a stranger to loss of kerbals..even in the most innocent circumstances.. just about everythings deadly in KSP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my current game I drove 90km to get him back.. but with history as a guide.. this brave little kerbal never lives long \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esimply because I.. like many people choose him to crew the best vehicles.. be they planes, rockets or trains.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand those things push the boundries until they cant anymore.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehes always the first to go either to dust.. or worse. orbiting kerbol. in a capsule..a station.. or EVA.. without fuel, light.. or hope \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esuch is the life of this great pilot \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"celem","CreatedById":91132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T12:00:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, unfortunately he is the only \u0027always fearless\u0027 pilot.

Show your grief, erect a monument, recover the body, build a shrine. Go nuts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETypically I do lose Jeb if Im going to lose a Kerbal. He has such a tendancy to be a Test Pilot. (If you re-order your astronauts in the complex by drag-dropping then you can change who the default kerbal that jumps into manned ships is. Its the guy top of the list, which is why its Jeb.) Once Jeb has risked his neck through my pre-orbital program and i\u0027ve got a fistful of trained \u0027nauts (school bus to orbit and moon flybys for mass-training) I tend to move him down the list and use him for the most landmark (and hopefully tested) projects.
