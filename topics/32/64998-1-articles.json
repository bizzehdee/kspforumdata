But I do wonder if the missions will be just go to planet/moon X and return. Or will they be land at a specific crather, collect samples off of rocks X, Y, and Z, and return with no lose of crew. I would like to see harder missions as the career mode progresses.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T23:55:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey way it looks right now is that there are no set missions for Career mode (or ever will be), it will most likely end up as the sets of contracts the Dev team is currently working on. Basically, you need to complete the terms of the contract to get funding (?) for new parts or other rewards. In \u003Cem\u003Eessence\u003C/em\u003E, it\u0027s similar to what you have in mind but there\u0027s no forced path you\u0027ll have to take. You\u0027re free to take on or pass up jobs as you please.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
