That value is certainly up for debate, especially since certain part occlusion isn\u0027t modeled in the stock aero (or oldFAR for that matter) and struts are often clipped inside the craft, but saying they shouldn\u0027t produce any drag at all is dodging a very real concern."},{"CreatedByName":"RAINCRAFTER","CreatedById":127524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T21:44:12Z","Content":"This thread is cool.

So your rocket needs some structural parts that add some drag and weight... Seems only fair... And judging from the pictures in this topic the drag and finally the reduced performance added by the struts seems really negligible..\n\nI think it\u0027s more of a problem that the drag of the struts is independent of their size, and how their positioned with respect to the airstream etc. Stuff I see in the exchange forum like connecting wing tips to fuselages with long struts exposed to the airstream should really add a -lot- of drag to the craft.. But I guess that\u0027s a simplification we\u0027ll have to live with in stock (go to voxel based aero like nuFar).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T14:03:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 02:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Chris\\_2**"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T16:27:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E oh. so if you *REALLY* cared about efficiency, your struts would all start on the disposable parts.\n\u003E interesting.\n\nI do that anyway to reduce part count."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T16:42:14Z","Content":"There are some times when it\u0027s easier/simpler to start the strut on the upper stage part.
