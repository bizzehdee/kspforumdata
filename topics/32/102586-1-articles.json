You can send out Jeb, Bill and Bob -back-to-back- and noone else for everything you do in the game. When they are currently going to Duna, and you want to visit say Eve next, there is no reason not to wait for their return and send them right off again, afterwards, for the next long-term mission (launching windows provided - and there will be one coming up after their arrival - guranteed. It\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s just a matter of how much extra warping you do). How much time you warp through for doing this has no consequence in any way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: And yes: Offtime is irrelevant, if time passes for nothing else, either, except orbits, which repeat, by defintion. That changes a great deal though, if other stuff would be affecrted by time, too. Go figure: Time (as space) only matters as a relation - and that takes two. If you only have one object, there is no point in assigning any location to it. As is with time - if you only have one thing fall through it, it is meaningless.
