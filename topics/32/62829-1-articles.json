Now, what was I thinking? My computer can barely handle my bitcoin mining operations, let alone KSP, let alone mining bitcoins while playing KSP. But still, I persisted, and during one quick break during my Bitcoin mining operation on a slow day when my fellow miners where bored and the hash wasn\u0027t that good nor the payout, I decided to set my plans into action. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was to build a kilometer long spacestation. No, wait, it was two kilometers long. Anyways, I began to work on my first segment, one of the 20-segments that would make up the station. And this, my friend, is a top-down view of Segment-01. In total, it had 2000 parts (All them decorations on the outside hull that you can\u0027t see). The planned station would have around 20,000. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Kerbolnauts where sick of sitting in little tin cans, either waiting for the moment they would don their spacesuits and jump out the airlock, or waiting for the moment they would die (More often the latter). So 99.9% of them want a stopover station where they can sleep/eat breakfast before embarking on Beyond-LKO missions. I comply, and build it in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Top down view of Segment-01. Note that this is only 75% of it, the other 25% goes beyond the VAB roof). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fBFoye0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fBFoye0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing the lazy person I am, I decided to Hyperedit it into orbit, not that I could\u0027ve launched it anyways. So, right before I hit the launch button, KSP is already eating up a good number of my CPU percentage. However, as I clicked the launch button, I noticed something disturbing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, my camera began to lag more than Internet Explorer on Windows Vista, followed by the game suddenly replacing my flag with that of a graphic of a Kerbal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince stuff like this doesn\u0027t happen all the time, I......just ignored it, then blamed it on the lag. Bad choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game suddenly popped up a menu that claimed that I had no command pods on it. That\u0027s weird, since I put a total of three different command units on it along with enough electrical power to charge the iPhones of 100,000,000 American citizens with bloodshot eyes after a night of playing Flappy Bird. So I attempt to load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothing happened. I try again. Nothing pops up, no GUI, no button, not even something that said \u0022ERROR: COMPUTER WILL COMMIT SUICIDE IN 10..9..\u0022. It just loaded my ship again. And again. And again. So I flee to the Space Center, hoping to escape the Kraken that has clearly eaten the VAB. It takes around fifteen minutes to load Space Center screen. I decide to reenter VAB. And then.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oops!
