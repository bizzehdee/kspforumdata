What I mean, to say is that I can see that we have experienced KSP as a service rather a product because of the updates moving through Alpha and into Beta. Perhaps when the game reaches 1.0, (or perhaps 1.1) that interest and and way in which we interact with each other on the Forums and Reddit will change as the game will be complete.

Each update, hasn\u0027t changed the core game but the way we play. Contracts and career being introduced is a good example. We enjoy the game, some of us explore all the possibilities, but then the next release comes and we have a new experience. The service idea also brings into account the role that the Forum and Reddit members play including modders. We give feedback and the direction that the game goes in changes to. In that very real sense Squad is providing the game, the forums as a service to us. That will probably change when it goes to a full release and we stop expecting new features.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-23T07:02:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat business model works for MMO which require a constant flow of money to run its servers, or for a big corporation with lots of games under their belt to basically rent out all games in their possession for a recurring fee (EA and their model, ugh), but for a single player game?

Games with a strong community definetly develop theire own language, habits, does and don\u0027ts. From my point of view ksp definetly falls into that category. I think of this community as a snow globe^^ it\u0027s a world of it\u0027s own and it\u0027s vastly different from the dota 2, dayz or space engineers community (those are the ones I visit once in a while). The service aspect is absolutely true. Many games do that, with quite different approaches. ksp is one of the examples that has rly fair busines model and that\u0027s why the community exists as it does. One of the noticable aspects is almost absolute lack of trolls that claim the devs are soulles greedy scrooges, that\u0027s pretty unique. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if ksp is a game that keeps you commited to mostly this one game.

There are people who play almost nothing besides KSP (I am one of them at the moment) because it is so engaging to a certain kind of individual. Also: Due to the fact KSP is constantly evolving and developers are in an ongoing exchange with us, the players, at least the early access period of KSP has had more the makings of a service than that of a traditional game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-23T11:44:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, thank you.
