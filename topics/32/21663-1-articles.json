After a few major versions, and dozens of minor fixes between major reworks, I came up with this. I call it the Lifeboat-MK2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/vvzPh\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/vvzPh\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, this version is a resounding success, which is a huge relief after 12 deaths and who knows how many aborts even beginning the test. A fully fueled Lifeboat weighs 1.5 tons, empty its about 1.3. This is much lighter than a conventional 3-man pod and de-orbit RCS module, which weighs in around 5 tons. Too bad this pod only holds two people. Plus, the ride is an absolutely terrifying, white-knuckled one-way trip. The pod has so little fuel, once you board it, you\u0027re committed.
