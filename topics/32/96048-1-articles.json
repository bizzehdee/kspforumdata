I had plenty of data stored within the capsule and didn\u0027t want to give it all up by reloading, so I decide that I shall mount a rescue attempt! And not just to save Jebediah, but to drag the entire capsule back to Kerbin with me so I can get all that sweet, sweet science. I build a ship made specifically for the purpose, stripping away all unnecessary items and adding in a cargo module so I can snatch the capsule up and transport it home. It took a number of attempts; getting the right interplanetary trajectory, making sure I arrived in a good spot, matching up orbits, slowly but surely bringing myself in close for a rendezvous with the other ship, detaching the command pod, and finally scooping it up neatly inside the cargo bay. It took quite some time, but I managed it, all this with plenty of fuel left to get it all back home. Yay!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only problem left was that Kerbin was currently out of position. Okay, so I just need to time-warp so Duna and Kerbin are in the right positions for a good shot back. That\u0027s fine. I go to the spaceport, initiate maximum warp, wait, then stop when it\u0027s all set up. Time to switch back to the ships and start the journey...except, wait, why are the symbols for each ship so far apart? To my abject horror, I discover that somehow, the captured pod had phase-shifted through the closed cargo doors during warp drive and was now about 80000km behind the rescue ship. The doors had been closed. It was inside! And now it\u0027s outside and far away! Ffffff-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo at that point, after having gone through a rather heavy amount of trial and error to get to where I was, the thought of matching up docking alignments again and doing it all over just made me say \u0022Screw it\u0022 and reload from a previous save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it could\u0027ve been so awesome too...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Norpo","CreatedById":113342,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T21:43:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, warp mode and cargo bays without docking ports don\u0027t really mix.

I had a pretty awesome almost rescue as well. I had a large rover-ish type science collecting ship stuck on minmus. I made a tug vessel with 4 nuke engines with a claw. The thing looked like a crab and was supposed to land on top of the rover and the claw would attach to the science processing lab on the rover. After a few tries I managed to get the tug attached and carried it into an escape of minmus. With the vehicles attached I hit the time warp and both ships exploded. I quick reloaded and tried again, and again both ships exploded. The third time I separated the vessels and time warped, they both exploded. After about 2 hours I gave up and loaded an old save.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stargazer86","CreatedById":134900,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T19:10:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022timsfitz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022timsfitz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJeb could have just removed the science from the pod and deposited it in the rescue craft.

I snatched up the pods from the original craft as well as the first rescue ship, bringing them both back home safely with 2000 science to show for my efforts.

I\u0027m going to check a little later to see if you can use other connections like girders to do the same, but I think they will.
