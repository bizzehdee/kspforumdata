left the Rover on the planet, it\u0027s \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPilot transferred to the Lander Capsule for Ascent .. went back to Orbit, and had about half a tank of fuel left.. so we did a neccessary plane change to accomodate the orbit of our return vehicle, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand then I played catchup using the (much better fuelled) return vehicle employing the ORDA computer for measurements (but doing the RDV manually), and finally docked both ships using ERKLE (works better\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethan ORDA right now) just relying on ORDA Attitude control. then did an EVA-Personell transfer to the crewtank (will be possible with menus in the new ORDA..can\u0027t wait!), dropped the Lander in Orbit (could theoretically be re-used if refilled using ORDA refuel Mod), and went on my way home.. and safely landed my six Kerbals using four radially mounted parachutes and a small Lander Engine for the extra smoothness on Landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo pictures yet, since I didn\u0027t think the mission would actually work, and therefore didn\u0027t take any.. but I will add pictures of my launchers later today when I return home.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-09T10:34:41Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2012 10:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Kuldan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tom K.","CreatedById":52797,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-09T10:39:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to do a Duna and return mission myself, The rocket is completly done and tested but I haven\u0027t really got time to do the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts a big rocket with four parachutes a the top, my plan is to use the little atmosphere on Duna as effecient as possible, when the parachutes slow me down enough I will start a powered descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I hope I will have enough fuel to get it back in orbit and I will probably have another resque rocket in orbit already to bring them back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little question though, can four large parachutes resist slowing down a heavylander, in Duna atmosphere?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kuldan","CreatedById":5337,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-09T11:20:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, good question.. in my trials, I actually figured that I do a 100% powered Landing on Duna since I have that D-V in my IPTS (Interplanetary Transfer Stage) to slow the Lander to about 300m/s before I have to drop it and switch over to the lander engines, which is plenty to do a 100% powered descent..so my lander actually doesn\u0027t even have a parachute at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kiershar","CreatedById":40861,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-09T16:36:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tom K.\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tom K.\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m trying to do a Duna and return mission myself, The rocket is completly done and tested but I haven\u0027t really got time to do the mission.\u003Cp\u003EIts a big rocket with four parachutes a the top, my plan is to use the little atmosphere on Duna as effecient as possible, when the parachutes slow me down enough I will start a powered descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I hope I will have enough fuel to get it back in orbit and I will probably have another resque rocket in orbit already to bring them back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little question though, can four large parachutes resist slowing down a heavylander, in Duna atmosphere?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s really not much atmosphere on Duna.
