To reduce burn times, increase thrust and/or reduce mass. Increasing thrust usually increases mass both in the weight of engines and in the extra fuel they need to maintain the desired amount of delta-V. Therefore, reducing mass is usually the best bet. Carrying this to its logical conclusion, the easiest way to reduce burn times is to put all your various mission payloads on different ships. Instead of docking them in LKO and sending out 1 huge monster ship, send its pieces separately and assemble them at the destination. Because each ship is smaller, it requires less fuel for the same amount of delta-V, and fewer engines to get the desired burn time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this regard, consider the probes. There really aren\u0027t many good reasons for attaching them to the mothership. First, this makes the mothership heavier.
