I think that a verbal reprimand would\u0027ve been more appropriate, and if a flame war escalated from there, maybe a post lock was neccesary, but not so early\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I did some investigating, and I found an amazing landing location. It is perfectly situated right on the edge of a crater, its completely level for kilometers around, and provides a constant view of the planet. Also, the surrounding landscape is rather beautiful. But what else is special about this location? It is the exact location for the Apollo 11 landing. I am dubbing this exact location and surrounding area as \u0022Neil\u0027s Landing\u0022 for future purposes, so please keep this thread alive.
