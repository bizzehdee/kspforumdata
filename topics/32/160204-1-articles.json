You can likely save some delta-V by burning from a pole when your orbit lines up with the planet\u0027s prograde direction, then doing bi-elliptical transfers or something. The trip will definitely be complicated by the need for complete scans, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"T.A.P.O.R.","CreatedById":137748,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-05T11:08:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuch nerdery.
