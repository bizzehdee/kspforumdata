I\u0027ve been suspecting it since they announced 1.0 with only one beta release...\n\nWe already know that Squad want the game in more outlets than just Steam and their own website. Designating the game as a full release may well be motivated by that.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E heh.. i think some folks are overthinking this. I mean not to long ago they had the partnership with NASA for 23.5 and the asteroid redirect mission\n\nNow that\u0027s a fair point. I suppose a good reasonable scenario is a partnership with another space company. SpaceX is obvious given Elon Musk has complimented the game, but there are others.
