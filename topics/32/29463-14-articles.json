Allegedly. Then the ridiculousness happened. After going through the usual motions (orbiting a satellite, orbiting a kerbal, an LKO rendezvous test with my shiny new service module/docking target). All this went swimmingly. Then it begun. Mun mission Apollo style. I built the rocket, I (err...mission control) did some napkin math and got about 8 tons worth of payload to 150km LKO. 8.36 tons is about 8 tons. NO. It isn\u0027t. When the manual says 8 tons, it means \u003Cem\u003E8 tons\u003C/em\u003E not 8 tons give-or-take a bit. The mission is off to an embarrassing start, and I have to use the lander\u0027s engine and dip into my \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E lean fuel budget to clean up my orbit. Not as bad as expected, I can still make it, but there goes the safety margin I left myself (around 300 m/s). Then I decouple the CM from the LM and position the ships for docking. What do I see? A big caution-striped decoupler blocking the docking port on the LM. Laughing. Mocking me. Well. Time to scrub this mission and go back to the drawing board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of building a bigger rocket--I could easily lob 100 tons into LKO if I wanted, but I\u0027m trying to simulate a logical technological progression here--I launch the LM (unmanned) and the CM (with Jeb) into orbit. We\u0027re going to do some orbital construction today! So I set up the rendezvous (and \u003Cem\u003Enailed it\u003C/em\u003E might I add--it might actually be a personal best time). And then once I had a visual on my LM, what did I see? That damned decoupler! I\u0027d nailed the rendezvous with the wrong LM. Argh! So I deorbited Jeb (and removed the old LM to avoid a repeat).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis time things went fairly smoothly. Rendezvous. Dock. Transfer burn to the Mun. I even had a bit of my upper stage attached to the LM, so I had a much bigger fuel budget than expected too. Right as I reach Munar orbit, I realize that the CM doesn\u0027t have any way to control it remotely. Meh. That couldn\u0027t possibly come back to bite me. I\u0027ll just do the rendezvous with the RCS in the LM. Worst case scenario, Jeb gets to take a bit of a space walk. Jeb loves space walks. So I transfer Jeb to the lander and deorbit. Once again, I nailed it. About as efficient a descent as I could\u0027ve hoped for. However, I was still very optimistic. While the CM had plenty of fuel, the LM most definitely didn\u0027t. But Jeb was at the controls, and I know he\u0027d man up and try to make orbit on his tiny tank of fuel and the RCS (which I had quite a lot of). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClose. So very close. But not close enough. The lander didn\u0027t make orbit, and all the tanks are empty. So, it\u0027s time for the manliest possible solution. Jeb bails out of the death trap and turns on his jetpack. Miraculously, he manages to circularize in a horribly eccentric orbit. But disaster has been averted. Now, the second stage of the LM...err...Jedediah Kerman is orbiting the Mun, grinning maniacally (Jeb LOVES space walks). This is going to be one hell of a rescue mission, but I\u0027m going to do it with the same configuration that got me into this mess. While my lander can\u0027t actually land and return, it is at least a spare seat, and I intend to get some use out of the stupid thing (that said, it\u0027s probably okay for Minimus or the other smaller moons). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoin us next week when Bob Kerman embarks on a heroic rescue mission!

Simple, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figured that i\u0027d already been to Laythe unmanned, and Duna manned, so this should\u0027ve been a milk run for Jeb and friends.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaturally, with said above experience, i proceeded to overengineer the \u0022milk-run\u0022 into a needlessly complicated Carrier craft and Lander system, because i couldn\u0027t get over the internals for the new Cupola, necessitating a \u003Cem\u003Elateral\u003C/em\u003E rather than linear docking setup. I was watching my TWR on the carrier craft (3 nuke engines, very poor thrust), which meant that the lander had to be a squat little thing. One Rockomax Poodle, a X200-8 with only 360 units of fuel, and the Cupola made the body of the midget lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was becoming more uselessly complicated, like the US\u0027s M2 Bradley development (\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/aXQ2lO3ieBA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E)\u003Cp\u003EBut the mission must go on! I ended up flying the carrier there, using up way more fuel than intended even with NERVA\u0027s, but i dismissed this issue, thinking i could use surplus fuel from the landers. Jeb proudly boarded his lander, and made his descent into a good-looking crater, where he pierced the soil of the Mun with the Field Dynamics Flag! Unfortunately, i realized only after sitting Jeb back in his seat that.... i had used over half his fuel landing. There was no way a noob like me could get him back to the carrier. Plus, this now meant that the carrier that was supposed to wait for surplus lander fuel (that now didn\u0027t exist) was also stranded. I \u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C/em\u003E get to space, but i lost Bill, Jeb and Bob out there. Who said it was a milkrun, again? (Keep reading, this is only half of the fails.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERescue time! This time, learning from my prior error, i create a simpler rescue lander with capacity for 3 rover seats(Jeb loves reentering in external seating) and sent my rescuer off to save Jeb! Fast forward to landing, where i swoop down to rescue Jeb and... *BAM* .... The landing legs were too short, and the engine exploded on contact due to a rough landing. It took 3 attempts to finally set down a rescuer for the rescuer of the rescuer of the rescuee (That\u0027s right, 1 for 3 on the landing attempts due to design and then pilot error), filling the external seats that i thought would not be needed. Good thing my insurance covers lithobraking damages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have pictures, but i don\u0027t remeber how to post them.
