When I freely admit to being a KSP Win64 user (having used the Unfixer tool) and being forever tainted as \u0027annoying\u0027 or \u0027irrelevant\u0027. Since switching to Win64 (because, with the amount of mods I want to use, OpenGL is sorely needed but breaks TextureReplacer reflections - Win64 doesn\u0027t have that problem. I have like 8GB RAM and a meh CPU on this laptop anyway, reflections are literally the only benefit I gain from Win64), I have not once reported a bug to ferram4 at all or any other modder without first verifying on x86. I know Win64 is unstable, the fact I had to hack it means I\u0027m dabbling in things that ought not be dabbled into. But it makes me sad that the actions of other idiots tars me with the same brush. I recently had a bug with InterstellarFlightSwitch - first thing I did? Switch to x86 (even though none of the mods involved are specifically against Win64) and minimal mods for testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5thHorseman, you say I have that choice of number 1, of not reporting bugs when using Win64, but the reality is that I don\u0027t. Because if I report a bug and have admitted in the past that I use Win64 KSP, I\u0027m assumed to also be a moron that doesn\u0027t actually check things. So I have to say \u0027yes I use Win64 KSP normally, but this was on x86 because I\u0027m not stupid\u0027 and even then, I can sense the judgement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust makes me sad, is all.

What does it really matter, in the grand scheme of things.. I stay quiet, bugs will still get reported by other users and fixed, I get locked out of one of my favourite mods, I lose interest in a video game and end up sad that the chuffing asset loader was stupid enough to kick off this whole thing :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T02:51:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E5thHorseman, you say I have that choice of number 1, of not reporting bugs when using Win64, but the reality is that I don\u0027t.
