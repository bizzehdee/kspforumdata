For example, you can hover 85,000 km ahead or behind Kerbin\u0027s orbit around Kerbol without orbiting Kerbin. You can also orbit Kerbol slightly faster or slightly slower than Kerbin without ever entering Kerbin\u0027s SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMight these points provide some useful characteristics for trajectory planning?

So I might only send my lander into Duna\u0027s SOI since it will have only a fraction of my transfer vehicle\u0027s mass. Thus, my mission mass is much less than it would be if KSP used an n-body system.

This orbit would be rather efficient at getting out of the SoI, but docking the lander to the station in this orbit would prove difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
