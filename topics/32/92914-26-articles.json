I am somewhat a victim of too much previous experience and as a result had managed to overlook a few things here and there. Thanks to Scott Manley\u0027s video on getting started in 0.90 for making me re-assess and look at the game ab initio properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Having started going through the tutorials (which I had not realised had been updated - haven;t seen any mention of that anywhere previously), I went through them up to the Munar landing one. The service module apepars to have barely enough fuel - IMO it ought to be a larger tank back there, bearing in mind the idea is to teach beginners. At the end of this tutorial, it reccomends the player have a go at trying to land. This startled me, because trying to actually land on the Mun is far and away the hardest most challenging thing I\u0027ve encountered in the game thus far. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem here is (a) no height above ground readout (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E the speed indicator seems to be able to go from teens of metres per second downwards to teens of metres per second upwards without bothering to go through zero in-between. It was impossible to make a gentle landing in the LEM provided, given teh uneven surface of the Mun. In my opinion, some kind of height over ground indication AND indicator whether vertical veklocity is positive or negative is essential. An rough angle of slope indicator of some sort would be helpful too. Also, \u00A9 harking back to the probes before Kerbals or vice-versa thing, because Munar landings are so difficult there is no way that I would ever want to attempt to land on the Mun with Kerbals before I\u0027ve done the job with a probe first (and hopefully managed to find a relatively flat spot for a manned craft to aim for). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is due to my psychology - I have noticed that I really get immersed in games I\u0027m playing, to a greater extent than some of my friends. In Minecraft, I can get claustrophobic in mines, vertigo up heights and dislike being anywhere too dark. Similarly in KSP, I really do NOT view my Kerbals as expendable, and regard every time one of them dies as a tragedy. Whilst losing one in , say, a freak landing accident on Minmus is sad (I\u0027m very au fait with landing stuff on Minmus), Munar landings as things currently are is so difficult - to me - that I am loathe to attempt to put Kerbals on the surface of the Mun, except on places that I know are flat (and I don\u0027t know why many say that the interior of craters tend to be flat - they don\u0027t seem any better than anywhere else to me). And to explore the rest of the Mun, I want to be able to use rovers, rather than have to repeat the process of using probes to find relatively flat spots, then follow up with a manned landing - which might well be economically uintenable in career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The EVA bug also makes it rather fraught to collect science on EVA. I\u0027m a lot better at EVA manouvering in orbit than I used to be, but when I press F for my Kerbal to grab a ladder, I expect them to do just that, not suddenly twist and zoom off into the black at a great rate of knots! During the Career game I started (but am going to have to abandon - simply ran out of funds), one one mission, I landed Jeb in the desert, which was a biome that hadn\u0027t been visited before. He couldn\u0027t get at teh hatch just by walking close to it, so I tried jumping and aiding the jump with the rocket pack on his suit. This did the trick, but the instant the F(grab) indicator lit, he suddenly zoomed a good 10 metres straight up into the air - far higher than a jetpack can take a Kerbal on Kerbin\u0027s surface!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. I don\u0027t like that Mission Control is where we get contracts from. That should be from an admin building. Mission control should be a place that sends and receives data during flight. I noticed that in some of the tutorials, Gene Kerman is giving information that otherwise would not be available to you. I liked that a lot. Might I suggest that perhaps there is always the option to consult with Mission Control the plus side of which is that you get extra info, the negative side of which could be a loss in reputation (and possibly science and cash as well, as is necessary for game-balance)? That way, the expert pilots amongst us that get into a rare scrape can call on Gene in an emergency, whilst those lesser pilots (like me) can use Gene\u0027s advice more often - and get a sense of achievement as we find we need to call on him less and less often? Right now, I really, really want Gene talking me down on Munar landings, and giving me those altitude over surface readings!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still not convinced that Career mode is for me in its current incarnation (which is, of course, Beta!). I AM, however, very glad that it\u0027s there, as I can see how much it adds to potential gameplay, and I cannot express how delighted I am that KSP allows such freedom in the number of ways that one can play it, both within the game itself, and via the use of mods.
