I got a few interesting results, mainly the 48-7S being able to lift the most for it\u0027s weight, with the Mainsail coming second.

The weight of 2 48-7S\u0027s with 2 fuel lines and 4 cubic octogonal struts is still less weight than a LV-909. It is also 10 more power. However, is the 40 less ISP worth the cost of 10 more power and about .196 weight?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt depend mostly on your payload. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFound that the 48-7S win with less than 1.5 ton payload, the 909 win with more than 2 ton, used 1500 m/s dV here, the 909 will do better with more dV but the most important thing is the payload, an simple reason for this: with an large payload the engine weight become an less faction of the total weight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for short, if you land a probe or single crew ship on Mun the 48-7S win, with a 2-3 man or other heavy stuff like large rovers the 909 win. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 48-7S also win on the high TWR, low duration burns like braking for Duna landings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T10:26:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother interesting question would be, what if (will they?)
