This might have been because I was entering with a speed greater than Jool orbit, but now I am more stable as I am orbiting Jool and I have a slightly inclined orbit. Is it possible to not use a heat shield in Laythe aerobraking, or do I have to use a couple thousand delta-v to orbit it again?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-26T00:34:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can lower the heating for the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my experience Laythe gets hot real easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"invision","CreatedById":178900,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-26T04:15:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nunless you burn a\u00A0lot of fuel to slow\u00A0down you will probably burn up without a shield.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
