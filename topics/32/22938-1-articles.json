Today I was sending my mun base to orbit with the mun before setting up shop on the surface. After setting an intercept encounter I fast forwarded to skip thr boring trip from kerbin to the mun. Upon coming out of time acceleration I could no longer turn off sas or increase or decrease throttle. I tried reloading and even restarting but it keeps happening. The ship is frozen. Also randomly when choosing a vehicle to launch the game crashes. I have restarted the computer and even reinstalled KSP. Anyone else having these problems?

It\u0027s a good idea to update your drivers as \u0022thetommygunyeah\u0022 says if your problems persist. I had problems with crashing at the beginning as well but thanks to KSP tech support we figured out it was a driver issue. Also check your vbios is up to date as well. I run on a laptop so I had to upgrade not only my Nvidia drivers, but my Intel graphics as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still have a little bit of lag in the game but no crashing or blue screens. But that\u0027s more due to the age of the laptop and not a driver issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T19:51:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh god... the Electricity issue... I have lost SOOOOOO many probes and droid controlled ships to this that I insist on at least one singular solar panel and probe brain on every stage. Adds to the weight a bit but it does make sure that don\u0027t lose control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I did manage to get one probe in a wide orbit that essentially stayed in shadow for about 30 orbits. Ship ran out of power mid course correction and it totally ruined my orbital insertion due to a random encounter with Ike of all things. Totally futzed up my orbit that it went totally weird and I had only about 4 minutes of power to figure out a course correction to stop slamming into either Ike, Duna or going off into interplanetary space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what happened?
