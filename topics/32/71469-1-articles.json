Apart from RemoteTech2 (because I\u0027m scared of the bugginess) and some Life Support mod (because that would just inconvenience me), I have pretty much every mod that people usually recommend. FAR, KW, EVE etc etc\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy issue is a kind of catch-22.. To go anywhere interesting, I need to do launch after launch and I find that tedious. I can dock and build incredible things in orbit, I just find it tedious to launch again and again. So why not just Hyperedit the assembled craft into orbit? Because then.. why go anywhere? Why do anything if I can just Hyperedit there instead (after jettisoning the various stages it \u003Cstrong\u003Ewould\u0027ve \u003C/strong\u003Etaken me to get there of course)? I play pretty much only in career (because I like Science) and I love the first few days of a new save - new toys to play with, new choices, everything) but once I\u0027ve got enough to get out of the Kerbin system and back (e.g docking ports and nuclear engines), it just becomes the whole \u0022launch, rdv, dock, repeat and then go somewhere\u0022 thing again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I could install Realism Overhaul or BTSM or something but I\u0027ll still run into the problem of once I unlock nuclear engines and docking ports, it\u0027s just launching for the sake of launching.

But then I run into the problem of decent plane parts. The stock plane parts are laughably under-developed and as for mods, I\u0027d love for someone to point me to a mod that has the range of B9, but isn\u0027t B9. It\u0027s like the go-to plane part mod but it\u0027s A, been broken for 2 versions now (yes I know there are fixes for it but...) and B, doesn\u0027t really look nice when use with other parts. I suppose part of my problem with B9 is thanks to KSP. First off, everything in B9 is Structural but also, the games part list I think should also be overhauled. Why would I want air intakes when I\u0027m building a rocket? Why would I want fairings when I\u0027m building a plane? Why would I want probe size parts when I\u0027m building a massive lifter stage?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are so many mods that should be made stock and I do recognise that Harv and the team only have so many hours in the day and I know I\u0027m just one slightly drunk guy posting on a forum at midnight, so I\u0027ll admit I\u0027m just rambling at this point and stop here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tortoise","CreatedById":68002,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-05T23:02:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGo into jool and back on ion engines\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-05T23:45:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2014 11:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Tortoise\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Caelib","CreatedById":59329,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T00:20:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStart a new career mode and explore the system without using fuel lines -- harder than it sounds.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T11:40:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETake a Whackjob style challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart with an orange tank.
