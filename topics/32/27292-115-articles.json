What can I say, I\u0027ve been away from KSP for about three months now (needed a break), and decided to get back into it with a full-on stock install. Trying the career mode out currently. I tend to treat this game much like I treat DayZ; it\u0027s fantastic, but don\u0027t overdo it or you end up bored and/or frustrated. Anyway, also forgot antennae on that ship, but made it back with a reasonable research total...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/keGwRrL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022keGwRrL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brapness","CreatedById":73986,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T11:19:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI built my first career mode mun rover...sort of\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oMEL3Zm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oMEL3Zm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T13:06:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo more missions down for the Constellation Program Challenge - pretty sure I screwed both of them up if you want to get technical about it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHelped some folks get into orbit who hadn\u0027t progressed very far on the tech tree.
