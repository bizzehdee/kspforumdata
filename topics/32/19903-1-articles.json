So in the case of the NERVA, its specific impulse being two times higher than the other engines at your disposal, the engine will need two times less fuel than the other engines to do the same momentum change. So with the NERVA you either need much less fuel to reach your destination, or you can go way further than with conventionnal engines for the same amount of fuel. Note that this is only true in vacuum, as its specific impulse in atmosphere is similar to the other engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, since it has a very low thrust, the burns will need quite some time to be completed, which isn\u0027t a problem when dealing with interplanetary distances.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-22T23:48:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELow thrust and long burn times can royally mess up well timed interplanetary travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the moment, im sticking with the \u0027real\u0027 LFE\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-23T00:00:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am loving it. with sutch high impulse in vaccum, it is perfect for interplanetary transfers! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cardgame","CreatedById":12317,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-23T00:06:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood luck getting to Jool without one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pawelk198604","CreatedById":35539,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-23T00:11:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReally this engine works i managed to crash land on Duna, with small help form MechJeb :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder when they add ION engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ziff","CreatedById":27566,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-23T00:24:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pawelk198604\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pawelk198604\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis engine have thrust only 60, what it\u0027s advantage over other engines?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce in orbit, thrust only determines how long you have to burn in order to make orbital maneuvers.
