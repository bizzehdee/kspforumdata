This means your final delta-v is very high, but you have to run the engine for a long time. For efficiency with the fuel, you should go for fewer (1-2) LV-Ns, which means you have to run the engine when you have reached orbital or near-orbital speeds because of the low acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA bad effect of the low thrust is you may lose on gains from the Oberth effect, since most of your burn is going to be \u0022out of\u0022 the planet\u0027s gravity well. To get a proper idea of the comparison between an LV-N and a (high-thrust) LV-30 or LV-45 or Aerospike, you probably need to do the mathematical calculations on a computer, and the results will vary depending on your destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good effect of low thrust is you do not need excessive strutting, which increases part count. High acceleration can cause a spacecraft to break apart. If you watch Scott Manley\u0027s videos, there is one where he uses a mainsail on an interplanetary injection burn, and the maximum safe thrust is about 1/3rd of the throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkeh","CreatedById":72122,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T17:04:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUntil you\u0027re in orbit you\u0027re pushing against gravity accelerating you downwards.

Despite having an 800 isp and 60 thrust, the weigh 2.25, as much as small diameter half fuel tank. In comparison, the LV-909 weighs .5 and has 50 thrust. I just performed a test with a small parachute on top of a small capsule on top of a small half fuel tank powered by an LV-909. After a vertical decoupler, the lower stage was a small diameter quarter tank on top of a full tank on top of an LVT-45. I launched completely vertically and made it to 1,275,000 meters. (The second stage ignited at 11k feet, almost in a vacuum, so the isp was already quite near optimal.) I performed the same test, except I swapped out the LV-909 for an atomic motor. It made it 525,000 meters.\u003Cp\u003EConclusion: Although the atomic motor is just over twice as efficient as the LV-909, it\u0027s thrust-weight ratio is worse due to its much larger mass. Therefore, it is actually more efficient to use an LV-909. If you have enough fuel, the atomic motor\u0027s efficiency may eventually outweigh its thrust disadvantage, but at that point, you\u0027d probably be better off using a more powerful LVT-45, so your burns don\u0027t take forever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I\u0027m insane, but this makes sense to me.
