It might be because I use a joystick (I bought it just for KSP). With the new SAS my ship bounces around a lot more and I have to give more jerky input on the joystick like I did when I was using the keyboard and \u0027feathering\u0027 the input. I like the joystick because it lets me give very small steady inputs, but the new SAS doesn\u0027t seem to like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*snip\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall excellent post and I agree with every point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use a joystick too, I think it\u0027s easiest to bind momentary SAS toggle (f) to the trigger-- hold it down to turn it off, change pitch, then release to reactivate.

It\u0027s boring, and feels arbitrary and forced, like someone is trying to come up with a Career mode but doesn\u0027t really know how to make it fun or how to get it to progress, so they dumped this scoring system on it. It\u0027s outstandingly average game design (meaning it\u0027s very disappointing, coming from Squad) and it, for me at least, adds absolutely nothing but limitations to an otherwise fun, quirky and deep game. In fact, it kills most of the fun, and frustrates me because instead of figuring out how to fly space missions I\u0027m trying to figure out what Squad think I should do to earn points. The only reason it\u0027s difficult to earn points, is because they deliberately left out the instructions on how to score points. I am not playing a space mission in a realistic universe with physics as the obstacles to overcome. Instead, I\u0027m being constantly reminded that I\u0027m playing a game and I need to figure out an opaque game mechanic before I can progress to more of the same.
