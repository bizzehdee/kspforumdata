(Without MechJeb, or any other docking mods)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the 90 hours that I\u0027ve played this game I\u0027ve learned a lot, I\u0027ve been to multiple planets and moons, and now I\u0027m docking like a pro, and coming up with new ways to keep this exciting. My next goal is to establish a Mun base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway I just wanted to say I really do love this game, and it was well worth the $25. I can\u0027t wait to see more from the Squad team, as well as the people who continue to add great Mods to this game!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T01:17:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI cannot agree more. I think it was Scott Manley who said that the game could be released as is, with only a few minor polishes and it would feel like a complete game. The fact that Squad keeps developing it is awesome, I can\u0027t wait to see what they come up with!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Westo454","CreatedById":12702,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T01:22:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis game is SOOOO worth every penny paid for it.
