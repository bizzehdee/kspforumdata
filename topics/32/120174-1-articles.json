As they sit in their pods for days/months/years, they watch instructional videos over and over that teach them to perform the simple, menial tasks required of them (fix flat tires, reload Goo cannisters, etc.). Physical restraints are used to ensure they watch the videos and various chemicals are pumped into them to enhance their retention of the material.
