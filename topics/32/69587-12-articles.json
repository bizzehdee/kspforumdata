If you switch into debris rolling on the ground, that\u0027s it. You\u0027re stuck and helpless to control the game. I\u0027ve had to revert otherwise successful missions before because of this annoying misfeature of the UI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another note, I get frustrated when I want to slide a maneuver node along the orbit path (changing just the ETA time, not the 3 components of the burn), and when I drag it with the mouse, the hotspot of the click is so fuzzy and vague that I\u0027ve ended up dragging one of the 3 burn components instead of moving the position of the node. The reason this is annoying is that there\u0027s no way to Control-Z the action and revert the burn vector back to what it was other than just having memorized what it was before and fiddling with it again manually to put it back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, there is a solution, Alt-F12, whack a kerbal, just shoot the debris untill it blows up and be done with it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
