As such, it\u0027s obviously not possible that squad will ever incorporate such things into pilot experience.\n\nI was wondering if anyone thought of writing a mod to integrate it?\n\nFor instance: \n\nLevel 0 pilots have SAS stability\n\nLevel 1 can point at all 6 primary directions\n\nLevel 2 can point at AND execute maneuver nodes (using mechjeb)\n\nLevel 3 can execute ascents and orbital insertion (using MechJeb)\n\nLevel 4 can execute transfers (using MechJeb)\n\nLevel 5 can execute targeted landings and docking (using MechJeb)\n\nOr something of the sort?\n\nFurthermore, perhaps engineers, rather than gaining piloting skills, can gain access to information from MechJeb and/or use of Kerbal Attachment System (KAS), for instance:\n\nLevel 0 engineers can fix broken parts\n\nLevel 1 can use Kerbal Attachment System\n\nLevel 2 has access to transfer windows (using MechJeb) \n\nLevel 3 can see trajectory in flight (to make manual targeted landings easier)\n\nLevel 4 (need ideas?)\n\nLevel 5 (need ideas?)\n\nWhat do you guys think? Other ideas to make this mod better?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T16:24:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 04:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by arkie87**"},{"CreatedByName":"Trentendegreth","CreatedById":86953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T17:04:03Z","Content":"go for it id use it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"WhirlwindMonk","CreatedById":142384,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T18:04:10Z","Content":"I like the idea.

I dont use it in career mode either. But after a while (leveling up kerbals, gaining money, science and rep, and having loads of designs and missions), it would be nice to take a step back and start the game feeling more of a Kerbal Space PROGRAM rather than Kerbal Space Piloting Simulator. Thus, sitting back and launching missions, without having to micromanage things you\u0027ve already done 100 times...\n\nThough, one change i would like to see is rather than gaining experience from different flights (flyby of planet, orbit planet, landing on planet and planting flag on planet), it would make more sense, especially given my recommendation for autopilot, to give each specialist type experience for doing things related to their specialty. For instance, scientists gain experience from doing science (As well as going on trips and flying to different planets, moons etc). In particular, it makes sense to give experience for performing certain maneuvers such as orbital insertion, transfer, rendezvous, docking, landing etc.. to pilots, and only allow unlocking of MechJeb functionality once those actions have already been performed by THAT pilot.\n\nWhile i\u0027m on the subject, Kerbals should gain experience and level up instantly upon doing the activity, and not only upon being recovered on Kerbin..."}]}
