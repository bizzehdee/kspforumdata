HOWEVER, these are the same biomes as in level 1, so unless you\u0027ve unlocked new experiments since then, you can\u0027t get any more science from the buildings if you already did them in level 1.\n\nAt Level 3, you get a few more:\n\n- 1 for each main building:  9 (again, same biomes as in level 1 and level 2)\n- 1 for each tracking station antenna:  3\n- 1 for the flagpole at the astronaut complex (but not the launchpad):  1\n- 1 each for the tanks beside the runway near the SPH:  2\n- 1 for the round tank between the VAB and SPH:  1\n- 1 for the Mk 1 pod memorial:  1\n- There might be a couple others but not many.  The runway, launchpad, admin, mission control, and R\u0026D don\u0027t grow extra biomes IIRC, so call level 3 a total of 17\n\nAs [@wumpus](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/133850-wumpus/) says, doing all the KSC biomes at level 3 is not worth the time and trouble because by then, the amount of science you get for this is utterly insignificant compared to the cost of the remaining tech tree nodes.  The only time KSC biomes provide significant science compared to the current cost of tech tree nodes is very early in the game at level 1.  By the time you\u0027ve upgraded everything to level 2 (and even assuming you HAVEN\u0027T already done the buildings in level 1), doing the KSC biomes will get you maybe 1 node.\n\nSo why does level 3 have all these biomes that are effectively useless and worthless?  It\u0027s a relic of the KSP development process.  The KSC biomes were created prior to when upgrading buildings became a feature.  Back then, level 3 was all there was, so all those biomes were there at the start of a new career game.  And the small, \u0022starter\u0022 airplane wheels and jet engine didn\u0027t exist yet, either, so you couldn\u0027t build a rover until about mid-way into the tech tree.  Thus, you pretty much had to walk all around KSC doing EVA reports and surface samples.  Still, if you were willing to put in that time and effort, you could get a nice science boost to kickstart your new career.  It was sort of a sop for peole playing on hard mode.\n\nThen building upgrades came along and half the KSC biomes became unavailable until late in the game when they\u0027re meaningless.  But OTOH, we got the ability to make simple rovers much earlier in the game, so can now get several times the science per KSC biome than on foot, meaning we can now get more science from KSC when it still means something.  Plus we now have many more altitude/speed/distance milestones short of space than before,  So the need to have lots of KSC biomes isappeared, which is probably why more haven\u0027t ever been added to level 2.\n\nAnyway, enough history.  Messing with KSC biomes is only really worthwhile when your tech tree nodes cost no more than 150 points.  Then you can get several nodes in 1 go with a KSC science rover.  But if your remaining nodes cost 300, a trip around KSC will get you 1 at most, mabye just a fration of 1.  Might be useful if you really need to get 1 more node before you next mission, but otherwise no.  And if your nodes cost 550 or more, don\u0027t bother."},{"CreatedByName":"Terwin","CreatedById":139655,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T18:04:25Z","Content":"I would disagree that roving around the KSC at level 3 is not useful, you just need the correct scientific equipment.\n\nIn particular a class A asteroid can be carried to each building and area, gathering 60 science for each asteroid report, giving over 1800 science plus any collected by other instruments.\n\nAs an added bonus, I believe you can do this with every asteroid you successfully land and carry around KSC, not just the first one.\n\nI would not consider 1800\u002B science to be trivial, even after upgrading all buildings to level 3."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T20:06:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Terwin said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I would disagree that roving around the KSC at level 3 is not useful, you just need the correct scientific equipment.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E In particular a class A asteroid ........\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I would not consider 1800\u002B science to be trivial, even after upgrading all buildings to level 3.\n\u003E \n\nLOL!!!
