because by then, the amount of science you get for this is utterly insignificant compared to the cost of the remaining tech tree nodes.\u00A0 The only time KSC biomes provide significant science compared to the current cost of tech tree nodes is very early in the game at level 1.\u00A0 By the time you\u0027ve upgraded everything to level 2 (and even assuming you HAVEN\u0027T already done the buildings in level 1), doing the KSC biomes will get you maybe 1 node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo why does level 3 have all these biomes that are effectively useless and worthless?\u00A0 It\u0027s a relic of the KSP development process.\u00A0 The KSC biomes were created prior to when upgrading buildings became a feature.\u00A0 Back then, level 3 was all there was, so all those biomes were there at the start of a new career game.\u00A0 And the small, \u0022starter\u0022 airplane wheels and jet engine didn\u0027t exist yet, either, so you couldn\u0027t build a rover until about mid-way into the tech tree.\u00A0 Thus, you pretty much had to walk all around KSC doing EVA reports and surface samples.\u00A0 Still, if you were willing to put in that time and effort, you could get a nice science boost to kickstart your new career.\u00A0 It was sort of a sop for peole playing on hard mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen building upgrades came along and half the KSC biomes became unavailable until late in the game when they\u0027re meaningless.\u00A0 But OTOH, we got the ability to make simple rovers much earlier in the game, so can now\u00A0get several times the science per KSC biome than on foot, meaning\u00A0we can now get more science from KSC when it still means something.\u00A0 Plus we now have many more altitude/speed/distance milestones short of space than before,\u00A0 So\u00A0the need to have lots of KSC biomes isappeared, which is probably why more haven\u0027t ever been added to level 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, enough history.\u00A0 Messing with KSC biomes is only really worthwhile when your tech tree nodes cost no more than 150 points.\u00A0 Then you can get several nodes in 1 go with a KSC science rover.\u00A0 But if your remaining nodes cost 300, a trip around KSC will get you 1 at most, mabye just a fration of 1.\u00A0 Might be useful if you really need to get 1 more node before you next mission, but otherwise no.\u00A0 And if your nodes cost 550 or more, don\u0027t bother.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Terwin","CreatedById":139655,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T18:04:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would disagree that roving around the KSC at level 3
