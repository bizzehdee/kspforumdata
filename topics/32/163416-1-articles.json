Seemed like all the contracts that were coming up weren\u0027t cost-effective to even bother with, and I was at the point where I was about to start in-depth exploration of the Mun and Minmus. I used leadership initiative to increase the value of exploration. With a reusable lander and space station in orbit of Minmus, all you need is periodic resupply/crew rotations and to bring the science home. At this point I didn\u0027t have mining tech, but Minmal gravity is low enough that not much fuel is needed. If a contract asks to deploy a small probe around Minmus, you can piggyback it on a supply ship rather than launching a dedicated mission. The payout is less because of the strategy but it\u0027s cheaper to send as you\u0027re going there anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis should give enough of a science boost to gain the tech you need to reach Duna without having to grind away at tourist contracts and convert the funds into science via outsourced R\u0026amp;D.
