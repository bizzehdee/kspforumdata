I dubbed them ISM-1 and ISM-2 respectively (Interplanetary Suicide Mission, because the Eve mission was most certainly one-way and I wasn\u0027t feeling too sure about the Duna one). Gregmund Kerman bravely volunteered to go to Eve knowing full well that he wouldn\u0027t make it back and the chances of rescue were minimal. This was my first manned ship to use my newly acquired nuclear engines and ion propulsion. This mission actually went TOO well at one point, I fiddled around with maneuver nodes until it was pretty darn close and I had PLANNED to orbit a few times and take a look at what was down there then pick a general area to land. What actually happened is I accidentally set my trajectory for a high speed Eve intercept and by the time I realized it my engine wasn\u0027t powerful enough to correct it in time. Not to be deterred, I burned off as much speed as I could and separated my command module with science equipment while entering the atmosphere. The landing went mostly smooth except that on impact 2 of my 4 solar arrays were knocked off because I landed on a small hill and they were too close to the bottom of the craft which didn\u0027t have landing legs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2013-12-2822-31-54-78.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2013-12-2822-31-54-78.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(insert extremely zoomed out screenshot here)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2013-12-2822-36-36-13.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2013-12-2822-36-36-13.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Duna mission however was more thought out and for the most part it went exactly according to plan. I had a young and dumb recruit lined up to pilot this mission who thought he could make it there and back successfully even though we told him it\u0027d be a real stretch. Plot twist happens when Bill decides to sneak into the lander when no one was looking and kick the newbie out, and no one noticed until the ship was halfway to Duna. The bad part came when I was passing too close and fast (I think?) to Duna and instead of doing a smooth transition to orbit I was forced to burn up the remaining fuel just to keep from going on an escape path. Then I was in an extremely elliptical orbit and I switched on the ion drive until it was reasonable to aerobrake. I had planned for the thin atmosphere by packing 3 Rockomax 24-77s to thrust just before touchdown, but I wasn\u0027t sure exactly what I was dealing with so the fuel and engine size was an educated guess. It was quite a nailbiting experience watching the planet flying towards me and praying the altimeter was wrong while waiting on my chute to deploy. When it did I burned retro until I was coming straight down at about 13-15m/s and then was able to set the lander down gently at about 3m/s with the help of the engines (on my third try, mind you. There were a couple minor disasters that were avoided with a quickload). There is a slight possibility that this ship could return home on ion power after (hopefully) getting into a low orbit with the engines I included, but I\u0027m not brave enough to try it yet. A rescue mission is certainly feasible though with the tech I have now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2013-12-2823-39-59-19.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2013-12-2823-39-59-19.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2013-12-2902-11-07-77.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2013-12-2902-11-07-77.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetween those two missions\u0027 transmitted data I was able to get new tech I needed.
