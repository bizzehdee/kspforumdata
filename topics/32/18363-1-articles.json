I\u0027m here to voice a concern for the future as well as maybe find some answers that may or may have not been dealt with here before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I was in the process of concentrating a few landers on one small area on the mun by trying to simulate some type of munar base, each following landing became progressively choppier , until I got to my 6th lander which gave me about 1 frames per second hence was impossible to complete, no matter how low I set my graphics quality settings. My system is a quad 3.2 ghz cpu with a 9800GTX video card and 8gigs of ram so it\u0027s not a push over by any means.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m guessing, the presence of all the already stationed landings in that location made processing the environment virtually impossible. These landers are not extravagant in design by all means... they actually composed of a capsule, 4 tanks and landing engines, an advanced sas, 4 maneuvering rsc, an 4 landing feet. (?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat really gets me is that even when all the other landers are not in my field of view, it seems that they are still being rendered since no matter where I turned the camera it had no effect in the choppiness. Now I know I have seen massively more complicated scenes on other video games that can handle alot more, and I also understand that this is basically not a finished game yet, but I\u0027m thinking that the rendering engine is not something that is easily developed, nor easily edited. SO I\u0027m willing to guess that the game\u0027s current development point should really not be taken under consideration when talking about the capabilities of the rendering engine that is implemented here. Or am I wrong? is this an issue that is known and will be addressed in the future?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow will this game cope with it\u0027s expansion, of capabilities? How can we even dream about creating munar bases without first taking a serious look at the rendering limitations of this game? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo flames please, this is not a troll, I really enjoy this game, but I have genuine concern that this will greatly limit the possibilities of enjoying a richer kerbiverse.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-01T13:09:21Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2012 01:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by tsakali\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-01T13:14:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP is alpha software with a lot of room for optimization before anyone can claim that the graphics engine is not up to the task.
