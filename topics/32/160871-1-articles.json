I play Career mode and I\u0027m\u00A0done with Mun and Minmus. I play with Remote Tech, so I spent some more time around Kerbin and now that I have Duna Contract, the transfer window is very far. I accepted the contract and skipped some time, no new contract appeared. The closest transfer window is to Dres. What do you do in these situations? f you were me, would you just use your available funds and send mission to Dres to get science, or would you warp time and go by contracts, Duna first?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think the last time I played KSP with mods, I ended at the same spot.
