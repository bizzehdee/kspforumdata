I\u0027d like to add expanding the current tree, not with more parts but with more logically divided nodes, would be nice. Even just by 10% would be good, eg. making science experiments occupy their own node and pathway (so, a node only contains a thermometer, which unlocks the next one which only contains the barometer, etc.) could work out as a good balance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have played with lower science returns, 40% and 80% funds, and found the early challenges to be fun. I actually used the No More Science Grind mod however because repeating some experiments for nickels and dimes worth of science to me is where the grind is at.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-20T17:20:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222638472\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022142115\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221466432157\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022125662\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snark\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Snark said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNope.\u00A0 OPM leaves the stock solar system completely untouched (other than moving Eeloo into orbit around Sarnus); it just adds additional planets to the outer fringes of the system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot true, OPM lowers the science multipliers of the stock bodies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/93999-112-outer-planets-mod-20-complete-overhaul-better-terrain-nicer-terrain-textures-improved-scatter-etc-21-may/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb style=\u0022font-weight:normal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14.666666666666666px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\u0022\u003EOPM adds a lot of new bodies, which means that the amount of science that can be gathered has increased by a lot too.
