Back in the day, there certainly was something to be said about the quality of the graphics in a game, since general capabilities of the hardware were limited. Compare the average 1983 c64 game (say \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4centipede\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4) with the average one in 1988 (say \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4Katakis\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4).

Today, it\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s more like trying to rate art: Do the gfx support the atmosphere of the game? Is the colorscheme eye-pleasing? I mean, how do you rate a game\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s gfx, that is intentionally trying to look 8-bit-ish? Poor, because it doesnt utilize modern hardware at all, or good, because its original and supports the feel of the game very well? Does the average FPS-game really deserve a better score than pretty much any other game from most other genres, only because now you can look 25m further, when compared to the last iteration of the same game? Is rating the graphics of a game more like judging an engineer\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s or an artist\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s work?
