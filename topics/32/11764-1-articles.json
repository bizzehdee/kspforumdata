It\\\u0027s a real balance between \u0027reality\u0027 and a \u0027fun game.\u0027\n\nAt the speeds a craft enters the atmosphere you get extremely high mach number gas flows. This results in not-so-simple calculations to do. You would say, yes drag or air-friction would create so much heat that needs to be dissipated by radiation or convection behind some mach cone at some distant from the capsule. This already requires gas compressibility calculations not to mention characterizing the planetary atmosphere beyond what I believe they have implemented. \n\nBut it gets worse, because the temperatures are so high, rare species of molecules start to form and reduce the amount of heating actually predicted. \n\nGive them time - it seems like they\\\u0027ll make an approximation."}]}
