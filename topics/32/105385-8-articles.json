When you have a pilot and are using the extra nav modes, (points at waypoint, point normal etc) these only work when your relative velocity is over 1.0 m/s. I nearly always dock by having one craft facing normal and one facing anti normal (so they don\u0027t change as you orbit) but once my speed is below 1.0 relative to the target I can only choose normal sas.

So if you have a plane flying a constant speed (in m/s, not mach) and altitude going north/south, the planes mach number will actually be going up as the air gets colder further from the equator. By adjusting speed to keep a constant mach you can actually geta quite noticeable fuel saving.\n\n-Control surfaces make more drag the more they are deflected. So if SAS needs a big input to keep your plane steady, it\u0027s making more drag. But by pumping fuel forward and back to shift the CoM you can reduce the control surface input needed to stay steady and get a small but noticeable drag reduction and fuel saving.\n\n-Normally physicless/negligibly draggy surface attached mod parts, like the BDArmory autopilots and Flag Decals flags, now create drag, and quite a bit of it, enough to push a craft normally supersonic at sea level down to subsonic."},{"CreatedByName":"Iceblade02","CreatedById":145414,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T07:25:43Z","Content":"The atmosphere is much thicker in 1.0.2 making fairings a must and winglets on upper stages necessary!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nThe thicker atmosphere from 1.0.2 has made finns necessary on all atmospheric stages (from my observations).
