Now, this was the evening after I had finished my school, including dreaded 1980s A Beka Algebra II book with lessons such as... \u0022Precision in Measurement\u0022, which at first glance looks like the unspoken rules of social normalities in Math, equivalent to, for example, the unspoken social rule of when to use \u0022lol\u0022 in any common conversation, digital or not. The kind of thing that has a ridiculous amount of importance in common Math, but you just have to learn by reading the crappiest explanation ever and stumbling through how to use it like any other social rule. So, just a quick perspective on Math from me. So, we go to the giant whiteboard in our hallway for this kind of thing, and start factoring polynomials... \u0022just for fun\u0022. Another quick note, both my brother and dad are math majors and think it\u0027s just the coolest thing ever. Don\u0027t get me wrong, it\u0027s cool to me too... in KSP. \n\nSo then, he gets an idea. He looks up physics and math curriculum and came up with just playing with different values of position, speed, acceleration, time, etc. and we graph different speeds and acceleration, on a graph of X Time, and Y Position. Then, we played around with 3 cars: Car A is going slow and speeds up. Car B is going a constant speed the whole time. Car C starts fast and slows down. We graph those, and they all meet at a certain position, and a certain time, and just kinda play around with different aspects of the graph, blah blah blah. Fun stuff.\n\nThen, I thought, since my dad is my \u0022Math tutor\u0022(he does a better job than my brother, so most of the time I need him) and works on and off doing contract IT work, sometime\u0027s he\u0027s here to help, sometimes not. So I figured, when he\u0027s not here, I could do some more \u0022fun math\u0022. So, I had an idea to play around with graphing values of Thrust to Weight, or TWR to time, as your TWR gets better as time passes from dropping stages or whatever. So, I\u0027m not an expert at graphing these things, so without telling me everything about how it works, how could I do that? again, I assume I could mess around with Y TWR X Time, but how could I do Thrust and Weight? I assume I should get something like Kerbal Engineer to view that as my rocket is in flight. Anyways, what would be some fun ways to mess around with graphing that kind of thing?\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n-Slab"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T15:08:35Z","Content":"Get [Telemachus](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24594-0-23-Telemachus-%E2%80%93-Telemetry-and-Flight-Control-in-the-Web-Browser-%282014-1-11%29) to export data directly from KSP.

That means that the faster the exhaust shoots out, the more efficient the rocket is.\n\nF\\_thr = v\\_exh x dm/dt\n\nDivide both sides by the fuel consumption rate (dm/dt) and we get\n\nv\\_exh = (F\\_thr) / (dm/dt)\n\nIn other words, v\\_exh is the *ratio* of thrust force to fuel consumption rate--that is, newtons of thrust per kg/s of fuel consumption.\n\nIn any sane world where all engineers use the metric system, we would call that ratio specific impulse (I\\_sp). However, in our world, some engineers insist on using other units of measurement for distance, meaning that engineers in different countries would get different values for v\\_exh. To avoid confusion, it is traditional (on Earth and, apparently, on Kerbin) to divide v\\_exh by Earth\u0027s gravity (about 9.8 m/s^2 or 32 ft/s^2) to get units of seconds; that way it doesn\u0027t matter what measuring system you use as long as everyone is measuring time in seconds.\n\nSo that\u0027s I\\_sp: the exhaust velocity (or ratio of thrust to fuel consumption rate) divided by gravity.\n\nThat means if you want the actual ratio of thrust to fuel consumption rate, look up the engine\u0027s I\\_sp and multiply by about 9.8.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nSome other fun math stuff to try out:\n\nCheck the current mass of your craft. Check the thrust provided by its engines. Use these to calculate the acceleration it\u0027s capable of, and then read the display on the acclerometer (you did include an accelerometer on your craft, right?) to see if your calculations are correct.\n\nRead up on the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation if you haven\u0027t already. If you\u0027ve taken calculus, see if you can use the idea of specific impulse (and perhaps conservation of momentum) to figure out *why* it works. Whether you\u0027ve taken calculus or not, you should be able to use the equation ot set up a spreadsheet where you can type in your craft\u0027s mass, how much fuel it\u0027s carrying, and the I\\_sp of its engines, and instantly get feedback about how much \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC v it\u0027s capable of.\n\nUse the formulas for force of gravity (at a long distance, not just F=mg) and centripetal force to figure out how high and how fast you\u0027ll have to be for a perfect kerbosynchronous orbit--that is, a satellite that\u0027s always directly above the space center (or any other fixed point on the equator).\n\nTry a suicide burn! Suppose you have a rocket that starts at rest (relative to the planet surface) some very large height above the surface of a planet. The most efficient (and most terrifying) way to land is to freefall (AAAAAAAA! says mission control) until the (very precisely calculated) last possible moment, then set engines to full throttle and slow down just in time so you come to a complete stop at ground level. Try to construct a formula that can determine (given mass and radius of the planet, initial height, mass of the lander, and engine thrust) *exactly* when you should \u0022hit the brakes\u0022 and transition from freefall to full throttle, then test your formula experimentally! (Suggest trying this with an uncrewed probe; your first attempt will almost certainly crash catastrophically--and then you get to try to figure out why!)"},{"CreatedByName":"SlabGizor117","CreatedById":135987,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T14:18:21Z","Content":"Lol, to be honest, I have no idea what most of that meant, I\u0027m very early in Algebra II also, but calculating a suicide burn looks like fun. Sorry if I\u0027m not explaining what I need very well, but I just thought it\u0027d be fun to play around with graphing the curve of thrust vs. mass as you burn fuel(or maybe velocity vs. mass would be better) or whatever else you could graph, I\u0027m not sure. What I mean is, nothing involved, just something to play around with.\n\nThanks for the help though!\n\n-Slab"},{"CreatedByName":"monophonic","CreatedById":76902,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T15:16:54Z","Content":"1.
