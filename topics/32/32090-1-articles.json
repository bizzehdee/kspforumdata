What it is is my friend designed a simple mod where there are enemy countries on kerbin and they have (all stock) weapons. My nephew and my job is to design (once again all stock) weapons to kill the (computer controlled) evil kerbals and their (all stock) weapons. Send me. Craft files of your (all stock) weapons, be it spaceplane fighters, spaceplane bombers, space station parts, or just concepts.
