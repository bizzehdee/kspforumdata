Weight is in kN, mass is in metric tons (where one ton equals 1000 kg). All you need to do is have your thrust be higher than your weight; both will be in the same units, as long as you know the local gravity. The physics in this game is the same as in real life; it\u0027s just the scale that\u0027s different, with the planets and sun having radii about 1/10th that of the real bodies, but with densities about 10 times higher to give comparable surface gravities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022purpletarget\u0022 data-cite=\u0022purpletarget\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E(Which itself is variable, as it falls off exponentially as you climb away from the surface)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorrect, although realistically you\u0027d have to be really high up before it becomes a noticeable difference. On Earth, for instance, the radius of the planet is 6371km, so the gravitational acceleration 200km up is only about 6% lower than it is at the surface; your TWR in low orbit will be almost the same as it would be at sea level. Kerbin\u0027s a much smaller planet (only 600km in radius), so it drops off quite a bit faster, but it still means that you have to basically get out of the atmosphere before TWR starts rising noticeably from this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you really care about TWR, I recommend downloading the Flight Engineer mod. It tells you your maximum TWR, your TWR at the current throttle level, and what your TWR would be on the planet\u0027s surface.
