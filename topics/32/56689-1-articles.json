Everything seemed great at first, and then I noticed something--parts that used to be robust and wouldn\u0027t fall apart on ascent, were now tearing itself out of their attach points, thereby destroying the stack. I also noticed this with some of my winged SSTO designs, esp. wing roots (the part where a wing meets the fuselage or fuel tanks). I never experienced that before with any of my aerospace planes. So anyone experience or notice this issue with robustness as well?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markarian421","CreatedById":57423,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T15:58:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI ran into that problem in 0.22 -- I could not put enough struts on some of my rockets to keep them from falling apart on the pad or on ascent.
