I decide to send Bob both to get him some xp and to try to maximize the science. Flight went fine, landing was a little bumpy but not bad. Bob goes EVA to get the surface sample and collect the data from the instruments outside the ship because they\u0027re not going to survive reentry.\n\nwhile reaching for the materials bay to collect data he slips and somehow manages to get himself jammed in the radial decoupler.\n\nTHIS is when he chooses to go ragdoll and stop responding completely. Here he sits with less than six hours of life support left in his suit.\n\nIf I could afford to send another mission I\u0027d be sorely tempted to just fast forward time until his air runs out. Lucky for him I\u0027ll just revert to before the flight and try again.\n\n![OUFvxZf.png](http://i.imgur.com/OUFvxZf.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T02:30:38Z","Content":"Well done, Bob...."},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T02:50:13Z","Content":"I\u0027ve had goofy things like that happen. I just edited the save file and rounded off his latitude to the nearest degree.
