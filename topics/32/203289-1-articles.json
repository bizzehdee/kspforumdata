shot.\u00A0 Firework (besides being far more compact and not taking up the entire length of a starfighter), is a SINGLE part with 8 or 32 shots.\u00A0 Yes, it isnt as lethal as properly made old fashioned weapons (when not using KAL cheats), but its very low performance (provided you dont spam too many fireworks until the ones already out there explode/despawn), much smaller (these alone revolutionized all my starfighters overnight), easier to add to just about anything without wrecking asthetics (its not easy to hide a massive torpedo completely inside a ship or build a launch tube for it, and many designs with them slapped on the hull without much care dont quite look right), and they have actual customizeable fx like bullet trails, explosions (you can make some nice cinematic flak effect with that alone), ect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot perfect by any means at all, but ill take it as an option alongside old weapons (which my biggest pet peve about was the sheer lack of ammo capacity for a given number of parts.\u00A0 That and ive really not been a fan of BDA in the last few years, so it makes it possible to have easy to make stock combat vehicles/ships without installing BDArmory.\u00A0 Again, nothing against the mod (i even helped develop it a tad back in teh day Baha was still running the mod), but ive just not been a fan of the recent changes such as going from thermal to HP damage (this made the mod way more convoluted, complex, and slowish, and it did not imo improve enjoyment realistic or not), the uttery broken damage models as of late (ever since they added armor penetration its been really hit or miss with damage and how it behaves), and frankly, the only worthwhile addition the new mod has is the AI autopilot stuff (that is very nice, the rest of it id go back to Baha\u0027s original mod if it still worked like at all in teh new versions).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, good exaple is this, before and after on my TIE replicaish thing.\u00A0 Goes from looking just stupid (with
