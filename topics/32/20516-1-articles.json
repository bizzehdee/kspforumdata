With a speed of around 7560 m/s, I had absolutely no chance to perform a nice and stable orbit around the moon and was just 15 minutes away from being shot out of the moon\u0027s SOI. Violent atmospheric breaking was the solution and I adjusted periapsis to around 9 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i48.tinypic.com/ng7yw0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ng7yw0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeed increased to 7750 m/s ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i50.tinypic.com/etzkw8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022etzkw8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make a long story short; the brave kerbonaut survived the extremely rough descent but now floats in a massive ocean with land at least 60 km away, and not even a stunning view on Jool ... !

Then I raised my Pe to over 50 km(height of Laythe\u0027s atmo), and picked landing spot.
