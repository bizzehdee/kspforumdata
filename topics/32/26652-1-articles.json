I mean no-one in their right mind works on a project without having at least a grande programme with deadlines and expected completion date established. I bought the alpha version with the expectation that at some point it will be finished, like many other I presume. It would be nice to know when I can expect to be playing the career at least, and the final iteration of the game. I think I have a right to know at least what the overall plan of attack is?? Dont you Squad?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what is the established schedule for the games development, presuming you do have one other than the list of features to be incorporated? What \u003Cstrong\u003EIS\u003C/strong\u003E the outline plan and plan for the final release? 2014 some time? Earlier?

Simply put, the team is three(four?) people. They have a list of features they want to implement.

Squad will get there when they get there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the same note, what use is a date to you anyway? It isn\u0027t actionable information, no plans can be made around it. Even if they did release dates, they would get changed, rendering the announcement useless, obviously. Giving release dates to gamers is just one more thing the company gets yelled at for.

Maybe Pong. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou receive no \u0022rights\u0022 at time of purchase other than the ability to use the game in its current form.

Of course there is a third option of creating art for arts sake and not getting paid for it and dying of starvation (like some famous artists have done in the past to great acclaim once they were dead). Although I consider this game is a piece of art it is being created for sale as a commercial product. I am sure they cant afford to work on it for the rest of their lives (but I could be wrong). So if you are doing something for sale then that dictates that you need the money for something, and if you need the money for something, that dictates you have a deadline. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso selling an alpha version is selling an incomplete product. And once you sell an incomplete product to someone you are saying to them \u0027I will finish it in a reasonable timeframe\u0027. I am just asking what that timeframe is (roughly) and what the plan is to get there. Not unreasonable questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut its not like I will die or anything if I dont get told. I am happy playing the game, and happy with the value for money so far. I trust Squad are going to continue to develop the game and finish it eventually. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt just would be interesting to know these things. So for example I know whether to put the game down and stop playing it for a few months once I have visited a few planets to wait for an upcoming patch, or whether I should hold off doing something like building a massive spacestation because that feature is going to be patched soon into something a lot more almighty. A bit like the flags for example - I mean who is now going to go back around all the planets and do exactly what they have already done to put a load of flags around? Is there any point visiting Duna if I know by waiting a little bit I can plant a flag? That kind of thing. It\u0027s a problem I find with constant updates to games, you keep having to redo stuff you\u0027ve already done. It would be nice to get an idea what parts to play in the game and what not to bother with for the moment. Or maybe I am just thinking too deeply about it?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-13T19:50:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2013 07:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by nats\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Qumefox","CreatedById":43197,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T19:43:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Joe_Bender\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Joe_Bender\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn other words, what is the End Game?\u003Cp\u003EThat is something I would like to know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this intended to be a realistic space sim with little green men or just a \u0027feel good\u0027 game with a little math skillz thrown in?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe devs have stated repeatedly that it\u0027s the latter..

Most other games you don\u0027t really see anything at all out of until the game hits beta, and thus, is mostly done except for bugfixes... So most people have no clue how long it takes to build a game.. They don\u0027t get much information about the process except the very tail end of it that they can see. Squad has gone the opposite route and has had the community involved from the beginning.. and since most people really have no clue how long it takes to develop a game, they get impatient thinking it should be done in a few months.. because that\u0027s what they\u0027ve seen before with beta\u0027s etc.. and that\u0027s just not how it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd personally, even if they stopped development now, I can honestly say i\u0027ve gotten my $18 (what it was when I got it) out of the game several times over. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the only answer you\u0027ll get in regards to when it\u0027d done, is that it\u0027ll be done when it\u0027s done. In the past we\u0027ve gotten large updates every 2-3 months.. Squad has said they plan to shift to smaller, more frequent updates since they switched to GIT. Squad learned long ago giving people hard dates only causes problems. Just look how the expansion thing blew up over harvester thinking out loud about something far in the future during a livestream. This is pretty much what would happen every time Squad missed a deadline.. With the only other alternative being to release buggy/unfinished updates.. Neither of which scenarios end very well... Them not releasing hard dates is much easier on everyone than the alternatives. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP will be done when it\u0027s done.

So; all they are selling on the moment is a alpha version. That\u0027s the game you bought. If for what reason they ever decide to pull the plug.. To bad, but nothing that we could do about it. We did bought a alpha with the plan to become a full version someday. And that would be your answer. The \u0022big\u0022 plan right now is to get it done someday. You followed the Streams a little bit before the forum darkness? They mentioned so many times before they sometimes don\u0027t even have a clue. I know they have the plans, the features, I also know they think about a year, year and a half right now. But even that can change down the road. Maybe six months from now they thought about some really new cool stuff that takes it up to two years. Stop worrying over a full-version and stuff like that. Just get exited about the updates their working on.
