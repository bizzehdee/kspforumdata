Stations, Probes, Landings, Rovers, Docking, Rendezvous\u0027. I can perform all of this within Kerbin\u0027s SOI without a fuss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat isn\u0027t to say I haven\u0027t tried. I have launched and landed plenty of probes and failed numerous manned times. Two days ago was my last failed attempt. As my ship dropped into Duna\u0027s atmosphere, the capsule was ripped from the rest of the ship. Needless to say it was a failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo today I started again, carefully crafted the ship to have enough TWR, Delta-V, and parachutes for the landing. I breached Duna\u0027s atmosphere and skimmed over the surface. This gave me an orbit but my injection stage from Kerbin had some fuel, so I burned it and went for my landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETouched down with 5 big parachutes fully deployed and at the last second fired my rockets to kill the last bit of speed. Simply looked astounding. Had 3050 D-V remaining. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the return home, seeing Kerbin in all her glory made my heart skip a beat. The capsule and landing module streaked across the atmosphere. Watching those chutes deploy and the legs go down was exhilarating. 430 m/s Delta V leftover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have finally done an interplanetary mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if everyone has heard enough of these. but dammit after 250 hours... I feel like I have opened up a whole new game. Hell, after 250 hours I still feel like I\u0027m just scratching the surface and keep coming back for more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Merinsan","CreatedById":57629,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-18T23:22:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell done!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETook me a few tries to get the Duna landing right too.
