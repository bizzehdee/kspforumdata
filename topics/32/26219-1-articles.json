All they do is make it harder to turn the ship (intentionally or otherwise) while it is on.

What they will do is use the other control methods available to it (capsule rotational power, RCS, vectorable engines, and aerodynamic control surfaces) to turn the ship back in the direction that it was pointed when SAS was turned on (SAS and ASAS are both turned on with the same key, and it\u0027s called SAS regardless of whether there is any SAS on the ship).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EASAS loves to overcorrect if you\u0027re using RCS.
