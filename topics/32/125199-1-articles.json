I\u0027m getting used to the way 1.0.4 ran, though. I am perfectly okay with change (in fact, I\u0027m not sure if it could even be better since I\u0027m not nearly as used to game mechanics as some people were) but just not sure how drastic it would be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, my question is, as the title suggests: do you think it\u0027s worth it to upgrade to 1.0.5 now or are there some issues that need to be worked out before updating?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sewerbird","CreatedById":62540,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T14:26:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost likely yes - new toys, better water, better heating.

There are a number of improvements in the new version, especially to thermal effects, that makes the base game a little easier. There are also neat new aircraft engines like the Juno that I\u0027m enjoying in career mode. The new Mk1 inline crew cabin is also a great addition; I\u0027ve been playing around with \u0022microshuttles\u0022 in Sandbox and \u0022microtourist\u0022 sub-orbital hops are my cash cow in Career right now. The new cockpit, two cabins and a tail chute with wings is a regular thrill ride of a tourist hop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you play heavily modded, you might wait until more mods have updated their compatibility. Instead, you could make the transition to CKAN if you haven\u0027t already. The repository is tremendously convenient and keeps compatibility problems from plaguing you, as most mods I used were updated as quick as the modders could code. I did have a small problem where RealChute and the stock nosecone chute had an arguement over statistics until Jebediah learned his parachute had a deployed area of 0.0 square meters... but its been patched up since and nothing lost.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T14:38:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t, for two reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
