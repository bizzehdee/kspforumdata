I was just running through a simple sub-orbital flight and taking my rocket back in.

If it is the former, the only thing I can think of is that my winglets are actually generating significant amounts of lift.

The same should happen in KSP. Now, for the rocket shown, it should streamline into the ground given that the center of pressure is to the rear of the center of mass.
