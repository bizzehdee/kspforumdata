Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not color blind (my most recent line of work would have revealed that if I was), so it\u0027s not an issue of being able to distinguish the colors. It\u0027s the issue that I have difficulty seeing the X within the retrograde marker now, which is what I must have trained my eyes to be able to quickly distinguish the two over the many hours I have played KSP. I\u0027d use Enhanced Navball as I used to, but I already have a heavily modded install going for me and I\u0027ve been reluctant to add anything else that hasn\u0027t been officially updated (already having some mod conflicts that I had to deal with).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep. That fixed it for me. I feel a little foolish for not noticing the UI transparency option. I can tell the two apart now. Didn\u0027t mean for this to turn into a support thread.
