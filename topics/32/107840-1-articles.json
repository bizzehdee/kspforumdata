Of course it depends on the brightness/contrast of your screen, the ambient light, and last but not least your own ability to distinguish colours (there\u0027s a thread started by a colorblind person who hardly is able to see the markers...)."},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T15:25:41Z","Content":"I was having the same problem, waiting for Enhanced Navball to recompile. \n\nWith over 1900 hrs. in KSP, it was slightly embarrassing yesterday to realize that the retro vector has exterior spokes dividing it into thirds, while the prograde vector is divided by spokes into halves, the upper half of which is spoked in half.

Thanks!\n\nI\u0027m not color blind (my most recent line of work would have revealed that if I was), so it\u0027s not an issue of being able to distinguish the colors. It\u0027s the issue that I have difficulty seeing the X within the retrograde marker now, which is what I must have trained my eyes to be able to quickly distinguish the two over the many hours I have played KSP. I\u0027d use Enhanced Navball as I used to, but I already have a heavily modded install going for me and I\u0027ve been reluctant to add anything else that hasn\u0027t been officially updated (already having some mod conflicts that I had to deal with).\n\nEdit:\n\nYep. That fixed it for me. I feel a little foolish for not noticing the UI transparency option. I can tell the two apart now. Didn\u0027t mean for this to turn into a support thread. Was just wondering if others were having a hard time like me.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T20:36:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 08:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by stevehead**"},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T21:28:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is it me, or are the prograde and retrograde indicators very hard to distinguish on the navball since the v1.0 release?\n\nI find the same thing.\n\nEdit: oh, looks like I will try fixing it then."}]}
