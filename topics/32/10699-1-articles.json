At the moment, i\\\u0027m saving up money for the actual game. So far, I have attempted many Mun landings and my rocket is flawless but I can\\\u0027t get the hang of obtaining orbit. Until I get the game, which mods would you reccomend, or what should I do?"},{"CreatedByName":"Thobewill10","CreatedById":6148,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-17T03:46:15Z","Content":"Well, to start, how do you know that your rocket is flawless? Only testing can do that.\n\n[This](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=12091.0) is a good guide for getting into orbit for the first time. Going to the moon should happen after you\\\u0027re pretty comfortable getting in to orbit. \n\nAs for mod packs, just look around in the addon releases subforum. I recommend KW Challenger and Downunder extremely highly.\n\nBest of luck on your launches!\n\nEDIT: Fixed link"},{"CreatedByName":"sss","CreatedById":24050,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-17T04:07:50Z","Content":"Adress not valid.\n\nalso to get into orbit, simply burn untill on youre map (m) it shows a AP of say, 100,000m once its there, cut all throttle.\n\nthen when you get to youre AP burn prograde (at the green marker on nav ball) untill youre PE is also 100,000m.\n\ni also recomend IFE wich you can use of the demo.\n\n(and the intrepid sls that it gives you) \n\nalso, once you have the full version, i suggest Mechjeb for getting manuveres done perfectly. you can also use it as a training tool by watching what it does.\n\nany other questions, just PM me (private message)"},{"CreatedByName":"Endeavour","CreatedById":21125,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-17T11:32:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E also to get into orbit, simply burn untill on youre map (m) it shows a AP of say, 100,000m once its there, cut all throttle.\n\u003E \n\u003E then when you get to youre AP burn prograde (at the green marker on nav ball) untill youre PE is also 100,000m.\n\nPrograde is actually the yellow marker, the one that is a circle with nothing inside the circle.
