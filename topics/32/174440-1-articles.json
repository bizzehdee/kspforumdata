However, it really can slow your progress if you let it. I learned to put a stop to it with a pretty simple cutoff switch; money. Once I have an unGodly amount of cash, I start warping more. This also coincides with Reputation. Once your Rep is high enough, it doesn\u0027t hurt you to warp for long periods. This also has the added bonus of letting you cherry pick through the available contracts.

don\u0027t let a contract go by, never timewarp if there\u0027s something I can pick up, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, after my first career or two, I pretty quickly settled on a basic way of relating to the game that has held me in good stead ever since:\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Estory arcs.\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, what I do is this:\u00A0 Every time I\u0027m about to start a new career, I always figure out ahead of time \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewhat is this career going to be \u0022about\u0022\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 I have a story arc in mind, with a specific end goal.\u00A0 And I\u0027ll have a specific set of mods to use in that career, which will help determine how the story plays out (e.g. life support or not?\u00A0 Extraplanetary Launchpads or not?\u00A0 SpaceY or not?\u00A0 etc.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis has a couple of benefits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, it keeps the game fresh for me over time.\u00A0 Every career has a different planned story arc and a different set of mods for working towards it, which means each career plays out differently, which keeps me coming back for more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut second (and more relevant to the point you raise), it also \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ekeeps the career moving along\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 My goal is never, ever \u0022do all the things\u0022.\u00A0 It\u0027s always to \u0022move the story along towards the desired goal.\u0022\u00A0 Perhaps, for example, I decide I\u0027m going to play with Galileo\u0027s Planet Pack, and also with Karbonite\u002B (so I can get those sci-fi karborundum-powered engines, but which requires mining karborundum), with the end goal of sending a crewed mission to the star Grannus and back.\u00A0 Everything I do in the career is geared towards furthering that goal.\u00A0 \u0022Okay, first I have to get out into the solar system... now I need to prospect to find where the karborundum is... now I need to set up a mining operation... okay, now I need to build my interstellar ship... off we go to Grannus... now I\u0027m back, successfully land... yay!\u00A0 Done.\u00A0 Time for a new career.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA typical career\u0027s story arc will account for usually several dozen hours of play time, at least-- long enough to keep me entertained for a good long while, but short enough that I don\u0027t get bored with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd since every single thing I do in the game is in furtherance of the main goal, this means I don\u0027t get sidetracked by trying to \u0022do all the things\u0022.\u00A0 Did a juicy tourist contract just pop up?\u00A0 Should I take it?\u00A0 Well, do I actually need any money in order to build my Grannus expedition, or do I have enough right now?\u00A0 If I\u0027ve got enough, then stopping to pick up more would be counterproductive, so I just skip it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find that having that story arc and \u0022goal\u0022 always in mind generally keeps me nicely on track, and I never get bogged down.\u00A0 Works great, keeps KSP fun for me, and keeps me coming back for more.\u00A0 \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg
