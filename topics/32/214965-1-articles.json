The big Part in the middle won\u0027t allow any transfer of crew or resources so I need to add the tube part. Its really just some structural tubes and a docking port at each end. when I wanted to dock the tube it docked on one side. I then used the EVA construction option to aligne the second port but it just doesnt want to dock. I tried wiggeling the Station with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E but that didnt help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/NVqCPjc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/NVqCPjc\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you guys have any idea what causes that or how I could fix it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\u003Cbr\u003E\nDarkHawk\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-13T01:22:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you take some pics in better light?
