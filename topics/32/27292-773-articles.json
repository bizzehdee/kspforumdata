Naturally I picked a landing zone with greater than ten degrees of grade, so the landing took two tries, but eventually I got the craft down safe. Jeb got out and took a surface sample and EVA report, and planted a flag for good measure; Val also got her flag-planting ticket punched. Everything done, the craft returned to Munport, where Jeb processed the science in the station\u0027s lab and then the trio transferred back to \u003Cem\u003EBockscar\u003C/em\u003E for the journey back to Kerbin along with the four science experiments (two Jeb gathered plus two from a previous trip). \u003Cem\u003EBockscar\u003C/em\u003E successfully returned to the Kerbinport space station, the science was processed there as well, and the three tourists aboard \u003Cem\u003EBockscar\u003C/em\u003E were loaded into the \u003Cem\u003ERaven\u003C/em\u003E spaceplane docked at the station, again along with the four science experiments. That gives me six tourists - Rayny, Ludock, Orlie, Clauca, Tesei and Thomman - aboard the \u003Cem\u003ERaven\u003C/em\u003E. The craft is at capacity Kerbal-wise with only tourists aboard; good thing there\u0027s a probe core installed on the craft.

The two craft were undocked from one another and subsequently docked seperately to Munport, with the remaining fuel from the \u003Cem\u003EPigeon\u003C/em\u003E transferred to the \u003Cem\u003EPeacock\u003C/em\u003E. Verise was then loaded aboard the \u003Cem\u003EPeacock\u003C/em\u003E, where I discovered that the tools necessary to repair the \u003Cem\u003ESojourner\u003C/em\u003E ore-scanner probe had indeed been loaded aboard. The repair mission commenced at once and was successful; with this set of repairs, my errors in the launch of the first three \u003Cem\u003ESojourner\u003C/em\u003E probes have all been rectified, and ore-drilling operations on Mun can commence (finally). Verise then had a pretty hairy return to Munport; the plane changes drained the \u003Cem\u003EPeacock\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E fuel to the point where the craft only had 26 m/s of delta-V remaining on main thrust. The final rendezvous had to be done on RCS thrusters only. Fortunately, the \u003Cem\u003EPeacock\u003C/em\u003E is a pretty light craft - 6.5 tonnes fully loaded and 4.5 tonnes empty - and has more in the way of RCS thrusters than she probably needs. The craft returned successfully to Munport and docked with about 45% of its monopropellant remaining. The Mun is pretty much out of gas at this point, so the sooner I can set up drilling ops, the better. That may very easily be my next order of business when play next resumes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile all this was going on, Kerbolport 7-3 arrived in solar orbit.

I was offered two contracts to replace that one, a flag planting contract for Mun (which figures since Mun is out of gas at the moment), which I took, and one to transfer 2100 units of ore from Duna to Ike, with a payout of just shy of \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A11M.
