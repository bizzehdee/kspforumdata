I love those since you get an extra free kerbal. The classic way is to just your ship close to it and then have the kerbal EVA onto your ship. That works fine. But I suck at using the jetpack and i can\u0027t control it. Ever since I unlocked the AGU and started with asteroid missions, I had this idea to use the AGU to grab the stranded kerbal\u0027s ship and then do a crew transfer. Now 1 (actual) year later, I decided to make the plan work. I was completing one of those grab-an-astroid-and-land-it-on-kerbin contracts. The way I do it is to use the engine of the grabber ship to fire at the asteroid and make it reenter by it self and \u0022land\u0022. The grabber ship is still in orbit and I was planning on getting it back to Kerbin when I saw the rescue contract. So used asteroid ship and got it close to the stranded kerbal. Then I pointed the ship in the right way and used the claw to grab the stranded kerbal\u0027s ship. Then I tried to do a crew transfer, but then I realized that I didn\u0027t carry an extra cockpit, so I launched another rocket, but this one did not carry an extra seat, but a monster heat shield and some extra parachutes. I attracted the the heat shield and parachutes to the first craft using another AGU. then burned retrograde But since I sort of chipped the heat shield into the bottom of the engine, I couldn\u0027t stage it. So I ended up reentry with extra parts. After I deployed the parachutes, I tried to jettison the heat shield, but since it chipped into the engine, it didn\u0027t move. So I land pretty hard and destroyed the heat shield, but hey, I had the engine and the rescued kerbal. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-24T22:40:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy ending! \\o/\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cant think of a username","CreatedById":204905,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-25T00:20:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223808893\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022195020\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221593038400\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002227914\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Vanamonde said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy ending! \\o/\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYea true.
