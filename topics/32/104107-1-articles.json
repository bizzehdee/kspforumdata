I find this weird, since a flag is not a controllable object (yes, you can focus on them, but you can\u0027t do anything with them). Why would it be included in the count with capsules and probes, but debris is not? Shouldn\u0027t debris be included then too? \n\nMy preference would be to not include planted flags in the \u0022flights in progress\u0022 count. Like I said, its just a petty detail that bothers me."},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T14:20:39Z","Content":"Well they could be flights--haven\u0027t you ever run a flag over with a rover? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T14:26:33Z","Content":"Because KSP."},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T14:52:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Because KSP.\n\nBasically.
