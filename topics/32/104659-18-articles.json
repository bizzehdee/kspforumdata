I could imagine a countdown or a crawler as well, but those would both be annoying to experienced players, so I don\u0027t see them as likely (even if toggle-able). I think craters from crashes fits well, especially considering the hint about destroy-able buildings: something like \u0022You won\u0027t even notice if you\u0027re good.\u0022\n\nPersonally, I always look for tutorials in a new game with complexity like KSP. Since we already have those (and it\u0027s not Harv working on them), I can\u0027t see introductory (teaching) material as likely. I also can\u0027t imagine it\u0027d be Harv working on an intro cutscene or the like, and that would probably take longer than 2 days. I think craters fits because the lack of it is something a brand new player will notice when they crash their first couple rockets, and the destroy-able buildings might have already put in some of the necessary infrastructure.\n\nI\u0027m very disappointed that the new feature won\u0027t be clouds. Craters would be a nice addition, but I think clouds are the most important cosmetic update KSP is still missing."},{"CreatedByName":"Moesly_Armlis","CreatedById":112247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T01:46:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...and the destroy-able buildings might have already put in some of the necessary infrastructure.\n\u003E I\u0027m very disappointed that the new feature won\u0027t be clouds. Craters would be a nice addition, but I think clouds are the most important cosmetic update KSP is still missing.\n\nI started playint only a year ago at version 23.5, and the clouds or storms was something I was looking for first, and second was where is the burned out crater. Storms and lightning can really mess up a launch. Craters would be a reminder of prior science experiments.\n\nThe buildings can now be destroyed and I find it hard to believe that all that programming potential is left behind every time we launch away from the KSC, that is destroy-able structures should exist throughout the KSP system. For now I will settle for the scorched crater hole.\n\nI am hyping for the scorched crater hole."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T02:32:38Z","Content":"Also it\u0027d open the door for the concept of deformable terrain.
