Was quite amazed when I spotted it: a Kerbodyne-sized Lab module, short profile, with two cargo hatches at the sides.\n\nThe storage spaces are too small for a Science Jr. and not easily accessible by ladder, so they\u0027re not exactly suitable for science-y stuff. They comfortably hold a lot of fuel cells / batteries / RCS tanks, however, so you don\u0027t need to add a dedicated storage bin just for the small stuff.\n\nUnfortunately, the ladder is sunk into the model and I have a hard time connecting it to surface-attached ladders.\n\nIn other news, it can hold 750 data for even MOAR Science."},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T11:49:53Z","Content":"There is no such part.
