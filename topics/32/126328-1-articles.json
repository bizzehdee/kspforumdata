One time I had a rocket that crashed the game whenever I loaded it in the editor. It was moderately sized, but not too big. Sometimes the game had a bad habit of just loading said rocket whenever I opened the VAB, crashing immediately.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T14:47:54Z","Content":"\nIf you can reproduce that reliably with this rocket using stock KSP make a bug report!
