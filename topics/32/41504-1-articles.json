In that layer, the clouds turn dark green and the camera becomes restricted. At the bottom of that layer, there\u0027s a bouncy barrier that kills Kerbals and rips ships apart, or at best bounces them around and prevents you from leaving the probe without ending the flight. The trick is not to touch the bottom of that 95m deep layer. You can do this with Hooligan\u0027s airship mod, and use KAS to drop a grappling hook or anchor into that layer (you might have to config edit to make the cable reach far enough).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPic is relevant: An old 0.20 science platform anchored just over the \u0022Kraken Lair\u0022 layer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5S2GCnH.png\u0022 alt=\u00225S2GCnH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sma","CreatedById":67377,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T21:34:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETHere\u0027s also a \u0022quantum anchor\u0022 effect you can get with quantum struts.
