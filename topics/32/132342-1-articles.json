As drag draws your trajectory down, counter it with blips of the throttle. Once you\u0027re close to your destination use your rocket to fine tune your trajectory. Reentry heating shouldn\u0027t be a big issue as you really won\u0027t ever get above say 1600 m/s and any drops you do should be shallow.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
