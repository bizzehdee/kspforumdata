About the only thing I\\\u0027d change is that 909 thruster. The anemic power curve on that coupled with such a heavy lander doesn\\\u0027t make me comfortable during the drop into Mun\\\u0027s gravity well. I still have enough fuel in the transit stage to tear a good chunk off of that 650m/s drop with its LV-230, but you don\\\u0027t dare let it get out of hand again once its gone and all you have is the 909 for company. Widening the base of the landing struts without making the lander taller really helped, however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, a pretty smooth tour!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Endeavour","CreatedById":21125,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-29T21:36:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat job!
