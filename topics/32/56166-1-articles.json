Resources can\u0027t do that without totally changing the way players interact with the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou see, what originally attracted me to this game was the fact that there \u003Cem\u003Ewere\u003C/em\u003E no resources in the game and that I could just go into the VAB and build a massive rocket with no regards for economic feasibility, health, or safety concerns, and (semi)realistically launch it into space. I mean, the way I understood that resources were to be implemented was that there was a finite number of resource X or resource Y or resource Z and you had to more or less \u0022craft\u0022 them together to create resource Q so that you could build rocket part W. Everyone\u0027s so scared of KSP becoming the next Minecraft, I don\u0027t see why we\u0027re so sad to see resources more or less be scrapped. It\u0027s Kerbal \u003Cem\u003ESpace\u003C/em\u003E Program, not Kerbal \u003Cem\u003EMining\u003C/em\u003E Program. I don\u0027t know, it\u0027s about creating and managing a space program, even in career mode. Space programs, as far as I know, do not have their own mining divisions. You don\u0027t ask SpaceX to go out and mine its aircraft grade Aluminum out of the ground. No, they buy it in its more or less \u0022completed\u0022 form and shape it to form the parts they need. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultiplayer, on the other hand, has the potential to make the game super fun. I believe it was on one of the KerbalKon streams where one of the devs(?) or streamers(?)...Well, someone mentioned that Multiplayer would be cool because you\u0027d be able to get yourself and two friends into a CSM and fly the Apollo 11 mission with them, where all three players could have control over some part of the ship. It\u0027s a level of cooperation and immersion that I think would really make the game more interesting to play. I\u0027ve played the KMP mod on a server, and, while it\u0027s still \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E buggy, it\u0027s insanely fun, even if it basically is just a bunch of people syncing to each other in Sandbox mode. The fact that I could, if I wanted to, dock to another player\u0027s craft that is being actively controlled, seems, like, awesome. There is literally no other game currently on the market that would offer a (realistic) space simulation in multiplayer. And even if it isn\u0027t the favorite feature of some players, you don\u0027t /have/ to play it in MP. That\u0027s the thing about MP, it\u0027s not a required part of the game. There\u0027s no possible way that it could actually /subtract/ from the gaming experience involved.
