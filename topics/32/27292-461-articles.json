Thus the \u003Cem\u003EBaby Omni\u003C/em\u003E was born. A simple 3-Stage rocket that primarily used cheap Solid rocket fuel. In an effort to save on the cost per launch the 1st-Stage was designed to be recoverable in effect reducing the cost by over 50%!

The satellites were very exposed, forcing slow and inefficient launch profiles to avoid mechanical failure. Each satellite requiring differing amounts of solid rocket fuel to achieve their individual orbits meant the center of mass would change for every flight causing a headache for all involved. Finally the cost was insanely high. More than double per launch compared to the \u003Cem\u003EBaby Omni.\u003C/em\u003E After the 3rd launch suffered from multiple unplanned disassemblies the rocket was retired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NQwdnZr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NQwdnZr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeet the \u003Cem\u003ESpore v3\u003C/em\u003E. A small albeit long rocket designed to put Omni-directional satellites in orbits ranging from LKO to near Mun distances. The major change was that instead of relying on each satellite having its own engine, the main rocket would carry enough fuel to place them in their correct orbits. This made them much smaller and therefore easier to stack vertically, allowing for a protective fairing. Currently it only carries 10 satellites but recent test have indicated it should be capable of double that number with a more powerful 1st-Stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GYWdDNa.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022GYWdDNa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far the \u003Cem\u003ESpore v3 \u003C/em\u003Ehas been a HUGE success.

I\u0027m up to \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A13,000,000 now - should be ready to fund my Duna/Ike mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did do something of mild interest last night - I combined a FinePrint aerial survey in the vicinity of KSC with a sub-orbital TR-18A parts test with a robotic spaceplane design. I knew going into it that the flight looked a little short on oxidizer, but I went ahead anyway; missions were successfully completed. Now, what I should\u0027ve done was let the plane come back down on the other side of Kerbin and use the excess liquid fuel to just fly back. What I did do was, after the TR-18A parts test, I went ahead and circularized the orbit thinking I could just deorbit in the right spot and come back in. Fine and dandy, dandy and fine...but the game was telling me the maneuver would take 50 m/s of delta-V and KER was telling me I had 15 m/s left. Once again, I did the stupid thing and burned. KER wasn\u0027t lying. Wound up with a wonky orbit with a periapsis just above 70k...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo...refueling mission!! Sent Jeb and Bill up in a plane heavy with oxidizer, carrying a winch and a KAS Radial Port. I thought the Liquid Fuel level was a bit short for the mission, but I went anyway...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMade a successful rendezvous. Jeb bumped the plane while he was getting the port in place - which I thought was no big deal. When I got him back to grab the winch cable, the target was over fifty meters away and the range was still opening. I did manage to get the winch cable in and docked and Jeb back to his plane - by which time the two craft were seventy meters apart. Doesn\u0027t sound like much, but that\u0027s still a hell of a spacewalk if you ask me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I got the fuel levels balanced out with both craft now (Jeb and Bill\u0027s flight probably didn\u0027t have the LF it needed to make a successful de-orbit, but at least they had RCS for backup - this way they have a little more fuel for flying). I\u0027ll try to land them both tonight if I get the opportunity. I\u0027m just hoping I don\u0027t overshoot the runway when I make the de-orbit burns; I doubt either flight has sufficient fuel for a lot of atmospheric maneuvering. At least I know already that in an emergency a Mk-2 cockpit makes a pretty descent boat...if I can land it slowly enough......\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Theoderich","CreatedById":111972,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-07T14:45:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zilentification\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Zilentification\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI figured the easiest way to solve my Remote Tech troubles was quantity.
