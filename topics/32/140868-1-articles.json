For trips to Dres and Jool the LV-N will be much more mass-efficient. Moho too, though you might also consider ions for extreme delta-V because Moho missions can use a lot of it if you aren\u0027t careful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShip mass is a factor too. On small probes and even lightweight Kerballed ships the LV-N is just too heavy itself, so chemical or ion propulsion is the way to go. On very large ships the LV-N doesn\u0027t provide enough thrust and you\u0027d need to spam too many of them, so instead consider the Rhino, one Rhino provides as much thrust as 33 LV-Ns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is very true, I\u0027ve found the Rhino to be an excellent engine for that midstage to get a large interplanetary ship out of Kerbins SOI, and then use NERV\u0027s for the rest of the trip.
