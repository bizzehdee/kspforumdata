Previously, I thought the aerospike was rather poor because as an engine intended for use in the atmosphere (as well as the vacuum, but previously it had the best atmospheric Isp, now its more properly modeled such that other engines have equal or better atmospheric performance at the expense of vacuum performance), but it lacked the TWR to serve well in an early stage.\n\nThey thus reduced the weight, giving it more TWR. I would have preferred an increase in thrust, as it still doesn\u0027t have much lifting power for something in an early stage.\n\nThe mass reduction then results in it competing with the LV-909 more when you want to keep your dry mass down.\n\nAs a whole though, its much better now.\n\nStill not great thrust, but I like it in an asparagus/parallel stage design with the aerospikes near the core/as the core stage.\n\nHigh thrust engines optimized for atmo performance (LV-T30s) fire alongside the aerospike, and then are discarded as they become inefficient in the higher atmo, while the aerospike keeps burning"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T08:03:42Z","Content":"Squad has previously stated that they want to introduce at least a small amount of performance progression into the tech tree.

The Isp should be roughly the same for both atm and vac. The Aerospike should be the best Eve lifter engine.\n\nAgreed. Looking at the description for the Aerospike, it would be very reasonable to assume that it\u0027s the best engine to use for getting off the surface of Eve. However, it doesn\u0027t have enough THRUST to lift enough fuel for it to be usable for that purpose, and it\u0027s ISP falls off too quickly. Sure it\u0027s got better TWR now, but that\u0027s not what\u0027s needed.\n\nIt\u0027s like trying to use an outboard motor to power a ocean-going cargo ship. There\u0027s just not enough power, no matter how light it may be.\n\nI think the aerospike should have a bottom stack node. How else are you supposed to get it to Eve? Side mounted inside a fairing? I don\u0027t think an Eve return vessel will fit in a stock fairing.\n\nAdditionally, it\u0027s specs should be adjusted like this:\n\nMass = 2.5 (maybe even a bit more)\n\nMax thrust = 300\n\nISP @ Vacuum = 335\n\nISP @ Kerbin SL = 330\n\nISP @ Eve SL = 275 \u003C== This plus the high thrust is what makes it a good Eve engine.\n\nIt might seem OP at first glance. Allow me to demonstrate that it\u0027s not actually OP.\n\nIt\u0027s got high mass, so it\u0027s bad for landers. \n\nVacuum ISP isn\u0027t highest in its class.\n\nBottom stack nodes just make sense, there\u0027s no reason you couldn\u0027t support the engine around the outside diameter just like the rest of them.\n\nHigh mass also makes it an inferior choice to the LV-T30 or LV-T45 for small turbojet\u002Brocket SSTOs.\n\nAlso, the KS-25x4 Mammoth has no business going to orbit, let alone all the way to Eve.\n\nThe use of it makes ships need 500 parts, which isn\u0027t fun.\n\nUsing anything else requires 1000\u002B parts. That\u0027s worse.\n\nWe should be able to do better than 500 parts for ANY single-planet return mission. Even ones to Jool moons.\n\nThe problem here is that the challenge isn\u0027t one of piloting ability or ability to design a suitable ship. It\u0027s a challenge of patience, because the ships end up needing so many parts that they make the game slow to a crawl even when you have a good computer.\n\nA game\u0027s challenge should never be even remotely related to how good your computer is, yet in the case of Eve return missions, it is.\n\nThat needs fixing, and changing the Aerospike like I suggest should result in a massive reduction of part count required to get Eve return capability.\n\nI\u0027m not trying to reduce the difficulty or challenge of Eve return missions by suggesting an OP part.\n\nI\u0027m suggesting the balance of a part be changed in order to try to cut out the root cause of lag (which is part count, plain and simple).\n\nLess ship parts, less lag, less tedium, same challenge.
