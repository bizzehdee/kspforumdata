The idea is that if the spacecraft passes close enough to Mars to be considered to be within Mars\u0027 gravitational SOI, then Mars\u0027 gravity will grab hold of the spacecraft and pull it the rest of the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Hohmann transfer has to be aimed precisely at Mars, while a ballistic capture only needs to be aimed at Mars\u0027 SOI, which is a much bigger target.
