So, for those of us who are already \u0022pro\u0022 at orbital mechanics - Career Mode is just a set of arbitrary restrictions. Keep in mind, that when we are testing this Beta and giving suggestions, Career Mode changes should always be aimed at newbies - so they can progress (both their career and understanding of Orbital Mechanics) in a logical way, much like the world did when we were learning about how to apply Kepler\u0027s Laws and Neuton\u0027s Theory of Gravity in a practical space exploration program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn that note, I would assume that by the time a newbie completes the entire tech-tree, they would have been able to gain the knowledge to do whatever they want (maybe with some trial and error yet) and basically be functionally the same as Sandbox mode, at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as accuracy: Liquid fuel rockets were operating as early as 1926; right about the time that jet turbines were being invented.
