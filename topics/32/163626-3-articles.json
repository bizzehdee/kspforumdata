I\u0027m quite used to auto-update as well, but I\u0027ve never had a system reboot to apply the update without permission until Windows 10. Perhaps this was an edge case, but it nearly caused me some trouble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do live production for events, and my Windows 10 laptop must have downloaded an update when it connected to the venue\u0027s wifi (auto-connected since it was a venue we frequent), and when it was idle it rebooted without warning\u00A0to apply the update. I\u0027m used to the nag screens of previous Windows versions, but there was nothing this time. I suspect it was a security update that was deemed a priority\u00A0and/or that the system hadn\u0027t been updated in a while. Whatever the reason, it rebooted to apply the update without asking if it could, and I almost missed my cue because of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI now check for updates before taking the systems out into the field, and I\u0027ve set them\u00A0to ignore updates during our busy hours.
