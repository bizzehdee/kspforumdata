I know I can download the latest version from the store, but what I don\u0026#39;t know is - do I install this over my existing installation, or create a new installation in a new location?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd if I\u0026#39;m installing in a new location, what do I need to copy over from my previous installation?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks for the help.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n(By the way, is it just me, or is this forum software kind of laggy?

As I noted, I have a horrible experience trying to use these forums at work, but I assume that is just due to the limitations of my work computer and their handicapped setup. Works fine for me at home on Chrome, but using IE at work it is nearly impossible to type any replies, I usually write them in notepad then paste them into the forum. Even at that I have to right-click because Ctrl\u002BV doesn\u0026#39;t work.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit - I see now that it got moved to it\u0026#39;s own post.
