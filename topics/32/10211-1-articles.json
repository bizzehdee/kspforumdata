One thing to note; the developer of C7 has joined the official dev team, and a lot of his parts will be included in the next official release (0.15) of the game, which will probably come out late next week, so you may or may not want to get started on the older version of those.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cardgame","CreatedById":12317,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-06T02:48:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENovaSilisko, DownUnder, and kwChallenger are great packs for parts, although some are slightly more powerful than others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndustrial Flames and Explosions has some great reality-based rockets and landers, but they\\\u0027re OP relative to everything else.
