So far this little station is pretty sweet. I\u0027m getting ready to fly the sucker to Mun and Minmus but I\u0027ve run into a problem. When I\u0027m in the orbital display, I cannot place maneuvering nodes on the orbits anymore. I can click but nothing happens.\n\nI\u0027ve got a pilot on board and I can set it to prograde, retrograde, etc and all that works just fine. \n\nI assume the game is confused by all the engines and potential command nodes on the station. Is there anything I should be looking at in particular to restore the ability to set maneuver nodes? \n\nI mean I \\*could\\* just eyeball it to the moons. I did that on my first Munar flight, just manually lined up prograde and fired the engines since I hadn\u0027t unlocked patched conics yet. However, when trying to fly a nearly 100 ton station, that seems like it might be a bit of a headache..."},{"CreatedByName":"Meecrob","CreatedById":104543,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T02:55:36Z","Content":"I get the same issue sometimes.

This is going to be a real pain to fly.\n\n^^ also these\n\nand on that note, (and just me being silly) but maybe because it\u0027s a \u0022station\u0022 the game feels that it\u0027s orbit should remain *stationary*? But seriously, stations are often asymmetrical (with regard to their center of mass) and tend to be more flimsy so they\u0027re difficult to move once built. Whereas a \u0022ship\u0022 (assembled in orbit) is generally designed to have it\u0027s COM central and directly inline with it\u0027s COT and has a more ridged design (typically things being more inline with each other, rather than having heavy parts off to the sides and joined with large docking ports). \n\nAnd finally, Welcome to the Forums!"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T13:21:15Z","Content":"Instead of outright eyeballing, undock the lander, calculate the node with it, remember the values, dock it back."}]}
