Its that easy (or they show un targeted adverts usually for asian brides, they must think people in finland want that)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe reason for this, although google and facebook are the most noted, is the other advertising companies that are harvesting massive amounts of personal data about people and keeping it on unsecured servers and not telling anyone. Yeah its an inconvenience for people running the sites to make sure they are safe and comply, but that aint nothing compared to people that get their identity or card details stolen from these places.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nhere is my actual experience, 2 years ago someone in south america hacked my facebook , and my gmail. it turned out they had hacked my yahoo address and used that to authenticate, i was also told by paypal about hacking attempts but i had changed my passwords. it took over 2 weeks to fix\u00A0 and go through all other sites i could think of and make sure passwords where changed and authentication changed. Yahoo set up security so basically there is no password, i need my phone to sign in. all sorted but no idea how they did it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI only found out a month ago what happened when Eve Online contacted me and said\u00A0my email address and password where on a list of breached passwords, some exchanges later i found out this was a hack of adobe in 2007.... and actually they informed all*\u00A0their customers that had been hacked, but only if they lived in the US.\u00A0 These laws are needed because these companies cannot be trusted on their own! and thats the end of the argument. IF i took your credit card with, firstly you should have to giver me permission to have it, secondly if you did, you would expect me to keep it safe and not where people could get it. thats all these laws do. Ive personally seen the lookup tools at an isp in the UK where you can take an ip and get an address. take that address and get a general profile of people that live there. a few name searches later and boom you know who was shopping at petsovernight.com and you can send your self a giraffe at their expense...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n//rant off\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nwith all that said thow, my question isint what will people do, its why wasent this being done before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lisias","CreatedById":187168,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-31T01:48:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223389700\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022172119\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221527730433\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166557\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Space Kadet\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n31 minutes ago, Space Kadet said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhere is my actual experience, 2 years ago someone in south america hacked my facebook\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[SNIP]\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nwith all that said thow, my question isint what will people do, its why wasent this being done before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy C.V. with some private\u00A0details (mine and from previous employers) are published on the Web.
