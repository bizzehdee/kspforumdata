It adds limited funding and limited starting facilities as constraints. In science mode you have limited technology but can build as big as you need to and can retry as many times as needed. In career mode, you can fail the game if you fail too many time in a row and deplete your funds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCareer also forces you to complete contracts to replenish funding. Some of those contracts aren\u0027t worth the time and effort, or might even cost you more to complete than they actually pay out, so you have to know enough about the game to pick and choose the right contracts. Contracts also might require precision landings, specific orbits, etc. and many of those requirements (and the skills needed for them) aren\u0027t needed in science mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find it to be more fun than science mode because of the added challenge. It has its shortcomings that have been discussed quite a bit over the years, though. My personal opinion is that it could be improved by having annual costs that increase as you upgrade facilities and have more flights in progress, and annual government funding that increases as your reputation increases, and reputation decreases if you haven\u0027t done anything in a while -- this would make time warping is more consequential.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
