I vastly turned down the lens dirt and vignetting and tweaked the depth of field until it had a nice rounded bokeh effect.

It\u0027s a bummer the whole mission builder didn\u0027t pan out as well as some had hoped, because a lot of folks had been complaining about career mode at the time and asked to be able to define their own mission parameters\u00A0and the capability to share those parameters seemed like a cool idea. Since then though some of the nuts-and-bolts quality-of-life additions like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, burn time indicator and now maneuver node and flight data improvements are huge, and I\u0027m also super appreciative of the long-needed art pass efforts.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) I still think there are some flight-data pieces missing, most notably an alarm clock and a\u00A0transfer-window finder to help players go beyond KSOI and further develop their space programs without resorting to mods. I\u0027ve seen a lot of discussion about scatterer and new\u00A0planets kicking around in the Suggestions section\u00A0and while I\u0027d love to see that I still think step 1 should be putting the tools in place for players to succeed.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) As we\u0027re thinking past all that\u00A0it\u0027s worth considering that career mode does still feel a bit incomplete. Some things would be relatively easy to fix, others would take a bit more effort. I continue to believe the game\u0027s obvious Main Quest--Kerbals landing on other planets--is not being served well by the UI in mission control. You can of course fund your entire program in career by just adventuring out and achieving milestones, but there\u0027s nothing in the UI that informs you of that\u00A0so players are entirely forgiven for thinking they are dependant on repetitive generative\u00A0contracts to survive. There are other\u00A0relatively easy moves like creating strategies for the Admin building that directly increase contract type probabilities--for instance \u0022Space Tourism\u0022 or \u0022Base Builder\u0022 strategies that increase\u00A0the rate that tourism and base building contracts appear in Mission Control--that would give players a stronger feeling that they were in control of their own destiny while still taking advantage of all of Arsonide\u0027s hard work.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n4) My greatest hope, however, would be a deeper dive into to the science mechanic and player exploration. The worlds just feel so empty now its hard for me to justify adding more empty planets. And a cosmetic upgrade just isn\u0027t enough, what we really need is to make the surfaces qualitatively varied in a way that impacts core game mechanics. What I\u0027d love most to see is a layer of sciency surface features that a) look neat b) are mappable from orbit and c) give science and/or funds/experience bonuses for visiting. Right now a player can land any old place and it makes no difference. We need a reason to really develop our mission profiles, to do things like scout landing sites, precision land, and bring rovers to cover more territory on the surface.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n5) And yeah, I won\u0027t lie, I love my mods. I love the way the game looks with scatterer. Much more than that I love the combo of Roverdude\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E life support and Nertea\u0027s SSPXr. Its more than some players think they need, but life support with habitation is a total game-changer.
