A little rotation by this point, but manageable\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Gravity Turn - 13.5 K Here\u0027s where things get a little tricky. If you\u0027re better with orbits then I am, you might know a better way. Turn off SAS if you are using it. I go straight for 45 degrees on 90 (east). You can use RCS to assist the turn. You want to make sure your well out of the thickest stuff (at least 13K) before turning as you have lost a lot of stabilizing struts have been dropped in previous stages. Stage 7 can creep up on you if you do not nail the turn. If the stage get\u0027s real close. I\u0027ll stop my turn anywhere on 90, even out, and turn SAS back on. Stage and then continue turn. You can turn SAS back on after the turn is complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Stage 7 (Space) - Around 22K Drops lower middle Tank. Here\u0027s where things get really delicate. We\u0027ve lost a lot of our stabilizing struts and you\u0027ll start to get some shaking. I have lost some tanks at this point, but it seems like as long as I just hold her straight, she holds together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Stage 6 (5 Space) - Around 39K (your gravity turn may alter this) At this point we\u0027re just shooting for an Apoapsis of 70K. We won\u0027t hit this at this stage, but we have to plan a little. We\u0027ll be dropping the lower center rocket with our Gimbal, because our upper rockets have more struts keeping the craft stable. As you near the stage right click one of the upper mainsails for the menu so you can see when Gimbal is activated. As soon as the lower rockets empty, press 5 to reactivate Gimbal and then space to stage. Those orange garbage cans have had a lot of shaking at this point. Be gentle. they can still fall off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Complete Orbit - Around 48K (a lot can affect this, but this where I am as I write this) At this point we\u0027re preparing to burn horizontally at 0. We\u0027re going to start a little early, because the LV-N\u0027s need a lot of time before Apoapsis to be effective. When the Apoapsis gets to about 65K cut thrust (x or ctrl all the way). Gently maneuver to 0 degrees on 90 (East). RCS may be used. I like to keep 30 seconds to 1 minute 30 seconds in front of my Apoapsis. We\u0027ll be finishing with the LV-N\u0027s. As I\u0027m writing this I crept past my Apoapsis, but was able to push it ahead by bringing my heading up to 30 degrees on 90. Let\u0027s try to get our Periapsis to 60K.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Stage 5 (Space) Final launch separation. I have the separation in it\u0027s own stage, because it forces me to stop and think and keeps my for and aft engines separate. If you want to combine stages 5 and 4 feel free, but realize it will reduce all previous stages by 1. At this point, The final engines are either heading back to Kerbin, or have a Periapsis below 65 K and can be de-orbited at your leisure, or stuck at a stable orbit. They are drones with small docking ports so they can be refueled and de-orbited later if you\u0027re stickler for such things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Stage 4 (1 or Space) Main thrusters activated. Action Group 1 also activates thrusters, so at this time we can lock stages and just use 1 and 2 to switch between thrusters. I find the LV-N\u0027s don\u0027t have a lot of Gimbal for this whale of a beast. Feel free to use RCS as there\u0027s a ton (possibly literally \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ) but with a little patience it is not necessary. With forward and aft engines, you won\u0027t need to do any crazy 180\u0027s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we\u0027re at one of three positions. First and worst case our Periapsis is below 60K. If this is so burn those LV-N\u0027s as high as you can with out heat. These will over heat quite quickly at full throttle. Bring your nose out maybe to 10 degrees at 90 to avoid over taking your Apoapsis. Go ahead and throw RCS forward with H key if you need to. If you pass your Apoapsis and your orbit is shrinking, I\u0027m sorry, but it\u0027s time to abort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, your Periapsis is between 60 and 70 K. This is where I usually fall often on purpose to make sure my last stage can be de-orbited. As long as you are more than 30 seconds in front of your Apoapsis you should have no problem burning at 0 degrees to finish your orbit, other wise see above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, your Periapsis is over 70k.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations. You are now in space with a stable orbit and well over 19000 fuel and 6500 monopropellent. As I write this I\u0027m at 19406 Liquid, 23718 Oxidizer, 6601 MonoPropellent. That should get you to most Kerbin orbits with 4 full jumbo-64\u0027s and 4 full FL-R1\u0027s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote\u0027s on final stages: These are if you ever want to de-orbit the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 4 - Forward Engines At this stage 1 key and 2 key can switch the action groups for forward or aft engines saving 180 degree turns.

If you can zoom inside of the piece with shift scroll or middle click you can sometimes find them when the reverse polygons aren\u0027t rendered. I also find this helpful for alining struts.

If you get lag when they are close, you might simply NEED MechJeb to dock. I ran into this very problem when my space station reached certain part count.
