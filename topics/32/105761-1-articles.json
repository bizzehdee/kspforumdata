No SAS. No hard pitch overs. If your rocket is stable (and that looks like it should be), it will just fly itself. Keep acceleration at about 2g.\n\nAs for re-entry, read the threads on the heat shield problem. Start with just returning the capsule, not a materials lab and storage bay. (Also, if you want to do it the easy way, just stage your chutes before you re-enter the atmosphere. They will pop out and magically stop you.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Matt516","CreatedById":133442,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T20:32:00Z","Content":"So here\u0027s the thing: what was often called a \u0022gravity turn\u0022 in old KSP isn\u0027t actually a gravity turn at all. In real life (and now KSP 1.0), rockets don\u0027t point off of prograde more than a few degrees while in atmo. Or they explode.\n\nA true gravity turn is simply pointing your rocket prograde the whole time (with a slight nudge off of vertical in the beginning to get things started) - as you follow your ballistic trajectory, the rocket will naturally turn as gravity brings it around. Hence \u0022gravity turn\u0022. Scott Manley has a nice tutorial video here:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/_q_8TO4Ag0E?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nSo to summarize - you don\u0027t turn a rocket more than 10 degrees off of prograde in real life, and now the Kerbals can\u0027t either. Gotta keep the rocket pointing prograde if you don\u0027t want to tumble. Makes sense?"},{"CreatedByName":"locustgate","CreatedById":81277,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T20:35:27Z","Content":"They need to fix the heat shields, though you can by changing it\u0027s weight, I can\u0027t remember how exactly.

As I understand it, the further the CoL from the CoM, the more stable your rocket is, i.e. the stronger the force keeping the rocket aligned with the prograde (direction of motion) vector, but the more difficult it is to turn. With lots of fins you should gravity turn early otherwise the lift/drag forces will prevent you from turning at all."},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T20:49:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not sure what I\u0027m doing wrong.

This is my rocket: [http://i.imgur.com/GrNyeGu.png](http://i.imgur.com/GrNyeGu.png)\n\nA lot of people are really enthused about the \u0022actual gravity turn\u0022 concept of just turning off SAS and letting the turn go naturally. That\u0027s great for people who want to figure out the proper balance, but it\u0027s not necessary. You DO need to make slower, more gradual turns now, but there\u0027s no reason at all that ship you have there couldn\u0027t fly just fine. Though I do highly recommend using a \u0022swivel\u0022 or ... whatever they renamed the 909 to for that second stage. Or slap a small reaction wheel into that service compartment. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m also having problems with re-entry. This is the return ship: [http://i.imgur.com/Mbj6UzB.png](http://i.imgur.com/Mbj6UzB.png) I did my best to keep it perfectly aligned with the drag vector, but before the heat shield could even start to ablate it flipped right over, nose towards the ground, and very quickly exploded.\n\nFirst, know that heat shields are currently bugged, but it\u0027s an easy bug to fix. It\u0027s three lines of config that need to be changed (and will be in the next update), and easily done yourself in the meantime.\n\nOpen your game directory to \u003Cpath\u003E\\Kerbal Space Program\\GameData\\Squad\\Parts\\Aero\\HeatShield. There, you\u0027ll see HeatShield1.cfg Heatshield2.cfg and HeatShield3.cfg. Open each of them in notepad (or your text editor of choice) and look for \u0022PhysicsSignificance = 1\u0022. Change that 1 to a 0. Save and close. Repeat twice... you\u0027re done.\u003C/path\u003E\n\nSecond... is a bit more complicated. You have a logical arrangement of parts, but not a balanced one. The material science bay is a LOT lighter than the capsule, so it will act almost like a set of fins on the back, pulling that end around. Fixing the heat shield configs will help with this somewhat, since the shield will have mass again, but you\u0027ll still have to fight to keep it pointed the right way. Currently, the best solutions are either a) get EVA capability and just store your science in the capsule, and don\u0027t return the materials bay at all... or ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) flip physics the middle finger and pop your parachute at 25km in the air, streaming fire all the way. A blast of plasma that will disintegrate a packed parachute does nothing to it once you deploy it, and it\u0027ll keep you pointed the right way as an added bonus."},{"CreatedByName":"PTNLemay","CreatedById":30142,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T21:09:43Z","Content":"Thanks for all of the advice, I did manage a return eventually.
