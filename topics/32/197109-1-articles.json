It was purposely designed that you couldn\u0027t \u0022buy\u0022 reputation or science from the admin building.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever,\u00A0I suppose from a purely gameplay perspective, it would make sense to be able to trade cash, reputation and science points freely between each other. But since that\u0027s not the case, I like to think about it like this: With reputation, that one is simple when you think about it; you simply can\u0027t \u0022buy\u0022 a good reputation, something like that needs to be earned. It\u0027s not just some numbered resource, like cash or science, but it\u0027s supposed to represent how much the rest of kerbal kind likes your space program, and how much they\u0027re willing to send you quality contracts to do for them. And honestly, if a real space agency was giving me money to try to give them a better-than-they-deserve reputation, that would look pretty shady, no? As for science, well, that\u0027s also simple: nobody else has \u0022science\u0022 as a resource that they can give you. Your space program is the only organization who is out there in the solar system trying to learn more about it, and as such, you\u0027re the main provider of science. You can sell it for money, but then that science would presumably be \u0022used up for research\u0022 like we do with the tech tree. In that light, it\u0027d be a bit silly to try to trade money for science from kerbals who don\u0027t have it. It\u0027d be like if NASA went around and asked if anyone had any Moon rocks for sale.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, this is just my own head canon, but I feel it makes sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-09-26T22:31:48Z\u0022 title=\u002209/26/2020 10:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 26, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Yellowburn10\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
