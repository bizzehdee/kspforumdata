If we go with the worst case scenario, no atmosphere, the most efficient path would probably involve boosting yourself into a highly eccentric kerbol orbit and reversing direction at Apoapsis. From there you can adjust it back to a normal orbit and do all the usual things. I can see this easily taking 10k dV however. But landing on it is definitely possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DChurchill","CreatedById":60282,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T17:42:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd inclined 90 degrees. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T17:46:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DChurchill\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DChurchill\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd inclined 90 degrees. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would actually make it easier, the angle you have to make would only be 90 degrees instead of 180.
