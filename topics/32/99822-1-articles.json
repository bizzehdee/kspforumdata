And no matter how long you follow the node, you will never be able to \u0022complete\u0022 it, because you will never get down to 0 m/s delta V left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei started noticing this behaviour when i tried to use mechJeb to rendezvous or dock with other craft while orbiting Duna. It\u0027s impossible, because mechJeb can\u0027t complete a single maneuver because of this effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eat first i thought my install was messed up. but since then i tried fresh 0.90 steam installs without any mods (except HyperEdit) on two different machines and the behaviour is the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei tried the same scenario around Kerbin (little different altitudes of course) and it works fine there. i assume thats why i never noticed it before in my game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eis this something the community is familiar with? do i have to live with it? can i do something about it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eany input would be appreciated. thanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eregards\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: after some discussion it became obvious that a video of the effect would be helpful for everybody to know what we\u0027re talking about, so i provided this one:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaU51V4QzBY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaU51V4QzBY\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-17T04:47:52Z\u0022 title=\u002202/17/2015 04:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by maxdreamland\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eproviding additional information\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Henshaw","CreatedById":56745,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T13:16:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThats because nodes assume an instantaneous change of velocity, but since that isn\u0027t the case it needs to adjust and move since your burn takes time in order to get the exact orbit one planned with the node.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brdavis","CreatedById":88788,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T13:22:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe marker on the NavBall shows the orientation to burn in to reduce the current difference between your velocity vector and the selected velocity vector\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 but there\u0027s no such thing as \u0022zero\u0022.
