An unstable overclock can cause various issues, like the error correction in de GDDR5 kicking in (causing slowdowns because data needs to be sent multiple times). Temperature could be another issue, as chips that run too hot throttle themselves back. I have not heard you about the temperatures, even though they are the main factor in determining whether you can push an overclock further.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt could also be your settings are too high. If you have certain texture settings (high AA and AF combined with large textures) or effects, the memory consumption can be off the charts. This in turn causes slowdowns, because data needs to be transferred back and forth all the time between HDD and video memory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I feel that aiming for settings that will allow you to run a game at 60 fps is a decent approach. That way a game runs buttery smooth and has some headroom for performance heavy areas, yet generally games do not improve much visually with excessive settings. You really need to do a detailed side by side to even see any the difference.

An unstable overclock can cause various issues, like the error correction in de GDDR5 kicking in (causing slowdowns because data needs to be sent multiple times). Temperature could be another issue, as chips that run too hot throttle themselves back. I have not heard you about the temperatures, even though they are the main factor in determining whether you can push an overclock further.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt could also be your settings are too high. If you have certain texture settings (high AA and AF combined with large textures) or effects, the memory consumption can be off the charts. This in turn causes slowdowns, because data needs to be transferred back and forth all the time between HDD and video memory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I feel that aiming for settings that will allow you to run a game at 60 fps is a decent approach. That way a game runs buttery smooth and has some headroom for performance heavy areas, yet generally games do not improve much visually with excessive settings. You really need to do a detailed side by side to even see any the difference. Pushing your system to the limit can be fun, but if stable gameplay is the goal, you might want to aim for 10-20% below that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222662068\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002223017\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221467718614\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022104935\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cantab\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 hours ago, cantab said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/159324-koclobster/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022159324\u0022 href=\u0022%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/159324-koclobster/\u0022 rel=\u0022external\u0022\u003E@KocLobster\u003C/a\u003E what other software did you use to stress test your overclock?
