Drop tanks without the extra drag and without the cost of extra decouplers, even without having to run any fuel lines.\u00A0 Works well if you can time it so the tanks are empty right about when the SRBs flame out. This displayed burn time issue makes it a little less convenient to figure how much fuel to put there, as well as throwing off the overall \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E calculation.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
