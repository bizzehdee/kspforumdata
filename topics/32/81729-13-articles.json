I have seen anti-realism people on countless game forums over the years somehow equate \u0022realism\u0022 with \u0022unfun\u0022 and \u0022hard.\u0022 Realism and fun (for the large majority of players) are not mutually exclusive. Realism and \u0022hard\u0022 are not mutually exclusive. Easy vs hard has at least as much (or more) to do with the tools provided (UI, etc) than the physics (a nod to the devs, BTW, that their user interface is actually really good, IMO, and makes things that might be daunting for some players make a lot of sense). Trying to keep the physics in line with the real universe is good because we know that the real universe makes sense. In doing science fiction, it\u0027s best to try and keep some grip on reality so unexpected consequences and inconsistencies don\u0027t break everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to track your astronauts through careers, and their stupidity/courage is to matter, for example, then presumably there needs to be a way to actually kill them (deadly reentry, for example), something I\u0027ve not managed to do yet (playing only a couple weeks now). As it is, the idea of anything making the game too hard seems fanciful to me. The first night after I downloaded the game, I successfully landed on the moon twice in science career (the first managed to leave the surface, but I had wasted so much fuel accidentally over thrusting and having to shoot the landing a few times that I could not make it home and Jeb was stuck in orbit (a terrible, retrograde, inclined munar orbit into the bargain), the 2d was a return trip). A couple nights after that, I rescued Jeb (wanted RCS first). I\u0027ve not gone everywhere yet, but honestly, I will have run out of unplayed stock game in a couple weeks more of play (all done after the kids go to bed with a glass of wine or beer in one hand).

On rails objects are treated as a single point following a predefined orbital path; as I understand it this is much less computationally intense than calculating gravity and trajectory continuously even if it\u0027s treated as a single point mass, as would be required for n-body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real performance bottleneck as I understand it is the interaction of parts within a given ship, this sort of chained rigidbody problem involves a lot of calculation dependent on the results of other calculations, so it\u0027s not easily multithreadable even if the engine supports multithreading. At best, a thread for each vessel in physics range could be done, so being near a staion wouldn\u0027t necessarily start lag like it does now.
