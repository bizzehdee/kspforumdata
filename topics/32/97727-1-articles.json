I am a semi-lurker here, but something has forced me out of my shell. I just read that KSP is going to be called \u0022complete\u0022 after just one beta update. One. And there are still so much stuff that needs to be made before most of the community can call KSP complete. I discovered that many other members share my opinion. To address this problem, I have created a petition on change.org \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.change.org/p/squad-extend-kerbal-space-programs-s-beta-period?just_created=true\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. I hope you fellow KSPers will sign this petition and make Squad extend the KSP beta period. Save the Kerbal Space Program!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Melfice","CreatedById":3143,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-25T00:58:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E...

I trust squad, but I just wonder if they have completely thought this through, or got caught up in the excitement, or otherwise being suggested to speed up release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you want them to be known as the Indie version of Bethesda if Aero severely breaks something that they miss?

So no a game can be released more than once or even have things added onto it after its release, which, after watching the Squadcast, is what they are planning on doing. So I would not get sand in uncomfortable places, like the back of VW, and take a pill and relax a bit. I will do out on a limb and say that what has been released is far from all that is coming.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-25T01:25:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think we can safely there have been quite enough threads on this matter.

Sure, they\u0027ve had troubles in the past, but they have proven time and time again that they can learn from their mistakes. Best to give them the benefit of the doubt for now, I think. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease add your thoughts to an existing thread if you feel the need.
