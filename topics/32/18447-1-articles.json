I\u0027m about half done with text-BARIS already and by just switching around a few part names it would be kerbal. Leave out the actual launch simulation and tell people what parts they can use in KSP, and you have a KSP Campaign. It would make a campaign easy to be a part of, attracting more players, and reduce confusion because the program would handle all the number crunching. It would be in Java so it could run on any OS. By adding an AI (not sure how that would work) it would be a single player KSP space race! Even without an AI, a single player KSP campaign could still be fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering if anyone is doing or is planning to do a KSP Campaign and would like me to make a program for them!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Justin8Ball","CreatedById":9094,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-02T13:17:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould be an awesome add on for kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"simplemunrockets","CreatedById":22495,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-02T15:10:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, there\u0027s this guy: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/XLordStimpyX/featured\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/user/XLordStimpyX/featured\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe has a forum thread with the rules: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/11778-Stimpy-s-Campaign-Mode-Budget-Rules\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/11778-Stimpy-s-Campaign-Mode-Budget-Rules\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Th3Cap3","CreatedById":11274,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-07T01:14:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was going to try my hand at building a Java app for it, I sent a message to Lord_Stimpy to see wat he thinks about it.
