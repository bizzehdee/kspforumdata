I\u0027ve been experiencing some sort of glitch that has been messing up my orbits. I\u0027ll inject a spacecraft into an interplanetary trajectory and set up a nice encounter with the target planet.

There is no explanation because I didn\u0027t perform any burns and there are no other bodies nearby that could have altered the orbit. This has happened to me at least three times since the 0.90 upgrade. It has to be some sort of bug.
