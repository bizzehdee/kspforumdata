I think I came across some sort of bug or something that made my vessel rotate uncontrollably faster and faster every time I EVA\u0027d. While trying to collect the data from my science instruments, I had to use a combination of time-warp to stop the motion and hit B to board, otherwise I would be flung out of control. All this while the Martian music score is playing in the background.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLong story short, it was a minute or two of high suspense and the music perfectly lined up. The song was the one that plays when Mark Watney is doing his Iron Man stunt to rendezvous with the Hermes. The suspense built, and\u00A0then the happy part of the song played perfectly in line with me finally boarding my craft. It\u0027s the little things like that that make me love this game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fourfa","CreatedById":151713,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-10T08:58:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like Gemini 8. \u00A0Nice going\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Turf","CreatedById":161356,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-10T09:05:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPretty much the music got coincidentally starts and ends.

I can\u0027t tell you how many times my gameplay has lined up perfectly with my music playlist. I love it when that happens. I remember one time that the (explosive) landing of my prototype space shuttle lined up with the 2001 theme. And then I survived!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
