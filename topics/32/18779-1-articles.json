While this is, of course, very true, I\u0027m afraid i don\u0027t think that it\u0027ll be very relevant to transferring from planet to planet. The whole thing is relative to the body you\u0027re currently in orbit (or not) around, and so when moving from one body to another, the velocity readout changes. In a mission to another planet, the most efficient way to do so is (at least as I see it) to move to orbiting Kerbol and then grow the orbit out to the other planet. But I digress. The system should work perfectly fine for interplanetary transport, just as it does for Mun-Minmus missions. Besides, the only time I really use it is when I\u0027m coming down to a body, and I don\u0027t want to know my total velocity relative to Kerbol at that point. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"royalkingofgames","CreatedById":23658,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-07T12:00:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etrue but it should be for advanced calculatins\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-07T13:33:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Legoasaurus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Legoasaurus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA very intresting point!

You can save large amounts of fuel by taking advantage of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOberth Effect\u003C/a\u003E, and burning from low orbit into a trajectory that allows you to coast directly into your transfer orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, consider a spacecraft starting from a 100km Kerbin orbit, going at about 2.1 km/s. Assume you want to get it to escape Kerbol. (Escape velocity at Kerbin\u0027s altitude, about 13.1 km/s)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo run that spacecraft up to Kerbin escape velocity from that altitude (about 3.2 km/s) requires a delta-V of about 1.1 km/s. That will put you just outside Kerbin\u0027s SOI at rest relative to Kerbin, moving at Kerbin\u0027s orbital velocity of 9.3 km/s, and you\u0027ll need a delta-V if about 3.9 km/s to reach Kerbol escape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal Delta-V from 100km orbit by burning to escape, then escaping and burning to Kerbol escape velocity, about 5.0 km/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead, let\u0027s take advantage of the Oberth affect, and burn up to about 5.0 km/s from that 100km orbit, (Delta-V 2.8 km/s) timed so that we cross the SOI boundary, we do so in precisely the direction that takes us across the SOI boundary moving in the direction of Kerbin\u0027s orbit. When we cross the SOI boundary, we\u0027ll still have 3.2 k/ms of that velocity with us, which, when added to Kerbin\u0027s orbital velocity, takes you on Kerbol escape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal delta-V, 2.8 km/s. In this case, a 44% saving in required delta-V to reach Kerbol escape, which results in very significant savings in fuel and corresponding spacecraft mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen going from Kerbin to interplanetary destinations, in almost every case, you wind up with significant fuel savings by burning directly into your tranfer orbit from as low a Kerbin orbit as you can manage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rickenbacker","CreatedById":2349,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-07T15:12:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022royalkingofgames\u0022 data-cite=\u0022royalkingofgames\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Espeed is a funny thing and very complicated.\u003Cp\u003Ewhen landed on kerbin your at 0m/s but your not. the planet is rotating so your at 174.5m/s but then kerbin is orbiting the sun so youre at over 9284.5m/s.(K)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis gets more complicated orbiting kerbal. say your orbiting at 100km and say your moving at 4000m/s (S)then when your ships orbit is traveling kerbins pro-grade your traveling k\u002Bs which is13284.5m/s. and when your pointing kerbin retro-grade your traveling k-s which is 5284.5m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHence the \u0027surface\u0027 and \u0027orbital\u0027 speed modes, when close enough to the surface of a body, your speedometer shows your speed relative to the surface, which means 0 m/s when landed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sp_blazer","CreatedById":38958,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-09T01:55:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGot to love good old relativity\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
