Basically it seems like the game screws up the calculations of where your plane is and thinks it collided with a structure or other vessel. If you\u0027re lucky the plane survives. IIRC it\u0027s related to the kraken\u0027s bane changing the coordinate reference, and became a lot more noticeable once the KSC buildings became destructible.
