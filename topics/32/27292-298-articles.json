But oh boy, let me tell you what I did yesterday! Yesterday, I successfully landed Jebediah and Genedred on the surface of Moho, marking my very first manned landing on the surface of another planet. I have to say though, it went really, ah, \u0022interestingly\u0022. I needed to use my massive refuelling vehicle to mostly deorbit my lander, because I wasn\u0027t 100% sure my lander had enough deltaV to land and take off again, even refuelled. The only thing was, because of how massive the two vehicles were, and the fact I\u0027d be doing it with fission rockets, it took a couple of minutes just to kill about 400 deltaV. That part wasn\u0027t a huge deal, because I could just rotate the whole thing slowly to make sure I didn\u0027t build up a negative vertical velocity, keeping both vehicles above 30,000 meters. But once detached, I needed to get my refuelling vehicle back to orbit as soon as possible, since I needed to have it dock with the return vehicle to refuel it. But if ignored the lander while getting the refuelling vehicle back into a stable orbit, which would take another couple of minutes, the lander would of course crash into the ground. So while getting the refuelling vehicle back into orbit, I had to kill the engines, switch to the lander to kill the vertical velocity it had built up, and then switch back. Once the refueller was back in a stable orbit, I switched back to my lander for the last time to complete its decent. The only problem, was I had overshot my landing site. Thankfully by not too much, and I just burned into the appropriate direction, and headed over to the unmanned lander that I had landed the previous day (and a few months previously game time), and successfully touched down beside it. Heck, I nearly landed on the thing. Oh and ya, did I mention I was doing this all in the dark \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E? Originally, I wanted to land on the day side, but the first time the lander\u0027s orbit crossed the probe\u0027s landing site, it had just become night time, so I decided to make the long wait until the next time the orbit crossed the landing site, thinking that one would be in the day time. The problem was, because of Moho\u0027s quick rotation around Kerbol, the second crossing was still on the night side. Getting up on to the unmanned lander to collect all the science also proved interestingly since I didn\u0027t put a ladder on the thing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E. Using RCS to hover up beside the science instruments is WAY harder on Moho then it is on the Mun or Minmus. I fear I may have given Genedred a bit of a headache bumping into everything on the probe until I realized there was a part I could just stand on and collect everything with ease. I was also right about the lander not having enough deltaV on its own for landing and getting back into orbit again. Even using the refueller to kill a bunch of the lander\u0027s orbital velocity, I have JUST the right amount of fuel left to get back into orbit. Unlike my landing, I\u0027m going to have to have a perfect ascent or Jeb and Genedred are going to end up learning about lithobraking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter I go all the science into the lander, I switched back to the refueller, had it burn prograde at one of the intersecting nodes between it and the return vehicle, at apsis, which now was also the oppossing node, matched inclination with the return vehicle, and then returned to a circular orbit. After that, it was a pretty standard intercept to the return vehicle. When I came up to the return vehicle, I parked near it, and switched to the return vehicle. The return vehicle only had one docking port, which at the time was tied up with a science lab, that didn\u0027t have an extra docking port, so I needed to undock with the lab, dock with refueller, then return to the lab. Easy enough, between playing Orbiter for years and now playing KSP, I had done tons of dockings. This is when I discovered the apparently infamous \u0022docking bug\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s where I\u0027m sitting now, with Bill staring out the window of his command module as a glorified gas tank with the fuel he needs to get himself, Jebediah, and Genedred home, just a couple of dozen meters away, and he can\u0027t dock to it. I didn\u0027t have time yesterday to go correct the save file, reload, and continue, so I\u0027ll have to get back to it later. I\u0027m also going to have to take some screenshots, darkside of Moho not withstanding.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoPanShabuShabu","CreatedById":91327,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T06:27:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s now a place on Eve called \u0022Jeb\u0027s ford.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oH248yq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022oH248yq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot recommended for long distances.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadpangod3","CreatedById":58339,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T06:56:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Espent the majority of the day fighting planets and moons so that they work properly, got sucked into nullspace several times, got nom\u0027d by the kraken, struck a few mountains, raged at my color map edit not showing up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Duke23","CreatedById":96591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T07:04:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter lots of cussing, redesigning, and relaunching...

Wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t planning on doing anything more than rough concept and design testing because I could only play for about 30-40 minutes.\u003Cp\u003ETurns out you can put together a perfectly functional drop-pod in that time. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, pretty happy with that: a drop-pod designed for a very fast, high-G entry which uses no parachutes at all, relying solely on separatron retrorockets to slow down at the last second and which reliably gets kerbals alive and well from orbit to the surface of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFun fact: I can only get it to work from IVA view because you need to hit the retrorockets at EXACTLY 200 meters above ground level, and the radar altimeter in the cockpit view is perfect for that. So the drop pod is designed to hurl your kerbal at the ground at ludicrous speeds with a suicide burn at just the last 200m and the only way to (reliably) survive \u003Cem\u003Eis to operate it from the pilot seat\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the name, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m still doubting between ODSK (Orbital Drop of Silly/Screaming Kerbals) pods or STEWD (Screaming The Entire Way Down) pods. Maybe SCREWD (Screaming, Crying or Raging the Entire Way Down) pods?

Afterwards Bob, Calbas and Kirlas left both, lander and orbital station behind and returned to Kerbin. When checking the results I realized that I missed some of the possible reports, simply because I forgot to get crew reports from some of the biomes. Nevertheless, the whole mission yielded 6428.4 science points - enough to unlock all remaining items in the tech tree. So, no need to worry about the missed science. If I ever want to land on the Mun again, there is now a perfectly working science lab with a working lander docked to it and enough fuel for at least two landings waiting in munar orbit.
