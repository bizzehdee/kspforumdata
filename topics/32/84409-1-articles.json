Only two VASIMR-powered Sagittarii have flown so far; one is landed at Minmus with a nearly full fuel tank, while the other is on the surface of Vall, probably without enough fuel to return home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFornax- Named for the constellation of The Furnace. Fornax was my first serious launch vehicle and landing craft when I first started playing back in .19, and made my first landings on Minmus and the Mun, as well as serving as the Vela-dockable lander for my first excursions to Duna, Ike, Eve, and Gilly. By the time I figured out how to go to Dres or further, the old Fornax program had been replaced by the newer, but still very similar, Aquarius lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArgus- Using the Vela launch vehicle and the majority of the same transit-vehicle spaceframe, the Argus program launched a very large and complex (at least by my standards) station, Argus One, into Kerbin orbit back in 0.22.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUp Goer- Crap rockets that didn\u0027t start seriously but turned out to be interesting enough to save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ESpaceplanes\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESagitta- Included my first planes to get off the ground in the stock .19 game. Mostly were single-engine canard-configuration aircraft which eventually were fitted with parachute drop-probes to investigate the ocean and outlying islands near KSC. The name Sagitta is still sometimes used for small SSTOs in my current game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVolans- My first serious spaceplane project and the first to launch an SSTO into low Kerbin orbit in my first save. The first iterations were nothing more than beefed-up Aeris 4A ripoffs, but the latest versions included massive KSPI nuclear-powered behemoths.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStormsprit- By far my largest spaceplane program, Stormsprit began with a VTOL fighter project before being repurposed into designing long-range SSTOs. All-stock Stormsprits have made visits to Eve and the Mun, and have landed on Duna, Minmus, and Gilly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKestrel- The Kestrel project made SSTOs that were designed not only to get to orbit, but to get there fast. They had higher TWRs than anything I\u0027d built previously, and typically attained speeds in excess of 2 kilometers per second before rocket handover. Kestrels had enough delta-V to make it to Minmus and back, but anything much further was essentially out of the question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I haven\u0027t come up with many other names to use since then, so there we have it. All my new stuff is just recyclings of names I\u0027ve used for a long time. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commissioner Tadpole","CreatedById":91993,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-13T00:51:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI name my programs after planets, whether they\u0027re stock or not.
