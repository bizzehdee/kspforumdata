Multiple, in-fact. You can outright sell them for profit...granted, it\u0027s just small change, but getting money back from a game you enjoy can\u0027t be bad. You can also use them to make the little badges, which increase your chances of getting booster packs via some convoluted raffle system, which will inherently increase your steam account\u0027s profitability(though still by a marginal degree)...and some people just make certain badges just as a mark of pride, to say that they have it because they like that game the most or whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s undoubtedly other reasons people might benefit from steam trading cards, but those are the most prominent reasons my feeble mind could think of \u0026gt;_\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I don\u0027t have those cards, i don\u0027t think.
