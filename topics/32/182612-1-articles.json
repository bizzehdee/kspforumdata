However, in the original ksp loading\u00A0\u00A0thread, the sensible consensus seems to have been reached that if you want to use it, fine, otherwise, you can ignore it. Though I would not really care about it, it does have some appeal (mun base without killer part count), and, if ksp on consoles is to succeed at selling more copies, it has to offer something novel, and I have no problem with the devs trying to do that. At the same time, I will withhold \u00A0 \u00A0judgement until the update actually is released.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-07T08:59:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeems like its giving console players a taste of the Alien Space programs mods...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed632956397\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/175079-131-161-kopernicus-alien-space-programs-re-visited-v163-03-feb-2019/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:228px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no problem with it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-09T13:35:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223551379\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022182612\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221551685303\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022120081\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022purpleivan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/4/2019 at 4:41 AM, purpleivan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know anything about a Mun launchsite for the console version, and at first I was thinking what\u0027s the point of that.

Once you\u0027ve flown it to the planet of you choice, you then can connect to it (it has some docking ports ready for expansion) and anything else you want (accomodation, fuel storage, power, additional \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E etc.).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce in place, the base hub\u0027s launch pad can be placed anywhere not occupied by other parts, up to a maximum distance (say 100m) of the hub.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith this done the player can then use the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E gear to produce materials for parts and then manufacture them, following the same flow as the creation of fuel.
