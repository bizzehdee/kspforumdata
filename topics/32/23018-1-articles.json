I\u0027m sure Squad wouldn\u0027t object. I had posted screenshot evidence that I owned KSP back in March, which is now gone... Anyways, I think there really should be a sticky of the old (free) versions of KSP that can be downloaded. If you\u0027re reading this and are a dev, I really do want to know: Do you have all the versions of KSP on your Hard Drive?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Qumefox","CreatedById":43197,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T06:27:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost versions up to 13.3 (where it split between demo/paid versions) are in this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24858-Old-versions-of-KSP-%28some-versions-still-wanted%21%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24858-Old-versions-of-KSP-%28some-versions-still-wanted%21%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it\u0027s unlikely you\u0027ll find anyone willing to just post versions after 13.3, since those were paid versions.. even if they\u0027re old now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kacperrutka26","CreatedById":18849,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T10:42:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Qumefox said, you can only get versions before .13.3 in the OLD versions thread. Other ones you cannot get yet and people can\u0027t publish them because those are the pain ones. But in the future the devs said they would make a KSP collection where you get all of the old versions. (I think if it\u0027s wrong just correct me)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
