It was very Kerbal - cute and funny, and I hope they bring it back. \n\nIn the mean time, can someone link the Imgur album with the barn complex images?

Tier 3 is so big and developed, but Tier 2 has that industrial \u0022we\u0027re a successful but young space agency\u0022 feel to it.\n\nAs for the barn, I don\u0027t feel it\u0027s necessary.

The one that looked like being clicked together in half a day from a five year old assets library?\n\nI think it\u0027s rather that people want *a* barn.\nTimber makes sense for the main building, you don\u0027t see too many metal barns at least not where I\u0027ve been.\n\nI think the hard thing to get right with tier 0 - and for that matter *all* the tiers - is the other facilities. VAB is easy, it\u0027s the biggest thing at the space centre. Launchpad and runway are trivial. SPH is pretty easy, just make something that looks like an aircraft hangar. Tracking station isn\u0027t too hard, though I might complement the telescope with a tall mast carrying some radio antennae, along the lines of a typical ham radio setup like [http://www.ko4bb.com/ham_radio/Pumkin_Tower-2.jpg](http://www.ko4bb.com/ham_radio/Pumkin_Tower-2.jpg)\n\nBut distinguishing R\u0026D, Mission Control, the Astronaut complex, and the Admin Building, that\u0027s where the designers need to do their work. Some very rough ideas from myself:\n\nMission Control - The only \u0022fortified\u0022 building, clearly protected from explosions so controllers could be there during launches.\n\nR\u0026D - I think the best thing would be some sort of obvious testing equipment outside. Not sure what, a rocket sled track might do the trick. And perhaps it would be better if R\u0026D had the telescope (the higher levels do) and the tracking station was just a few radio masts?\n\nAstronaut Complex - If this were the \\*only\\* facility using caravans, instead of them being all over the place, it might stand out more as the place people live. And maybe have a ping-pong table outside. Do Kerbals play ping pong?\n\nAdmin Building - I\u0027m kinda stumped."},{"CreatedByName":"FlowerChild","CreatedById":74289,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T19:40:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I think it\u0027s rather that people want *a* barn.\n\nYup. For those that play a lot of career, there\u0027s a noticeable big gaping hole in the building progression where the barn was obviously supposed to go.\n\nIf you take a look at stuff like the launch mass limit and part count upgrades, they jump from tight to almost immediate irrelevance in no time, indicating there\u0027s a level(s) missing there. Internally, the building upgrade system even recognizes more levels than we currently have and has values defined for them. \n\nI personally don\u0027t care what they look like, I\u0027d just really like to see that progression be more fleshed out (as it was intended to be) from a gameplay perspective."}]}
