But hey, i got this really nice approximation for the mun! You don\u0027t even need to know where your orbit is going after that, the mun it is!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBad timing i suppose, my launch window just so happened to intersect with the mun\u0027s orbit. But really? Why does the rest of my orbit disappear from the mapview when i pass by another body?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I delay my transfer burn a couple of days untill the moon passes, making my transfer burn a whole lot less efficient in the process...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI finally get my orbit somewhere close to duna and I\u0027m on my way. When I leave kerbin\u0027s gravity well I go back to the map view so i can finetune for a duna approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eksp: Oh hey, it\u0027s you again! Trying to get to Duna huh? I can give you a nice intersect with Ike.

Or at least, that\u0027s what i thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eme: approaching duna\u0027s gravity well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eksp: Oh hey, remember when I told you that you were going to get within 10km from duna\u0027s surface? About that... I miscalculated and you\u0027re going to miss it by about 2000km. Good luck though!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, just need adjust my orbit a bit. Lucky me for bringing along enough fuel. But it does raise a question: why are the predicted orbits so far from the actual orbits? I\u0027ve noticed this more, the game says i\u0027ll graze the planet at, say, 15km but when the game actually transfers me from one area of influence to another it\u0027ll suddenly give me a massively different orbit. Why?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eok, ok. I got this. Orbit adjusted, I\u0027ll now enter the atmosphere and do some aerobreaking to get into a captured orbit.
