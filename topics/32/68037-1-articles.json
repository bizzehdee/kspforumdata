Another of my little curiosity\u0027s is putting a ring of the same battery type around a docking port if the docking port is right on top of the craft. Along those lines of illogical slander I never launch a rocket if the Mun is more then half way across the sky, along with that I never land a rover on the borderline between the sunlight and the shade on the Mun.
