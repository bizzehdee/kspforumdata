The difference is that now a copy of the parts that were moved are left behind and they weren\u0027t before 0.21. I might be wrong, but I just want to make sure I didn\u0027t miss a notice about an intended change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t done a lot of scenario testing with this, but I can consistently reproduce this by detaching a part from my ship and dropping the newly detached part somewhere to the side. Then I press CTRL \u002B z and the detached part becomes reattached to the ship, but a copy of the part is left where I dropped it. If memory serves, the part used to reattach, but the a copy would not be left behind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone remember this behaving differently before 0.21?
