The devs have something that other game developers can only dream: a real feedback of exactly how easy or dificult the game is. And in this point even regex agrees that, if you do not limit yourself ( either by ignorance or via roleplay ) , the current ( science gathering ) game is probably too easy ...\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, my point is: first we balance the game difficulty in a way that , as it comes out of the box, 50% of the players find it easy and the other 50% find it hard. \u003Cstrong\u003EThen\u003C/strong\u003E you add options to make it easier or harder to the players taste if you fancy.

No matter how you adjust the prices and make things harder, one of two things will happen: you gain money with each launch because your rocket designs are good, and after a while you have effectively unlimited money. Or, you lose money with every launch, and soon you will be bankrupt. To balance the game right in the middle is extremely difficult without an external source to add or remove money based on how much you have (e.g. dynamic difficulty). One great example I have in mind is the game Papers, Please. If you do poorly in that game, your family will starve, but if some of them die, it makes the game easier (fewer mouths to feed). It punishes the player with guilt, but adjusts to their skill level so that the game goes on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor KSP, you essentially need other ways to spend or receive money that\u0027s not related to launching spaceships and doing contracts. The administration building is a good step to doing that, but I wonder what else can be done (basically more sources of income, and more places to spend your money). You want to reward players for making money (but not reward them with even more money), and punish players for being inefficient (but not by further reducing the money they get), and then push both types of players toward the middle of the spectrum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-04T02:09:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wasn\u0027t quite as quick as tater, but not that slow either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuborbital within a few launches, orbital a launch or two after that, off to the Mun shortly afterwards.
