Similarly, with the ability to mine for resources comes a decreased desire to fix the issues with xenon; as xenon is really for the high dVs, but mining can also increase dVs, xenon may end up being abandoned in favour of supporting and expanding mining.

Just because you won\u0027t use something, doesn\u0027t mean it should be removed from the game. OTOH, if the game practically requires you (out of game balance, for example) to use something that you dislike, then it actually can make the whole game go sour for that person. For example, if Squad included a planet with gravity so crushing that I had to use an overpowered part that I disliked for personal reasons, like \u0022oh, this is an ion engine but it\u0027s TWR is 4,000,000 and warps spacetime!\u0022 then I\u0027d probably actually enjoy KSP less (just personal preference, guys).\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The community\u0027s increasing obsession with \u0027cheating\u0027 in a sigleplayer game makes me want to smash my head on the table.
