One very simple design was promising so I decided to modify it slightly for more fuel capacity and give it a payload.

Well when I examined the station I realized I didn\u0027t put any Clampotron Jr\u0027s on it, which the SSTO would use to save weight and drag. So its first true mission was born out of necessity -- bring up a module that would add a single Clampotron Jr so it could refuel once it made the rendezvous.

Well I got the ports as close as possible, the shuttle below the orange tank close enough to reach out and touch it, and still a significant vertical distance between them... Then fired off the decoupler that the module was attached to. I just KNEW I overshot and it was going to go hurdling through space or blow something up, but the magnetic force caught it just at the right time and it swung around for a few seconds before snapping on and knocking everything out of balance, but I didn\u0027t care about that.

It was manageable to a point but the lower we got the worse it was and trim wasn\u0027t helping. suddenly all control was lost, the plane stalled and went into a flat spin and started careening for the mountain at a lousy ~180m/s, like an insult. We thought it was over. Mission control held their breath, Anfield was cursing the kraken. But then everything just tightened back up and he was able to regain control, sort of. He transferred fuel forward as fast as possible and lit up the engines to plan for a controlled crash in the foothills... But you know what? Screw that. We were going to land at KSC from orbit for the first time, even if we had to cheat a little.

Of course, getting them back will be another matter... The mk2 lander can (plus some small rocketry attached to it) and the kethane factory both separated from the main rocket during descent (as intended) and survived intact. The whole landing zone is about 50m spread apart, and everything went so well... apart from the main rocket. It tipped over after it touched down at a gentle 10m/s, nearly destroying the kethane factory as it went. I did lose a lot of exterior equipment during the rather violent descent. Such as the proper landing gear for my main rocket (only the auxillary survived) and several toolboxes with what turned out to be rather vital KAS gear.
