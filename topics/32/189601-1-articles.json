I\u0027m a bit of an old school\u00A0gamer by now. Let\u0027s say that the journey from the Commodore 64 to what is possible nowadays, what KSP is nowadays has been quite the experience. I remember being proud of putting 110 hours into Final Fantasy VII when it came out. I don\u0027t even know anymore, nor does it matter to me how many hours I\u0027ve logged on KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd even after starting over a few dozen times,\u00A0after playthroughs\u00A0that took\u00A0many many hundreds of hours, KSP still\u00A0manages to completely draw me in.\u00A0It just keeps ticking every great-game-box in my experience and never becomes dull. After more that 3 years of playing, I still want to do so much in the Kerbal Universe.\u00A0I never had such a\u00A0strong gaming experience that is lasting for years allready! I\u0027ve started calling KSP a hobby instead of a game...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wonder how other long term players experience KSP after logging so many hours that keeping up with it doesn\u0027t really matter anymore.
