On the server though a log file starts to get created detailing the movements of the players ship throughout the time warp but other players ONLY see the ship in the location it was at at actual server time. Other connected players would see the normal orbit of the other ship as a solid line, but at the point the warping player starts to warp, the line becomes a dotted line representing their warped journey as it will happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the warping player finishes playing and goes back to the mission list, they see the normal server time so their ship would look like it\u0027s not moved but the mission log shows the their missions is warped and not yet current to server time.

What I propose is a limited kind of multiplayer (even limited number only, say max of 8 players), wherein ALL participants agree that they are headed to ONE body or in the VICINITY of one common body (i.e. 8 players all going to Duna/Ike). So with this, anyone going \u0022out of range\u0022 of an accepted radius from one another is considered to be \u0022KIA\u0022...everyone must be in close proximity so that all the complex physics doesn\u0027t have to go awry because someone else is doing something completely different from someone else. This way, the \u0022warp window\u0022 methodology CAN work--additionally, if the maneuvers require an insane amount of physics, then it is also a GIVEN that the players do that activity ONE at A TIME--i.e. all of them arrived in Duna successfully, and are in orbit, but when they all deorbit at once, the physics of atmospheric friction and so on will hamper the across-the-board sharing of data...so to make this work, it will be a prior agreement that each vessel or \u0022mission sub-entity\u0022 will de-orbit from LDO one by one...once landed, that data point (landing spot) is already static, so there will be no data-sharing issues (you will just share the coordinates of the landing spot across the board).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T12:23:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only way I think multiplayer would work is if you allowed people to control individual Kerbals when doing a landing mission.

The lobby will have a map display that looks a lot like the Tracking Station, showing who is on that particular game/server, and doing what. So you start at the KSC \u003Cstrong\u003Eor\u003C/strong\u003E you can begin someplace else, such as an empty vessel docked with another vessel being controlled by a real person, orbiting Jool. So, once that happens, the only true \u0022real-time\u0022 thing going on, from the vantage point of the two players, is \u003Cem\u003Etheir current situation\u003C/em\u003E--all other situations are merely \u0022abstract\u0022 events going on someplace else in the Kerbol system. So these two players who are in \u0022real time\u0022, they are the ones who are, in effect, \u0022bound\u0022 to do things together. Like, the \u0022warp lock\u0022 I mentioned before in my earlier posts, will be applicable here. But what about cases wherein they are docked? Simple--someone will be elected to become the \u0022commander\u0022 and that person can control warp at his/her whim, considering that the two spacecraft are functioning as one at that particular moment. The other player\u0027s controls are \u0022frozen\u0022 whenever someone is active as a \u0022commander\u0022...once they finish re-entry into say, Laythe, ship has landed, if someone wants to driver a rover, then the real-time multiplayer, individual Kerbal can be controlled mode is once again active, and the two players can go about doing their stuff...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nicoli","CreatedById":68993,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T13:47:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think that there would be too much trouble with deorbiting stuff as I doubt people would really be playing \u0022open\u0022 multiplayer. If one of the guys I would be playing with deorbited a station I would drive over and smack him a few times. Even with that you could simply add the ability to \u0022lock\u0022 a mission in a stable orbit. A locked part would be on the same rail system that the planets and possibly limit or exclude any interaction for it. As for time warping could you not do it by doing the slowest speed in what SOI you are in?I mean does it really matter if someone is doing x100 mapping Ike if your trying to land on Mun? The only issues for I see is solar system level time warp and that is something that could easily be handled by the slowest speed selected. With the exception of ION engines most of my looking at the suns SOI is at max time warp. Make the Solar system have it own special Time warp so that you can speed it up to reach a proper transfer window with out messing with the time warp of the SOI that you are currently in.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dharak1","CreatedById":61137,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T14:13:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think a voting system is best, you propose a warp and amount of time for warp and the server checks if everyone is eligible for warp (not moving, in any stable orbit or prelaunch) then starts a vote if everyone agrees there it goes!

The idea of phased events in multiplayer games isn\u0027t unusual and could work quite well here. The addition of the dotted line style indicator for other players would also serve to guide other players with what missions are in progress and how they might be able to contribute to a server wide cooperative goal if the game were to go that direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still would think that the servers would have to be limited to few players (\u0026lt; 8) because there would have to be a way for the server to catch up and aside from all players agreeing to accelerate server time I\u0027m not sure how that would have to be configured. Without a catch up mechanism the server would accumulate large numbers of accelerated missions that the server time wouldn\u0027t be able to keep up with. There needs to be a way to keep missions mostly on the same page.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think before multiplayer would make much sense though we need more objectives to strive for. Mostly now we have personal challenges. If we had more reasons to build space stations, moon bases, or interplanetary ships there would be more incentive for cooperative multiplayer.
