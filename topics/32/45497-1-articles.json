Its lighter weight and lower fuel requirement compared to a rack of 24-77s caused a trickle-down effect of mass reduction compared to the 0.20. This allowed a lighter CSM, which in turn allowed the use of a Skipper on the third stage because the second and first now had so much less payload mass to lift off of Kerbin\u0027s surface.

While I can\u0027t argue against what you said, if I use a more efficient engine I don\u0027t need to bring as much fuel in the first place, making my entire craft lighter along with any craft that propelled said craft previously, like a launcher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not a pro, but I can\u0027t think of a situation where I would want my TWR to increase over a burn. Maybe a dedicated landing stage that would be dropped before ascending back to orbit. Even then I think a better engineered lander using more efficient engines would require you to use less fuel to achieve the same goal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy most efficient asparagus launchers have decreasing TWR as I stage. I use greater delta-V to reach orbit, but I use less fuel because I\u0027m burning more efficient engines for a longer time. In the end, my long burns use less fuel than an inefficient engine that changes delta-V quickly. What am I missing here?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
