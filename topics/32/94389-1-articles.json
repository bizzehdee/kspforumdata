Ridiculous if you ask me. Sometimes when I\u0027m just puttzing around with the game I want to do for instance, a science mission to Duna! But that isn\u0027t possible in a standard Sandbox. Performing the experiments just tells you that you don\u0027t need to do this...

Hell, just keep expanding the custom game settings they have implemented for Careers now.
