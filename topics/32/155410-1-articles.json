Your lander is unable to connect to the HG-5 relay. You would need an external antenna on your lander and you will need a connection to Kerbin to hop the signal using HG-5s. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:9px;\u0022\u003E(which you seem to have between your relay and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrying to relay signal from HG-5 to HG-5 will only work for rather short distances.
