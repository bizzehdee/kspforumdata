Not sure its been awhile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for why that rockets not reaching orbit is simple. Its too complex. I would lose the third stage entirely. Stretch the first as much as you can given your TWR. Then have that smaller engine ( the LV909 I believe ) on the second and stretch that as well. You only need a .8 TWR on an upper stage. Try without fins. There heavy. Reaction wheel torque should be enough. And if your having trouble with a low TWR on the first stage ( especially if you stretch it ) don\u0027t hesitate to use radial SRB\u0027s in a sustainer configuration. Where as the first stage doesn\u0027t have enough TWR until after the SRBs burn out and its burned enough fuel to be light enough. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo TL:DR just a little bit of a larger rocket is needed. Just a little. Converting that to a sustainer shouldn\u0027t be to much extra cash.
