Pondering what kind of orbit to give it, I got to wondering: given the relative (ridiculous) densities of the two, what would be a \u0022realistic\u0022 Roche limit between them? Using the old Kerbal stand by that everything is one tenth \u0022real life,\u0022 I figured somewhere between 1000 \u0026amp; 1800 km. Anything more involved than that makes my brain hurt, but I\u0027m betting there are some folks around here who could give me a ridiculously accurate number AND actually enjoy coming up with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kermunist","CreatedById":63745,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T15:49:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Roche limit is given by:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/f/d/7fd4933586359cfcb4df953d279e5ff6.png\u0022 alt=\u00227fd4933586359cfcb4df953d279e5ff6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERM = radius of planet = 600 000m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EpM = density of the planet = 58\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0484.791 kg/m3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epm = density of the moon = 13\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0496.490 kg/m3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(numbers from wiki)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso the roche limit d is 2 390 000 meters, or 2 390km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the point at which loose rubble will start being lifted from the surface of gilly.

At the Roche limit, the SOI size would be the same size as the moon. Within the Roche limit, the moon has no SOI and ships landed on it will gradually float away -- as they should (albeit probably quicker than they should).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-12T15:53:51Z\u0022 title=\u002207/12/2013 03:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kermunist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T17:06:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting....
