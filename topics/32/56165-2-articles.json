Getting into orbit, rendezvous and docking, and landing on other worlds were all great and enjoyable experiences. But after that, exploration was what I enjoyed most. Hunting down easter eggs provided hours and hours of fun. It seemed there was a story in mind at the time with easter eggs, along with the history of the games development. These things were interesting. Resource mining with kethane also provided hours of enjoyment for me, because it also gave me a sense of exploration and achievement. I feel like development has stagnated and lost direction at this point however. I hope the threads popping up today regarding resources serve as a wake up call. I want to see HarvesteR and his team get back on track and have a happy ending to the story that they began with the easter eggs. For me, resources are important, but not nearly as important as having new things to explore. Multiplayer is not a big draw for me.

But maybe in 0.24, we get plane parts, or more rocket engines, or 3.75m stuff. Maybe we get resources. Maybe we get planets. Maybe a new solar system to explore. Or maybe we get something no one ever thought of, but ends up being epic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FITorion","CreatedById":7606,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T07:21:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Landwalker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Landwalker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI feel like I\u0027ve missed some significant announcement about resources... which isn\u0027t surprising, since I don\u0027t follow all of the seemingly infinite outlets of information related to KSP.

I got to thinking about what resources are to me. Many think that it is about exploitation, going to another planet and stripping it bare. But I think resources are something different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me the ultimate goal of a space program is to get people, many people onto another planet to become a self sufficient colony. But while this is the long term, in the short term it is about resources. Air, Water, Food, Waste, construction, and people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me resources are about getting Kerbals that are not astronauts onto a planet. Getting habitats there for the people. Finding the water they need, growing the food they need, and balancing their needs with what can in time be provided. To me it is more like the path you take in an RTS then it is Minecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe benefit to this would be you do not have to monotonously tend to everything. There can be contracts by companies to send additional goods to a colony. And research can be expanded and done by the people there. You do not need to know or manage every kerbal, just give orders and help them grow and do better. And there can be events and tragedies, damage to a habitat could mean an emergency mission with a rough deadline. But doing it is a sense of accomplishment that is far more rewarding then just collecting 50 tons of ore from the Mun to build that next rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the system I would like to see...make mining abstract and keep it about managing an ever growing space program.
