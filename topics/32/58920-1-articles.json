Powergaming. Using all sorts of OOG tools to make perfect every launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Mods - Not all mods. Just ones that can make things simpler. Mostly the large boosters and engines really....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo solve this, I really play only vanilla, I used to have stuff like the Bobcat rovers, and fairings, but the clutter in science sorta took away and now make the similar out of Vanilla. This is especially handy during career play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI try to make a real mission out of everything. Usually my crafts are more complex because of the roleplay. There is no option to quicksave and no editing of files. Not using any calculators enhances in the fact that I need to actually experiment with every launch. Starting from the manned early missions, then getting probes to launch test flights and scouting planetary systems. I even purposefully pushed the atmos and altitudes from my mind, and run a test to see where I should come in for atmo braking with probes. To add to the challenge, for me to consider the test, I must also land the probe and deploy a communication report.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter determining what the planet is like, I then will launch the manned mission. Now, there are no overly advanced satellites in my parts, so instead, the exploration craft carry a scout probe with them. These are designed to be able to scout a surface area of any planned body to pick a suitable landing area for any lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy self challenging doesnt end there however. I also dislike wierd and infeasable rockets. Stuff like my interplanetaries. Sure, I could design and launch them all at once with some extremely wierd setup, but hey, if cost was an issue that wouldn\u0027t work. Instead, I send up my ships in sections and assemble them in atmosphere. All my boosters have to be designed to be recoverable, and I do. Instead of 20 boosters, I might have four, that I re-use multiple times. In roleplay. It helps keep me from making all my interplanetaries right quick. It takes a while to assemble the ship, and then once in space, I made the design reusable. I can replace the lander section, then refuel or replace the engines in space onto a main hub. Once the science tree came out, this was even more fun! Now I return the science vessel, and I make upgrades to the ship. Send down the old nuke engines that are a bit wobbly to replace with the bigger tanks and better engines! Mwa ha ha!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe free cost on parts is probably the biggest killer for fun since it is easy to make overly expensive rockets and have a ton of fail missions. Is like playing a game with god mode. You do it all really fast and burn out. Plan some limiters, take a break, and will be like a whole new game. In fact, I still havent maxed the science tree since it\u0027s release because my missions are such a challenge, combined with flying by the seat of my pants, that one interplanetary can take a week or more to complete! Sure, it is slow, but now getting there is 90% of the fun!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T07:58:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI currently have one mod: Kethane.
