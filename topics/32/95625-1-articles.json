Not everyone knows what impact their job can have. Preventing costly errors with minimal effort is the key to making high-quality products. And in a sector where you simply cannot afford any errors like aerospace such things are immeasurably important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, exactly because these things seem silly, cost little (but extra) effort and because the effects aren\u0027t noticed until something goes catastrophically wrong, it is extremely hard to consistently get everyone to do them every time.
