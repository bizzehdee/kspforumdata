Send a lab to the Mun or Minmus. That way you can do several landings on either planet without having to do multiple returns to Kerbin.... I will admit it is some time investment to set up a functional space station/science lab in orbit around another celestial body. I\u0027ve barely dabbled in even Kerbin space stations before .23 because they were literally useless to ME... However it is quite feasible and very rewarding ( again to ME ) after you finish. I haven\u0027t finished my tech tree yet but I\u0027m more then half way unlocked across the board, up to the row with Sr. docking ports and Nuclear engines. This is roughly how I\u0027ve progressed so far, with minimal headaches and spaced across the two or three(?) days since release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting out the same I would in .22, I did 2-3 suborbital flights in various directions from KSC to hit as many biomes as possible. I followed this up with a moon flyby. I went for a Minmus flyby next, but as my Minmus flybys usually end up, I found myself with just even fuel at periapsis to turn the flyby into a landing and return. Literally, I landed back at Kerbin with less then 1 unit of fuel in the tank, one of my my proud missions now. Anyways, following that I went for a Moon landing. Now I went for ANOTHER Minmus landing knowing that Minmus now has biomes! Normally around this time I would proceed with a Solar orbit and return. It worked out that when I launched for my Minmus landing it was quite late and I was quite low on give a $*\u0026amp;@. And this far along in my game I had not made a single Kerbin orbit, I had been eyeballing out single burn transfers. Well I screwed up and put Minmus on the wrong side of my takeoff. So I did a solar orbit (just barely leave Kerbin SOI, do your science, and then burn retrograde until you are back home \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E). Upon my return to Kerbin SOI, I had already set my Kerbin periaps low during my \u0022injection burn\u0022 from solar orbit. But I came very close by Minmus, so I said what they hell and did another Minmus landing as well! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Bear in mind by now I had 400 (and maybe 800) unit 2.5m tanks and a poodle engine unlocked. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter all that was said and done, perhaps before that even, I unlocked everything I needed to start my science lab. But it was kind of intimidating me. I had small mono tanks, I had standard docking ports, lander can, etc etc.. But any space station I\u0027ve done in the pas was with Sr. ports, nuclear engines, 5 way RCS, etc etc.... None the less I figured I may as well give it a shot because I was getting to the point you are at now where science was not coming in fast enough doing a landing and return over and over. So after much tinkering in the VAB this is the system I devised, and put into orbit last night. No landings yet however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Built my LAB module, launched it probe controlled. Basically a lab, with panels and propulsion. Orbited it... I built the lab before I knew what modules I wanted to attach to it so I left it in Kerbin parking orbit for awhile (yay finally kerbin orbit after 5-6 missions!...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Planned and developed 2 \u0022main\u0022 modules for the station. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- A 3 man capsule with a crew cabin. Same barebones style as the lab. Propulsion, panels, mono....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- The Lander! Duh! It has all the science I had available to me and all the fancy gizmos I could fit in....

Going to fire up the game and play a bit before bed after forum lurking a bit more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander IS a manned lander so I will be doing sample returns. I don\u0027t want to transmit them however, which is why I designed the 3man \u002B crew compartment module. I will load that sucker up with dirt from all over Minmus and then ship it back in the shuttle to rendevouz at Kerbin and then return to KSC in a yet-to-be-designed re-entry vehicle. Which will probably be a part of a refueling station which is also yet-to-be-designed. I do have future plans with the station however. Since I waited for reasonable tech levels to build the thing, it SHOULD be re-useable at other planets. I\u0027ve never transferred to another planet from MINMUS orbit before, but I imagine its hella easy!!!!! So once I\u0027ve milked Minmus for all its worth, it will be off to the Joolean system, or Ike or Gilly or something Minmus-alike. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomewhere during my mess of missions and before building my station, I to did a Duna landing. It was a probe mission with 2 goo\u0027s, 1 materials, and a thermo and atmo detector. Now, compared to 0.22 mission, you are right. It was USELESS! But not really... 400 something science if I recall correctly. I built the goo canisters and materials bay into the injection module so I did those experiments around 8km altitude during aerobraking and then ditched that garbage after promptly transmitting. The thermo and atmo detector are reuseable so I \u0022spammed\u0022 that as much as the game would allow, whizzing over the planet above orbital velocity. I captured and landed over the north pole and did my last science transmission there. The fun part of this mission (seriously the only fun part too, I hate interplanetary burns......) was desposing of the probe lander after it was done. It fell on its side during landing, so I tried taking off up the hill it tipped on. Needless to say it never got more then 5m off the ground, but it flipped around lie a bucking bronco for a good minute (40 some fuel on 2 ant engines). I managed to bury the nose into the ground like in that background splash screen from the games Menu (Mun or bust). I got a screenshot I may upload later, probably not though \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E. It was really cool. It is literally buried nose first and can\u0027t move anymore since it somehow clipped into the planet. That and the battery died since the solar panels broke *didnt fall off though!*. I gotta brag here a bit as well... This Duna mission was no exception to my no Kerbin orbits \u0027rule\u0027. It was the first time I eyeballed the phase angle or whatever the technical term is, by doing timewarp on the launch pad. And indeed I blasted off and rendevouzed with Duna in ONE BURN from Kerbin for the first time ever! Any other planet for that matter. Now THAT felt good \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E It was 27,000km separation but it was something like a single 10dV correction burn to drop periapsis under 10km. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe intent of my post is just to say I think science progression is just right now, nearly \u0027perfect\u0027 in my opinion. The game actually has a nice pace to it now and incentivizes building space stations and other engineering marvels. And the engineering is where I find the most nerdy gleeful joy. Sure it could be better I suppose... But its good enough for me. If anything they should just make careers more player defined in the next update to sort all of these problems out. Difficulty levels if you will. Let the player decide how much transmissions are worth, how many times they can be done, how much science you start with, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully this was a coherent post.
