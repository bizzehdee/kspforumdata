It might help support your question too.\n\nSomething just struck me about realism. For the new aerodynamics and the old FAR, does the [Whitcomb area rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_rule) apply for this level of simulation?"},{"CreatedByName":"woosy","CreatedById":142025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T14:56:22Z","Content":"No. I tried the stock plane D45, take off, then keep it flying at about 200m, maximum throttle. After reaching 800m/s at about sea level(already insane), the accelrating is almost unstoppable, when 896m/s hitted, boom. Then I tired to fly higher. 4000m, 896, boom; 19000m, 900\u002B,boom.

Dedicated flight sims can work on one specific airframe and have it working like its real counterpart. Since KSP is about being as creative as you can, you can\u0027t expect the same level of accuracy, especially if the system is based on part stats (a more viable approach would be what nuFAR is doing, making its calculations based on the whole fuselage). \n\nBut as far as I\u0027m concerned Squad has done an amazing job on the new modeling. Being able to actually stall is a huge improvement (Well if I thought I\u0027d ever say that sentence...)."},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T15:41:35Z","Content":"The whole \u0022go boom over 900m/s\u0022 problem is actually because the heating system is borked right now.

(well, exactly 3.6/1.852, which would be 1.94).\n\nSo a touchdown at 50 m/s resembles a touchdown at 100 knots, which is quite realistic for a faster aircraft. Fighters or large Jets touch down at 150-160 knots, and a Cessna might get as slow as 40-50 knots.\n\nHowever, the Kerbal Spaceplanes still tend to glide too well IMHO. I guess the wings don\u0027t have induced drag calculated (drag induced by air streaming around the edges of the wings and creating those huge turbulences behind heavy Airliners). That\u0027s the reason planes don\u0027t seem to slow down below 150 m/s very well. There also still seems to be no difference between straight and swept wings.\n\nAnd yes: The low altitude acceleration is \u0022a bit\u0022 exaggerated.\n\nAll in all not bad for a Lego Game."},{"CreatedByName":"Curveball Anders","CreatedById":107529,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T19:09:45Z","Content":"As an old fart with experience from most flight sims from that last 20 years I mainly use one test to judge the \u0027reality\u0027 of a flight model.\n\nAnd it\u0027s \u0027snap roll\u0027.\n\nTake any aircraft close to it\u0027s stall, and step on the rudder.\n\nIf it\u0027s a reasonably realistic model then the sudden yaw will yank the inward wing into a stall, and the aircraft will roll into the yaw.\n\nIf the model is almost good (or you\u0027ve miscalculated the stall), then the aircraft will sideslip and roll against the yaw.\n\nIf the model is bad, the aircraft will just yaw.\n\n(If the model is really bad, the aircraft will yaw, even when parked.)"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T19:12:27Z","Content":"1.
