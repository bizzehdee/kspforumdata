How would you handle collision detection, SOI changes, and any other thing that needs to be actually run through the simulator, if the program is not running? I suppose you could, when the program is started, just run really fast, inaccurate simulations to get to current time, but then I have to ask why would you want that? The only significant thing that this could affect is that you\u0027d end up missing a window due to real life cropping up, and your ship would crash into Jool instead of orbiting Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lincourtl","CreatedById":72218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T02:33:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could have an option to use \u0022frozen\u0022 time (as the game is now), or \u0022liquid\u0022 time saves (the OP\u0027s suggestion).
