For mid size craft (15-25 ton fully loaded range-the one posted is a tad small) nukes are the way to go if you can fit one. Anything 2 jet engines and above should qualify. I flew an aircraft with a nuke stuck to the front, the same way one of the earlier posters had set his up. In this configuration you will likely need an extra engine at the back for the phase immediately after jet engine shutdown, but even then the efficiency gained from nuclear is high enough to offset that wasted mass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a test, I sent up the aforementioned plane. It made it to stable orbit with about 2500 delta-v. The atomic engine was only used in circularization, not the main burn. And I didn\u0027t even jettison the rear rocket engine, so it really could have been more efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor comparison, I flew a very similar plane with the same fuel loading. All I did was remove the nuke, change the rear engine to a single aerospike, and adjusted the aerodynamic surfaces to suit the new CG position. It made it to orbit just fine, and indeed, was a little easier to fly. It had substantially more fuel once in orbit as well. But, it\u0027s calculated delta-v was only 1800. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISP matters. A lot. 800 is clearly superior to 390. As long as the weight of the engine is offset by the overall mass of the spaceship, (and there\u0027s fuel ofc!) efficiency becomes the dominating factor in delta-v calculations. Furthermore, if you refuel a rocket plane, that element of efficiency with the nuclear engine will increase even further. It may be extremely awkward, but if you really need to go far with medium to large spaceplane, a nuke is the way to go!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T04:56:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022M5000\u0022 data-cite=\u0022M5000\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOP, I have no idea how you managed that but I really like your craft, and that idea for space saving...
