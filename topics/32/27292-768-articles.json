Turns out that if you crack open a persistence file, the first word in it is \u0022GAME\u0022; KSP won\u0027t load the thing if all it says is \u0022E\u0022. Did something the other night when I looked through the thing for my ore contract. A quick \u0022GAM\u0022 on the keyboard and I was back in business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo once I got into the game, I tasked myself with returning my two \u003Cem\u003EStratofortress 7a\u003C/em\u003E \u0022atomic bomber\u0022 craft - \u003Cem\u003EEnola Gay\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003EBockscar\u003C/em\u003E - to the Kerbinport space station. The \u003Cem\u003EGay\u003C/em\u003E, holding Cerxie and her tour group coming back from Mun, arrived back at Kerbinport without any major issues; she was able to dock, refuel and swap out tour groups. Cerxie is now on her way to Minmus, where her tour group is scheduled to dock with the Minmusport space station and transfer to the Mun Buggy for a surface excursion for contract. \u003Cem\u003EBockscar\u003C/em\u003E was another story; Jeb and his group of tourists came in a full 100 degrees off the plane of Kerbinport\u0027s orbit, and it took most of the craft\u0027s remaining fuel supply just to realign the orbits. After eight aerobraking passes, Trajectories was predicting the ship would enter atmo for good on its next pass, so I went ahead and circularized. The ship is out of gas now in a 264 x 94 orbit around Kerbin. I plan on sending up a \u003Cem\u003EVulture\u003C/em\u003E flight to rendezvous with and refuel the craft this evening if I have time to play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also finally figured out what was going on with that ore mining contract - you actually have to be present while the ore is harvested in order for it to count, apparently. So I wasted 1200 units of ore by dumping it out of \u003Cem\u003EWildcat\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E storage tanks and let the drill work at filling the tanks back up while I watched in timewarp. This morning I am \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1350,000 richer, which oughta be enough for me to get some refineries up and running at Minmus, and maybe take care of some smaller contracts in the interim.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent plans - aside from the planned \u003Cem\u003EVulture\u003C/em\u003E flight, I want to send a fuel pod to Minmusport so that the refinery module will have a place to put refined fuel as it comes in. Both Munport and Minmusport need refinery modules installed. I still need to tweak the \u003Cem\u003EMagpie 7\u003C/em\u003E ore-delivery plane and put a booster on the \u003Cem\u003EMidas 7\u003C/em\u003E refinery lander. I want to redesign the \u003Cem\u003EProject Peacock 7\u003C/em\u003E craft for interlunar flights; it\u0027s not really designed for that and it\u0027s consistently arriving at the moons with only about 300 m/s of delta-V remaining, which is a low margin for space station rendezvousing. I need to get Theogel from Minmusport back to KSC to round out his rescue contract, and I\u0027ve got three tourists at Kerbinport that need to come back down to finish out their itineraries. Finally, I\u0027m considering a replacement for the \u003Cem\u003EVulture\u003C/em\u003E refueling plane; it\u0027s an excellent design but it does have one drawback - the amount of fuel it delivers, which is equivalent roughly to an X200-16 tank, or enough fuel to refill a \u003Cem\u003EStratofortress\u003C/em\u003E completely in two trips.

(That was an unmanned dress rehearsal)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeantime, I didn\u0027t have the energy to rush things, so I let the boys cruise along in space and did something else. Started work on my new generation of rockets, based on the Mk3 Spaceplane cockpit as command pod. First out was a new moon rocket. I hired some more astronauts, three green girls, and let some old hands take them on their first trips to Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i445.photobucket.com/albums/qq176/Vermil_01/screenshot2061crop.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot2061crop.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, the planets lined up and I figured that Ikaros E, the latest iteration of my trusted Ikaros family of Duna rockets, hadn\u0027t been tested on a live trip yet.
