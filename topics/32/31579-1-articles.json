So I set out to find a mathematical expression for this.

The critical point comes at about 15km; below there, you\u0027ll often need to throttle down to keep your speed at terminal velocity, but above that height the atmosphere thins out enough that terminal velocity starts rising much more quickly than you can possibly accelerate in a rocket. In real life, the critical point is the \u0022max Q\u0022 point, where stresses are maximized and liquid fuel rockets throttle down, but once you\u0027re past that point you can (and should) go max throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you DO like using mods, the Flight Engineer mod (and MechJeb, of course) have readouts that can dynamically tell you the terminal velocity at your current height.

This is usually sufficient to keep me travelling at ~terminal velocity. If I ever go above 200 m/s, I throttle down and try not to gain any more speed. When I reach 10 km, I will pitch over, the amount is dependant on how large of a TWR my rocket has. If it has a large TWR, then I pitch over to 45 degrees and throttle up. If it has a smaller TWR, I will either keep going straight up or turn over slightly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the pitching over, I will switch to map view and check to make sure my time to apoapsis is increasing.
