However, due to the way it is locked (it will face Kerbin but its equator will stay parallel to that of Kerbin, while its orbit is not), libration would make it appear to rotate over the course of its orbit.\n\nFrom Minmus, Kerbin appears to move in the sky, while it does not when seen from the Mun, which is perfectly tidally locked to Kerbin.\n\nAnd here\\\u0027s a short video showing the movement of Kerbin in Minmus\\\u0027 sky:\n\n[http://youtu.be/2a9-Xgf3joo](https://youtu.be/2a9-Xgf3joo)"},{"CreatedByName":"Nooblet68","CreatedById":11784,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-28T18:48:58Z","Content":"This is probably due to Minmus being on a 15\\* tilt with it\\\u0027s orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-28T19:03:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This is probably due to Minmus being on a 15\\* tilt with it\\\u0027s orbit.\n\nI think that was Cykyrios\\\u0027 point... \n\nGreat video!\n\nP.S.

An analemma\\\u0027s shape is defined primarily by the eccentricity and obliquity of the observer\\\u0027s orbit.
