I\u0027ve been making a shuttle like thing that can lift a payload up to orbit and then return and last night (late last night) I managed to get a 7.7 ton payload to a 70km orbit!!

Its wings are in 3 layers (so kind of a tri-plane) which does give it more lift, the single layered wing didn\u0027t cut it and wider wings became ungainly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft (with 7.72ton payload) is 85.5tons. With that payload I can make a 70km orbit and have (just) enough fuel left to de-orbit and fly to the landing strip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mods used are TT\u0027s wheels, KAS, quantum struts and dammed robotics for hinges. It also has the TAC fuel balancer, but that is mostly for observing the fuel levels.

I use it for info (as I don\u0027t use map mode during ascent/circularizing) and the SURF function and that is all. I\u0027m getting RSI from flying planes manually! The SURF just allows a heading and (most importantly) a pitch to be set, but its my choice of heading and pitch, no auto piloting here! The engines, tanks, wings and control surfaces are all stock. Thou I will probably change some tanks for KW or NP tanks now, just to reduce part count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/sWerESa\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sWerESam.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sWerESam.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/jqyWbn3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jqyWbn3m.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jqyWbn3m.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 6 turbo jets engines take it up to about 24km. The second I reach the point of flame out (just shortly after above right pic) I engage the 2 rocket engines and shut down the outer pair of turbo jets. Then the other 4 jets can stay on longer. When they start to flame out the next pair is shut down so it\u0027s on just the rockets and the 2 inner jet engines. Finally when there is no more air the last 2 jet engines are shut down and then its up to the rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting up to speed before firing the rockets is important, I could climb to 24km in less time but be going slower, however that doesn\u0027t work out. I climb steeply (40-45 degrees) to about 18km, then start to level off and pick up speed. I keep adjusting the pitch to climb gradually and gain speed. The speed increase rams more air into the intakes so I can climb higher before firing up the rockets (when doing about 1200m/s) and this seems to be key to getting this flying bus of a craft into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the time my AP is at 70, the PE is about -80 to -100 so it doesn\u0027t take much to circularize the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to release the payload; The cargo bay doors open to reveal the test payload; A small rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/y3rJjgi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/y3rJjgim.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022y3rJjgim.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/krusE1s\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/krusE1sm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022krusE1sm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/YKXcvTX\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YKXcvTXl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YKXcvTXl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb then attaches KAS lines to the payload before it is released (and is generally just Jeb - grinning maniacly at stuff and looking cool)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ig9IqyS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ig9IqySl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ig9IqySl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/fQXUsAx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fQXUsAxm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022fQXUsAxm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/oH7M4fh\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oH7M4fhm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oH7M4fhm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne KAS line is used to hold the payload, the other is for Jeb to grab hold of so he can be (unceremoniously) yanked back to the main ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/I11F7fA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/I11F7fAh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022I11F7fAh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to use this to bring things down from orbit too.

Drag is low at high altitude so wont effect speeds much but it will help you climb the first 15-20km.

I could prob stick more intakes on it, but I wanted to not be too air-hoggy and aesthetics is an important aspect for me. It only has intakes on the front of tanks, without using splitters to double up the numbers. I might add a couple more in but only if I can keep it looking ok. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get around the COG shifting as fuel drains I have quite a protracted network of fuel lines in there which forces the order that the tanks drain. The COG stays pretty level as they drain. I do also have the TAC fuel balancer mod on board, I manly use it to have a overview display of the fuel levels in all tanks, but I can use it to auto balance the fuel or shift it around as I need. When coming in to land and its mostly empty I need to shift the fuel forward to keep the nose down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery interested by your advice re engines. I started out using LV-30s and LV-45s, I also used the BearCat from on of the mods (NovaPunch I think) but I wanted the main frame and drive to be stock. In the end after many attempts the aerospike seemed to be best choice. It was similar on paper to the BearCat, just heavier. No way could I get it to work with the NV-1, but I guess that if I had more intakes and got higher before needing rockets that might work better. It\u0027s just so heavy, even heavier than the aerospike. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll my SAS is near the front and seems to work ok. might try moving it back and seeing if that helps. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, wings!! MOAR wings! I found that to be very true. Was really struggling to get throu the first part of the atmo, then I tripled with wing area by making it more of a tri-plane and it was much better. Might even add some more wings in. Part count is getting a bit high thou. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, thanks again for your advice, I\u0027ll incorporate it into my next one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scottiths\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Scottiths\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EVery nice!
