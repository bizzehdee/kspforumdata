This discussion is no longer relevant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI expect this may be nerfed in a future version, and correct me if I\u0027m mistaken, but with the release of 1.0:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new ore tanks are overpowered. Not because you can refill them by mining (that\u0027s the idea, right?), but because they have a higher fuel fraction than other fuel tanks. This means that it is cheaper (dV-wise) to carry ore than it is LFO (liquid fuel/oxidizer).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOre masses 10kg/unit and LFO masses 5kg per unit. The ISRU converts 1 Ore to 2 LFO, so the mass conversion ratio is 1:1. LFO tanks have a dry fraction of 1/9 (they hold 8kg of fuel for every 1kg of tank), or less for some parts. However, the ore holding tanks have a mass fraction of 1/12 for the small tank and 1/15 for the large tank. In other words, using large tanks you can store ore 67% more efficiently than you can store LFO. The mass of the ISRU and solar panels (or fuel cells), lets round that up to 5t (assuming you didn\u0027t have them already), offsets this a bit. But by the time you want around 200k LFO (100t, along with 12.5t of tank) or more, it is actually lighter to carry that mass in ore along with an ISRU and convert it along the way (carrying just enough of the heavier LFO tanks to hold the fuel before it is burned).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow this has some issues. One requires 1.7 ISRU\u0027s to continuously feed a single LV-N engine. To make the break-even point your *average* (see the next paragraph) acceleration will be around 0.3m/s at best (though it will improve as fuel is spent), or a TWR of 0.03, meaning it will take close to an hour of burning (over 20\u002B orbits, most likely) to transfer to Mun from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis can be offset by having a slightly larger reserve of LFO so that you can convert it slowly and spend it in bursts. Most maneuvers in LKO last 5 minutes or less (beyond this you can\u0027t make Oberth-efficient maneuvers), so stocking ~400 fuel per LV-N should allow this and cost only 0.1t extra per LV-N (you were already paying 0.15t for 200 units of ore tank, so you just pay the difference for the LFO tank). A single ISRU provides enough fuel for at least 18 engine-minutes of LV-N thrust per orbit of Kerbin (and much more at longer, higher orbits), so now you can use 4 (or more) LV-N\u0027s to achieve a modest (but playable, for the patient) burst TWR of 0.2. But remember that you\u0027ll be in shadow for half that time (when in low orbits) so you\u0027ll need extra solar power to compensate (or just use fuel cells, or expect shorter burns until you get to high enough orbits to have enough time to fuel longer ones).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould you do this for every large ship? Not unless you are willing to make long burns. But for fueling stations (or ships that already carry an ISRU), you should store as much fuel as ore possible. Suppose a 200t LFO-only ship has mass ratios 160:20:20 for fuel:tank:misc (where misc is engines, capsules, payload, etc) and a 200t ore-based ship has a ratio of 168:12:25 for ore:tank:misc (misc now includes an ISRU). The ore ship will have 9% more dV for the same payload and TWR while possessing an ISRU (or one could remove fuel to have equal dV while being 12% lighter, offering easier launching and higher TWR).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an added bonus, the ore tanks have a smaller form-factor (the 1500 unit large holding tank holds almost as much fuel as the 3200 unit LFO tank yet is half the size) and ore is basically free (500kg/cred vs 11kg/cred for LFO), though the size and cost of the ISRU and extra power offsets some of this. Also, by cost it is cheaper to convert all your LFO on the pad and recover the ISRU than to buy the fuel in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T22:27:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 10:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by arq\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E1.0.1 update\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Khobai","CreatedById":83366,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T02:07:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI noticed this too.

This is also by design due to the impact of a lossy conversion on other systems. No conservation of mass rules were violated in the creation of this feature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI concur with the assessment that the tank mass should be adjusted to match corresponding LFO tanks (they are all at 89.99 as I recall). At that point, there is no mass benefit, only a resource density benefit (but heavier tanks offset this).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond that - if you wish to make an Ore ship, rock on \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E you will have to pay a tax for the ISRU module and it\u0027s power requirements, but that will be a lot less appealing if the tank mass ratio benefit is removed (see above).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbital and ground based refineries are equally viable because of Ore being mass neutral. Really boils down to playstyle, and I am ok with that (personally I will be doing ground refineries in my own save).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOre is not overly valuable, it was not meant as a funds faucet - it\u0027s cheap as dirt. I expect mods will quickly fill the gap for people looking to use ISRU as funds generation. About the best you could do... in theory... is build a massive mining rig to convert Ore into LF (which is the most profitable of the potential products). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven the work involved, and how far down the tech tree ISRU is, funds are not much of an issue that late in the game.

There\u0027s no way something that does all that is going to only weigh 4 tons. 10-15 tons is far more reasonable even with the consideration that kerbal technology is far more advanced than our own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven from a game balance perspective, ignoring any notions of realism, 4 tons just isnt balanced.
