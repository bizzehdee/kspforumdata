Now 1.0.2 and you make MAJOR changes to the aerodynamics again, and break just about every design again! How about you take a deep breath, make up your mind, design it right, then implement and finally release 1.0.3 with the FINAL (as per 1.0) aerodynamics huh? Please!\n\nThe constant changes in aerodynamics and the NEED to use the likes of NEAR and FAR are only making you look bad, and making me NOT want to play this game, out of the fear of yet another breaking change you\u0027re going to intro next month, so I have to redesign everything again. \n\nI stopped playing after 0.24.2 due to major changes, now I feel like I should wait for 1.1 until you make up your mind.\n\nPlease!"},{"CreatedByName":"boostme","CreatedById":118817,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T12:48:15Z","Content":"Oh stop your whining. Wait for 1.1 if you have to. The recent tweaks is the aerodynamic model really isn\u0027t such a huge deal.

Feature compete means that all the things they wanted to have in the game are present, but does not mean they are refined/balanced etc. \n\nSquad\u0027s only fault is in expectation management and going against labeling convention, they have still delivered a fantastic update, with many new features and many things fixed. Sure there are issues, but they have said more updates are in the pipe, not least of which is a Unity engine upgrade (1.1 which will probably also break things and reek havoc). We just have to mentally think of these releases as still being 0.90.x, stop whining, say thanks for delivering some great new features and be constructive in helping root out the issues."},{"CreatedByName":"Lime","CreatedById":137978,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T13:13:01Z","Content":"The rockets all have fins to keep them stable."},{"CreatedByName":"hazens1","CreatedById":129789,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T13:14:34Z","Content":"My only complaint about 1.0.2 is that they nerfed the atmosphere but didn\u0027t un-nerf engines to compensate...
