Complaining about ridiculously shaped fairings being allowed in a game where your KSP personnel will happily OK launching whatever insanity you put on the launchpad even if it has 5 SRBs with their business ends pointed straight at the capsule in the middle rings pretty hollow. Also, a lot of pFairing protesters seem to think fairings are some kind of magical hard-coded drag-eliminators. They\u0027re not - at least in FAR, and I would presume in the upcoming stock aero model as well, they are subject to the same drag calculations as the uncovered payload - for them to perform better, they actually have to provide an \u0027aerodynamic advantage\u0027 to the non-covered payload. If sanely sized, they will, but some of the examples here would probably get to orbit with much more dV left if flown without the fairing - though those sticky-outy girders just might get torn off if you pick up too much speed too low in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T20:05:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheOrqwithVagrant\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TheOrqwithVagrant\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.ata-e.com/asymmetric-payload-fairing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.ata-e.com/asymmetric-payload-fairing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI doubt this page\u0027s veracity.
