Before I started using Extraplanetary Launchpads, I had set up a Kethane base on Minmus and found that the old adage \u0022Once you\u0027re in orbit, you\u0027re halfway to anywhere\u0022 is very VERY true. All you need to do is build a ship that can get into orbit, and then ferry down all the fuel from your base on Minmus to that ship, fill it up, and then that ship can get anywhere.\n\nEasier (though more wasteful but now that Karbonite has unlimited supplies of fuel at any drilling station wasteful is not an issue) is to make the ship a little bigger at launch time and make it so it can arrive at Minmus with dry tanks. Then fill it up there, and from there burn down to a low Kerbin periapsis at the correct time and use the Oberth effect to launch out to your destination. And as a bonus, you will feel like a BadS for nailing that maneuver.\n\nWith EPLP installed, things go from cheaper to free, as you can just build the ship on Minmus (or in Orbit) and fly off from there. The only thing you need to launch from Kerbin then is the astronauts, and all they need is enough dV to get from the launchpad to Minmus orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T17:32:50Z","Content":"There\u0027s an old adage saying \u0022time is money\u0022. It applies in a surprisingly large number of situations. Also in this one, for example.\n\nHauling fuel to orbit is expensive, yes. You can probably save a lot of money mining your own. But do you know what you will be doing then? You\u0027ll be mining and hauling fuel for a mission instead of actually flying that mission. Everything will take you a whole lot longer, and certain tasks will quickly get repetitive and unexciting. As such, there\u0027s a tradeoff: do you pay money and fly now - or do you pay with your playtime, spending an hour to procure your \u0022free\u0022 fuel from a mining station, conducting orbital rendezvous and docking maneuvers and other such things?\n\nThe resource mechanic is probably not truly suited as a long-term primary fuel infrastructure. I mean, I don\u0027t doubt that it will work as such, sure - but you\u0027ll be doing tasks that are not particularly fun to play. At the same time, you don\u0027t want to ignore the refueling mechanic completely, either. Where it is really going to shine, I think, is when it enables you to fly missions that would involve excessive launch and transfer costs. Prime example: a vessel designed to make manned landings on all of Jool\u0027s moons and return. That Tylo lander is going to be *heavy*, and that\u0027s not yet taking care of the other four moons. Maybe, depending on how the mining equipment turns out, it might actually weigh less than the contents of the tanks of the Tylo lander - and in that case, well you just launch towards Jool with all your lander tanks empty. That will greatly reduce the weight, launch cost and assembly tedium of the vessel. Once at Jool, you hit up Bop and/or Pol, and mine them for fuel for the larger landers."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T17:41:51Z","Content":"My costs are low anyway, because I use SSTO\u0027s to do nearly everything.\n\nRefueling in space will open up new capabilities for spacecraft.

I tend to focus on huge reusable interplanetary ships, and once I have a few of those in play, my largest expense is sending up colossal tankers to refuel them.

The infrastructure includes:\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 one karbonite extractor station on a plateau on Minmus\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 one karbonite refinery in low Minmus orbit\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 one tanker (four Kerbodyne tanks with atomic engines and maneuvering jets) docked to the refinery\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 two landers packed with karbonite storage tanks\n\nThe extractor mines karbonite and pumps it directly into the attached lander; when the lander is full, it detaches and flies up to dock with the refinery, which converts the karbonite into rocket fuel and deposits it in the tanker. Repeat until tanker is full. (If desired, I can detach the full tanker and leave it in a parking orbit, then send up a second tanker and fill it up too, and so on.)\n\nNow the starship \\_Voyager\\_I\\_ doesn\u0027t even need to descend to low Kerbin orbit (and ascend afterwards, costing lots of \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC v) between missions; it can just ease into Minmus orbit, settle into a parking orbit a few km from the refinery, and wait while the tanker putts on over and transfers all the fuel it needs for free. (Meanwhile the crew can fly to Kerbin on a spaceplane, check in at home base to drop off science data and level up, and return to the \\_Voyager\\_ on the same spaceplane.)

You could likely make much more money spending the hour or so just doing a few contracts.\n\nIf you had Extraplanetary Launchpads installed as well, and every once in a while just built a \u0022fuel returner\u0022 on the surface of Minmus and returned it full of fuel, then that would be profitable, because you\u0027re not really spending that much time (just launching from the surface of Minmus back to Kerbin as opposed to launching into orbit, then transferring to Minmus, orbiting, landing at your base, loading it up, and then launching back to Kerbin for your proposed plan) for the same profit.

I recently installed Karbonite and set up my first mining base on Minmus, where the gravity is so low that I can extract karbonite from the ground, use a big lander to pull it up into orbit, dock at my orbital refinery, and convert it all to rocket fuel. The lander is big enough that each round trip fills a large Kerbodyne tank with fuel, and then I pull a small amount of that back into the lander to power the next round trip.

I realized this halfway through launching all the infrastructure but decided to just finish the project as is, partly because I had already designed and built most of it and partly because I like the idea of mining raw materials and then transporting them to orbit to finish production.
