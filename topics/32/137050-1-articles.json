What other places have you seen KSP news shared recently? I\u0027m curious to see how far the 1.1 buzz goes!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-16T07:41:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTMC has always posted about multiple different games and ~things~ no matter how turbulent EVE-O was, and KSP has always had a place there since the site was created; hardly an \u0022unexpected\u0022 place for it to show up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Curveball Anders","CreatedById":107529,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-16T07:56:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222516478\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022137050\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460792473\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002270807\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, regex said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTMC has always posted about multiple different games and ~things~ no matter how turbulent EVE-O was, and KSP has always had a place there since the site was created; hardly an \u0022unexpected\u0022 place for it to show up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a lot of shared fan base between EvE and KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPossibly due to space and spaceships, and maybe also because of the totally different atmosphere (easy, laidback, no-drama single player KSP to ease ones nerves after some hours in the dark, plotting, backstabbing, multi player space politics EvE).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen at home I often have KSP on one monitor and EvE on another, But some months ago I actually shifted KSP to the central monitor and shuffled EvE over to the right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI actually got intrested in KSP beacuse I was reading Jester\u0027s Trek while Jester was on the CSM, and he often posted about his adventures in KSP in between the EvE posts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
