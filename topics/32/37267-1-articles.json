I have recently launched a mission to Duna but sadly i have missed the phase angle. So i need to time exhilarate to get the phase angle in line again. so i was wondering if it would be considered cheating to use infinite fuel to boost my orbit into one that allows for 10000X time warp and when the phase angle is in the proper place drop my orbit back to it\u0027s original state then disable infinite fuel.? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS. what is the ideal altitude to air brake on duna?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CCKinnison","CreatedById":71439,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-16T02:30:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s kind of up to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMe, I\u0027d just work on missions to someplace else and wait it out.

I know of two ways you could fix it described below. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption 1: You could edit your persistent.sfs to change your game time to a future date. My gut feeling is that it is in seconds, with your first time on the pad or runway in a clean save being time 0. That being said, you\u0027ll need to estimate (more like guess) what UT your next window is. Note: the game labels time as UT for universal time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption 2: You can copy (not cut) the orbital information block for your ship in the persistent.sfs. Then, go into the game and enable infinite fuel and follow your original plan. Next, go back into your persistent.sfs, highlight the current orbital information and paste the old information. Finally, save the whole thing. This will put you in EXACTLY the same orbit you were in before with EXACTLY the same amount of fuel. Don\u0027t forget to turn infinite fuel back off\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome pieces of advice: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I am not an expert on persistent editing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Always make a copy of the original (unedited) persistent\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Ensure there is only one persistent.sfs in your save file when you open the game. Save the other one somewhere like \u0022My Documents\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. I don\u0027t know what quick saving will do while you are editing the persistent.sfs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs said above, though, what you do with your game is your business.
