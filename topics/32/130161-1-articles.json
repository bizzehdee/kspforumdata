By the time you\u0027re subject to serious aerodynamic forces, say going 100m/s\u002B, you don\u0027t want to deviate much from prograde. Ideally not at all, but it\u0027s in the nature of ideals that they\u0027re pretty hard to achieve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMuch has been said already about how higher TWRs are energetically better, at least up to a point. Kerbin is a small world with little atmosphere, so TWRs in the game can be a lot higher than in real life. Looking at entrants in ascent challenges, the sweet spot seems to be somewhere around TWR 2-2.5. However, such a rocket makes for quite a frantic launch where you have to turn aggressively right off the pad. Besides, that\u0027s \u0022efficiency\u0022 measured as \u0022least dV to orbit\u0022; you may find that if you optimize for other values (like... cost?), a lower TWR may well be better. In terms of dV, going from TWR=2 to TWR=1.4 will only require an additional 200m/s or so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, you may want to have a look at the new \u0022Gravity Turn\u0022 mod (this week\u0027s modding monday) -- it tries to guess a good ascent profile for any lifter and does so very well. Even if you don\u0027t want to use it in the long run, it\u0027s a great teaching tool in that it shows you what a good turn looks like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
