Launch windows aren\u0027t relevant if you plan to enter LKO at all, which mayb it\u0027s just me but I always like to have a thorough check, and probably a top up the tanks, before I set sail for distant worlds. As with all things in KSP, from ascent to docking to hoffman transfers to re-entry, intuition is more rewarding than any amount of preparation and planning. How to we learn this intuition?
