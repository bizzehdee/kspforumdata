This turned out not to work the way i wanted. \n\nFirst, the chutes will not fully open if you deploy them below the set altitude. Even if you deploy them at apogee, they still wont open. \n\nSo I thought I would lower the inflation altitude. This also did not work if you set the altitude lower the chutes come out, but fail to open before hitting the ground even if they were close to apogee when they were deployed. \n\nI know from past experience this used to work, and i know you can set the altitude higher and they will deploy. I had some problem with 1.02 with the preset, in some circumstances gear/chute combos were one chute was inadequate to safely land by itself. This was solved by increasing altitude.\n\nNow it seems there are more rigid constraints on when and how the chutes will deploy."},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T00:02:54Z","Content":"There has been a noticeable downturn in the quality of parts coming from the suppliers and safety procedures have had to be changed to reflect the poor quality of the parts.

I just wish they would add some combination chutes so you would have less parts."},{"CreatedByName":"windows_x_seven","CreatedById":112926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T03:34:15Z","Content":"Try opening the chutes at lower speeds, I usually open them near 250 m/s, using FAR. You can also use drogue chutes, or more interestingly, airbrakes, that can help you slow down during re-entry and landing."}]}
