As I began developing the lander, I realized I have no idea how much gravity to account for. The lander I sent there before was unmanned and more powerful than it needed to be. Obviously, I want to take only as much weight as I absolutely have to, and have a TWR just high enough to get the job done. This led me to wonder what planet or moon might serve as a fair testing ground for this mission. Thanks for the input!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T01:34:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoho has a radius of 250km, while Mun\u0027s is 200. Not a great match, but probably close enough to make it a useful testing ground.

As far as gravity is concerned, Duna is actually a closer match at 2.94 m/s^2, though Duna\u0027s atmosphere makes landing a bit easier than on Moho. The only other body in the Kerbol system in the range 1.7 to 7.8 is Vall, at 2.31 m/s^2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hardest part about Moho missions is capturing into Moho orbit since there\u0027s no atmosphere and your incoming transfer orbit will likely be going much faster than Moho when you get there. If you\u0027re patient enough to plan out more complicated maneuvers, you can use an Eve gravity assist to adjust your orbit. You want Eve\u0027s gravity to lower your solar apoapsis, with your periapsis near Moho, to reduce the cost of the capture burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tarmenius","CreatedById":16990,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T04:14:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys!
