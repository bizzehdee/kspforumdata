Considering the usual update routine, I put all the stuff on the lowest graphics settings-- BUT! the game automatically reset those options for me almost immediately afterward (I think it was the second time I opened KSP.) The game is running as smoothly now as 1.3.1 did without mods and all the graphics turned way down to minimal.

I was suggesting an auto-welding algorithm: once the part count passes a threshold, it combines connected parts into larger units, which are treated as single parts for the physics computations. The thermal and physical thresholds for the combination parts would have to be adjusted with some heuristics. This way it would be possible to keep the physics part count of the craft down to any number you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still think this would be doable in ways that would be almost unnoticeable while playing the game, and the performance payoff for large part-count craft would be dramatic. At least I would happily take a less-accurate simulation at 60 fps than a more-accurate one at 10!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hms_warrior","CreatedById":142205,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-09T13:33:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed807611000\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/96670-131-252-2017-10-28-ubiozur-welding-ltd-continued/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:211px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-09T13:40:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n^\u003Cbr\u003E\nYup, like that, but automatic and self-reconfiguring e.g. when you dock, undock, or get blown to pieces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
