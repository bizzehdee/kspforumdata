Destruction of the part causes the same outcome as \u0027overheating,\u0027 meaning if your gigantic multi-layered C7 space battleship gets shot with a railgun at only 100 meters away... you will know what I mean here.\n\n\\*tink\\*\n\n(screen freezes up)\n\n\\*BAAWHHWOOOMMMMCCHHHCCHKKSSHHAAAA\\*\n\nDoes anyone know a workaround for this specifically? I personally think a gradual collapse and destruction of a massive ship slowly exploding in different areas could take on a simple one-shot fireball of doom.\n\nIn this example video, you will see one of my boats get shot twice with the \u0027Particle Cannon.\u0027 It is big enough that the first shot is slightly realistic, but the second one... my god.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/8AUjjaMvxdw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n(ignore the people in the background; turn up volume for maximum need of new pants)\n\nThis probably made no sense, but someone is bound to reply with a question or two."},{"CreatedByName":"cardgame","CreatedById":12317,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-25T04:09:47Z","Content":"Heat conduction? ;P"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-25T09:51:31Z","Content":"Remember, it\\\u0027s not a boat, It\\\u0027s a gigantic boat shaped rocket.
