I can\u0027t know for sure, though, that\u0027s just a guess. Still; that\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve seen it happen in orbit (usually it happens on approach with the runway, with a plane going fast), so it seems to happen less frequently the further you go from Kerbin. That could be a clue. Also, the KSC is visible from orbit, so yes, it is being rendered while in orbit, which means the \u0022crashing into the KSC in orbit\u0022 bug is very likely the same bug as \u0022crashing into the KSC on runway approach\u0022 bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;/speculation\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-21T15:18:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis must be what caused my (otherwise successful) prototype Cargobird to lose its vertical stabilizers in LKO yesterday.
