Once it is triggered, using nonphysical timewarp will bring about a number of different weird effects depending on where your ship is located (e.g. on launchpad = hovering capsule, low orbit = torquing/disassembly, high orbit = explosion). When you see a \u0022stuck\u0022 orbit the ship isn\u0027t really immobile - its velocity is locked but the altitude changes. A \u0022stuck\u0022 ship just seems to be stationary because nonphysical timewarp breaks at the same time, so you don\u0027t notice its movement in higher orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore about the bug here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75274-Frozen-orbit-null-reference-exception-%28REPRODUCIBLE-output-logs%29?p=1070347\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1070347\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75274-Frozen-orbit-null-reference-exception-%28REPRODUCIBLE-output-logs%29?p=1070347\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1070347\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to the bug tracker, the devs are currently looking into the problem. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasmic","CreatedById":64885,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-13T08:42:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve not been attacked by the Kraken a single time in ARM, and only very few times in 0.23.0.
