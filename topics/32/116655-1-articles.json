Mismatched profiles in attached nodes will have more drag than matched profiles; this is how KSP models smooth profiles being better than ones with steps in them. It completely ignores offsetting though, so you can make some silly looking things that are still aerodynamic according to the model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERotation, however, is not ignored. You can exploit this by mounting an appropriately-sized nose cone to the front of a stack and then rotating it 180 degrees so it clips into the stack, this will actually result in less drag than having the pointy end exposed. I don\u0027t use this method for \u0022serious\u0022 craft though, as I feel it is exploiting the simplifications of the model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, your inlined pics need fixing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T15:39:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery strange.
