I built a probe with a fairing. Below that was a transfer stage with a 2.5m tank and nuke engine. My launch vehicle was 3.75m, so it looked ugly. Just out of curiosity I put another fairing below that, and when I built the fairing and put my mouse on the fairing base for the probe, the \u0022Close fairing\u0022 text turned blue! Clicking closed it onto the other fairing base, making a straight inline fairing with no part clipping! When deployed, it breaks away like a sliced up cylinder.\n\nAgain, never saw this anywhere else in the forum or announcements. Did I just miss it? Does anyone else know or is his just a feature that was forgotten in release notes?\n\nEither way, if you didn\u0027t know, now you do! Hooray for nice looking rockets!"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T15:30:42Z","Content":"Yeah, I\u0027m really loving the stock fairings for their flexibility.

I use the fairing then a decoupler before the next stage engine.

If there is any part anywhere near where the fairing needs to go it won\u0027t allow it to be created (even if it doesn\u0027t look like it would be a problem). And sometimes they just won\u0027t create at all, what I\u0027ve found in these cases is that saving the craft and then re-opening it quite often enables you to then create the inline fairing. \n\nAlso, you don\u0027t need two fairing bases to create them, they\u0027ll join up to other parts.\n\n[![Jh8wEUil.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Jh8wEUil.jpg)](http://imgur.com/Jh8wEUi)"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonik","CreatedById":79705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T16:47:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Also, you don\u0027t need two fairing bases to create them, they\u0027ll join up to other parts.\n\u003E \n\u003E http://imgur.com/Jh8wEUi[http://i.imgur.com/Jh8wEUil.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Jh8wEUil.jpg)\n\nI was getting the impression from the OP that if you use 2 fairing bases you can have a smooth fairing wall without any curvature. I haven\u0027t actually checked yet. Maybe I\u0027m just not following correctly. I was aware you could already do inter-stage without 2 fairings, but due to the finicky-ness of this I have gone back to Procedural Fairings."},{"CreatedByName":"Vicomt","CreatedById":93574,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T17:16:06Z","Content":"I\u0027ve never been able to get interstage fairing to connect. never tried this trick though. thanks."},{"CreatedByName":"CommanderSpock","CreatedById":147594,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T17:20:33Z","Content":"I just wish that the fairings would keep the inside creation inside, and not let it go through like there isn\u0027t anything."},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T17:22:56Z","Content":"Yes, it does not require another fairing base.

The problem is not that it can\u0027t be done, the problem is that you are required to separate them making them inferior to Procedural Fairings.
