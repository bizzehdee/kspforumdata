which the cargo bay is built with, and the second unit is the floating part inside suddenly becomes non-solid - or in other words the two units do not have collider meshes and do not collide with each other - which causes the effect of one solid passing through the other - or in other words, you will see the wheel float right out of the cargo bay with the cargo bay doors shut / closed. \u00A0So I
