But if you have been poking around the internet recently you may have found a game called BeamNG drive, in that game all cars have soft body physics, which means if I was driving head on into a pole the car would somewhat \u0022wrap\u0022 around the pole, like in real life, someone else can probably explain it better. But I think this would be awesome in KSP because say if you are approaching the mun at a higher speed than the landing legs can support, the legs would bend and buckle under the weight and speed of the rocket. This could also be used if you collide with another object, instead of parts exploding they would bend, snap, and leak fuel if it were a fuel tank while colliding with the object, maybe the rocket would still work, although not as well. One of my favorite reasons is if your engine gets damaged, while landing or something, instead of it just exploding, the nozzle (depending on what engine it is) could bend, or it would be much less fuel efficient, produce less thrust (possibly by leaking fuel through the nozzle, which could ignite and explode, maybe further damaging your rocket) and could possibly give you a chance at going back home. Last reason, also my favorite, is reentry. While reentering the atmosphere, if you go in to steep or at a bad angle parts of the capsule could start to melt. Say you are reentering and you go in nose first, if you dont turn around fast enough the parachute could melt if it is ontop of the capsule, and after that the whole front of the capsule starts melting, until a hole is made and, sadly, your precious kerbalnaughts die. Or if you go in lopsided and one side is more exposed than the other, a hole could be made there, killing the kerbal on that side, but there could be a slim chance you correct yourself and the others survive, or the capsule flips out and they all die. I think this would be awesome if it ever were to happen. BeamNG Drive is made with unity, and if im not mistaken ksp is being ported to unity (?), so with a miracle this could happen. Share your thoughts? Do you think it\u0027s a good idea? Or does it suck?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T22:04:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP isn\u0027t being ported into Unity.

Though you\u0027re suggesting a very sophisticated ablation model which would ultimately be nearly indistinguishable from a simple \u0027hitpoint\u0027 based model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel that rigid-body physics offer a good tradeoff between realism, computational load (though I really hope Unity can get a GPU-accelerated physics engine), and user transparency. My biggest physics-related wish-item is the new aerodynamics model they\u0027re eventually planning to implement, as the current one is *not* a very good characterization of realistic aerodynamics. FAR is better, but is still limited by some of the core KSP mechanics and messes with the gameplay balance a bit (ie significantly reduced dV to orbit) and I\u0027d be much more willing to use a stock model.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T23:06:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAhh, fluid dynamics.

Also, it looked totally awesome when your car got all battered and messed up, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is different in that constant damage is not a major part of gameplay, most of the time your ship takes no damage or catastrophic damage. You might occasionally get an Apollo 13 moment where you have partial damage and have to get your kerbals home, but mostly this would just be a heap of CPU time devoted just to making crashes look cooler, which, I\u0027m not against cool looking crashes but it certainly is not worth adding more complexity and wrecking gameplay for anyone without a monster PC, smooth running and good frame rate is much more important. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I have a feeling that fancy soft physics \u002B the modular built rockets of KSP would be a mighty glitch fountain for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beachernaut","CreatedById":69994,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T23:35:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMeh...

It\u0027s not just CPU demand either - the matrices that have to be manipulated each time frame can get absolutely gargantuan, which eats RAM and as we know we can\u0027t address enough of that already as it is \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, perhaps someone in the know can answer this, but I don\u0027t believe all these lovely fluid simulations are truly coupled simulations - and by that I mean that solids affect a fluid flow, but the fluid does not cause any sort of \u0027loading\u0027 of the solid itself? If so, the computational demand of these simulations seen thus far is smaller than what would be needed for KSP. It wouldn\u0027t be enough for the sea or the air to react and move accurately to disturbance (in the case of air that would be fairly pointless as we can\u0027t see it most of the time) but the fluid would need to present a force upon the solid for the solid to deform/heat up/vibrate like a bee/etc., otherwise the whole shebang would be a waste of processing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of the time physics problems can be simulated without all the pesky computation by making some gross assumptions and/or using analytic solutions. At some point I want to try to integrate exhaust mach diamonds (if Unity\u0027s particle system will allow this) and you can be sure I will not be simulating wave behaviour!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
