Most of the planet\u0027s population is reasonably ho-hum about the whole thing, seeing as how they\u0027ve been through **lots** of impacts before and nothing notable has ever resulted.

Let\u0027s see... Ah yes, here we go.\n\n**Kerbin\u0027s Atmosphere**\n\n It has come to the attention of the Guide that, while the knowledge we possess concerning Kerbals is quite extensive, one thing that\u0027s been consistently overlooked in discussing these strange little explosion factories is the fact that their atmosphere makes no sense whatsoever. While it does generally exhibit certain qualities known to exist within atmospheric bodies, such as lift, drag, and mucking up the lovely view of space with an annoying color change, it does not actually seem to follow many of the rules of aerodynamics. Previous Kerbologists sent to Kerbin by the Guide failed to mention this phenomenon for no reason we can ascertain, mostly because there aren\u0027t many surviving Kerbologists outside of those in the employ of the Guide, but this editor suspects that it had something to do with the fact that paying attention to aerodynamics is not something you usually have the luxury of doing when dealing with Kerbals. Generally speaking, if you\u0027ve got time enough to notice that the air around you isn\u0027t behaving like air, you\u0027re probably either dead or about to be when Kerbals are involved.\n\n Whatever the case, the Guide has now sent a new Kerbologist out to study the phenomenon. The extensive report can best be summed up as: the entire Kerbin solar system is one seriously messed-up place, and worrying about the fact that the air on its various planets doesn\u0027t behave itself seems kind of petty in that respect. This Kerbologist was promptly sacked, and a new one was hired to give us a non-sarcastic analysis of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. His report was, in full: it\u0027s beans. We are once again in need of a new Kerbologist; please apply if you have the time and lack of self-presevation skill required for the job. Regardless, one thing is certain about Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere: whatever it is, it is truly a unique gem in this galaxy for us to treasure. So long as Kerbals have that going for them, their tourism and body count both should remain high.\n\n Addenum: It has come to our attention that the Kerbals caught wind of the Guide\u0027s entry on their atmosphere, and have decided to alter it to more closely resemble a normal atmosphere out of spite for us. In retrospect, this was something of a predictable side-effect of letting the Kerbals know that we\u0027ve been watching them and laughing at them for so long. This editor in particular finds it quite terrifying that they can radically alter their ecosystem in such a short span and in such a fundamental fashion, but that\u0027s just my opinion. The post of Kerbologist remains open, incidentally, as it was when this article was first published two weeks ago. We\u0027ve admittedly gone through 14 Kerbologists since then, but don\u0027t let that deter you from applying!"},{"CreatedByName":"skyace65","CreatedById":71431,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T02:11:17Z","Content":"It\u0027s a kerbnado"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T02:19:28Z","Content":"The Kraken\u0027s spirit has returned from its resting place on Bop to enact sick revenge on the kerbal race for vanquishing it all those years ago."},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedCowboy","CreatedById":92106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T03:41:25Z","Content":"The 2nd Coming of Jeb"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T03:50:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E There will be no change to Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere whatsoever.
