(I just changed them to the more recent pre 1.05 basic jet model)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Engine nacelle from 1.04 (and earlier.. to 0.9?), modded to be heavier, function as an \u0022intakeAtmosphere\u0022 source, and electric charge storage (ie batteries replace the liquid fuel)... all that I already had for atmospheric craft on Duna/Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I\u0027ve added a ballast tank (no unique 3d model and texture)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically its the same as an ore tank, but it has a generator that can produce the \u0022Ballast resource\u0022 which enables you to control your buoyancy... and also to launch these things empty, tranfer then empty, and splash them on Laythe/Eve empty... and have them sink on their own from taking on ballast in the water(the ballast function works anywhere, but I can\u0027t imagine why you\u0027d want to increase your mass in any other circumstance... but you can also generate ballast in space).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... instead of having to fill ore tanks after launch (which can be quite difficult considering no liquid biome has any ore to drill)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eWkD2Q2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022eWkD2Q2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, I didn\u0027t realize the \u0022activate generator\u0022 button disappears when I have multiple things selected... you can see the \u0022efficiency 0.00\u0022 readout on the ballast tank, the generator is off, so 0.00 makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPower consumption is quite high, and top speed is quite low... but I was balancing these electric fans for use on a light mostly solar powered aircraft for traversing Duna by air at ~80-100 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QX9gIcs.png\u0022 alt=\u0022QX9gIcs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m gonna need more NUKs... that sub is already ridiculously expensive from all those RTGs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/elB1gIo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022elB1gIo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking maybe I\u0027ll add an Isp curve to it, so it can perform well at \u0026gt;1.0 atms, but still be weak on Duna... but on Eve... well that would be OP\u0027d there\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also thinking a better method of getting rid of ballast is needed than just the jettison function (though with small tanks I can tranfer into the smallest tanks and jettison from those)... a negative generator? something that just consumes ballast and does nothing of any significange? (like a 10,000 ballast = 1 Electric charge fuel cell)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6sYNsN8.png\u0022 alt=\u00226sYNsN8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DMK3AfP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DMK3AfP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also thinking I should add thrust reverse on the electric fans (I\u0027m not exactly sure how to do that, they\u0027re using the old \u0022ModuleEngines\u0022, not the new \u0022ModuleEnginesFX\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may have to copy the .cfg file of the new turbofan, and then change the stats to turn it into an electric fan too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I can\u0027t think of any good old part to use for basically an electric \u0022RCS\u0022 for use underwater... I\u0027ve got an idea for an underwater base where I can dock subs on laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
