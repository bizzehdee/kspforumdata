I think I have over 800 hours played on KSP. There are plenty of games I\u0027ve bought for more than that and ended up disappointed. Lookin\u0027 at you, Rome II Total War.\n\nBut I remember what it was like when I was younger and had to be a little more discerning about waiting for discounts. If you must wait for a discount, there\u0027s likely to be one in a Steam Summer Sale which last year started on June 19th. Video games also have a general trend of going on sale a few months after release, after the early adopters have paid full price and the developer is trying to entice more buyers to keep their market momentum up.\n\nEDIT: Conclusion - buy it now if you can. Even in beta with all its bugs, this game is addictive and fun."},{"CreatedByName":"-RanZ-","CreatedById":51892,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T19:52:29Z","Content":"buy it now, it\u0027s worth it"},{"CreatedByName":"Vallius","CreatedById":100188,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T19:58:32Z","Content":"Better buy it now.

You might buy it now, find out the price went up after 1.0 and realize that you made out well... or, you could buy it now and see it go on sale for 25% off not long after. If price is your major concern, the only way you\u0027ll make out solid for sure is to wait until a good sale comes along. If play is your major concern, I\u0027d recommend waiting for 1.0... a lot will be changing, and it will take those of us who\u0027ve played a while already some time to adjust to the new mechanics... if you wait until 1.0 is released, you won\u0027t have to unlearn any habits from previous versions (and you have the advantage that there won\u0027t be many sweeping changes afterward... you\u0027re basically getting a polished product). Of course, if you just can\u0027t wait then buy now, nothing wrong with that (you\u0027re gonna do it sooner or later right? might as well be this weekend)."},{"CreatedByName":"soulsource","CreatedById":110576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T14:22:51Z","Content":"I\u0027d say: Buy it right now.

A lot of the keys up there were purchased at places with lower regional pricing and resold to other places and that\u0027s the most legitimate of their dealings.

The Far Cry 4 debacle where Devolver had to deactivate the keys because they were not legitimate is the most recent big one but not the only one.
