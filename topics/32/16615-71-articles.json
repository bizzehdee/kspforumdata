That just seems silly. Moreover, as the game advances, things will inevitably get easier. IE. Remember before patch conics how difficult it was to get to Mun? Unless you calculated it you really didn\u0027t know, now it is much easier to get to Mun. Remember how hard it used to be to rescue Kerbals if they crash landed?
