Personally, it\u0027s been worth every penny, but I have a personality and interests well in line with this game. I can see why some wouldn\u0027t like it that much, and why it might seem on the tin to be a low budget indie game (which it kinda is), and there are some for whom $40 would be a lot, but for me personally, I\u0027m with the bandwagon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-11T04:54:45Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2017 04:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Starman4308\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EDurn mobile\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corona688","CreatedById":2511,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-11T05:22:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHell, it \u003Cstrong\u003Ewas\u003C/strong\u003E a low-budget indie game when I got the preorder for $12 or so.\u00A0 It\u0027s come a long way since then, with things like, oh, planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-11T05:23:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI actually have to agree that KSP is a bit too\u00A0expensive given the current state of the game. Not because it isn\u0027t a fun game, and not because I haven\u0027t gotten hundreds of hours of enjoyment from it. The problem is that the game STILL feels like an early access title in a lot of ways. Game balance and polish are both still sorely lacking for a game that has been \u0022released\u0022. Not to mention gameplay outside of sandbox mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n$40 is quite expensive for an indie/small developer game, most of those are $30 or less and many of them are made with much higher production values than KSP. The higher price implies a higher level of quality and polish which KSP simply doesn\u0027t have right now given that we\u0027re STILL using poor quality placeholder graphics and part balance values. What KSP does have is a niche with no real competition.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the devs can ever properly finish the game, it will easily be worth whatever price they want to charge. As it stands now though, KSP is still in early access as far as I\u0027m concerned. The only thing that really changed when it went 1.0 was the price, so in my mind the game needs to actually be finished before it will be worth the full asking price.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, I\u0027m a bit salty about this whole issue. Mostly because I can see the potential of KSP to be so much better than it is now and how it\u0027s being held back by years of technical debt and questionable business decisions (the whole console debacle).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-11T05:32:00Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2017 05:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corona688","CreatedById":2511,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-11T05:39:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223241080\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022168425\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221512969787\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002271687\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lord Aurelius\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 minutes ago, Lord Aurelius said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe higher price implies a higher level of quality and polish which KSP simply doesn\u0027t have right now given that we\u0027re STILL using poor quality placeholder graphics\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven the ludicrous system requirements people mod in for \u0022non-placeholder\u0022 graphics I\u0027m quite happy with graphics that actually work on sane system specs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 minutes ago, Lord Aurelius said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand part balance values.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven the caterwauling which occurs whenever they change...\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003Eanything\u003C/strong\u003E, I\u0027m not shocked at this either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FrostedShoe","CreatedById":183418,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-11T06:45:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the problem with KSP is that it serves a very niche market.
