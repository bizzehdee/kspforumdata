Mounted on the bottom too. And they would have totally survived, if I didn\u0027t insist on going \u0026gt;40m/s, occasionally breaching 60m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeriodically, I\u0027d stop, and either roll the rover upside down (plenty of torque) or let it have a look at distant landscape as the batteries recharged if the terrain was flat enough. It looked quite funny as it lifted several meters off the ground on the panels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegardless, it has enough backup panels so that it can go indefinitely in noon sunlight, and only stop for a bit during evenings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
