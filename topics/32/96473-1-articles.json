But here we are... Is there a way I can find all of the previous versions of KSP? As far back as 0.14, pre-minmus days. Back when the physics engine was wonky as all hell and getting to the Mun was a REAL challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also ask due to a... slight worry on my part. I do trust Squad very much, and I\u0027m sure they will most likely go on to make the game better and better. But... there is always a risk that version 0.95 will have some terrible thing added that I hate. And if that does ever happen, I like the notion that I can have a stockpile of the old versions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-12T17:56:25Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2015 05:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PTNLemay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T17:31:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EToo bad you didnt post this last week...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had been hoarding every version since 0.17...I JUST deleted them all last week, while cleaning up lots of old KSP installs, saves, crafts, mods, and all the other junk I ended up collecting...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou DO have me thinking i probably should have thrown at least a few of the old versions on DVD, though... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T17:42:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24858-Old-versions-of-KSP-(some-versions-still-wanted!)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis topic\u003C/a\u003E may be relevant to your interests.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Engineer of Stuff","CreatedById":106757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T17:46:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEverybody realizes that they should of been hoarding them, and then feels sad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PTNLemay","CreatedById":30142,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T17:55:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SkyRender\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SkyRender\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24858-Old-versions-of-KSP-(some-versions-still-wanted!)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis topic\u003C/a\u003E may be relevant to your interests.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a good start, thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T20:10:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll find that getting your hands on copies of versions after the 0.13.x series is very difficult (well, except for 0.18.3, the current demo), as those are all technically pay-to-play releases.
