I\u0027m getting some slowdown on larger part-count rockets and ships, which is to be expected to some degree, but I\u0027m getting crippling slow-downs on ships with less than 150 parts. More puzzling is the fact that it seems to be recent and worse in .22 than .21.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, before people go ripping on about this being \u0022a development out of Squads heart, not deep pockets,\u0022 or, \u0022still a beta,\u0022 I understand that, fully. I am simply trying to diagnose whether there is a problem with my setup, my computer or the game code itself. If it\u0027s with the game, I\u0027m trying to see if it is something Squad knows about or if it is something to be brought up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m playing on an iMac 2.9 GHz Intel Core i5; 16 GB DDR3 at 1600MHZ; NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M 512 MB; running OS X 10.8.5. I know that video card is nothing special but my understanding is that the CPU is the choke point due to the physics calcs. The CPU seems like it wouldn\u0027t be that bad. On the CPU front, not entirely sure what to make of my activity log details. I\u0027m seeing up to 130% CPU usage for KSP\u0027s process but also 30% user usage for the CPU in general. Maybe someone more familiar with Macs and Multi-core processors can make more sense of that than I can. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere anything going on here other than \u0022need more CPU\u0022? I seem to exceed all recommended specs but I know those were also estimated recommendations and with .22 may not be entirely accurate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T04:41:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also observed a lower threshold before lag sets in with .22.
