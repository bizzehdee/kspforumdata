For a circular orbit, that\u0027s radius to the power 1.5. So T = k*(a^1.5) where T is time to complete one orbit, a is semi-major axis (or radius, which is usually close enough), and k is some proportionality constant that doesn\u0027t matter because it cancels out. In the case of Earth, we can set all the constants to be equal to 1. The Earth\u0027s semi-major axis is 1 AU, the orbital period is 1 year, etc. So if we say Earth is 1 Astronomical Unit from the sun and know that Mars averages about 1.52 AU from the sun, then we know that Mars completes one orbit in time T where T = 1.52^1.5 = 1.87 years which is about 684 days. Actually it\u0027s 687, but close enough since we\u0027re using approximations, and mid-course corrections don\u0027t tend to cost a lot of fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow imagine you want to do a hohmann transfer orbit between Earth and Mars. That means your orbit will have a perihelion of 1 AU and an apohelion of 1.52. That makes your semi-major axis equal to 1.26 AU. That means your orbital period is 1.26^1.5 years = about 1.4 years. You want to rendezvous with Mars, so you\u0027re interested in the outbound leg of this journey, so total transfer time is half that; about 0.7 years. So you want to launch 0.7 years before Mars reaches the point where it\u0027ll be 180 degrees from your present location. That\u0027s 0.7 / 1.87 = 0.37 of a Martian orbit. Times that by 360 to get 136 degrees. So Mars should be 136 degrees behind the point that\u0027s directly opposite to the sun from where you are now. Subtract that from 180 degrees, and you get 44 degrees. So you want to launch when Mars is 44 degrees ahead of you in its orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to apply that maths to the Kerbal universe, you need to measure Kerbin\u0027s orbital distance from the sun, and call that \u0022one Kerbal astronomical unit\u0022, or 1 KAU. It\u0027s always worth setting known values to 1 because it makes the maths so much simpler. Then, all other planets\u0027 orbital distances can be measured in KAUs. Plug in those numbers, and you\u0027ll get your optimal launch timings. The same maths works for orbital rendezvous, you just have to remember that semi-major axis is measured from the centre of gravity, not from the surface. So if you\u0027re orbiting 100km above Kerbin (and Kerbin has a radius of 600km), then your semi-major axis is 700km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know, I\u0027m a crap teacher.

For a circular orbit, that\u0027s radius to the power 1.5. So T = k*(a^1.5) where T is time to complete one orbit, a is semi-major axis (or radius, which is usually close enough), and k is some proportionality constant that doesn\u0027t matter because it cancels out. In the case of Earth, we can set all the constants to be equal to 1. The Earth\u0027s semi-major axis is 1 AU, the orbital period is 1 year, etc. So if we say Earth is 1 Astronomical Unit from the sun and know that Mars averages about 1.52 AU from the sun, then we know that Mars completes one orbit in time T where T = 1.52^1.5 = 1.87 years which is about 684 days. Actually it\u0027s 687, but close enough since we\u0027re using approximations, and mid-course corrections don\u0027t tend to cost a lot of fuel. \u003Cp\u003ENow imagine you want to do a hohmann transfer orbit between Earth and Mars. That means your orbit will have a perihelion of 1 AU and an apohelion of 1.52. That makes your semi-major axis equal to 1.26 AU. That means your orbital period is 1.26^1.5 years = about 1.4 years. You want to rendezvous with Mars, so you\u0027re interested in the outbound leg of this journey, so total transfer time is half that; about 0.7 years. So you want to launch 0.7 years before Mars reaches the point where it\u0027ll be 180 degrees from your present location. That\u0027s 0.7 / 1.87 = 0.37 of a Martian orbit. Times that by 360 to get 136 degrees. So Mars should be 136 degrees behind the point that\u0027s directly opposite to the sun from where you are now. Subtract that from 180 degrees, and you get 44 degrees. So you want to launch when Mars is 44 degrees ahead of you in its orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to apply that maths to the Kerbal universe, you need to measure Kerbin\u0027s orbital distance from the sun, and call that \u0022one Kerbal astronomical unit\u0022, or 1 KAU. It\u0027s always worth setting known values to 1 because it makes the maths so much simpler. Then, all other planets\u0027 orbital distances can be measured in KAUs. Plug in those numbers, and you\u0027ll get your optimal launch timings. The same maths works for orbital rendezvous, you just have to remember that semi-major axis is measured from the centre of gravity, not from the surface. So if you\u0027re orbiting 100km above Kerbin (and Kerbin has a radius of 600km), then your semi-major axis is 700km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know, I\u0027m a crap teacher.
