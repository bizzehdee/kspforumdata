Instead we get this information at twitter and most important post a pic for the contest at twitter (this, in my opinion shows a disrespect to the KSP forum community), to top it off this info is made known to the KSP community via a member and not a moderator. I read this topic this morning (at my time zone), it\u0027s been 8 hours and no word from squad at this forum (i know, i know there is a time difference). I respect the dev\u0027s work that put into this game but the communication team should be more consistent when it comes to giving information about the game\u0027s development and not letting the community finding them via third persons. \n\nIn conclusion i am excited that the game will be released soon^TM^ and i will enjoy playing it since i have taken a hiatus at playing KSP but the way this information is shared with the game\u0027s main basis (forums) is bad\n\nP.S. i won\u0027t continue this rant since i don\u0027t want to spoil the hype that has started, just wanted to share my thoughts\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-17T10:26:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2015 10:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by kookoo\\_gr**"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T11:33:36Z","Content":"I have a theory.\n\nSquad is not a standard marketing company.

The counter-point that I\u0027m trying to make is that the forums are not the only official channel we have. Facebook, Twitter, KSP-TV and other places are also official channels we maintain. The form and depth of information often lead us to certain channels we can use: Maxmaps\u0027 dV announcement for example was a very short \u0022snippet\u0022 of information, by which I don\u0027t want to downplay its importance, but it was a very short update with no further detailed information. Twitter is perfect for this sort of thing, and like I pointed out earlier these snippets won\u0027t work well on the forums. \n\u003E \n\u003E Could we also post this to the forums? Yes, there\u0027s nothing technically stopping us from doing that, but why would the forums get all the information where other official channels don\u0027t? Well, as many people argued a lot of the \u0027hard core\u0027 fanbase resides here, but is that really enough of a reason to refrain from posting information exclusively elsewhere? We have a great community and this sort of information always finds its way onto the forums, where someone gets to have their 15 minutes of fame for discovering a new piece of the 1.0 puzzle, and I think that in itself is a good argument not to post everything here. I know many of you will disagree with me here (and in the past I probably would have disagreed with myself on this point), but the hunt for small bits of information regarding development is a great part of a community.\n\nSO, yeah, they really are geared towards the multi-platform hype machine.

Hype is useful to sell the game.\n\nMy issue is that they exclusively use other sources, and the information only gets posted to the forum if a user posts it. Very rarely is an official representative of Squad the one bringing the information to the forum. Yes, there are the occasional blog posts. Those are few and far between. There\u0027s also the Dev Notes every Tuesday. Those do get posted to the forum, but Squad also goes to the effort to post those to reddit and their dev blog.\n\nAs a recent example, Squad recently decided to take down the 64-bit Windows version of the game from Steam. People posted a large number of threads here, asking what was going on, why their game wasn\u0027t working, etc. As far as I know, Squad has not yet addressed the issue on their own forum. Users located a post by a dev on the forum for Orbiter. How many Steam users were affected by this? How many of them would know to go to the other forum to find out that this was a deliberate action by the company, and not a bug? Why wouldn\u0027t the company address the questions posted *to their own website*?\n\nThe issues have been brought up with Squad before. Their employee said that they understood, and in the future they would use the forum.

They want to maximize audience numbers, but not the number of people in their audience. Say they make announcements only through twitter. That gets them lots of twitter followers. But by alternating between twitter and facebook they force fans to subscribe to both. So now they have twitter followers AND facebook followers, even though they know they are the same people. The end goal is to have all of us \u0027hooked in\u0027 though lots of different media platforms. That maximizes Squad\u0027s numbers, apparent buzz, while in truth we know its all a farce.\n\nWhy do they want us so connected? Why does facebook want people to use facebook? Why does twitter want people to use Twitter? So they can farm users for marketable data. As a gaming company Squad should not treat customers this way.

I\u0027m not a marketing person, but it seems to me that many marketing campaigns begin with small cryptic teasers of some sort.\n\nA medium like Twooter is well suited for dropping a small, potentially cryptic, remark which gets people thinking, wondering, guessing.\n\nA medium like the forum, which is essentially dialogue based, may not be well suited for such an objective.\n\nWe may not like it, but they have no obligation to announce things the way that we would find most enjoyable.\n\nIt\u0027s probably going to be a better ride for us if we accept that SQUAD is really who\u0027s in the pilot\u0027s seat and try to enjoy the ride, rather than being back-seat drivers pilots.\n\nI know I don\u0027t want to spend the next ten days being angry and frustrated.\n\nHappy landings!"}]}
