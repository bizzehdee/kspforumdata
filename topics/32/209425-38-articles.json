KSP itself can\u0027t ever use more than 4GB RAM at present on Windows or OSX. Running a 64-bit OS on a 64-bit CPU doesn\u0027t change that, due to the Unity engine having critical flaws which prevent it working on those platforms in 64-bit mode. Linux KSP does run ok as 64-bit, as the Unity flaws don\u0027t bite there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that said, however, more than 4GB RAM will help KSP performance on all platforms, since KSP is not the only thing using RAM. The OS itself can easily use 1GB RAM, and it\u0027s common for people to have various other widgets/gadgets/apps/whatever running at the same time. All those other things use RAM, so having more than 4GB helps to ensure that there\u0027s actually 4GB available for the KSP process itself, preventing the system losing performance from excessive paging activity (virtual memory / swap).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: So, to answer the OP\u0027s question, I\u0027d definitely prioritise getting more RAM, as 2GB is actually pretty tight these days. If the motherboard supports it, get at least 4GB \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC RAM pretty cheap, and pretty much the #1 thing you need to ensure good performance, as the performance penalty from having too little RAM is the most severe penalty you\u0027ll ever hit (once a system starts paging heavily, performance vanishes rapidly).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-31T15:35:24Z\u0022 title=\u002212/31/2013 03:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Murph\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T15:29:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Skylid\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Skylid\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks guys,\u003Cp\u003Eill probably upgrade my RAM due to the fact that my budget is less than 100 dollars.
