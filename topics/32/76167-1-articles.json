So like any science-hungry pilot, I set my rocket at a low level of thrust so it would slowly fly back upwards while I jumped out of the crew hatch.

So now all three kerbnauts were outside of the only vehicle which could land safely. Panicking again I jammed the quick-load button, but I confused it with the quick-save button, thereby erasing the earlier save and ensuring that THIS was the situation I would have to deal with.
