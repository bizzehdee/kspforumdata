But at the same time, I believe lift isn\u0027t the problem here. I think the direct problem is the massive drag.\n\n\u003E ![rmuUn1T.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/rmuUn1T.jpg)\n\u003E ![HnddX38.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/HnddX38.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![cqo2oUP.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/cqo2oUP.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Shuttle design, for referece.\n\nThe shuttle can keep its nose up and do a nice glide on as low speed as 80m/s, or even at 60m/s, given the right angle. So, it definitely has enough lift.\n\nBut I don\u0027t think a shuttle like this should naturally slow down to 30m/s before touching ground, from a deorbit, without using any kind of airbreakers.\n\nFor this example - as I would normally fly -, I came in a traditional approach. Not too shallow, not too steep. You can see that there\u0027s more than enough lift on the ship. Nevertheless, the speed is decreasing fast: 17m/s in less than 10 seconds, whithout any kind of speedbrakes.\n\nI noticed, though, that if I come in a pretty steep approach, and lifting the nose up in the last seconds, then I\u0027ll have enough speed to land without stalling to death."},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T06:35:47Z","Content":"Roflcopterkklol, how many threads have you made about this now?\n\nSal\\_vager already said if you keep spamming the same subject, the threads will keep being closed.
