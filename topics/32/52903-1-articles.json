It began with me landing on a snowy-like celestial body. I could almost guarantee it was Eeloo. Coincidentally the only planet I haven\u0027t gone to yet. I was getting pretty close to landing. All of a sudden I heard a bump, it\u0027s hard to describe. It wasn\u0027t a horror-movie bump but a deep, low kind of bump. It was silent, about 50m from surface and 2 bumps this time, the same sound. Then I finally landed. Then the bump got WAYY higher in volume, and all of a sudden green squid-like creatures came out of nowhere and started attacking the ship, it took about 2 seconds for the green squid-like creatures to explode the ship. After the ship was destroyed a LOOUDD screamer popped up, I don\u0027t remember what it was of, but it was pretty dang loud. It was so creepy and scary because it happened so suddenly, and everything went black after everything was destroyed. I remember seeing a Manley video (WTF) on these monsters, and it again was on Eeloo. The same thing happened, I don\u0027t exactly remember what Scott said, or even how it went. I do remember scrolling down to the comments and people saying things like \u0022I CRAPPED MY PANTS\u0022 \u0022THAT SCARED ME SO BAD\u0022 bla.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could totally see this happening for April Fools or Halloween or something similar.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaiier","CreatedById":22833,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T00:09:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKraken babies!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Akinesis","CreatedById":71042,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T00:09:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I read this just before I go to sleep...
