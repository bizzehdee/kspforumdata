For example we have nothing in this game that comes close to the solid boosters used to get the Spaceshuttle into space; same thing is the comparison to the Saturn V. Our biggest Tanks are 2.5m in diameter (with mods 3.5m ?!), Saturn V was 10m.

Kerbin\u0027s radius is one-tenth that of Earth, and one hundredth of its mass; this gives it the same surface gravity as Earth (9.8 m/s^2), but a far smaller orbital velocity. This makes spaceplanes easy, as it\u0027s not a lot of work to go from a cruising speed of Mach 3 to an orbital speed of Mach 5-6, whereas on Earth you need to go Mach 25 in low orbit.

It\u0027s all a bit of a bother, really.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: A very important client?

They are all very wealthy and powerful beings, and I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll understand that they enjoy their anonymity. But I will say that you\u0027d never have gotten this interview if the Mice were not very big fans of space travel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Mice are big fans of space travel?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: Certainly.

OK, let\u0027s get right to tonight\u0027s topic. Is there any truth to the rumor that Magratheans did the design and construction work for Squad on the Kerbol planetary system?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: I\u0027ve already told you, we don\u0027t discuss our clients.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Well then, hypothetically speaking, could you tell us if it\u0027s possible to design a solar system with these specifications?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(BROTORO hands Slartibartfast a sheet of paper. Slartibartfast glances over it briefly.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: Ah, yes... Miniature planets are adorable, aren\u0027t they? They were all the rage with a certain portion of our clientele.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: So it\u0027s possible to construct a solar system matching those specifications?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: Certainly. We Magratheans pride ourselves on being able to build any kind of planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: But look at the densities of those planets. Most of them have densities greater than any known element.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: That\u0027s not a problem. We use black holes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Black holes? But wouldn\u0027t a black hole inside a planet just swallow it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: No, no. We use spherical force field bubbles centered around small black holes. We can adjust the mass of the black hole and radius of the force shell to get any planet density desired, then cover it with the mantle and crust material of the client\u0027s choice. It\u0027s a very flexible system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: So you\u0027re saying that Kerbin is mostly hollow inside, with some old rocky material thrown on top?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: No. More like the inner one third is hollow. And I assure you we use only the finest ingredients when building our planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Wouldn\u0027t these force field bubbles require energy to maintain their structure?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: Certainly they require energy. We just allow a small amount of matter from the lower mantle to trickle through openings in the sphere. As the matter falls into the gravity well of the black hole, the energy equivalent to a sizable fraction of its rest mass is released as radiation before it crosses the event horizon. That radiated energy is captured and used by the force field bubble, which also acts as a Dyson sphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Dyson sphere? So do Magratheans know about Freeman Dyson?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: Who? You misunderstood me. I used the Magrathean term for \u0022spherical mega-structure that captures all radiated energy from a central power source,\u0022 and that little fish I put in your ear translated the concept into a term you are familiar with. I\u0027ve never heard of a freemandyson.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Ah, so that\u0027s what the fish was for. I thought it was a quaint Magrathean greeting or something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: You\u0027re sitting there wearing a digital watch, and you think my people are quaint?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: But wait... If Kerbin has no liquid iron core inside, how could it have a magnetic field?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: Does Kerbin have a magnetic field?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Um... well, I\u0027m not sure. The developers haven\u0027t given us any magnetometers yet, but I just assumed it did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: And it well might. Magnetic fields are easy. We would just need to orbit a ring of charged matter around the black hole inside the force sphere. Adjusting the charge on the matter can give the client any magnetic field desired, and the inclination of the ring can offset the magnetic pole from the rotational axis if desired. Any field strength can be tailored for the client, although it\u0027s easier for us if they want a simple dipole. Haven\u0027t you wondered why Jool has such a weak magnetic field for a jovian planet?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: It does?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: Of course. If it didn\u0027t, the planet would have powerful radiation belts, and any kerbal you sent in there for aerobraking would be late.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Late?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: Yes. As in, \u0022The late Jebediah Kerman.\u0022 Ah hum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: . . .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: I don\u0027t understand why Earthmen always stare at me blankly when I use that line.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: I\u0027m just wondering how you know about Jebediah Kerman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: It\u0027s the Babelfish again. I just used the Magrathean word for \u0022bad-ass space pilot,\u0022 and the fish did the rest in conjunction with your primitive brain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Well. What about Kerbol, the sun of the system? How could something with that low of a mass possibly support thermonuclear fusion?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: I\u0027m not part of our stellar division... I work on the planets, and I specialize in doing coastlines... but there are two different ways we handle miniature stars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: One way involves black holes?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: Both ways do. In one method, we simply make the force sphere around the black hole small enough that the density and pressure in the overlying hydrogen-rich material is sufficient to maintain thermonuclear reactions at the rate needed for the desired luminosity. The second way involves simply letting sufficient matter flow through the force sphere and into the black hole to provide the desired luminosity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Which method did you use for Kerbol?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: I didn\u0027t say we made Kerbol. I was speaking hypothetically. Why don\u0027t you just measure the neutrino flux coming out of Kerbol... then you could tell if there are fusion reactions going on inside of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Well... again... we don\u0027t have any neutrino detectors as yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: You really do need to take more interest in your greater environment. If you\u0027re not paying attention to things outside your planet, terrible things could happen to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Yes, thank you. But what about Minmus?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: What about it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: The developers tell us that it\u0027s made of ice, but that can\u0027t possibly be the case given its distance from the sun, can it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: Kerbin, like your own planet Earth, is located at a distance from the sun where the equilibrium temperature is below the freezing point of water. If not for their natural greenhouse effects, the oceans on both bodies would be frozen over. The temperature is even lower when you are dealing with a surface that has a very high albedo, like ice, since that reflects away most of the incoming energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Yes, yes, I know all that. But Minmus has no atmosphere. Its surface is in vacuum. And water ice would sublime directly into a gas and escape into space at the equilibrium temperature of Minmus. Minmus should be a gigantic comet!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: Ah, I see. Young Hargledertfirst of our small moon department solved that problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBROTORO: Did he?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLARTIBARTFAST: She. She engineered a microorganism that was active in the small moon\u0027s water during its early warm phases. The organism excretes a clear polymer as a waste product...kind of like a resin. All of the ice on the small moon contains a small percentage of this polymer.

I think Kerbin would look much better with more fjords on the coastlines. I always try to put a lot of fjords on a planet, but the managers always say it\u0027s too much. A lot of my work got erased.

I am not that good in english so pls forgive me my bad style.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter playing this game for 100 hours i started to ask me why all designs in KSP are so far away from the real Rockets used. For example we have nothing in this game that comes close to the solid boosters used to get the Spaceshuttle into space; same thing is the comparison to the Saturn V. Our biggest Tanks are 2.5m in diameter (with mods 3.5m ?!), Saturn V was 10m. Everything in this game is just small compared to the real ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this cause of problems with the simulation engine?

The sun in this system is over a hundred times smaller than our Sun, which actually means it\u0027s about ten times too small to actually BE a star. (Minimum size for nuclear fusion is about 0.08 solar masses.) Kerbin\u0027s radius is one-tenth that of Earth, and one hundredth of its mass; this gives it the same surface gravity as Earth (9.8 m/s^2), but a far smaller orbital velocity. This makes spaceplanes easy, as it\u0027s not a lot of work to go from a cruising speed of Mach 3 to an orbital speed of Mach 5-6, whereas on Earth you need to go Mach 25 in low orbit. (It also means that Kerbin\u0027s density is about ten times as much as Earth\u0027s, which isn\u0027t actually possible.)\u003Cp\u003ESo while the basic laws of physics might still be reflected in KSP, it\u0027s not even close to a simulator of our own star system.
