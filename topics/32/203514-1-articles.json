The process is reasonably well-documented in the first few images of my Retrosolar Rescue challenge album here:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/5URWb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/5URWb\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0 If you want to do it that way, you should launch around 5.2 years before a regular Jool transfer window. The\u00A0first of these which you can use for this happens on Y6, d413 by my calculation, and then another will occur about every 472.5 days after that. So your first launch date should be somewhere around Y1, d 327, or any integral multiple of 472.5 days after that. If you really want to do it with just one assist, then you\u0027ll have no choice but to boost directly to the Kerbin 2:1-resonant orbit (i.e. a period of ~852 days), and then do what was my second DSM from the AP of that.\u00A0 For that you will want to launch around 2.2 rather than 5.2 years before a regular Jool launch window, since you\u0027ll only be doing the one orbit before your gravity assist. For that you could actually use the third Jool transfer window in the game, which happens on Y3, d275, for a launch date around Y1, d190.\u00A0 These numbers may not be 100% accurate, because my estimate of an extra 0.2 years is unfortunately just that, but there will be a decent amount of wiggle room on your second gravity assist if you find yourself coming in ahead of or behind Jool. Anyway, that was probably a fairly bewildering explanation, but if you look at my pix and then fiddle about some, I think you\u0027ll find its not as hard to work out as all that made it sound.\u00A0 Just make sure to fly to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E like 40 days ahead of the launch dates I suggested and quicksave as soon as you get there, in case you need to move your ejection burn forward or back.\u00A0 You probably won;t need to, but if you do, whatever the phase angle is between your Jool orbit intersect and the target position marker from your best gravity assist, just move your ejection burn\u00A0that many degrees forward/back in Kerbin\u0027s orbit on the next attempt and it should work fine.
