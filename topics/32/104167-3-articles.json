No, the lack of torque on the probe cores is STILL an issue that I hope Squad will fix by giving us at least minimal torque on all probe cores. But there is no use to keep harping on it. We made the requests to Squad, and they can either choose to take their customers\u0027 requests into account, or they can just ignore us. We won\u0027t know which they choose to do until we see the next update.\n\nSame with our love for the Round8 LFO tank. We are making our arguments and requests, which Squad can decide to either heed or ignore. Happily, we found out about this BEFORE the update came out, so we can let Squad know this change will make us unhappy (for no good reason that I can see, since they could simply make a new 1.25-meter Xenon tank) in time for them to change their minds.\n\nAnd when we stop talking about this in a couple weeks, will it be because we no longer CARE about the Round8 LFO tank?

The back end is finished and has some nice little features which modders should enjoy. The Kerbal experience traits boost the ship/part they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re on and can have some very funky effects. Currently these include boosting thrust, reducing heat generation, increasing fuel efficiency and boosting science output. Obviously, the performance boosting effects have to be quite subtle to not make things too easy but will still provide a solid boost should you care for your Kerbals.\n\nRemember how they didn\u0027t change that to a better system at all, despite our complaining?\n\nAnd then when they released with that system, and we all disowned squad, and quit ksp?"},{"CreatedByName":"BagelRabbit","CreatedById":95028,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T20:19:14Z","Content":"Here\u0027s my thoughts on the \u0022death\u0022 of the Round-8.\n\nOkay, first of all. Why are you repurposing an existing part at all, SQUAD? This strikes me as a bit of a poor choice. It indicates that you seem to have no desire to make new parts, for one thing. I understand that you\u0027re pressed for time and that you want to release 1.0 \u0022on schedule...\u0022 but using a part with the same appearance for a different purpose is sloppy, in my opinion.\n\nThe Round-8 toroidal fuel tank currently looks nothing like any part used to store or burn xenon. It lacks both the texture, the color, and the general \u0027feel\u0027 of the Xenon tanks. In other words, to make it look compatible with all of the other parts, it needs to have its appearance adjusted... and if its appearance is adjusted, the reason for nixing the original Toroidal Fuel Tank is suddenly gone!\n\nFurthermore, toroidal fuel tanks are very useful for storing a little extra propellant in a nonintrusive way. Many people have used them, and continue to use them, as an \u0027adapter\u0027 between 1.25m and 0.625m parts or at the top or bottom of stages to add a little flair (I really love putting the basic jet intake on top of them; the appearance is marvelous). Their gold color has graced many an Apollo replica and their springiness has helped with everything from lander suspension to scary glitchy toroidal springs of death. As you can clearly see with this thread and others, they are a rather beloved part that has found its niche. Repurposing it has been almost unanimously rejected by the community, and for good reason.\n\nI would also like to throw in the following in general: SQUAD, as a marketing company, *you really should be looking at feedback from others, both positive and negative, wherever you can get it*. It will tell you when you\u0027re doing things right and when you\u0027re doing things wrong. We are your community. We are the reason for your success today. You are trying to market your game to us, and if we disapprove of your decisions, no matter how great you think the game is, we\u0027ll stop playing or lose interest more quickly. This may sound harsh, but it\u0027s the truth. Keep this in mind.\n\nThat\u0027s really all there is to say.\n\n-Upsilon\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-15T20:22:48Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2015 08:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by UpsilonAerospace**"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T20:21:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You sir, are in a minority.
