Today the usual method seems the same, except you turn over at 11km. But when I launch, I begin my turn gently at 5000 meters or so, just 5 degrees to the east. I then take it in steps by the speed my rocket builds up, going halfway to the 45-degree marker at 250-300m/s, then to 45 degees at 500-600m/ms, halfway from there to horizontal at 800-900 m/s and flat out around 1200m/s. This saves an amount of launcher fuel you wouldn\u0027t believe! Plus it makes launch a slightly more hands-on approach, which is good because let\u0027s face it, after a few hundred launches they all start to look the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027m thinking that this may have to do with the way I design launchers. Serial staging means you have a fairly wide range to thrust-to-weight ratio as you drain fuel from each stage. The Munshine V goes from something like 1.2 to 3\u002B on the first stage. Putting a lot of that high-end TWR into horizontal velocity makes sense, atmosphere be damned. Asparagus launchers, of course, maintain a far more even TWR throughout the flight and this may affect the ideal launch profile. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s your basic launch profile and what are your thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T17:34:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI start turning once my altitude hits 10Km, and get to around 45 degrees before hitting 20km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI turn all the way towards the horizon as soon as my apoapsis goes over 45-50km and keep it there until I increase my apoapsis to the desired height.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis leaves me with having to make only a relatively small burn (a few hundred m/s dV) to circularize once my craft reaches apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SofusRud","CreatedById":59276,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T17:44:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI start my turn at around 10km, then i gradually lead my prograde marker towards the horizon.
