Also I remapped the RCS control to the numeric keypad, which made things a lot easier for me. I now use the 4, 8, 6, and 2 for left, up, right and down. 7 and 1 for forward an backwards. Also, for the sake of practice be sure to use a light command pod \u0027cause these are way easier to control than the remote guidance units.\u003Cp\u003EHopes this helps!

If the ship your attempting to dock with doesn\u0027t translate / strafe / slide sideways well you\u0027ll make your life infinitely harder. When you\u0027re building your rendezvous ship check the center of mass for the bit that\u0027s going to dock and make sure you\u0027ve got your RCS about equidistant around that center of mass. Also - only use four way symmetry, turn on snap to face, and make sure your RCS are top / bottom / left-side / right-side - this is so that when you try and translate your thrusters aren\u0027t pointing off at strange angles. If you need extra oomph because you\u0027re trying to push around a fat orange rocko tank then add two more sets of four-way symmetric, don\u0027t go for the eight way symmetry. When you\u0027re first trying to dock there is almost no way to have too much RCS gas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, closing that last mile. Make sure you\u0027ve aligned your orbital planes - if you don\u0027t know how to do that, ask and I\u0027ll go into more detail. Get into an orbit that\u0027s co-planar, and about 5km above or below your target, whichever is necessary to catch up or let your target catch up with you. Just remember \u0022You take the high road, I\u0027ll take the low road and I\u0027ll be in Scotland before ye!\u0022 Higher orbits are slower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait until you get close to your target and your navball switches to \u0022Target\u0022 instead of \u0022Orbit\u0022. Wait until you get within about 10Km. Now, the prograde and retrograde and velocity markers on the navball are relative to your target. Burn retro until your velocity is close to zero. Now, burn towards your target. You\u0027ll need to adjust as you go. You can try and use RCS translate, but it\u0027s usually easier to just turn and burn. Burning causes the prograde marker to move towards your heading and the retrograde marker to move away from your heading. So if your prograde marker isn\u0027t lined up with the target marker, draw an imaginary line from the prograde, through the target marker and then put your heading on that line and burn. Your prograde indicator will move towards your heading and be pulled onto the target - meaning you are now moving towards your target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWatch your speed. It\u0027s far too easy to go way too fast. I usually aim for a speed equal to my distance in km x 10 in M/s. So if I\u0027m 5Km away, go 50 m/s. Once you get to 4Km slow to 40m/s. Slowing down gradually gives you a chance to figure out how well this thing stops and handles before you\u0027re way too close. Once you get closer than about 500m you can start using the translate controls (I\u0027ve never bothered with the special docking controls) to adjust your heading. Once you get within 50-100m or so right click select a docking port. Now your target and prograde markers are relative to that docking port. Try to get your ship on-axis with the port and then gently thrust forward. Like ... 0.2m/s gently. Once you get close enough you\u0027ll start getting pulled forward. Sometimes they just immediately dock, sometimes they flail around a bit first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget to put a headlight on the ship you\u0027ll be docking with! You\u0027ll thank me when you rendezvous in the middle of the night or the docking port is in shade.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
