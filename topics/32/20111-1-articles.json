I never really have had a flight stick for pc. Only consoles, go figure. But with ksp, I decided I had to get a flight stick for IVA, and well worth it for flying space planes. I got myself the Attack 3 cause of it\u0027s low cost. Too bad it lacks a z-axis rotation. Enough buttons for doing commands such as brakes, your yaw and ASAS commands. Setting new efficiency records on my flights too. What joystick do you use and how is yours configured? On mine, the buttons beside the joystick I use for gears, braking and rcs toggle. On the joystick buttons, I use a left and right button for my yaw, and the ASAS toggle and trigger in the middle. Having a trigger for stage separation just makes launches more fun as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: swapped my rcs toggle and stage separator buttons after accidental stage triggerings.
