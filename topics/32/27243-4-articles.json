I do use Mechjeb for most of the actual flying, as piloting a rocket is a lot more challenging than a plane, and frankly some of the concepts and even terminology used, are admittedly over my head. My current goal is to get an unmanned rover onto the surface of Duna, but alas, it seems my project management skills are as poor as my rocket piloting skills, as each rover has overshot Duna and drifted off into deep space.

The Bearcat is also the size of the Poodle: an excellent choice for lander engines that double as propulsion for the support module that carries them.
