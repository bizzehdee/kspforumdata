I resemble that remark! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIn all honesty, I have no objection to the female Kerbals anymore. My original stance against them was based almost solely on a perceived waste of development time, but the more I thought about it, the more inclined I became to believe that if it made little girls feel better about themselves, and increased the chances they\u0027d be interested in space exploration and other scientific fields, then it was entirely cool by me.\n\nAt a theoretical level I wish we lived in a world where this stuff didn\u0027t matter and Kerbals being androgynous would allow either gender to identify with them equally, but we obviously don\u0027t live in that world, so at a practical level I consider this to be a good thing.\n\nI still do hope that Squad hasn\u0027t stepped into a big old pile of gender conflict with this which winds up causing more trouble down the road, but now that it\u0027s done, nothing really to do there but keep our fingers crossed."},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T03:17:55Z","Content":"Awesome!
