So far, so good. But a set of equations is just a machine, mechanically crunching inputs into outputs. Thus, the results are only as good as the inputs. So the heat system must answer 2 questions. First, is the heat system a valid model for KSP and, second, what are the best inputs for it? When you reply to this thread, please try to answer both questions.\n\nI spend a fair amount of time playing around with the heat system in my mod, so I think I am slowly developing a fairly good understanding of how both the 1.02 and 1.04 models function.\n\nI think you\u0027re absolutely right in that it\u0027s difficult to balance for all planets simultaneously, which is why I personally favor the solution of having different heatshields for different purposes. So, a 1.25m heatshield might only be good for reentering small vessels (mass plays a big role in reentry survivability as it essentially determines how long you have to be able to handle it, since a heavier vehicle will decelerate less rapidly, but still sustain the same amount of heat per second at any given velocity and altitude) from LKO, a 2.5m might be good for a Munar return, and a 3.75 might be good for aerobraking at Jool.\n\nI think the biggest problem the system is having right now is that all heatshields are trying to work for all purposes. Especially in career mode, having them be suitable for different things helps emphasize progression, and even in sandbox, it would introduce an additional vehicle design consideration in terms of the mass of shield you\u0027d need for different things.\n\nOf course, basing this on only 3 shield types becomes a bit of an issue, but I think if the number of shields were fleshed out more this could be a viable method of balancing heat in stock as well.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I haven\u0027t tried it in 1.04. I did in 1.0 and had no issues on Duna.\n\nDuna has an extremely thin atmosphere, and thus is unlikely to ever be particularly deadly.\n\n\u003E 1.0.4 introduced a whole new heat system which, from what I can tell of its inner workings, is considerably more rational and \u0022realistic\u0022 than what we had in 1.0.2. So far, so good.\n\nOh, on this point, I will disagree: I\u0027ve spent a fair amount of time tweaking the 1.04 heat system now, and in comparison to that in 1.02, think that if anything it\u0027s just made thing much harder to understand what\u0027s going on from a player point of view, and also made it MUCH more difficult to balance as you\u0027re working with a greater number of variables that can have rather ambiguous interactions with each other. I really don\u0027t think it\u0027s added any perceptible depth or flexibility to the system either and am entirely uncertain why it was changed in the way it was.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-29T21:54:17Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2015 09:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FlowerChild**"},{"CreatedByName":"Caelib","CreatedById":59329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T21:42:18Z","Content":"I voted \u0022Other\u0022 because I believe aerocaptures to be unrealistic and unnecessary when you can do a gravity brake ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T21:50:20Z","Content":"Voted other: I usually don\u0027t bother putting heat shields, I just hit the atmosphere and brake with drag.

The new system seems to be fundamentally more rational than the old but of course is quite new and in need of serious tweaking. Because one of the things the new heat system did was increase the amount of reentry heat for the same slider setting by a factor of about 4x (probably somewhere between 4-5x). Regardless of the underlying model, that is a dramatic change that has far-reaching consequences.\n\nBTW, has anybody else noted how the maxTemp of many parts has been raised to 2400 in 1.0.4? I haven\u0027t seen anybody mention that. I do recall back in the early days of 1.0 that Squad said they\u0027d lowered maxTemps to 2000 \u0022for realism\u0022. I guess the retreat from that position is Squad recognizing that 1.0.4 makes too much heat so they did this in partial compensation.

It\u0027s actually cheaper and MUCH easier just to use the \u0022MOAR fuel\u0022 option and simply avoid touching atmospheres at interplanetary speeds.

Enough airbrakes and your ship wouldn\u0027t make flames at all. But in 1.0.4, they reduced drag besides changing the heat model, so I\u0027ve seen a different result. In my testing, I see no difference in heat at all between using airbrakes and not, at least at Jool. All the brakes do is lower your post-aero Ap. In theory, this could reduce heat by letting you use a higher Pe. Problem is, though, that at Jool you normally don\u0027t need (or want) to go deeper than about 190km, which is only 5% into the atmosphere. With such a shallow penetration, there\u0027s no significant difference in heat between 190km and 195km.\n\nBut maybe Jool is a special case.
