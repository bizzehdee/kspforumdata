For instance, right now I\u0027m playing with the stock parts in the stock solar system, which feels pretty well balanced. But later, I might want to install Outer Planets Mod, which gives much more distant destinations, and TAC Life Support, which makes flight duration a much more serious issue, so I\u0027ll probably also want to install something like KSPI or Near Future Propulsion to make up for that increase in difficulty, KW to make it a little easier to build super-heavy lifters that still superficially resemble rockets (and have a civilized part-count!), maybe even Extraplanetary Launchpads so I can build my big interplanetary ships on Minmus instead of on Kerbin. Still a challenge, still limited, just not the original challenge. Trying to do a harder thing, but working with better tools. And as an added bonus, the future-tech stuff means more tech nodes to research, which means more incentive to keep collecting science. \n\nThe downside, of course, is I\u0027m no longer up against the same challenge as everybody else, so comparisons between my achievements and everyone else\u0027s get a little less meaningful. Which is one reason I\u0027ll probably always play mostly-stock at least part of the time."},{"CreatedByName":"TeddyDD","CreatedById":28806,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T10:06:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What if there were no mods?

There are several mods I\u0027ve used, and will use again (KAS is fun to build with, KA is incredibly useful, DRE and TAC add a lot, and I like the challenge of RemoteTech, PreciseNode incredibly useful, etc.)\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 but at the heart of it, Stock (for me) is about the challenge of staying within the limits laid down by the designer.\n\nThere\u0027s a game within a game - the developer lays down a challenge and the rules, and the player sees if they can rise to that challenge. A first-person shooter with an infinite ammo code isn\u0027t the challenge the designers released to the wild, although it might be fun. Getting to Jool is pretty easy via hyperedit. So at least at first, I like accepting the challenge as described. That\u0027s all. Nothing special or magical.\n\nYep, they made it movable so (wonderfully!) if I *don\u0027t* like that challenge, or want a *new* challenge, I\u0027ve got plenty ready and waiting.\n\nDisclaimer: that\u0027s just me. I may be weird. But\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 it\u0027s a wonderfully wild, weird, diverse community.

And while I don\u0027t do it professionally, spacecraft theory \u0026 design is something of a passion of mine. So *for me*, doing all those calculations like delta-v, launch window timing, gravity assists, etc. *is FUN*. Being able to \u0022do it myself\u0022 is actually one of the reasons I play. With a simple calculator, a pencil, and lined paper by my side. Yeah, that\u0027s incredibly strange to some folks I know\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 but being able to actually DO the science and engineering is why I went into the fields of study I did in the first place.

Truly, adding the latter numbers for your first stage, dividing by ten, and then dividing that number by the weight of your ship does not seem to me like too much to ask of the player. Calculating the vacuum deltaV of a given stage from those numbers is a little more complex, but if I really felt like I needed to know that number exactly, it would take me about 5 minutes to cook up a spreadsheet to do it, and believe me I\u0027m no math whiz. Now back in the day before Vanilla even told you how much your ship weighed, THEN it was a real pain in the end that should not point towards space. The funny thing though is that even though I\u0027ve sucessfully completed the Jool 5 challenge (too lazy to post it all for the badge, but I will one of these days), and have done countless other fairly difficult missions, I\u0027ve never actually once calculated the vacuum deltaV of any of my stages exactly. In a few cases, I\u0027ve estimated it by burning for a set amount of time/fuel in a circular LKO and scratching out a few numbers on a piece of paper. If your stage has a given TWR and burn time ( burn time is easily calculated from the engine description in the parts tabs and the amount of fuel in your stage), you basically just multiply those two numbers by each other then by 10, and that\u0027s your minimum deltaV! In reality of course it will be more than that, especially if the stage you\u0027re calculating for has a significant percentage of its weight in fuel. But generally speaking, you want to have that added cushion anyway, because it is almost never a good idea to embark on a big mission with exactly the minimum amount of fuel you need to do it. That\u0027s all I\u0027ve ever needed to do to complete all those missions, and I\u0027ve never really gotten burned for it once.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T19:20:45Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 07:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by herbal space program**"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T18:43:16Z","Content":"If I may comment on this thread, my situation is almost the exact opposite of the O.P.\n\nWhen I first started playing KSP v.19 there were already a bunch of mods available for it, and I grabbed as many as I could when I first started.\n\nAs the game has continued in it\u0027s development, I\u0027ve slowly reduced the number of mods I\u0027ve used until now I only play the stock game.

I was a classic stock player until I first downloaded B9, Kethane, and KW; then I was hooked. Sure some have come and gone like Kethane, but I\u0027ve found others like Near Future, the Cryogenic engines mod, KAS, and every one of RoverDude\u0027s mods that just expand what you can do exponentially. I want Kerbals on eva to do something rather than just take the chance of flying off or using them to push a spent rockomax fuel tank out of the way - hence KAS/KIS. The Outer Planets mod is another one of these that just expand what you can do in the game. Have I explored every planet and need somewhere else to go, no, but sometimes I don\u0027t want to go to Duna again and again. I just want to build a cool mothership and go somewhere else on a one off mission with different scenery. \n\nI\u0027ve found myself using more and more mods recently, actually I\u0027m surprised I haven\u0027t crashed in 1.0 yet, so I know the pain of mod and part overload. So many choices that you can\u0027t use every cool part or engine. Though when I go to cull some, it\u0027s always so difficult to pick which ones. Some of mine consist of beautification mods such as planet shine, engine lighting effects (name?), and EVE when it worked well back in 0.24-0.90 (it may still I don\u0027t know). These just make the whole experience more stunning. I want to be mesmerized when I round the Mun and see Kerbin over the horizon or come to the dark side of a planet and have the skybox fade into view and resemble our Milky Way with texture replacer and distant object enhancement. I also download part mods to expand my design choices. I never thought about using the Mk2 spaceplane parts from stock since the form factors just didn\u0027t suite me. Now that I found the Mk2 stock expansion set, everything\u0027s changed and I can\u0027t wait to build an SSTO or shuttle with the Mk2 parts. They\u0027re cool now. I play with whatever has good quality a la B9, KW, you know the type, and also fill a niche like the B9 spaceplane cockpits or the hydrogen fuel and ion engines from Near Future propulsion. \n\nI do sometimes envy the stock player though when I\u0027m still downloading mods after a release, but that just gives me a reason to play with the newest update changes until I start career again. I see nothing wrong with either side of the coin, but rather as a spectrum from no mods at all, to no stock parts and using Ven\u0027s stock expansion that replace even the Squad originals."},{"CreatedByName":"justidutch","CreatedById":99185,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T19:03:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I tend to start fresh on stock after every release for a while, then after a couple of weeks or a month, I go on a mod-downloading spree.
