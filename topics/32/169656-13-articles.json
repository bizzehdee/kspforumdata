It\u0027s been more than half a year since the final update was released and we are still waiting, I just wish people would update us more on these things, I payed for the full game so I would at least expect updates to be within a month or two, just like any other game, but we still haven\u0027t even gotten the update that allows for out of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E construction and I believe we are coming up on around a year since that update was released (please correct me if I am wrong), also, there are still a relentless amount of loading bugs and memory leaks that take tolls on console players to the point of where crashes are extremely common. All I ask is that we are alerted more on the situation of KSP:EE development because being kept in the dark is a little bit odd and makes me think that they don\u0027t take the console edition seriously. People often buy consoles like the PS4 or XBox One in order to have a more budget friendly gaming experience, while the PC gamers have singular parts in their computers that cost more than a console, and I think it is good that a small portion of gamers on console are willing to brave the rough experience of console, which not even the great Matt Lowne could conquer with much success without taking weeks to relearn a game he already plays on computer. I am starting to go off topic here, so all I want to ask of the devs again, is that we are more updated on the situations of the updates.
