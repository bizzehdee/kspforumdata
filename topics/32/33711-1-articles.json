Especially the 78 m/s slow down in order to get to Duna. The best mun slingshot I\u0027ve ever done has put my apehelion about halfway to Duna, and that was because I was very lucky and very careful. It took me another 300\u002B m/s burn at munar periaps to get it the rest of the way there, and another 100 m/s at my secondary kerbin periaps to get my periapsis at Duna to be where I wanted it (intersecting Ike\u0027s orbit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, slingshotting around Ike when coming in is a very good delta-v investment. Assuming you don\u0027t want to aerocapture, which will become kind of difficult once proper re-entry heat is implemented, a 500-600m/s burn to slow down right as you enter Duna\u0027s SOI will give you an intercept with Ike that puts you on an elliptical orbit straight through Duna\u0027s atmosphere, allowing you to aerobrake at much more sane speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have yet to determine if slingshotting around the Mun upon return to the Kerbin system saves you any appreciable delta-v, but at least it makes aerobraking a more sensible in terms of heat stress on the spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
