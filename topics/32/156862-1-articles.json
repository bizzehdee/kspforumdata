Myself, I\u0027ve never done a return mission to Minmus. My first ship there had the objectives to deploy a relay satellite to high orbit, land on the surface, collect science data and return to Kerbin. However, after taking off from Minmus and achieving orbit I found that I didn\u0027t have enough fuel left to make it back*. I had sent the first module of a space station to Minmus shortly after I launched that landing flight, though, and since it took a while for the landing flight to circularize in high orbit to drop off the relay the station ended up arriving at just about the same time the lander was ready to take off from Minmus, so I just had it stick around and top off from the station transports\u0027 leftover fuel until it was finally ready to return home. After I got that station into place my next step was to land a mining base on the surface, and since then every ship I sent to that body has re-fueled before coming home; I\u0027ve never had a vessel make the journey both ways independently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Or at least I thought I didn\u0027t; I didn\u0027t know what kind of re-entry effects ships in KSP could handle back then so my plan was to re-circularize in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E before entering the atmosphere, which ate up a huge amount of fuel. These days I\u0027d probably either aerobrake to lower my AP or just put my PE low enough to re-enter immediately, but I didn\u0027t know that I could survive that back then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Theysen","CreatedById":144656,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-23T10:14:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNever returned from Eve or even tried to.
