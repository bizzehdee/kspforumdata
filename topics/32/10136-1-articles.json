Ask them here, and there\u0027s a better chance that somebody knowledgeable about the answer will respond. Craft files will be posted upon request... although I want to point out there are many people around here who are much more skilled than I at KSP, and some of their designs would probably work better for you. Also be aware that pre-.16 craft files will not work in KSP version .16 and later.\n\nSeriously, Youtube commenting is one of the worst mediums of communication *ever*. My mind is repeatedly boggled at the number of people who try to troubleshoot a complex problem via Youtube. ???\n\nThe channel is here: [Slipping the Surly Bonds](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheWinterOwl)\n\n**LINKS TO MODS**\n\nIf I missed listing a mod, please tell me so I can add it.
