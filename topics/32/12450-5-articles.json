You either get one that is made cheaply, and works cheaply, one that works decent, and is still made cheaply, or you spend 4-500 on one that is made well and works as intended. There really just hasn\u0027t been a good middle of the road joystick/hotas in years. Especially since Saitek was taken over by madcatz.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve owned alot of joysticks and hotas setups, and the only two I would bother spending money on again would be the saitek x55, or the warthog.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe saitek x55 is decent, but with most sub $300 joysticks/hotas it\u0027s light weight and cheap constriction are a letdown as soon as you take it out of the box. It has to be bolted down to something, and you easily feel the materials flex and bend while you use it, has a few driver issues but they are manageable. Sadly, this is the best sub $200\u00A0setup I\u0027ve tried.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there\u0027s the warthog. Great construction, great feel, works exactly as you expect. It does have pretty high resistance on the throttle levers, which to some is a turn off but I actually really like it. The biggest con? It can\u0027t be had for less than $400.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo like I said. There\u0027s really no mid range on them. Its either the 160$ saitek, or the $4-500 thrustmaster.\u00A0So if you can swing it you should just save for the higher range.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"colmo","CreatedById":25950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-26T03:14:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreat to see this thread still going strong.
