Given, Laythe looks nicer IMO, but with the amount of dV required to get there, plus the radiation (which would kill you without adequate protection), I still prefer Duna. Not to mention that rescue missions to Duna are a damn-sight easier, which I had to put into practice back in .19. Long story short; I was doing a supply drop to a base I had (with six Kerbals on board) and mis-judged my trajectory when jettisoning my initial braking stage. Well, didn\u0027t it just plow right into my base (RIP two Kerbals). Thankfully two were in a different module that was rolling down a hill afterwards and the other two were in a rover, but needless to say, I had to get them home.
