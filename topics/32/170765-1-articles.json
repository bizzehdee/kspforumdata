Here\u0027s my story of how I just build a few jet variants, and ended up with just about the most flawed concept and useless craft I think I\u0027ve made in KSP (to be sure, I\u0027ve made stupid designs before... but they were trying to achieve a concept that made more sense)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo 2 weeks ago I lost most of my files due to a corrupted hard-drive (those not lost were hosted on dropbox, or a pretty\u00A0old backup), and I set about re-making many designs I like to use. First this was stuff I actually used, like heavy cargo SSTOs, expendable rockets of a given payload range for a 3x rescale, rover modules that can deploy from a mk3 cargobay\u002Bramp, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I decided to not just recreate what I lost, but make some new designs (deployable and recoverable rovers not based on the mk3 cargosystem).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen... I thought I\u0027d go even further, and thought of the XF-85 Goblin:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022701px-McDonnell_XF-85_trapese.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/McDonnell_XF-85_trapese.jpg/701px-McDonnell_XF-85_trapese.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022598\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA jet fighter designed to fit in the bomb bay of a B-29,\u00A0- I was going to make jets that could deploy from mk3 cargobays and then return into them...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did succeed in making multiple designs which could do this... but... when I started to refine them for actual use, I asked myself \u0022What would I actually use these for?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had a Wheesley powered variant. I was thinking that an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E (playing on 3x here, so they are more specialized designs) may have poor handling, high landing speeds, limited landing places, a poor turning radius... so being able to deploy a smaller low speed jet could allow for exploration of harder to reach places (like flying around in the cauldera of a volcano on the mod-planet Rald)... the problem was that a design that fits into a mk3 cargobay does not meet this criteria. Its landing gear has a very narrow track, and it had a rather high landing speed due to its very short wings (although with stock KSP aero, and part clipping, I could make it work, but I don\u0027t abuse part clipping in my designs).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I figured, OK, I\u0027ll make the mk3 deployable jet into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E.
