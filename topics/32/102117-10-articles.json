Take from them what you will.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The next update will mark a big milestone for us at Squad, as it is the last update focused on Career Mode. After the next release, Kerbal Space Program will reach an internal milestone we call \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CScope Complete\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2.\n\u003E \n\u003E Scope completion means that every big system that the game needed is there, some closer to completion than others, of course, but they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re all there. After Scope Completion, development focus shifts towards completing those unfinished features, balancing and adding some smaller stuff. No more groundwork, no more laying down infrastructure. *note: They do mention aero and mining later in the blog.*\n\u003E \n\u003E Beta development is going to be a new stage for the project, and that also means our development workflow will change, and by consequence, this will have an effect on the releases. There shouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be any huge updates that we have to build for months on end and still have to release with barely more than enough content to showcase the system.\n\u003E \n\u003E Beta means we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be focusing on creating content, on using the tools we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve built. Priorities should level out, which means the things we consider important should also match what everyone considers important. Beta essentially means we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be working a lot more on stability, usability, performance, balance, aesthetics, all the while still throwing in little and some not-so-little things we hope you will enjoy.\n\u003E \n\u003E Our main focus during the Beta phase will be to improve the overall playing experience of the game as much as possible. Once we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re outside the Early Access umbrella, KSP will have to stand on its own as-is, and not rely on upcoming features and perceived potential affecting players\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 opinions.\n\u003E \n\u003E Beta is the period in software development when all planned capabilities are implemented, and dev focus is centered on polish and bugfixing. Yes, we do that already in experimentals, but we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to be doing it in a wider scope during Beta phase. Beta means taking a step back, and seeing all areas of the game under equal focus for testing and improvement. We know there are several bugs we haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t fixed yet. This is the time to make those fixes and assure the game is working as well as possible. The term Beta is definitely fitting here.\n\u003E \n\u003E We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to call our first Beta version KSP v0.90.0), to make it clear to everyone that KSP is nearing a state of completion. Of course, that doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t mean we plan to do exactly 10 Beta patches to reach 1.0. It could be more, it could be less, we can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t tell. If we run past 0.99. the next version could be 0.100.0, or we could change the system a bit, and increment the revision numbers instead, depending on how much we feel a release has added. In a way, Beta updates really are more like revision patches actually. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll keep announcing new releases as we have always done in any case, so just hang around the community and you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll never miss a release."},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T03:08:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So, let\u0027s take a look back.

They don\u0027t carry so much weight these days, but I do worry about peer reviews. Currently on Steam, KSP gets good reviews, but it\u0027s only because it is early access at the moment.
