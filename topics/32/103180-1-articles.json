If you\u0027re not super experienced at the game, I wouldn\u0027t suggest doing RO, as it\u0027s considerably more difficult... you need to do your maneuvers very efficiently, and abuse Gravity Assists and Aerobraking wherever you can, as the dV costs are so much higher (realistic).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTSM is pretty hard too, but also quite fun.... when you like playing in Kerbin\u0027s SOI that is.

As you haven\u0027t played career before I\u0027d say just stick with Stock; it gets you used to using some parts you may not have used much before, also gets you used to flying rockets in general without making it more confusing, you don\u0027t need to mod it, and it\u0027s the best way of avoiding the Memory Leak crashes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESETI is a good mod; I think it greatly improves the structure and flow of the tree, without warping it too far from stock nor real life; it makes the early sections of the tree focus on basic rocketry, and the later focus on the bigger stuff; plus it gives you planes earlier on which makes more sense really. I would still suggest doing stock first, but if you want to run through career again sometime later, this is the mod to pick! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t really know of any other tech tree unfortunately (apart from the interstellar one and Mod Orientated Tech Tree, but they\u0027re for more heavily modded playthroughs), so I can\u0027t really rate them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T22:26:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Comic Sans MS\u0027;\u0022\u003EI\u0027m currently playing with some mods that add some stuff to Career Mode.

I played through BTSM once, and thought the challenge was interesting, but got bored with BTSM before my first Mun landing in my second play through. Most of the challenge to BTSM was just adapting to BTSM rather than stock, so once I managed to do that, the second play through just felt like so much hoop jumping. Then again, I\u0027m used to playing with Deadly Reentry/TAC-LS/etc, just not the game balance changes that BTSM made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I\u0027d say go with a mostly-stock career mode at first. Learning the challenges of career mode at the same time as you\u0027re learning new part balances/game mechanics might be stacking too much at one time. Play with a few UI-type mods, not anything that changes the challenge of the game if you want. Personally, I tend not to do career mode without KAC just because I tend to have more missions going on at the same time so I\u0027m more likely to forget to check a certain craft as its transfer window approaches.
