Time to relocate the base my first thought was! But there are some small complications, Chobe Mun Base is located on the bottom of a large crater. Earlier scout missions have shown that the rim is very steep and there are no driveable exits out of the crater. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, driving 100km is gonna be a pain and the terrain to the West of Neil Armstrong Memorial is very rough. So it was quite quickly decided driving is not a viable option, so what then?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly the oldest of the 3 base components has a docking port on top (I never imagined a relocation), and I don\u0027t want to make a very complicated contraption using the 2 smaller side docking ports.

Did have some nice crashes, unfortunately I was so busy I forgot to take screenshots of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I had to abandon the idea of transporting both types of base components with one type of platform, they are just too different. So I\u0027m only taking the hab modules, two of them, so two trips. I\u0027ll leave the light tower/node component, maybe I\u0027ll drive it over later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere a few screenies of the dev work;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlatform lay-out complete. The wheel wells make sure the load doesn\u0027t move forward or aft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYay, it fits live a glove!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERolling back is covered by the addition of two lander legs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few itirations down the line we have the beginnings of the fuel system and engine supports, the three fuel tanks at the back are for balance and will not be used. Also we now have four middle sized lander legs making sure the load doesn\u0027t move upwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis things isn\u0027t going anywhere! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFighting for control with just two reaction wheels, this ended crashy I might add.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAaahhh much much better!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill fits..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhheeeeeyyyyyy...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERefueling the platform from the hab module. The fuel in the hab modules is probably not going to be enough for going back and forth between the two locations. So I might have to send along a refueling module. Very inefficient, but Kerbal logic is very different from Human logic. They value challenge and stupid but entertaining behaviour above efficiency and safety, and they\u0027re damn right!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny feedback is much appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see that your tests are going well, that\u0027s good. The platform looks really good and it must have been a challenge to get something like this to work with the toon physics, congratulations!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t wait to see your base proudly sitting next to the Neil Armstrong Memorial!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
