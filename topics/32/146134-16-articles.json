The nature of the biggest bug is such that those who are most enthusiastic and commit the most play time are the worst hit. This is, for many of them, their first experience with KSP, and it\u0027s a tough one; they don\u0027t have reason to feel confident that things will improve. I can certainly see why \u0022You\u0027ll have to wait for the patch\u0022 is unsatisfactory even if it is all that can be done. The forum is meant to be a place for discussing KSP experiences even if they are negative, but when they are critical it must feel like the entire forum is coming down on them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople who have been playing longer are approaching this from a different viewpoint. Their whole experience so far has not been negative. They\u0027ve already been around for some release and patch cycles, and have likely enjoyed enough play time to feel they\u0027ve gotten good value. Many of them are very enthusiastic about the game, and when some new players voice that their experience has been poor they naturally want to tell them that it gets better, hoping this will allay their disappointment. The community here has long been a positive and friendly one, and this sudden injection of negativity can feel like it is bringing the community down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor all that their experiences and viewpoints are different, I think it would do us all well to step back a bit and see that the newer members of our community and the longer term ones have more in common than they have differences. We all want KSP to be as bug free as possible. We all want to have the best experience playing KSP. We all want everyone else to have the best experience playing KSP. We all want to feel that we made a good purchase in KSP. And truth be told, I bet Squad wants all those things, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo we\u0027d like to ask everyone to not go on the offensive in this thread. Share what your experiences have been, whether positive or negative, by all means. But do not try to invalidate the views of others, do not take someone having a different view as a personal affront, and most importantly do not attack other people because their point of view is different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-01T01:20:37Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2016 01:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Red Iron Crown\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeremiah","CreatedById":168295,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-01T06:10:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222722204\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022146134\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221471606677\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002212858\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn August 19, 2016 at 7:37 AM, Red Iron Crown said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s already more playable on console than it was when I started playing it on PC, for what it\u0027s worth. vOv\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for locking threads, there\u0027s a few things going on there:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- We have rules about treating everyone else on the forum with respect and without accusations, whether users, staff or\u00A0Squad itself.

I guess sometimes some people want to vent frustrations more than they want to do anything practical about them, which is probably fair enough, but when practical solutions are offered and dismissed out of hand it\u0027s pretty galling. I believe many PC players posting here aren\u0027t doing so to troll console players or PC-master-race it, they\u0027re just doing everything they can to help the stuck move past it, and getting a big \u0026lt;snip\u0026gt; in return.
