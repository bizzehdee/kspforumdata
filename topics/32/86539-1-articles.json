Strategies let you take control over how your Space Program is managed, allowing you to tune it to best fit your own playing style.\u003Cbr\u003E* Space Program Department Reps: Meet Mortimer Kerman, your Finances guy, Linus Kerman, Science rep and Wernher\u0027s intern (because Wernher is too important to be bothered with these meetings) and Walt Kerman, PR representative who takes his job very literally sometimes, and Gus Kerman, head of Operations, who hopefully cleaned his boots before showing up this time.\u003Cbr\u003E* Strategies are of course, completely mod-friendly, and defined through cfg. So are the departments, in fact.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ECrew Transfer:\u003Cbr\u003E* Kerbals in the same vessel don\u0027t need a spacesuit anymore to switch seats. Just click the crew hatch and select Transfer to tell them to go sit somewhere else.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESpaceplane Parts Overhaul:\u003Cbr\u003E* We\u0027ve incorporated many parts fromthe very awesome SpacePlane Plus mod by Chris Thuersam (PorkJet), giving stock spaceplane parts a much needed overhaul.\u003Cbr\u003E* Many, many new parts: Wing sections, Control Surfaces, Air Intakes, Fuselage Sections and even Cargo Bays added.\u003Cbr\u003E* All parts in the Mk2 set were redesigned to be symmetrical in 3 axes. They also act as lifting surfaces too.\u003Cbr\u003E* The Mk1 Cockpit and Mk1 fuselage sets were also overhauled, and we\u0027ve also added a new Inline intake part.\u003Cbr\u003E* Rebuilt all stock vessels using the new parts.\u003Cbr\u003E* Obsolete spaceplane parts replaced by new ones when applicable. (Delta wing, Structural wind, Wing Connector, Mk2 fuselages)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EKSC Vessel Markers:\u003Cbr\u003E* You can now see (and focus/recover) vessels landed near the Space Center directly from the Space Center scene. Markers will show their positions and expand to show extra information when clicked.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ENavBall Vectors:\u003Cbr\u003E* The Navball now shows all 6 vectors when in Orbit mode: Progade, Retrograde, Radial In/Out, Normal and Antinormal.\u003Cbr\u003E* Off-screen maneuver vectors now have an arrow which points towards them so they\u0027re easier to find.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ENew:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFlight:\u003Cbr\u003E* Added a new stock craft, the Learstar A1: A hybrid multistage vessel that functions very much like the Shuttle did.\u003Cbr\u003E* MapView Filtering state is now persistent.\u003Cbr\u003E* Added a Full Throttle Key (Z)\u003Cbr\u003E* New \u0022Space Center\u0022 Button above the altimeter allows you to return to the Space Center without having to go through the Pause Menu.\u003Cbr\u003E* Added MonoProp gauge to OMS engines on staging stack\u003Cbr\u003E* Added \u0027Return to Editor\u0027 buttons to flight end dialog when Reverting isn\u0027t allowed (due to difficulty settings).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EEditors:\u003Cbr\u003E* VAB and SPH scenes now show visible KSC facilities in their current states (as in destroyed).\u003Cbr\u003E* Hold ModKey to override surface attachment in editors (when you want to stack to a node but can\u0027t because the part insists on sticking to the surface).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ECrew Management:\u003Cbr\u003E* Automatic Crew Hiring is now disabled depending on difficulty setting.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EScenery:\u003Cbr\u003E* Tweaked the main terrain shader to use worldspace triplanar mapping on near detail textures. This means we now have enough texture accuracy to texture small rocks or even blades of grass. This is still an ongoing project though, not all Celestial Bodies use this new shader yet.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ER\u0026amp;D:\u003Cbr\u003E* Entry Purchases in R\u0026amp;D are now required depending on difficulty mode.\u003Cbr\u003E* Added a \u0027Purchase All\u0027 button to purchase all parts after researching a node in R\u0026amp;D.\u003Cbr\u003E* Science Results in Sandbox Mode. They may not be worth much Science (or any at all), but running science experiments in Sandbox Mode will now show you the same results as in other game modes.\u003Cbr\u003E* Recovering/Transmitting Science Data requires an operational R\u0026amp;D Facility (as in not destroyed).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EMisc:\u003Cbr\u003E* GameDatabase code tweaked to allow modders to write their own asset loaders.\u003Cbr\u003E* Added GameEvents.OnCrewTransferred, fired from CrewTransfer and EVAs leaving and boarding\u003Cbr\u003E* Added SCREENSHOT_SUPERSIZE parameter to settings.cfg to allow taking ultra-high-res (multisampled) screenshots.\u003Cbr\u003E* Application Launcher added to tracking station (Messages and Contracts App visible).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBug Fixes and Tweaks:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E* Fixed a small bug where entering the KSC scene for the first time in a session would cause it to jitter from FP inaccuracy. This fixed itself after going into other scenes, but was annoying nonetheless.\u003Cbr\u003E* Tweaked text on Editor Cost Widget, so characters align with the Funds widget below.\u003Cbr\u003E* Funds Widget now has commas to separate groups of 3 digits.\u003Cbr\u003E* Fixed a bug in the Editor which prevented some parts from attaching properly to n-couplers using symmetry (like the RamJet Turbines)\u003Cbr\u003E* Added an \u0022Addons\u0026amp;Mods\u0022 button to the Main Menu, that will take you to KSP\u0027s official mod site.\u003Cbr\u003E* Massive reorganization of the part folders in the GameData directory.\u003Cbr\u003E* Inline Reaction wheel rescaled to size 0, since it was redundant with the Advanced Reaction Wheel module before.\u003Cbr\u003E* Cupola Part mass changed from 4.5 to 1.76. Total mass (with full monoprop) is now 1.8\u003Cbr\u003E* Tweaked the intake area of several intakes for better consistency.\u003Cbr\u003E* Fixed Experimental parts not being available in cases where the node was researched but the part itself not purchased.\u003Cbr\u003E* Set up a transition matrix system to bypass unnecessary loading screens on some scene transitions.\u003Cbr\u003E* Improved number formatting on all Contract values, from \u0022F1\u0022 (123456789.0) to \u0022N1\u0022 (123,456,789.0)\u003Cbr\u003E* Overhauled the in-game settings dialog UI, which was sorely in need of some attention.\u003Cbr\u003E* Removed useless \u0027None\u0027 option for Docking Lin/Rot state when assigning a key or axis in the Input Screen.\u003Cbr\u003E* Revised and updated in-game and readme credits.\u003Cbr\u003E* Fixed mouse detection for KSC facilities not working if camera was zoomed too far out.\u003Cbr\u003E* Fixed a bug where crew portraits would draw out of place after switching vessels.\u003Cbr\u003E* Fixed a bug which could cause a general game breakdown on rare occasions when vessels planted themselves into the ground.\u003Cbr\u003E* Fixed Index Out of Range exception and general crash on moving to flight after deleting a crewed part in a certain way.\u003Cbr\u003E* Kerbal recovery reward set to zero for the time being, to stop reputation exploit from recovery at the launchpad.\u003Cbr\u003E* Mk2 Cockpit renamed to Mk1 Inline Cockpit (makes a lot more sense, since it was a Mk1 type part anyway).\u003Cbr\u003E* Fixed several cases of UIs not stopping mouse clicks on objects behind themselves.\u003Cbr\u003E* Fixed a bug on OSX which made it impossible to open the Crew Hatch Dialog and possibly other dialogs too.\u003Cbr\u003E* Contracts App panel is now scalable in the VAB/SPH\u003Cbr\u003E* Fixed missing title bar on VAB/SPH on larger resolutions\u003Cbr\u003E* Fixed a bug with rescaleFactor parameter in part.cfg when a MODEL node was used.\u003Cbr\u003E* Fixed scaling issues with OMS Engine.\u003Cbr\u003E* Fixed vessel airlocks becoming falsely obstructed sometimes on certain ship design.\u003Cbr\u003E* Upgraded all parts using deprecated Winglet subclass to use ModuleLiftingSurface instead.\u003Cbr\u003E* Fixed minor visual issue with galaxy backdrop.\u003Cbr\u003E* Moved over ion engine and xenon tanks to Propulsion from Utility.\u003Cbr\u003E* Fixed Staging input locks not clearing if leaving the Editors while hovering over staging icons. (resulted in total game freeze)\u003Cbr\u003E* Improved GUI skin for input page in Game Settings scene.\u003Cbr\u003E* Editor sidebar panel transition speed increased.\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone notice anything else not listed officially?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Franklin","CreatedById":89718,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T19:57:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s this maybe,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELanding gear has mass now,\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FleetAdmiralJ","CreatedById":73364,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T20:05:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* MapView Filtering state is now persistent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHooray!
