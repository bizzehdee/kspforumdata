Good warfare related games depend on there being an underlying story to provide motivation, a believable enemy to fight against and a clear objective that can provide for a victory or defeat scenario. None of these elements exist in KSP. A warfare game could be made that employs the KSP methods of building and flying space ships, and it could even work with green Kerbals as protagonists, but ultimately it would be an entirely different game.\n\nTo take a parallel from a different Genre, Valve created the Source engine for first person perspective run around with a gun type games. They used it to produce a number of very successful games. They created the single player warfare type game Half Life 2, they created the multiplayer combat game Team Fortress 2 and they created the puzzle game Portal. They all are built around the same physics engine and have similar aspects of gameplay mechanics. They are each very good at what they are, but they are entirely different games, and people play one and not the other for entirely different reasons. If you tried to take gameplay elements from one of the games and shoe-horn it into the setting of one of the others, the result would most likely be a terrible game, because the setting would be all wrong and the story that successfully motivates you in one style of game would fail in another."},{"CreatedByName":"Fleb","CreatedById":63851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T18:08:06Z","Content":"It\u0027s a sandbox game, do whatever you want.

Of course I say this, and I write a comic where the main characters are all \u0022officers\u0022 in an organization called \u0022Kerbfleet\u0022 and have words like \u0022Majer\u0022, \u0022Looey\u0022, \u0022Enzin\u0022, or\u0022Comder\u0022 in front of their names. Allow me to explain ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI think that Kerbals are essentially meant to be human-like, but with all human traits removed that would be inconvenient for space exploration. Human traits that interfere with spaceflight include:\n\n- limited lifespan\n- need for air, water and food\n- desire for comfort\n- desire for wealth\n- basic regard for personal safety\n- belief that life has, or should have any purpose other than spaceflight\n\nand, of course,\n\n- the capacity to willingly harm one another\n\nLet\u0027s face it, if we humans removed all the above from our programming we could have put a person on Mars within ten years of Yuri Gagarin. Of course we would have blown up a few dozen people trying, but we wouldn\u0027t have cared! Instead we were distracted by our other desires in life, and we spent all too much of our energy on violence and the threat of violence. And here we are.\n\nSo I have this thing called \u0022Kerbfleet\u0022 in my comic, and it has all of the cool trappings of a military organization but none of the awful stuff having to do with war and violence. Is this reasonable? Certainly not! But none of it is reasonable, is it? Rather, I say it is unreasonable to give Kerbals any of those human traits listed above and expect them to be able to run a space program as we\u0027ve come to expect in KSP...except maybe the need for food, because I\u0027ve been playing with USI-LS and it\u0027s pretty cool."},{"CreatedByName":"Netskimmer","CreatedById":144822,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T21:15:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Generally, I couldn\u0027t really care less.

I may, at some point, try to create a manually controlled ICBM to send a warhead into orbit and see if I can hit a dummy target on the ground. It could be a good learning exercise on how to accurately hit a specific landing site when returning to Kerbin, or landing on another body with an atmosphere."},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T23:06:00Z","Content":"I regularly create military craft in game and have been doing so for ages.\n\nHowever I am completely against military parts being added."},{"CreatedByName":"nadreck","CreatedById":89087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T23:24:23Z","Content":"No need to add parts they are there, and in fact 1.0 just expanded their range!
