Now, I\u0027ve never returned from ONE moon, let alone two, so I need help. How should I go about this? Should I use docking, or just a really big rocket? Do I need refueling stations around the moons?

Since you are still a beginner, you should probably aim at a single moon for the time being (since going to the second moon will require a Hohmann transfer at some point, with an inclination change, so you should practice those).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy way of doing it would probably be a single rocket; actually, going from Kerbin to the Mun requires almost exactly the same amount of fuel (with a given rocket) as going directly to Minmus. Landing on either moon and going to the second one wouldn\u0027t require that much delta-v, since the most you\u0027ll require will be for liftoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust build a little bigger than a \u0022to-the-Mun-and-back\u0022 rocket, and it should do the job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: setting up a refuelling station would be overkill imo, but it would allow you to build a smaller rocket, even smaller than a simple Mun rocket, since you could use part of the upper stage to orbit, and then refuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing to the moons from there should then be doable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
