However, if you have enough time, you don\u0027t have to. Simply intercepting the asteroid might be enough if you can make your spacecraft big enough. Then, all you need to do is keep station a dozen meters or so beside the asteroid for a year or two, and the attraction of gravity between the asteroid and the fairly massive spacecraft will apply the small few cm/s dV you need to turn a hit into a near miss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this implies that we\u0027re able to put a spacecraft into orbit that has enough dV to intercept a rogue asteroid as far away from earth as possible and then, when it has succeeded in doing so, \u003Cem\u003Estill\u003C/em\u003E weighs 50-100 tons.
