I was racing for my spot in the leaderboards, regardless of whether the OP secures proof from the person who allegedly beat me to an engine bell landing.\n\nEDIT\n\nTo prove it is really Minmus, following controversy over an achievement I believe I earned, here is a photo in daytime. You can see the more green surface.\n\n\u003E ![index.php?action=dlattach;topic=12366.0;attach=19802;image](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=12366.0;attach=19802;image)\n\nAlso, in case anyone is wondering why the shadow looks separate from the probe, it is because in this landing spot, most of the probe falls through the ground. So to prove it was an unmanned style probe, I took off about 2 inches above the surface for a more contact looking photo. Here is how it looks when it\\\u0027s fallen through.\n\n\u003E ![index.php?action=dlattach;topic=12366.0;attach=19804;image](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=12366.0;attach=19804;image)"},{"CreatedByName":"sting_auer","CreatedById":11073,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T14:35:37Z","Content":"Mind adding an achievement for putting a shuttle on Minmus?\n\n![scaled.php?server=35\u0026filename=screenshot3bs.png\u0026res=landing](http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg35/scaled.php?server=35\u0026filename=screenshot3bs.png\u0026res=landing)\n\nI\\\u0027m almost done ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nedit: NEW PIC\n\n![screenshot0vp.png](http://img607.imageshack.us/img607/7300/screenshot0vp.png)\n\nPictures of landing and return coming as soon as I actually do them \u003E\\_\u003E\n\nEDIT: Never mind, it crashed when I tried to land.
