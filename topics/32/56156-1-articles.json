I tend to offload kethane and keep it in that state until I have a specific need, rather than trying to keep tanks full of mono/LFO hanging around. I sadly don\u0027t have any pictures anymore, but I used to have a fuel depot in orbit of Minmus using the spherical tanks (which hold something like 40-50k kethane each). I used kethane generators to power the stacks of refiners so an interplanetary ship fueling up for a transit wouldn\u0027t have to sit around forever waiting on the refining process and potentially miss its window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m currently working on a design using Hooligan Labs\u0027 airship parts (on .21) and KAS that can cruise around at high speed (using firespitter\u0027s electric props I can get up to ~200m/s on Kerbin) going where the kethane is. Once it finds a patch it uses KAS winches to anchor and lower drill pods. Only part I haven\u0027t worked out yet is how to land something on a moving airship to take the kethane back to orbit. I\u0027m certainly not going to attempt mid-air fueling, and even more certainly not in the kind of volume I\u0027d want to make it worth the effort. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-14T21:55:44Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2013 09:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Libra00\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T22:00:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Majiir\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Majiir\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat I want to know: Why do some bases and landers have more than two drills?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy 2 and why not 1 for that matter?

The developers announced it a long time ago, and I\u0027m sure their concept has changed a bit since then, but the core of it is a system with six to twelve raw resources, which then get converted into the various fuel types through a 2-for-1 refining process. While Kethane is good practice for dealing with a resource system, this is the part where it fails. Kethane has one resource that combines to four fuel types, so there\u0027s no downside to just making a single heavy lander with onboard refinery to make all fuels as needed, especially if that lander can then act as a pseudo-station in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in the upcoming official system, that just won\u0027t work because you won\u0027t be able to extract all of the necessary ingredients for rocket fuel at a single location, and you won\u0027t be able to refill all fuel types even from a single pair of resources.

There is no real goal or ending, nothing to be gained by, say, visiting Duna or Eeloo, no point in setting up a surfing club on Laythe or a Starbucks on the Mun. Even in career mode, you max out on science before you\u0027ve done everything there is to do, once you\u0027re past that point, its up to you to make your own fun and choose your own goals.

But also for pushing/pulling interplanetary payloads on their route out of the kerbin-system. After the ejectionburn, it will decouple from the payload and re-circularise immediately. So the design goals are: Low partcount, lots of fuel, low partcount, very stiff, low partcount, decent TWR, and so on. The extra mass \u0026amp; parts for drilling and converting would be very cumbersome for this job.
