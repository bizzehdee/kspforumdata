I could always look up how thick the atmosphere of XXX planet is, or the strength of its gravity, but I\u0027d rather derive the thickness and density of a given planets\u0027 atmosphere rather than relying on the KSP wiki. I\u0027d prefer to self discover, so for me the probes are valuable. Also, my fianc\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9e has forbidden me from killing Kerbals, so mine is a 0 loss space program. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Decho","CreatedById":66774,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T22:58:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Force21\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Force21\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t build probes anymore because pilots can give more science.
