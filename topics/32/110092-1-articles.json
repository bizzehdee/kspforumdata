So I want to see if others are having this issue and see what your thoughts on it are. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ethe symptoms\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue is a periodical (about every 10-20 seconds) split second freeze in the display. The whole game appears to pause momentarily and then catches up with itself. I say \u0022display\u0022 specifically as it appears that some level of input is still being registered. It is most apparent when you try to smoothly pan the camera around a craft (and it doesn\u0027t even need to be a large craft). There is a short pause in the display and then it catches up with the mouse input and you find that you\u0027ve panned further than expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is actually apparent when panning the camera around at the space center. here\u0027s a gif to try and show what I\u0027m on about. I\u0027m just moving the mouse in an oval and you can see at one point the camera snaps and your suddenly looking down on the RnD complex (can be a bit hard to distinguish the glitch from the gif looping at the end, but watch it a few times and it becomes apparent which snap is caused by the glitch. The glitch comes quite near the end of the gif, so there is a period of smooth panning, then what appears to be a hard cut and then very shortly after the gif repeats.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/syRyY1C\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/syRyY1C.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022syRyY1C.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMy observations\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo start with I did not experience this at all in 1.0.x, but gradually as my space program has got larger it has become more and more apparent. I don\u0027t think this will effect players with just a few craft in flight, I think the number of in-flight craft may be a factor (but not the whole cause). I now have over 40 in-flight craft and my save file is 4.4mb. I suspect that you need to have that sort of size save before this starts being apparent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart count is not the issue (although performance with large craft does also seem poor compared to older versions of KSP). This freeze-frame glitch is still apparent even with small craft (~50 parts) and just while at the space center, which is why I suspect that the number of in-flight craft /save file size is one of the main factors. It is sometimes noticeable in the movements of the Kerbals wandering about the SPH/VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in-flight craft isn\u0027t the whole story. I have two saves, a career and sandbox in my 1.0.2 install, in sandbox I only have 10 in-flight craft. If I start the game and play sandbox then it appears to run smoothly, but if I first play my career and then switch to sandbox then the freeze-frame issue is apparent there too. It\u0027s as if things are not being unloaded from memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould this be due to paging? It may be that windows is trying to free up RAM by writing unused assets to the swap file and the momentary freeze is caused by that write action?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epossibly, but my OS is on an SSD so that write shouldn\u0027t be so much of an overhead. I\u0027ve tried having KSP installed on the same disk (as it\u0027s my only SSD) and I\u0027ve also tried having it on a separate drive to the OS and performance is basically the same in both cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe longer the KSP session the worse the problem is. This makes the problem hard to diagnose or show to others. You can\u0027t just load up KSP and see it happening, it gradually creeps in over a long enough play session.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I being nit-picky? Well perhaps, but while I don\u0027t mind a low frame rate (within reason) this kind of glitch really gets to me. You can adapt and compensate for a constant low frame rate, something that happens intermittently is much harder to deal with. It causes annoying things like \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-when selecting a bunch of fuel tanks you pan around to select another tank and just as you are about to click there is a freeze and it registers your click on a different part, so then you have to de-select all the tanks and start again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-A couple days ago I was trying to land a plane with 16 tourists, my 2 best scientists and one of my good pilots when just as I was leveling out it froze and next thing I know I was rolled much further over than planned....all hands where lost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-When setting M-nodes and trying to gently tweak it a glitch can cause your gentle tweak to be registered as a much larger move and mess up your node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find this kind of error to get increasingly frustrating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut KSP is a complex game with lots going on? Yeah, but this never used to happen. I became really aware of this issue in 0.90.0 and it pretty much stopped me playing. In previous versions I\u0027ve had much larger space programs (saves files over 10mb) and never had this sort of issue. (as a side note; in previous versions I\u0027ve had much larger craft running at better frame rates than currently seems possible).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it because of too many mods. Not likely, I\u0027m running with just a handful of mods (MJ, KAC, QuickScroll, TemperatureGaugeKiller and Claw\u0027s StockBugFixModules). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPC not up to it? well as I said, I\u0027ve had larger saves in the past with no issue on this machine. My rig has an i7, 16GB ram and I\u0027m running win7.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would really like to hear from you guys if you are experiencing this glitch, and if you have any thoughts about it\u0027s cause and or possible work arounds. I want to make a full bug report but I don\u0027t feel like I have enough info to make one that will be of use to the devs as it is not easy to say how to replicate it (aside from saying just play KSP for several weeks with some very long play sessions). If you can add anything to what I\u0027ve already said then I will include that in my report.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Quidoo","CreatedById":48712,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T14:38:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had almost identical issues, but only when I\u0027m in flight, with a SCANsat map open.
