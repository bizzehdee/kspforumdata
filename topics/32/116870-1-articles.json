I\u0027m working my way through a science mode game which has its own challenge, but I figure it\u0027s time to do a large project in sandbox mode, just to see if it can be done. I like the engineering challenge of coming up with equipment that works. Been looking forward to resource mining for some time so would be good to get that operational.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPre-1.0, I\u0027ve been to Duna a couple of times, Jool and Eve (one-way). Never been to Dres, Moho or Eeloo as they don\u0027t seem too interesting (no moons or anything)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s some options I\u0027ve considered so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Exploration of Jool\u0027s moons. Bit of a ripoff of Brotoro\u0027s Long Term Laythe, but should be able to make it mostly self-sufficient with a good mining operation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Colonise Eve: Would have to be a colony as realistically they\u0027re not coming back. An orbital outpost running missions to Gilly is also a possibility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A surface base on Ike, with excursions to Duna to do some exploring there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Asteroid Nomads: Assemble a large mothership that goes cruising between asteroids, with a couple of attached \u0027landers\u0027 that can pillage them for ore. Hope the Kerbals like zero-g.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Something else?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T14:25:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI say try to develop rovers that can jump the canyon on Dres \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jett_Quasar","CreatedById":117851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T15:11:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the asteroid cruising idea - I\u0027ve never even seen that done before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t colonize Eve, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129260-KSP-Wasn-t-Designed-For-This\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etake it from me\u003C/a\u003E, you don\u0027t want to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJR\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T15:12:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETylo-Single-Stage-to-Landing-and-reorbit?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomassino","CreatedById":137899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T16:40:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOrbital city around Kerbin... yes I mean city not station.
