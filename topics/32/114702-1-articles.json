When deployed with an antenna and a   \npower source between Eve and Kerbin, aligned to face away from the Sun, and   \nactivated, the telescope will begin to map the orbit of the outer planet in a 200\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0   \nvision cone for passing asteroids.\n\nThis thread is to discuss the addon.

So you can\u0027t get it until you\u0027re reasonably far along in a career game. So small amounts of science as 1-shot things aren\u0027t too valuable by this point, but having a steady income is very helpful.\n\nAs to the other parts, the OX-STAT-XL is in Advanced Electrics with the unshielded folding solar panels (130-point tier, bottom node) and the HECS-2 is in Advanced Unmanned (last full column, 3rd from bottom). I haven\u0027t yet found where the high-gain antenna is hiding.
