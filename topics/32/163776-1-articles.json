Problem was, the runway (and all terrain in general) has weird invisible \u0027\u0027bumps\u0027\u0027 on it, wich make it nearly impossible for light planes or even rovers to drive or take off normally. And instead of trying to report the bug, and annoy the Devs of that mod again of a version of the game that is already outdated. I decided to go creative and adapt. I had this small flying car that i wanted to try out. I quickly realized that using the runway or terrain is not going to help in any way, and turning it into a full on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E would cause more and more frustration. So instead, i decided to use my\u00A0inner Kerbal Rocket Scientist and so, i attached\u00A0an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E under my car. This was a creative yet simple solution to a bug, that did not take up as much time and does not bother anyone at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022IUiyxzN.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022655\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/IUiyxzN.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith this, im just saying that one simple thing, can change the way players and people in general and start a butterfly effect. Another example of this is the whole Dres awareness situation and the Dres does not exist conspiracy, the sudden rise of combat players when BDarmory was added, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-27T21:35:00Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2017 09:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by NSEP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-28T01:11:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-28T01:27:24Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2017 01:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by regex\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
