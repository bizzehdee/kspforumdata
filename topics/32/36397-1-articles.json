I achieved a 100km x 270km orbit, and then I closed KSP without taking a screenie. Oops. But you can do the math to check:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. a turbojet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. a Mk1/Mk2 adapter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. lightest pod, and the small battery\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. cube struts so we can mount the intakes behind the engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. 48 ram intakes clipped together\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Control surfaces, for control (not infiniglide spamming).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal mass on launch: a bit over 2 tonnes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor sanity, I modded an intake that has 12x the mass, area, and resource space, so I didn\u0027t need to have quite so many parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore launch, click on 24 of the intakes (or two of my modded intakes), close them, and disable fuel flow (when you right-click on the intake, click on the little green arrow and turn it into a little red circle). Now you have 2.4 units of air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFly a nice shallow path; I used a mechjeb 25% climb slope starting at 2km and ending at 30km, preventing jet flameouts, but not following terminal velocity. This uses up as much fuel as possible (reducing your mass at circularization time), raises the periapsis nicely (about 40km for me), and doesn\u0027t take too long since you\u0027re going more than twice terminal velocity. I canceled the ascent as soon as I got out of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt apoapsis, click on that red circle in the intakes again -- but DON\u0027T open the intakes. Your surface speed is around 1600-1700 m/s so you get more than half thrust, Isp is 1200s, and your mass is just shy of 2 tonnes. 2.4 units of IntakeAir is just enough to pull periapsis up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t exactly practical, but it is a fun perversion of the system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-09T05:39:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe firespitter pack has a part that stores 100 units of intake air, to save you the hassle of modding the intakes or spamming them to that extent just for the extra storage \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pixel of Life","CreatedById":45646,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-09T06:29:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HoY\u0022 data-cite=\u0022HoY\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe firespitter pack has a part that stores 100 units of intake air, to save you the hassle of modding the intakes or spamming them to that extent just for the extra storage \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh yes, the air tank!
