If I tell you that a rocket has a thrust of one megaNewton, that number\u0027s meaningless to you unless you also know that rocket\u0027s total weight, because that might not even be enough to get off the launchpad if the rocket\u0027s heavy enough. If I tell you that the engine has enough fuel to burn for 10 minutes, that doesn\u0027t tell you much unless you also know the thrust, mass, etc. to know whether you\u0027ll be able to get anywhere If I tell you the design has a thrust-to-weight ratio of 2.3, then that sounds fine, but it doesn\u0027t tell you if the ship will run out of fuel halfway to orbit. If I say that my specific impulse is 800, it tells you that I\u0027ll burn very little fuel, but again, I might not have enough thrust to take off. And so on; most of the usual numbers only make sense if you know all of the other numbers as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, we need a measurement that doesn\u0027t require that sort of information, and Delta-V is the most universally useful as it\u0027s a measurement of raw capability in a vacuum. If your design doesn\u0027t have the ability to add more than 2000 m/s to your velocity, then it won\u0027t matter how perfectly you plan your ascent, you just won\u0027t be going to space today. A design with 6000m/s will do just fine taking off from Kerbin, but won\u0027t be able to take off from Eve. And so on; it means that if you\u0027ve got a good software tool that tells you the delta-V of your design, you\u0027ll be able to tell whether it\u0027s capable of doing X before you even take off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MC3craze","CreatedById":1636,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T22:57:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Firedtm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Firedtm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Enext question is what is some good mods to have if any ?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/0-18-4-kspx-parts-expansion/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSPX\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/0-18-1-kw-rocketry-overhauled/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKW rocketry\u003C/a\u003E.
