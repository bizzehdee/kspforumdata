I try and clarify what is an actual quote from Max (if it\u0027s wrapped in \u0022quotation marks\u0022, it\u0027s the best transcript of an official Squad member you\u0027ll find on the web), and what is a summary from myself as I\u0027m aware I switch between the two with 0 notice. When I say \u0027Squad\u0027, I mean \u0027the relevant people who are currently developing the game\u0027.

Hopefully, U5 will fix the current stability issues with OSX and Macs as Squad tracked down the problem to something within Unity itself. Windows 64bit - maybe? No promises, but they\u0027ll do their absolute best to make it the best it can be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EMiscellaneous\u003C/span\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.0.2 aero feedback - quite a lot of it, not all of it consistent - someone has to be wrong here.
