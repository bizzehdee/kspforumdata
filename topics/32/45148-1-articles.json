I\u0027m basing it on my current design, the \u0022Moho Special - B\u0022 seen in the pic below. Currently, it jettisons its 4 symmetrical secondary tanks on the way to wherever it\u0027s going (to save weight/fuel once they are empty), but once it\u0027s returned to Kerbin, there\u0027s no way to re-attach NEW secondary tanks as I currently use decouplers for them. This means that I have to re-land the ship on Kerbin, \u0022End Flight\u0022 it, and launch another one every time it finishes a mission and comes back. This has, needless to say, given rise to a number of \u0022______ Special\u0022 named ships in orbit around Kerbin in my save game that all have to be landed. I know the landing part is fun, of course \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E, but it\u0027s also fun to engineer things that are interesting and make scientific sense as well! After all, the Space Shuttle was designed to be re-usable, as is the in-development Dragon capsule from SpaceX! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can dock, no problem, so I can easily refuel the built-in tanks on each \u0022Special\u0022, but without the secondary tanks, they cannot go anywhere near as far out-system. I COULD currently re-use them now by docking a large secondary tank to the Clamp-O-Tron port on the bottom of the ship, or secondary tanks to the two Clamp-O-Tron Jr. ports on either side of the ship, but the bottom port is for \u0022towing\u0022 payloads to their destinations, and the side ports are for docking my single-seat \u0022Ike Mini\u0022 and \u0022Ike Mini II\u0022 Mini-vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0027Moho Special B\u0027 looks like this by the way (it\u0027s the ship in the foreground, this is an older screen so I apologize): \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/27/xlxt.png/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img27/7163/xlxt.th.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xlxt.th.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can clearly see the 4 FL-T800 secondary tanks attached in an asparagus config on each side. My question is, if I put TWO Clamp-O-Tron Jr. docking clamps on each tank/each corner of the ship (to ensure the tanks always re-attached perfectly straight each time), would both of them \u0022connect\u0022 to the main ship, or would just one of them \u0022connect\u0022? Like, would the game engine consider the tank as being structurally attached by only ONE of the ports (the one that touched first, per se?) or would they both be considered \u0022attached\u0022? I hope my question makes sense...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf only one were considered attached, I\u0027d have to try and go with one port for each tank, but two would be stronger, and easier to dock with once the docking magnets kicked in on both ends...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any comments! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-06T21:52:12Z\u0022 title=\u002209/06/2013 09:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by darkstrike\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dudester28","CreatedById":61717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T21:16:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe answer is yes but it is really hard.

One module was obviously misaligned with the rest of the ship, even though all the docks were connected and the ship constructed as exactly symmetrical. It just happens.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mellojoe","CreatedById":69154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T22:11:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rdUS6Es.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rdUS6Es.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes it is possible. Just remember, you are now aligning FOUR axis. X, Y, Z as well as ROTATION. It isn\u0027t super hard, just requires a light touch and patience. Sometimes only one of the ports will dock. You just then undock it, float backward, then push forwards again. One of mine took 4 tries, but the fourth time I switched to controlling the other ship and that worked. Just needs a little extra wiggle and aligning.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darkstrike","CreatedById":60004,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T00:10:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, it\u0027s good to know it\u0027s doable, if a bit glitchy....I may have to give it a try! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Thanks guys!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
