A ship with ion engines was too wide due to the crossbars its engines were on. I pulled them off and mounted them parallel to the spine for launch by a stack separator on on the centre engine, to be assembled by a micro-tug in orbit. This required the use of not just one, but a pair of small docking ports, so as to ensure the engines actually pointed straight retrograde for thrust purposes. The game\u0027s tree model of part attachment made it very difficult to make both the docking port pair and the center-mounted separator to happen. (Lotta re-rooting.) Docking angle limiting would\u0027ve saved all of that trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T15:44:54Z","Content":"\nOh right, I think I see what you mean.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy only suggestion would be a docking mod, such a Navyfish\u0026#39;s or the more-minimalist Navballdockingalignment which is based on it.\n"}]}
