They were awesome, but only really covered Kerbin and the Mun, as at the time they were the only places to go. We\u0027ve got more planets now, more things to do. We need more shiny things for our jackets!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I created these. They are based on the classic campaign ribbon, with extra optional devices to signify specific achievements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease do not make any suggestions that involve any of the following terms: Gold, Silver, Bronze, ___ times, without mods, with mods. The most important achievement is the transition from not having done something, to having done it. You should only repeat a mission until you can no longer learn any new lessons from it, or it stops being fun. You shouldn\u0027t feel any pressure to do something over and over again just to earn a different coloured bauble for an internet forum. I will also not discriminate against folks who use mods. My mom worked with satellites, and MechJeb\u0027s wall of confusing numbers is far closer to actual satellite ops than the intuitive GUI of the maneuver nodes. I don\u0027t use MechJeb, but it\u0027s because I\u0027m not willing take the time to understand what it\u0027s telling me, and I prefer a more seat-of-the-pants approach to travel. Why should I be rewarded for being a little dumb and a lot stubborn?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want me to make a new device, you need to do something novel. A good example is the user, name lost to the ages, who asked \u0022What device do I use when I just take a Kerbal on EVA and rocket pack down to the surface?\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Geosynchronous orbit dot and Rendezvous cross basically completely obscure the Equatorial orbit bar. This is fine. If you can achieve geosynchronous orbit and rendezvous ships in orbit you are obviously \u003Cem\u003Ecapable\u003C/em\u003E of achieving equatorial orbit if you wanted to, so who really cares if you\u0027ve actually done it or not?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSPFM-42\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERIBBON ORGANIZATIONAL \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003ESTANDARDS\u003C/span\u003E SUGGESTIONS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbal Space Program, recognizing the need to recognize the achievements of it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s various members has thus introduced the following space exploration ribbons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.0 Initial Award:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA ribbon is awarded initially upon entering the SOI of any body in the Kerbol system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.1 Asteroid Ribbon\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Asteroid Ribbon is awarded for getting a vessel within 2.2km of an asteroid. The right hand devices are awarded as normal, however, the left hand devices are used to indicate what has been achieved with said asteroid. If you make contact with the asteroid you get the rendezvous award, if you pull the asteroid into a stable orbit around a planet you get the orbit dot, and so on. The ribbon sidebars indicate what body the asteroid is orbiting around, currently restricted to the major planets and Kerbol. A bar should include only one asteroid ribbon, describing the mission that was most AWESOME or your FAVORITE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.2 Grand Tour\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Grand Tour shield is awarded when a vessel has visited (entered the SOI of) more than two worlds. A pip is awarded for each planet / moon visited. The craft used on the Grand Tour is indicated in the center. Kerbal Lost and Kerbal Saved are awarded as normal. To the left and the right of the center device are the Orbital Device and arrows and Landing Device and arrows. On the first orbit / landing the device is awarded, and then an arrow is awarded for each subsequent world orbited / landed on. The entire vessel doesn\u0027t need to land to be eligible for a Landing Arrow. As long as the lander was carried to the world by the ship that is conducting the Grand Tour it counts for a Landing Arrow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.0 Left Hand Devices:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeft hand devices stack, each device being added to the cluster as it is achieved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.1 Orbital Devices\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe following devices are added to the ribbon as various orbital and maneuvering goals are met:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Orbit - Awarded for achieving a stable orbit that does not dip into the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Equitorial - Awarded for achieving an orbit around the equator whose inclination deviates from the body equator by no more than 1 degree. It should also have apoapsis and periapsis with 5% of each other. The goal is control! Should always go under an Orbit Dot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Polar - Awarded for achieving a polar orbit that will allow a mapping scan to completely fill the map. No angle or circularity requirements beyond a successful mapping. Should always go under an Orbit Dot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Geosynchronous - Awarded for placing a craft into a geosynchronous orbit. If geosynchronous orbits are not possible, may also be awarded for placing a constellation of satellites so as to allow continuous overwatch of a point on the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Rendezvous - Awarded for the successful docking of two or more craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.2 Atmospheric Flight Device\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Atmosphere - Wings awarded for atmospheric operations, namely takeoff, controlled flight and a great landing at a destination. A good landing is any one you can walk away from. A great landing is one where you can use the plane again afterwards. If a craft is coming from orbit wings may also be awarded for entering an atmosphere and returning safely to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.3 Kerbol Escape Device\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Kerbol Escape - Awarded for getting a craft past Kerbol Escape Velocity. This award should only be displayed on the Kerbol ribbon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.4 Land Navigation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Land Nav - Awarded for successfully navigating a rover to a distant (10km\u002B) target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.0 Center Devices\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECenter devices stack, with the Kerbal Lost going under the Kerbal Saved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Kerbal Lost - Used to commemorate the loss of one or more brave Kerbals in attempts to reach that body. Kerbal Lost should be added to the ribbon of the body that the craft was in the SOI of when it was lost. Kerbals lost in interplanetary space are remembered on the Kerbol ribbon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Kerbal Saved - Used to signify one or more Kerbal saved through the efforts of their comrades. The Kerbal Saved should be placed on the ribbon of the body that the Kerbals were stranded on. Kerbals rescued from interplanetary space are celebrated on the Kerbol ribbon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.0 Strange Devices\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Anomaly - The Anomalous Black Dot goes in the lower right hand corner of the ribbon of the body upon which is was found. No further questions will be answered about the ABD or the reasons for it\u0027s awarding. You\u0027ll know them when you find them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.0 Right Hand Devices\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe following devices are used to recognize the craft used to reach and/or explore the body in question. These devices, with two exceptions, DO NOT stack. The order of precedence is informal, but the wearer should choose the mission that was MOST AWESOME or their FAVORITE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.1 Craft Devices\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Impactor - A (hopefully) autonomous craft that impacted with the body in question and was destroyed in the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Meteor - An (also hopefully) autonomous craft that was destroyed on atmospheric entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Capsule - A craft carrying one or more Kerbals that does not land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Aircraft - A craft capable of controlled flight through an atmosphere using aerodynamic lift instead of pure thrust. This may also be used if an aerospace craft makes it to a body with no atmosphere, but flight wings should not be awarded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- EVA - For landing from and returning to orbit without the aid of a spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Probe Landing - An autonomous vehicle that landed on a planetary surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Rover - An autonomous vehicle capable of surface travel successfully landed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Probe - An autonomous vehicle which did not land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Lander - A vehicle carrying one or more Kerbals that landed intact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Manned Rover - A manned craft capable of surface travel successfully landed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Multi-part Ship - An orbital construction capable of traveling to other worlds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Station - An orbital construction capable of docking and refuelling craft and housing Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Base - A permanent ground based construction built by two or more landings and capable of housing Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Flag or Monument - A marker on another world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Resourcing - An installation, either on the surface or in orbit capable of mining and/or processing resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Armada - Three or more vessels, staged in orbit for a trip to another world and launched within one week of another during one encounter window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.2 Return Chevron\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of two Right Hand Devices that stack, a Return Chevron is added when a craft has successfully returned from a world to Kerbin. It does not necessarily need to be displayed with the device of the craft that made the return. If a Capsule that returned is later exchanged for a more awesome Base the Return Chevron earned by the Capsule\u0027s return may still be displayed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.3 Challenge Wreath\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other Right Hand Device that stacks, the Challenge Wreath is awarded for achieving tasks specific to the world it is available on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.3.1 Kerbin SSTO Wreath\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SSTO wreath is awarded for getting a craft into orbit from the surface of Kerbin without dropping any parts along the way. The only pieces that may be left behind are the launching clamps,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.3.1 Tylo Land and Return Wreath\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe TL\u0026amp;RW wreath is awarded for getting a craft down to and safely back up from the surface of Tylo, the Eater of Landers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.3.2 Eve Return Wreath\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ERW is awarded for getting a craft back up through the swirling soup that Eve calls an atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.0 Displaying Ribbons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.1 General Guidelines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERibbons arrangements for forum use should be no more than THREE (3) ribbons high to avoid angering mods and making the forums look untidy. If you have a large block of ribbons think about unchecking the \u0022Show your signature\u0022 box for shorter comments so as to not wind up with a .sig block larger than your comment. Ribbons should be assembled for each body using the graphic program of choice and then saved as an individual graphic. The user should then open a new file and load all the ribbons into that program and assemble them there. Ribbons should not have gaps between them. Devices are optional.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.2 Ribbon Order\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.2.1 Geographical Order\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this design the ribbons are arranged from left to right starting with Kerbol and going outward to Eeloo. Satellites are displayed under parent bodies (or in the case of Jool, around the parent body). In the interests of compactness Moho may be displayed under Kerbol and Dres and Eeloo may be displayed under the Joolian satellites. The asteroid ribbon should go under Moho or Kerbol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.2.2 Delta-V Order\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this design the ribbons are left to right in order of the delta-V requirement to reach said body. In the game\u0027s current state, this is: Kerbin-Kerbol-Duna-Eve-Moho-Dres-Jool-Eeloo. The satellites of a system are displayed under/around the main planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.2.3 AWESOME Order\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERibbons are displayed in order of awesomeness. The most awesome mission goes top center by itself. The remaining, lesser missions are arranged in two rows below as determined by the wearer, generally with more awesome towards the upper center and less awesome towards the edges.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-17T04:31:29Z\u0022 title=\u002201/17/2015 04:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Unistrut\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EKerbaltek!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chruschtschow","CreatedById":57785,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T21:39:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERIBBONS!!!
