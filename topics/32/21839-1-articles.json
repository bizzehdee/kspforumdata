It has a total of 6 crew pods, along with a 3 man command pod on top. It\u0027s equipped with 16 solar panels that will continually attempt to follow the sun. The structure that supports the crew pods contains 1,600L of RCS thruster fuel, though during launch the station started spinning uncontrollably, and it took 3 out of 4 tanks of thruster fuel to actually stabilize it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to dodrian for the link to the mods for this station!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, now I\u0027m launching a ship to rendezvous with the space station, but instead of going onto the 31.944degree plane the station is on (remember the part about uncontrolled spinning?) it went onto a 31.944 plane opposite to the station:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i438.photobucket.com/albums/qq102/Evenger14/screenshot25_zpsec6117c5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot25_zpsec6117c5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere along my orbit do I need to burn in order to correct my plane?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"(An Original Name)","CreatedById":53457,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-10T00:26:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need to burn north or south at either point where the different orbit inclinations meet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bioman222","CreatedById":30364,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-10T00:30:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you get to the crossing node (See below), burn at 180 or 0 to raise or lower your orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=34561\u0026amp;d=1349828964\u0022 alt=\u0022attachment.php?attachmentid=34561\u0026amp;d=1349828964\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 1: Dang it!

This lowers your orbit and actually makes you go faster. It\u0027ll take a little while to catch up, but once you do, accelerate then to slow your orbit and match velocity. Once you are within about a km, you can just use your RCS system to directly jet over (more or less).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot the easiest of things to do and I am in need of a lot of practice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy only space station so far is this puppy. Not even any solar panels yet and only a single resident.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am working on the Olympus II which should have some solar panels as well as a command pod as an escape vessel. The Olympus I currently orbits at around 180km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am thinking I might send the Olympus II to Eve orbit. I have a tiny colony on the Mun and on Duna going. The Mun has a very small outpost/base that is not habitable as well as a rover and a 3 Kerbals from 2 missions (don\u0027t ask about the 4th Kerbal, RIP little buddy). Duna has two Kerbals and a rover on it (two missions) and one lander with some fuel left, but not enough for an orbit. The second lander crashed releasing the rover, fortunately with a Kerbal safe inside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t plan on trying to land on Eve any time soon, but I\u0027d like to visit it and map it. I figure this is a good way. Plus it\u0027ll give my Kerbals a safe place if I decide to land later and I am able to get a lander with sufficient delta V to get it at least back up to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ATTACH=CONFIG]34591[/ATTACH]\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-10T13:28:49Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2012 01:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by azazel1024\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
