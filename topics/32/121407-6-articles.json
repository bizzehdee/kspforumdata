Why sell all of Skyrim in one package when you can keep selling the core game DLC that should have come with the original purchase? I purposely do not buy those because their intentions are wrong. Compare completeness of a 2002 game versus a 2013 game that requires DLC to enjoy the full experience. I have even seen recent games where the DLC and the core game don\u0027t even add to the full experience that should be had.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen we bought KSP, we bought KSP, not cartoon KSP or misapplied physics KSP; as in, if I purchased \u0022KSP that is not realistic!,\u0022 then a realism mod that costs money can be understandable. But I bought KSP, and it is implied it is up to par and realistic based on the fabricated solar system it is played within. Conversely and similarly to my previous point, if I bought KSP: with OUR solar system, then I expect it to be realistic in that sense, as well, rather than purchased as such later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile many will argue realism KSP is like buying an alternate version of the game, they forget to incorporate all the programming that has already been accomplished to make the core game and the manpower used to create the expansion. Given, if it takes heavy manpower to create realism, might be compensable. But realism implies N-body physics, something the moderators are happy to remind you will never be included in any version of KSP, ever. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo ultimately, will I buy dlc for something like a reskinning that should be a simple mod(simple as in the state of the mod, not its programming and application), no.

Perhaps compensating the mod creators is a possibility depending on the difficulty and desire, but that is discussion best for another forum since it delves into opening the door to every mod creator charging awkward amounts for hard to measure services/goods, coupled with licensing problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EBut will I buy dlc that creates an entirely new experience? \u003C/em\u003Emaybe...maybe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I just have to vent, sorry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember in the 90s when they justified high cost (being $25 a game) in saying they had to print the box and sell the cd?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the boxes were made smaller, but the price went up to $30 for games on average?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen steam started late 90s. While steam is not the best example because it has so many discounts, it lends itself greatly to my point...Many manufacturers dodge production costs and sell via DL and DLC..but at what cost?

But I guess this is why I hate DLC versus a new game. It just hints at the idea that the game was incomplete, whether true or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then expansions got bad, too. Compare Vanilla WoW to the latest expansion. You buy WoW for $60 (back in the day) and it came with a lot of content.

The core game is $60 with hours and hours of play time, miles and miles of ground to cover, quests all over the place, and a core story. Hearth is $15. That is 1/4 the cost of the core game. My issue comes from not whether the DLC is fun, but why did they arbitrarily price it at 1/4 the cost of the core game? Is there 1/4 the land to roam, 1/4 additional quests? They priced it at $15 with the necessary code already in place and the personnel already hired and working on separate, related projects. The core game\u0027s cost makes sense - new engine, new everything. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is my issue with DLC. All I am talking about is ensuring DLC is worth it. When I say no to reskinning DLC, it is because I use the safe assumption the DLC will cost $15-$30 and did not require nearly 1/4 or 1/2 the effort the core game did. But when it does require that effort, effort should be rewarded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it is mind-blowingly fun (couldn\u0027t find this word\u0027s definition on google), and adds a ton to the game, simple or no, then I will likely get it.
