The challenge I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m thinking of is a flight and return and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m a bit concerned that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve made it too hard. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be working on some designs in sandbox mode tommorow to try and prove it is possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe challenge is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch a rocket using stock parts from Kerbin. Mechjeb is allowed since navigation is not part of the challenge. It must contain a probe or pod you designate as the core (you can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t pack multiple little ships and hope one survives). You must fly to Minmus and setup any approach you wish. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever once you enter Minmus SOI you cannot use any liquid fuel engines, solid fuel engines, RCS or kerbal jetpacks until you have finished landing. Decoupler spam or any other sneaky source of delta-v is also against the spirit of the challenge. You must \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153land\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 via lithobraking. Once you have landed (navball reads 0m/s on the surface) you should demonstrate that your ship is still functional by taking off and returning the core safely to Kerbin under your own power (you do not need to lithobrake on Kerbin). That means you cannot dock with anything you did not bring into Minmus SOI (if you find it useful it is legal to use docking ports on objects you did bring with you into Minmus SOI, so a lander might carry multiple return service modules as a shield and an RCS powered core that can dock with one that survived)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEntries are scored based on how much they weigh on the launchpad \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 the lighter the better. In the event of a tie then the weight of the vehicle returned to Kerbin is used, the heavier the better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHard mode is doing it on the Mun instead of Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be in the spirit of the challenge that results be reasonably reproducable - using quicksave to fly a ship into Minmus 100 times to get one lucky break is considered luck rather then skill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it proves \u0027impossible\u0027 (or at least very improbable) to complete the challenge as designed I might try to change it by reducing the distance from the SOI down to some specific altitude where engines must be shutdown.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Toastie_Buns","CreatedById":75603,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T03:45:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you\u0027re seriously overthinking this, dude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I\u0027m aware, the rules just state that you have to be able to do this yourself.
