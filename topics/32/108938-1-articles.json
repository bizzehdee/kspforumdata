Or is this not possible?\n\nBetter to say that the gravity from Earth and Sun balance so that the relative geometry between the three bodies (Earth, the sun, your vessel) remains the same over time. In KSP, you can actually sort of simulate this by placing your vessel on the same orbit as, but outside the SOI of, the orbiting body.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m considering on sending a replica mission that will need to be placed in LP1 (Lagrange Point 1)- but first I need to know is it possible?\n\nKS1 can\u0027t be simulated. Your vessel will pull ahead of Kerbin because of its lower orbit. KS4/5 can sort of be simulated as above, though an actual KS4/5 would not be directly on Kerbin\u0027s orbit, but slightly above it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E As I understand it, no.

They don\u0027t do it because n-body complicates everything (particularly time warp) and makes maneuver nodes much harder to implement and far less intuitive. In other words, it\u0027s gameplay, not technical capability that prevents it.\n\nTwo notes:\n\n1) L-points don\u0027t work in n-body simulations. They\u0027re only actually valid for 3-body simulations.\n\n2) Orbiter simulates n-body physics, solar radiation pressure, exosphere drag, orbital precession, gravity gradient torque, etc. If you want that stuff, head over to [http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/](http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/) and check it out."},{"CreatedByName":"Sky_walker","CreatedById":113214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T19:22:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I recall a post somewhere where someone did a 100-year simulation of the system with real n-body physics, and the only notable instability that manifested was that Vall and Bop got tossed out of the Jool system into solar orbits within a few years.
