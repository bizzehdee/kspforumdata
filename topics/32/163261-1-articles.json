The base has been ridiculously successful, although it\u0027s apparently successful enough to attract a Kraken, and this one is made of pure evil. To date 4 kerbals have died and two probes have been devoured.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Unfortunately I don\u0027t have pictures)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCase 1.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI placed a simple survey probe in a polar Minimus orbit at 26 kilometers. Probe worked great, did its job. I came back later to check on it, only to find it stretched across space and time. The probe core was fine, but the engines, fuel,\u00A0equipment etc etc were orbiting a few hundred meters ahead of the core, only by time warping would the probe \u0022reassemble\u0022. I shot the probe down and intend to launch another.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCase 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI built a Duna orbiter probe for a flyby contract, launched it from Minimus mun base, got it to Duna with a little cheering and some more money from the contract. This lead to another contract that needed a Duna lander. So I built one, launched it and made the Duna transfer. Only when the lander reached Duna it found no single from the relay capable probe that went before it. My orbiter simply vanished from reality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCase 3 and 4\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeres where things got real, and why Minimus outpost now has military grade antiair laser turrets and S.A.M. Batteries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I built the outpost I sent in two super heavy landers. One built for operating a science lab, the other to serve as the fuel factory until I built a separate one for the outpost. They did there jobs perfectly. One day I sent the science lander to another biome for science. Once done I went to my tracking station to clean up debris. I set the filters to display broken debris only as to avoid terminating any kerbals. When I finished I went back to the outpost, only to find that jeb and three white suits had vanished, along with their vehicles. Never to be seen again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission control finally took notice and sent the outpost blueprints for the AntiKraken DefenseHub, an addition that gave my base lasers\u00A0and nuclear missiles, just in case the beast returned for more.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey have begun calling it the Magic Kraken, due to its ability to completely vanish spaceships from reality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeware space pioneers, The kraken lives.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeiss Ikon","CreatedById":174016,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-14T23:27:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223121181\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022163261\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221500071251\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022177181\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ArmchairPhysicist\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n59 minutes ago, ArmchairPhysicist said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCase 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI built a Duna orbiter probe for a flyby contract, launched it from Minimus mun base, got it to Duna with a little cheering and some more money from the contract.

I quickly cancelled the time warp just as one of the wings was shredded clean off, but the odd thing was, the ship didn\u0027t come back together, all the pieces that were still attached were floating several feet from eachother all rotated at odd angles. It flew fine besides the missing wing, and responded normally despite none of it\u0027s pieces actually touching each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlaying with autostrut on the way down yielded very interesting results as well, \u0022pulling\u0022 and \u0022pushing\u0022 pieces here and there as I toggled through the modes.
