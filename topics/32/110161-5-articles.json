Case in point: all this bell-shape stuff. None of the engines in KSP model accurately a real engine, they are just a bunch of surface pixels that could have any properties but people want to find something about that arrangement of pixels to justify their position. Ignoring that another engine has a similar pixel arrangement but does not suffer from the same drawbacks implied.\n\nYou do have a bit of a point here. The engines in KSP, look wise anyway, don\u0027t match their stats.\n\n*Ahem, PorkJet? Can you please re-do all the stock engine models please?*\n\nBut, like, at the same time, The LV-909, Poodle, and LV-N were never ever meant to work in atmospheres.

The [AJ10](http://www.astronautix.com/engines/aj10118.htm) doesn\u0027t get an SL isp listed here, and virtually every dedicated vacuum engine listing will have no sea level isp listed. Going from what NonWonderDog posted earlier:\n\u003E we can safely assume that its isp at sea level was pretty much non-existent or nothing to write home to mom about.\n\nWell, I\u0027d wager they don\u0027t list it because they are never used except in a vacuum... so why bother.\n\nBut Yes, that is a good example, I guess vacuum engines really can be that bad (the SSMEs although definitely good in a vacuum or near vacuum, surely have much much higher chamber pressures than a small lander engine).\n\nSo I withdraw my objections to \\*how\\* poor the lv-909 and poodle are in the atmosphere.\n\nI always agreed with them being poor, but I guess they aren\u0027t unrealistically poor"},{"CreatedByName":"Mipe","CreatedById":109421,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T11:57:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E that engine has a name now you know.\n\nYes.

The old, unrealistic way meant you could just find one or two go-to engines and use them for everything. Now it actually matters that you pick out engines more suited for different phases of the mission.\n\nThis.\n\nIon SSTO\u0027s should have never worked. There have to be some limitations. In the various betas, there were several engines that I would just never use because they weren\u0027t better at anything than other engines. Thankfully this has been fixed.

I think what is really needed is some kind of electric propeller or ducted fan for that purpose that would also work on Eve and Duna (and Jool). I\u0027ve played around with some engines like that from mods and it\u0027s great fun making solar powered aircraft.\n\nI think a small propeller engine is a great idea. It would work on any planet with an atmosphere, assuming it used fuel\u002Boxidizer, or maybe electricity. It would add an interesting dimension.
