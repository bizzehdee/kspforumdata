KSP is probably my favorite game of all time. I love it. But it is unfinished. \n\u003E  The new parts where made by one man and it shows. They are not AAA quality by any means. Sound effects need changing, fairings need fixing, Unity 5 promises much, may deliver nothing. The aero model will change, again.. Performance is terrible, there are no environmental effects. there are bugs, big bugs, memory leaks, graphical glitches, nothing to do on planets except come home again, and I still bloody love the game but charging \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A330 is too much.

Honestly, I think steam sales have driven games to place a higher \u0022regular\u0022 price on games so they can set a sale price that they\u0027re willing to live with when the sales come around. With midweek madness and weekend sales giving you even more opportunity for a discounted sale, it really is the only thing that makes sense from an economic standpoint. The fact of the matter is if you tell people it\u0027s on sale, more will buy it and Steam has really started to reflect this in the last couple years.

Don\u0027t get me wrong, I love the game and have logged hundreds of hours on it, but I see it as a bit of a barrier to entry.

Using the equation someone else presented (amount spend/hours played = value), that means that each hour I\u0027ve played is valued at $0.006, basically FREE! (As of today I have 941 hours of play time).\n\nNow, about the price... I have paid $39.99 for many games going as far back as 1996. Some of them were \u0022da bom!\u0022 while others, well, \u0022bombed.\u0022 KSP is priced about right; I would easily and without reservation have spent that much to purchase this game based on the demo alone (the original demo I played was .17, I think).
