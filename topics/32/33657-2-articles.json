Mods, in general, improve the game; many of the new features in the last few patches (and in the next few, for that matter) were in mods before becoming official; wheels, 2.5m docking ports, mining for resources, mapping planets... all of these were in mods long before arriving in official patches. Other mods just remove some of the problems that the core game suffers from, like larger fuel tanks that allow you to build space stations with fewer total parts (and therefore less lag), or solar panels with more useful shapes. And there are some that just add to aesthetics. It\u0027s fine to want to play the basic game, but don\u0027t get the knee-jerk reaction some players have to mods; the only good objection I\u0027ve seen to most of those mods is the compatibility issue (other people not being able to use your designs, having some issues when the game updates).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are only a handful of mods that actually create the \u0022easy mode\u0022 you want to avoid. MechJeb is the most notable, due to its autopilot features, but there are also a few part mods that provide parts purely superior to the stock ones. As long as you avoid those, you\u0027ll still have all of the challenge of the core game; in some ways, you\u0027ll actually have MORE of a challenge, because you\u0027ll now be able to do things that the core game simply can\u0027t do, like landing on Jool or flying a jet plane on Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Merinsan","CreatedById":57629,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T00:31:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is truly incredible how much time you can spend sending a single ship to Jool.
