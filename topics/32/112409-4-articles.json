In KSP the situation is inverted - the space-program is an entirely civilian endeavour and (stock) military technology is created by re-purposing civilian hardware. \n\nCreating military hardware out of stock parts creates some interesting design challenges, and I wouldn\u0027t strictly rule it out on pacifist grounds (Kerbals may not fight wars, but they might still have use for an air-to-air missile to shoot down out of control drones, remove obstructions, etc.). Kerbals seem somewhat like they would design what we would consider \u0027fighter bombers\u0027 for peaceful engineering purposes. ([*Before you laugh incredulously, it\u0027s not as bizarre as some of the things that we\u0027ve tried*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaceful_nuclear_explosion)). Given the huge space-focus and enjoyment of explosions, I can also see use for A-SAT missiles in the Kerbal world.\n\nWith what we\u0027ve seen of Kerbals they don\u0027t seem a good match for military situations, so \u0022militarising KSP\u0022 in that sense wouldn\u0027t fit the tone of the game, but in terms of simply designing pseudo-military hardware I don\u0027t see an issue. In multiplayer, I can see a bigger case for warfare, since battling vehicles you\u0027ve designed yourself would be fun, though part of the challenge of a KSP battle would be how unfit-for-purpose the hardware is and dedicated military mods may detract from that.\n\n The current situation is ideal, at least for single player - a civilian space program, where it is in the hands of the player to decide whether they want to build an F-15 with an A-SAT missile to remove outdated communication satellites, or just de-orbit them with a small probe or onboard engine.\n\nI\u0027d also make a distinction somewhere between \u0022weapons\u0022 that exist purely to destroy automated equipment, and ones that pose a risk to Kerbalkind, but I can\u0027t think of a way to fit that into everything else I\u0027ve written. There\u0027s no harm in Kerbals blowing up obsolete planes by radio-control, but blowing up planes/ships with crew inside them is another matter.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T23:58:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 11:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Coam**"},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T00:07:11Z","Content":"A lot of iconic aircraft are military vehicles.
