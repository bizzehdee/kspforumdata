I would not reccommend you going to Hawaii. I personally have never been there before, but haven\u0027t heard any good things yet. Maybe because I never asked anyone about Hawaii, but thats not the point. I have been to the Island you mentioned in KSP and I highly suggest you skip your Hawaii trip and go there instead, it\u0027s well worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
