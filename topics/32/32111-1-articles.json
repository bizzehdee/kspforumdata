For one thing, the legs of my lander were constantly twitching, which doesn\u0027t happen on other bodies, and I sent a kerbal on EVA, and almost lost him into the depths of space when he tripped and went spinning off into the sky uncontrollably. I managed to regain control of him using his jetpack controls, but it took some time and effort. I only stayed for a few minutes and then promptly packed up and put the lander into a high parking orbit around Eve for later retrieval. I must say overall I didn\u0027t like Gilly at all (and I don\u0027t mean that as a complaint... it just means I won\u0027t be going back anytime soon).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut enough about me.

I\u0027m in the process of sending a small probe to its surface, which will be the second Gilly landing for me. If I learned anything from the first, manned landing, it\u0027s that you don\u0027t trust your legs; either yours or those on the lander. They won\u0027t work in the low gravity.
