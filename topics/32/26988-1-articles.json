Once they are in the air they control just fine, but for some reason they are reluctant to become airborne. What usually happens when I take off at the KSC runway, is that I pitch up the whole time with nothing happening, and then at the end of the runway, there is a little bump in the ground that gets me a few feet off the ground and from there I never have an issue getting into the air (assuming the tail of my plane doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t smash into the ground, which has been known to happen).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there some trick to generating lift while you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re on the ground? Realistically I know large airplanes rely on flaps to generate the required lift, though I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not sure how to design this in game or if it is even necessary. Seems silly to have to rely on bumps to get planes into the air, so some tips are appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SecondGuessing","CreatedById":62686,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T16:24:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn image would be handy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like you issue is the angle of attack when on its wheels.

Generally being unable to get a plane off the runway usually means you have insufficient lift for the plane mass. You have two options.
