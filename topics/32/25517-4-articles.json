This is because when you first start KSP, and are bad at all things, there is a conflict that drives you to keep playing, the conflict between your designs and the physics engine. After you have played for long time, such as I have, and find all previous things lacking a challenge, you lose the conflict. Then you begin to look for different kinds of conflict. Maybe it\u0027s the Mission controller mod, Perhaps it\u0027s Deadly re-entry, FAR, etc. These all present a conflict between your designs and another incomparable thing: a budget, the threat of destruction, the use of proper aerodynamics. Weapons provide a different kind of conflict, a conflict between two of your own designs. When I use weapons, it\u0027s never to kill other Kerbals, it\u0027s to test designs. And when it isn\u0027t, it\u0027s to drive a plot I have in my head. Besides, I never test on manned craft. It\u0027s important to remember that all games have conflict, just as all films, and all stories. A book about a man walking down the street to a bus stop and waiting for a few minutes wouldn\u0027t be as interesting as a murder mystery, or a love story. Violence is just another way of creating conflict and tension in a plot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point I\u0027m trying to make is that weapons are: 1) A challenge 2) A different kind of conflict 3) One way to continue the appeal of playing the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, jet fighters are just cool. they don\u0027t have to be shooting at someone to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T05:14:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd yet one more necro from last May.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocketscience101","CreatedById":12864,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T09:15:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWar is a terrible place to end up.
