As it was approaching, some things overheated and exploded. The game crashes somewhere around 2 million kilometres, but that\u0027s probably because I use some mods. Maybe not, though. It behaves as if I lost free RAM even if I lower the textures significantly.\n\n![594BD2D2D29DED9B1B8C4BB6259FABDCD7E7DC5A](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/26241203487589465/594BD2D2D29DED9B1B8C4BB6259FABDCD7E7DC5A/)\n\nThe question is - how to manage all the heat Kerbol is pounding the probe with? [I\u0027ve requested this mod recently, but nobody replied.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122168-Solar-shield)\n\nMy approach so far is to use a large shield and NFE radiators looking towards the space behind.\n\n(In addition to this topic - I\u0027ve heard some people managed to perform (partial? total?) aerobraking above (how much?) this star. How is that even possible with such enormous radiative heat coming out? It\u0027s not even realistic if it\u0027s in the corona because corona is a tiny fragment of one pascal. Couple billion of particles per cubic centimeter. That\u0027s a very strong vacuum. The only aerobraking I could expect is in the lower chromosphere. There is no benefit from unrealistic solar atmosphere in KSP.)\n\nI\u0027m all for Kerbol being a monster you can not approach, FYI."},{"CreatedByName":"tychodin","CreatedById":100446,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T18:20:07Z","Content":"i\u0027ve successfully gotten to within half the moho orbital distance before running out of fuel, and i definitely noticed the incidental heating at periapsis. if your game crashed, you probably had the heating gauges on? those have a memory leak in the current version.\n\nthere are several heat management mods out there, though, and a heat-shield is really only effective for reentry, as once it ablates, it no longer shields."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T18:29:52Z","Content":"You probably crashed because of the memory leak associated with overheating parts. Contrary to popular belief, it\u0027s not the little heat gauges that can be turned off by pressing F10, but rather the red glow effect that hot parts get laid over them. That can be disabled in the game options I believe (though I forget what it\u0027s called).\n\nAs for how to... I must admit I\u0027ve never tried it in 1.0, but my first impulse would be to install the largest heat shield available at the very front and instruct my probe or pilot to always point the craft radial-in... meaning the heatshield always faces the sun and the craft itself always remains in the shadow. The ablator on the heatshield should be consumed over time, negating some of the intense heat influx. I would try to insulate the rest of the craft from the heatshield... using stock parts, I dunno, perhaps another, smaller heatshield? I know those are among the parts that conduct the least in stock KSP. Or perhaps mount the heatshield on something with a really tiny bulkhead cross-section, like an I-beam or cubic octagonal strut. I would have to test to see what works best. The craft itself, I\u0027d try to have something with a large thermal mass on it so it can soak for a while without endangering fragile components if some head leaks through the kludged-together \u0022insulation\u0022.\n\nMod parts? I\u0027d install Nertea\u0027s [Heat Control](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124391) and use two insulator parts back to back between the heatshield and the craft. Perhaps active radiators on the inside of the heatshield, if they can surface-attach to it, in order to help mitigate the heat buildup.\n\nFinally, I wouldn\u0027t go quite as low as 1.8 km... ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) Don\u0027t you explode way before getting that close anyway?

Second, the probe core is in the middle of the craft, then the science instruments above that, then the battery and solar panels. This was intentional: the items are placed in order of greatest heat resistance and least mission value towards the sun. It was holding stable at around 1300 degrees on the top heatshield, 1150 degrees on the solar panels and less than that on everything else at 900,000,000m or so from the sun.
