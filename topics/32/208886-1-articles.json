I own a PS5 and a Series X and am thinking of getting back into KSP. I already own the original XB1 version so am entitled to the free update. However the Enhanced Complete bundle is currently on offer on PS5 for just slightly more than the cost of the two DLC packs that I would need to buy for the Xbox. I\u2019d heard that the PS5 version is entirely native code so my question is this \u2026. Is it therefore more efficient and is there any significant difference between the two next gen console versions? Would I be better off getting the PS5 version or does it really make no difference?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
