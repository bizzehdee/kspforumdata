From the error I recieved I am guessing you might be using an old version of the Kethane mod. I have the most current version installed yet it thinks I am missing the medium kethane pump when I try and load this craft. After a quick google I noticed that the medium kethane pump was included on the orignal interations of the Kethane mod. I am only guessing now that the older mod, if you have it, isn\u0027t happy with the newer code in the 0.2x versions of this game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems the forums are the best and most current location for some of the mods that are in development.
