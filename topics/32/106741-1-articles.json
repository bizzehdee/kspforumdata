After I downloaded 1.0.1, I went and built a shoddy, unstable plane with two turbojets attached. I throttled it up as fast as it would go, and once I got to a certain speed I lost control authority. The plane pulled nose up hard, lost a lot of speed, stalled, and then entered into an uncontrolled spin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Jy9NAtN.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022Jy9NAtN.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt that point there wasn\u0027t enough airflow over the wings for my control surfaces to have any effect, and of course I crashed shortly thereafter. Now I\u0027m a huge flight sim fan, and for it to be possible to have what looks like a spin after a stall, in KSP, just got me all giddy inside. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
