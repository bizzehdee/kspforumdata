I had two tanks that weighed about 30 t apiece, both armed with some i beam rockets. The rockets were the typical I beam \u002B two sepratrons and could reach speeds of about 300ms at about 1000 meters range. I had been playing around with these tanks shooting each other with i beam rockets and I had done this a few times previously with nothing unusual happening. This time I had aimed tank A at tank B and fired a rocket. Tank B was 200 meters away from Tank A and going 0ms, the rocket was probably going around 200ms. The rocket missed and eventually hit the ground almost a km away. I moved tank A a little closer to get a better shot. But as I was moving tank A, tank B all of the sudden went from 0ms to 300 or something in one second and travel about 200 to 250 meters. Something popped inside the tank, I never found what it was but other than that the tank was OK. My figuring is that the game somehow confused the current speed of the rocket (300ms) with the current speed of tank B (0ms). I\u0027ve tried to replicate this many times but have not been able to. I don\u0027t know if this is a known Kraken or not ,but if it isn\u0027t, I have name for it \u00A0\u00220 to 60 Kraken\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corona688","CreatedById":2511,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-14T02:31:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat could have been the wheel / landing leg kraken.\u00A0 Sometimes when you load a ship, or approach a different ship, on load its wheels will clip under the ground a bit and repel it into the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeb federation","CreatedById":173430,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-14T04:29:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223243843\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022168507\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221513218673\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u00222511\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Corona688\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Corona688 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat could have been the wheel / landing leg kraken.\u00A0 Sometimes when you load a ship, or approach a different ship, on load its wheels will clip under the ground a bit and repel it into the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell it didn\u0027t fly, just skidded forward across the ground really fast.
