Now the parachutes don\u0027t provide a fixed drag value so much as add extra drag based on their area, so a \u0022drag\u0022 stat would have to be a ballpark estimate at best."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T20:03:06Z","Content":"Drag is proportional to the square of the velocity, and therefore is meaningless if no reference velocity is given.\n\nIn the old days, the given \u0022drag when x\u0022 value was multiplied by the part mass and 0.008 to get (area \\* Cd). Now you can just use (diameter^2/4 \\* pi) to get area \\* Cd (assumed Cd of 1)."},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T20:08:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Drag is proportional to the square of the velocity, and therefore is meaningless if no reference velocity is given.\n\nWe could use an arbitrary \u0022drag unit\u0022 that would be just used to compare different parachutes. It would simply let you know that *x* chute has *y* times the drag for this other one etc... \n\nI guess a reference velocity wouldn\u0027t be very useful, because parachutes are used to slow you down... therefore your velocity changes a lot while you pop them. Knowing a chute\u0027s performance at a precise speed wouldnt serve much of a purpose since you would only pass through that speed during a few instants. (i dont know much about aerodynamics, so i could be making a mistake here)"}]}
