Let\u0027s hope they fix Making History soon. I\u0027m not too worried about them fixing KSP on console yet, prefer they concentrate on PC, then when that\u0027s sorted to work on other versions. Let\u0027s hope it not too long cos it\u0027s pretty frustrating at the moment when it breaks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"silverfox101","CreatedById":186580,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-24T20:12:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223332908\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022172877\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221521864652\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022100102\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Clockwork13\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, Clockwork13 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaking games takes time.
