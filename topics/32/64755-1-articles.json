All you do is build something that can get off the ground, go somewhere, and come back. If you can get just to Mun, you can get anywhere else. You don\u0027t have to change anything you do. All you have to do is build a rocket with enough fuel and thrust for the job, differing only in degree, not in fundamentals, from going to Mun.

The question is not IF I will go to a place, but how and in how many phases. I can do anything that needs to be done to accomplish a mission, but I am prone to being rusty in some skills. I don\u0027t use some skills, so I lose them. I think that mastery has a building component to it too. Simple rockets can be grasped in the span of a week, but a space shuttle, an SSTO, a grand tour ship, or a reusable ship are completely different challenges. Mastering orbital mechanics is not the only hurdle to becoming a \u0022master.\u0022 Oh, and Dodgey makes a good point. The title should be GIVEN, not proclaimed. And I would like to add that masters come in two Flavors: Master Builders and Master Pilots \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
