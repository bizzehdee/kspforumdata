(With PAO narration) \\[HD!\\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkWJph4-3Ks#ws)\n\n***NOTE:*** *The video was uploaded at 1080HD, but as it is currently \u0027Processing\u0027 as of 3:51PST, May 21st, 2012, you will not be able to view it in anything over 360. If the problem persists after processing is completed, I will have to re-upload.*\n\nYes, I realize I\\\u0027m not the best Jack King, but I had nobody else for narration at the moment, so I did what I could. I have launched several Titan-II GLV rockets on Kerbal Space Program, but this particular one was carrying David Skott and Neil Karmstrong to a rendezvous and Kerbin\\\u0027s second space walk mission.\n\nUnfortunately, the mission was cut short after a thruster malfunction and the EVA didn\\\u0027t happen.\n\nBelatedly, after making the narration, I realized how low in value my down range number announcements were, so it might see a little bit slow in horizontal Delta-V, but I guess we\\\u0027ll have to move past this.\n\nI do plan to put together a \u0027parts required\u0027 list and a .craft file for anyone who would like to fly my Titan II rocket. It is a great machine."},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T23:57:52Z","Content":"For the 50 of you that already saw this video (give or take), I just made my advanced Saturn V.

These videos were made in the style of the ones you see of the old launches from Kennedy Space Center. There are some readouts that I miss, but I really am pressed for time throughout the narration.\n\nThis is my most advanced SaturnV craft and it took a while to make sure all the staging was set. If you notice, I make the skirt separation on stage two fairly early, because due to a glitch, the engines won\\\u0027t accelerate the craft while the skirt is there. To properly achieve orbit, I had to get rid of that pretty quickly.\n\nThen, of course, MechJeb thinks that skirt sep wants the rocket to then fire its escape tower and the whole skirt sep, LES/BPC jettison is done too quickly.\n\nOn another note, I do realize that Apollo 8 was not a night launch, but the \u0027ignition sequence\u0027 only shows up at night, and that\\\u0027s my favorite part! (Save for the staging, of course!).\n\nYou may have noticed that the Ignition Sequence started at 6 seconds when it should have started at nine seconds, but that was due to a narration error and it was something I could not fix until I noticed it.\n\nLet\\\u0027s just pretend the engines delayed a little bit!\n\nThis was shot in version .15.

I was going to have a commander speak to the CAPCOM, but my friend Jackson went to some Lacrosse thing before I could ask for his voice over. \n\nWith my Titan II and Saturn V launches receiving good feedback, I took a leap into the future here and went with the old Space Shuttle. NASA\\\u0027s Space Shuttle is certainly not my favorite launch vehicle, but it\\\u0027s still a pretty cool system and I found it worth doing.\n\nMy mom did the voice of the CAPCOM on this one and I think she did great. It sounds very realistic!\n\nWith all three of these vehicles launched, I\\\u0027m really looking for ideas for another video, so as long as everyone wants, I will gladly do another one.
