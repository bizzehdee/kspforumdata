So I wanted to see how fast I could land on the Mun by just speeding at it the whole time. Half way there i realized I would crash into it unless i turned off the engines. But i was still too fast and when i was about to hit it, instead of blowing up, I just went through it. I just kept going and then came out the other end. Unfortunately I didn\\\u0027t get any pictures, and i was wondering if this was part of the the Space Kraken bug.
