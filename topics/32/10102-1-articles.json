So I wanted to see how fast I could land on the Mun by just speeding at it the whole time. Half way there i realized I would crash into it unless i turned off the engines. But i was still too fast and when i was about to hit it, instead of blowing up, I just went through it. I just kept going and then came out the other end. Unfortunately I didn\\\u0027t get any pictures, and i was wondering if this was part of the the Space Kraken bug.

That\\\u0027s when the Kraken usually starts to become noticeable. It basically glitches the physics engine, and you end up not being able to control your ship. Your ship typically just spins out of control every which way."},{"CreatedByName":"chillman1212","CreatedById":16988,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-05T18:55:17Z","Content":"It happened to me again while using the Component Space Shuttle.
