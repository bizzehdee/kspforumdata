The first is being able to point the ship/asteroid in the right direction. Like the poster above me says, you\u0027ll turn \u003Cem\u003Eeventually\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0 if you have enough patience. You can put extra reaction wheels and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E (or better, the more powerful vernor thrusters) on your ship to speed things up. When I captured a ~1400-ton class E roid, it took something like 15 minutes of game time to turn 180 degrees. That wasn\u0027t a problem as long as I pointed the ship in the right direction well before any upcoming maneuvers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second issue is keeping the ship/roid pointed in the right direction during maneuvers. You want to make sure that your ship is pointed directly towards the asteroid\u0027s center of mass -- you can unlock the claw and do this even after you grab the roid. Once I have the asteroid captured and the ship pointed towards center of mass, I EVA and engineer and have them install 4 struts between the ship and the asteroid. This will (hopefully) eliminate the ship bending at the claw joint when you fire up the engines. Then it\u0027s just a matter of engine gimbal, reaction wheels, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E/vernor thrusters to keep you on target while firing the engines. A pull design avoids a lot of these problems, but at the cost of being more difficult to design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
