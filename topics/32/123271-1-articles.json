I would actually move Tylo in closer than Laythe toward Jool, and make it more Io-like with high heat, enormous volcanoes and volcanic pits, and coated with red, yellow, and black tuff.

However, the difference in difficulty is huge. Laythe is a challenge on a whole different level. So one thing I\u0027d do is to insert an attractive target between Duna and Laythe in difficulty.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-18T11:27:26Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2015 11:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Vermil\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kuansenhama","CreatedById":114023,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T13:32:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, yes, this is fun...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I think the Kerbin-Mun-Minimus System would be pretty much unchanged. I might made Minimus a bit more inclined on its orbit and change the color to more of a bluish white, with patches of brown/gray. I know in the game they make a joke that it looks like mint ice cream, so I guess now it would have to be blueberry ice cream. But the really light greenish-blue just rubs me the wrong way. I\u0027d also make it more inclined in its orbit to make it harder to get to since its pretty easy to grind out science there when playing on career.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoho and Eve systems would be unchanged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d personally like to redesign the Duna system to be more realistic, with two small gilly-like asteroids for moons. Or maybe just one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnto the Dres-teroid belt. I\u0027d add a few more objects on orbits similar to Dres. Nothing too crazy. I wanted to add worlds called Nobal and Sosun. Nobal being larger, icy and more inclined. Sosun being smaller, rocky/metallic and having a very long rotational period.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool system would replace Laythe with a planet more like Io, with volcanoes and a colorful surface produced by sulfur. Perhaps 0.5g and tenuous no oxygen atmosphere. Don\u0027t worry about Laythe, It\u0027s just been moved. I know a lot of people love Laythe, so I\u0027m not getting rid of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom here it would basically be Snarus, Urlum and Niedon from OPM with all of their respective moons and with Eeloo acting as the game\u0027s pluto. I would give Eeloo a satellite called Charkon. (Charon) probably very similar to it in a lot of ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, at about 5x the orbit of Eeloo would be a nemesis star on a rather circular but 20 degree inclined orbit. (Small, red dwarf star) In order around it, it would have:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA large gas planet orbiting the star, with texturing similar to Jupiter. This hot jupiter would be being blasted away by the solar wind and orbiting in but a couple days on a highly inclined orbit. The material ejected would form a faint spiral around the star.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA large, hot desert planet with a few canyons with rivers in them. Bluish green oceans and reddish sandy beaches. Oxygen atmosphere 1.2ATM ASL and 1.3g. Possible name: Lystos. Lystos would have a moon called Kyte, a black volcanic sandy moon with a black and white surface and a tenuous atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA water/Ice planet with but a thin band of ocean around the equator. (Kind of like the OP\u0027s picture of Laythe) The same size/g force as Duna, but a little more atmosphere. This would force players to pick non-equitorial landing sites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA fast spinning oblate planet like Inaccessible from original KPF. This one would only spin slightly slower than gravity would allow, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA retrograde planet, similar to Dres with a satellite/moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA blue gas planet like Sentar from the original KPF. Somewhat inclined relative to the plane of the star. Laythe would be one of the Moons. It would also have a moon like Thud with 3g and no atmosphere, at least one one shepherding satellite and perhaps a retrograde or highly inclined moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA high eccentric comet planet like (uhh Hale?) from KPF.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy reasoning behind all of this is I wanted to make the Kerbin system a touch more realistic and based off of the real solar system. I\u0027ve heard a few people complain about the realism of the Duna-Ike system. I still wanted it to feel \u0027Kerbal\u0027, sort of cartoony and exaggerated, since this is after all a game, but fix a few of the things that I know bother people most. (Hence I wouldn\u0027t do things like make Eve yellow instead of purple or make Jool look like Jupiter). Then, the Nemesis system would exist with all the fantasy and far-fetched planets. All the requests for retrograde planets and other absurdly challenging and sci-fi planets can be put into the nemesis system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlayers who want the game to be realistic can have their cake, but for the players who like a more sci-fi approach or want planets that are a little more crazy challenging are generally the same ones who use mods, and hence could use a warp drive or hall thruster or whatever else the modmakers cook up to travel to the nemesis system and play around with the more absurd planets.
