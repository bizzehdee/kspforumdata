Needless to say, I was right before, and the contractor is stuck at a ridiculous altitude, with an orbit slightly larger than that of Plock from the outer planets mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would take me 52 years just to get to that altitude as I attempted today, and I\u0027m simply not saving a stupid Kerbal if it\u0027s going to take so much effort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever canceling is an easy way out, so I was going to ask how I could move it to a more reasonable but still challenging orbit. I\u0027m thinking somewhere close to the Sun would make sense as with the second rescue-from-Sun contract I have, which still has high delta-V requirements without the ridiculous travel time, so how would I go about teleporting Phoalla Kerman\u0027s ship to a low Sun orbit, perhaps with some inclination to further the challenge, without breaking the mission or the save?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T11:29:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you considered to fly a high energy transfer, New Horizons style?
