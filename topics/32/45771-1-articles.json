So at this point, I have a space station jam packed with Kerbals (to the point that sometimes multiple Kerbals appear on the portrait\u0027s area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I am trying to do is remove most of the Kerbal\u0027s completely at this point. I don\u0027t really want to fuss at this point with sending several rockets up to manually remove them, etc. I just want them gone. I tried playing with the Crew Manifest mod it seems to not have the ability to remove Kerbal\u0027s from already launched flights. I also tried editing my persistence file with limited success. It seemed like I was able to remove some Kerbal\u0027s, but removing others would cause the persistence file to become unloadable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas on how I can accomplish my objective?
