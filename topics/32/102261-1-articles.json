Whenever I try out new mods, I start a brand new save. When I feel a sense of completion with a career, and want to try different difficulty settings, I start a new save.\n\nI feel that in many ways I\u0027m still exploring aspects of the game itself, and still have much to learn. Therefore, I don\u0027t tend to build up a lot of infrastructure yet. I usually concentrate on planning, engineering, and piloting one mission at a time.

I end up starting new games a lot because I think the early game is so much fun now, especially in hard mode. You actually have to do a little strategic planning about which buildings to upgrade when.

I always play career with science and money, so my gaming tends to take a lot of time to be able to go to another planet.\n\nI am very sad that I never left Kerbin to other planet, because with the mods I use that make the game more realistic, like life support, remote tech and others, my progression is very slow. I also use the stage recover mod, were I have to plan my rockets very careful to be able to recover them and save the most funds I can get. This involves of 95% of the rocket to have parachutes everywhere and precise ejection stages.\n\nBelieve it or not, KSP updates more faster then I can progress, but it is also true that I do not play KSP everyday.
