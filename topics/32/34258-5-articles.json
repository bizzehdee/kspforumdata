It is, however, \u003Cstrong\u003Eliterally \u003C/strong\u003Eonly one step up from real machine language (ML). The CPU knows only ones and zeros in groups of 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 BITS (Not bytes), and we humans don\u0027t remember ones and zeros in 4, 8 16, 32, or 64 bit format easily, and also don\u0027t easily remember what the ML byte code for NOP is versus JMP. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(Some of us don\u0027t even remember our PIN for our bank cards when standing in line in a grocery store. .. .. ahem....)\u003C/span\u003E Hence its called \u0022Assembly Language\u0022. Assembly is also a compiled language, unlike Basic which is a purely interpreted language. C/C\u002B\u002B is also a compiled language, but, it knows how to take something like \u0022printf\u0022 and convert it into a lot of ML that will output something to a screen, file, or whatever the device in question is. The \u0022Assembly Language\u0022 is also a type of direct mapping to whatever instruction set is available for a set of CPUs and its mapping is directly set for a particular CPU type. That is how close to \u0022ML\u0022 ASM is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssembly *is* also portable between makes of CPUs, but it depends on the instruction set itself, and/or whether or not the compiler itself knows how to convert the assembled code into a ML instruction set for that CPU. If you use a really, really, REALLY basic instruction set, the compiler will be able to translate what you\u0027ve done into something the CPU of any flavor can handle, provided ALL CPUs know how to deal with the instructions in question, AND you tell the compiler WHAT language to compile for. The ML itself, however, IS NOT cross CPU compatible as far as AMD to Intel to ARM to whatever else. I would bet my lunch money on the fact that every CPU out there knows what a NOP and JMP instruction is, but some may not be smart enough to know what a CMPX is (Extended compare - Typically reserved for 32-bit and better CPUs IIRC). You wouldn\u0027t find CMPX on a 16-bit type of CPU. I\u0027ll also bet tomorrows lunch money that NOP and JMP are both different instruction IDs as far as the CPU is concerned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy weigh in on Unity and KSP itself, I\u0027m on the boat that more FPS is better. But KSP isn\u0027t even alpha, so I give it a very VERY wide margin for my tolerances in regards to speed. Sooner the better, IMO, but in a battle of stability versus performance, to me, is much MUCH more important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Meraco\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Meraco\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe human eye sees fluid motion at 20 - 25 FPS, this is the typical rate by which we watch movies, TV, and other media.

First, the human eye doesn\u0027t work on an FPS system, and neither does the brain. If it did, we\u0027d see the spokes on a wheel hub while driving down the highway instead of a blur, or solid mass with the the calipers behind said \u0022solid mass\u0022. The brain makes a \u0022best guess\u0022 to what the situation is and blurs things together if necessary so it \u0022makes sense\u0022 and reduces strain. Second, it depends on the specific individual (Which is where that 1% is) and what they\u0027re used to seeing on a monitor (Yes, real life is different than a refresh rate on a computer monitor). Third, you put two monitors, side by side, one running at 60hz and another at 120hz and do anything, even running just calculator on your desktop and dragging it around, you will see a difference in what kind of response you get. The 120 will look smoother. This is, of course, assuming that the video card is setup to work at 120hz.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I bought my 42\u0022 TV about a year and a half ago, I stood in walmart, best buy, future shop, and other electronic stores, watching a wall of TVs for HOURS (in total, and yes, literally stood and watched commercials for a good 30-45 minutes at a time at different stores, sometimes the same store on a different week) to decide on what model I wanted. SPECIFICALLY I was looking to see if there was ANY difference in frame rates, or at least what the difference would look like, just to see if there was a difference between 60 and 120, as well as picture quality between manufactures and models, and THEN went up close to look at specific capabilities. I noticed the difference even BEFORE I looked at the individual capabilities of each TV. Standing about 20 feet back, I could see that the 60hz TV was a bit more \u0022jerky\u0022 between refreshes. What was showing on the wall of TVs was just through a video repeater, so it wasn\u0027t like I was looking at two different signals. Now, there are a few stipulations that I don\u0027t have the answer to, and someone can come bite me in the rear for... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1\u0026gt; First, was the repeater working at 120hz? Doesn\u0027t matter as it was a stream to whatever the capabilities of the the repeater were AT MINIMUM. So if the repeater threw it off at 60hz, the 120s threw up at 60 and may have \u0022flushed\u0022 the two different images together. Point is, I could see a difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; Were the TVs themselves setup for 120? One would like to assume that the TVs come out of the boxes at whatever their top rate speeds were, not at less. Even if there was a chance, not all of them across several walls of TVs were configured as such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3\u0026gt; Were they hooked up via HDMI, Component or Composite? I COULD see this being a significant difference, especially at the Composite point, but, this isn\u0027t the 90s and not many TVs that are being put out on display are run off a composite cables anymore. ESPECIALLY to show off its high end capabilities. (Composite = single cable that splits the RGB signal; Component = Three colors sent across three wires)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you ask the guy NEXT to me who was wondering WTF I was doing, and asked him if he could see a difference, he MIGHT have said no. Why? With absolutely no disrespect, his brain may not have been wired well enough to SEE the difference, or his brain didn\u0027t understand HOW to tell the difference, or he just wasn\u0027t paying attention to that kind of detail. Even with all that said, with my seeing that there was a difference AT ALL indicates that either I\u0027m special, like my mommy and daddy told me so, or, the whole FPS thing is just an excuse for bad performance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-24T18:56:58Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2013 06:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Pontiac\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EDidn\u0026#039;t want to double-post\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jfx","CreatedById":37282,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-24T19:40:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Meraco\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Meraco\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe human eye sees fluid motion at 20 - 25 FPS, this is the typical rate by which we watch movies, TV, and other media.
