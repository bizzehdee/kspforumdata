I expect the solar system to be \u0027similar\u0027 to ours since they said it would be, but with a twist. So far that twist has come in the form of Kerbin/\u0027earth\u0027 having two moons instead of one and the other semi-revealed planet having a very large moon resulting in being tidally locked with each other.
