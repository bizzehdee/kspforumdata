While the orbiter had plenty of extra fuel (I later sent the same ship configuration for an easy Minmus mission) the lander was really tight since this was really the first time it was being used. I used about 49% of the fuel for the landing, and that from a 5km orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should have had just enough delta V but I screwed up the ascent - the only other Mun return I\u0027d done was with a single stage system so I didn\u0027t think twice before just burning straight up for a few seconds until I felt I was clear of the surface. However by then I\u0027d used 12L of my remaining 28L of fuel and sent Bob on a course then went way above 5km with no hope of making a stable orbit on the remaining fuel. I had no intention of leaving Bob in a little can to wait for a rescue mission to be planned and sent from Kerbin so I did the only sensible thing, I applied a course correction to get the lander in line with the orbiter as it fell back to the Mun, waited till they where close and then burned all the remaining fuel to get the velocities as close as possible before Bob jumped out and eye-balled a final orbit with his jetpack (he managed to get an orbit with a PE of 4.5km). Over in the orbiter Lodfel Kerman, knowing that his own fuel situation could be in trouble (it turned out he had lots) managed to do an intercept almost entirely using RCS and getting the orbiter 40m from Bob at nearly zero relative velocity. Bob jetted over and boarded the orbiter even as the lander had crashed back into the Mun a few minutes earlier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
