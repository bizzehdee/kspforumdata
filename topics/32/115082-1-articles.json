I noticed no difference there. But what they did do was blow up the part they were attached to after using time-warp out in space. Despite the ship not being hot at all.\n\n[![19235831399_6e0b5c68f2_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/273/19235831399_6e0b5c68f2_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/viNEvv)\n\nIn this case, the radiators were attached to the 1.25m SAS unit about in the middle of the ship. Also attached to this SAS unit were 2 1x6 solar panels (the ones that look vertical in the left part of the image). The left image shows the ship immediately after leaving Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere after an aerobraking pass at 40km. The entire ship is the \u0022cool\u0022 color, no thermal gauges showing. At this point, I warped around orbit (Ap about 5Mm) for another pass. I stopped warp at about 120km, before hitting the atmosphere again, to get lined up properly retrograde, retract the solar panels, etc. As soon as the warp stopped, the SAS unit blew up, tearing the ship in half as shown in the right part of the pic.\n\nThe plan had been to lower the Ap down to a couple hundred km, circularize and then deorbit with the engine, stage that, and land the pod and the science stuff and SAS unit. The heat shield was on the rear side of the SAS unit, so when the ship was blown in half, no more heat shield. There being nothing for it, the decapitated head of the ship came in for a landing sans heat shield, leading with a 1.25m service bay from a 5Mm Ap. Reentry caused no damage at all to any of the remaining parts. This was with 100% reentry heat.\n\nSo, something seems terribly wrong here. Radiators don\u0027t help, they hurt. Furthermore, the fact that hte SAS unit exploded reveals a flaw in the model, with heat flowing into the SAS unit faster than the attached radiators could get rid of it. It doesn\u0027t work that way."},{"CreatedByName":"Gamer025","CreatedById":147417,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T01:53:58Z","Content":"Are you seriously trying to deal with reentry heat by putting radiators on your ships?"},{"CreatedByName":"windows_x_seven","CreatedById":112926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T02:06:50Z","Content":"Heat is so glitchy right now, clipped parts overheat and explode as well."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T04:35:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Are you seriously trying to deal with reentry heat by putting radiators on your ships?\n\nNo. I had just heard people were doing that so wanted to see if it worked. It shouldn\u0027t. If the ship is getting hot from the air, then the air is hotter than the ship. Because heat only flows downhill, radiators should not work during reentry. Anybody saying they do is pointing out a flaw in the system. So I tried it just to see for myself. I saw no difference in heating with or without radiators, and an explosion with radiators that doesn\u0027t happen without them.

Once out of the air, warp to any point in the ensuing orbit prior to hitting the air again. The SAS unit would explode immediately upon coming out of warp, no matter where you did this.

I thought the reality issue with radiating reentry heat was that it\u0027s skin heating, not the core.\n\nAs explained towards the end of [this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127178-How-Do-You-Deal-with-Inerplanetary-Aerocapturing-in-1-0-4/page2), apparently the ship is surrounded by an envelope of hightly heated air/plasma, the heat from which enters the ship. This is called \u0022forced convection\u0022 although it operates more like direct conduction.\n\nAnyway, heat only flows downhill, from hotter things into colder things. Thus, for the ship to get hot at all, it must be surrounded by hotter air. Therefore, radiators should be counterproductive during reentry, increasing the rate of ship temperature rise by increasing the surface area exposed to the surrounding hot air.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve also had heating glitches with time warp. Often with service bays, but not always. At least once it was enough to explode a station. It looked spectacular.\n\nThis ship had both a 1.25m service bay (containing an OKTO core and 8x small radial batteries) and a 4x Universal Storage thing with DMagic Orbital Science wedges (2 Goo, 1 Materials, 1 Orbital Telescope). US has been updated to 1.0.4 but DMOS is still 1.0.2 and its wedges tend to get hot during reentry if air can flow over their outer surfaces (IOW, using a US thing the same diameter as the ship). That was the case with the above ship, although at 40km their thermal gauges remained green. Interestingly, the thermal gauges vanished instantly upon leaving the atmosphere. The F11 heat color code thingy, however, showed everything nice and cool, as shown in the pic.\n\nAnyway, because DMOS isn\u0027t for 1.0.4, the data here is of course questionable. But I thought it was interesting enough to post up and see what others were experiencing."},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T13:15:19Z","Content":"I had a satelite in Orbit of Minmus and it exploded completely during timewarp.\n\nFirst I thought it might have accumulated heat because i kept it in the Sun at all time but I tried that with another Satelite and it was fine.\n\nWeird glitch."},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T13:40:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Are you seriously trying to deal with reentry heat by putting radiators on your ships?\n\nI use a radiator to channel heat away from hot parts and towards a \u0027cold\u0027 part of the ship during re-entry.
