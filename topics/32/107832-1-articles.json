When I look for an optimal rocket for a specific delta v on the KSP optimal Rocket Calculator website ([http://garycourt.github.io/korc/](http://garycourt.github.io/korc/))\n\nand then afterwards build this rocket in KSP, the Kerbal Engineer mod shows me completely different values for delta V.\n\nIs there a difference in how delta V is calculated in the two tools? Or do I misinterprete the delta V in one of the tools?\n\nAny info is welcome,\n\nObijan"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T07:10:47Z","Content":"Engineer has an Atmosphere button. If it isn\u0027t selected, it is showing you delta V in a vacuum. I have no idea which one your website is telling you."}]}
