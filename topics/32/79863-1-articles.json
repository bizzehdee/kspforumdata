The \u0022plant flag on Mun\u0022 missions are carrots to go hit another biome. Hell, you\u0027ll want at least 9 flags on 9 biomes to maximize the Mun landing science. You\u0027re right; it is not a lot of fun or roleplay to simply leave a Kerb on the Mun to plant flags.

Not glamorous, but a little profitable. Real-world engineers snort at the tests just like we do. Have fun with it. Save money by collecting the contracts and then building a single, god-awful monstrosity to test them all on one launch. Screen cap it. Share it.
