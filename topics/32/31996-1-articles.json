I was wondering whether it was possible to utilise any Lagrange points in Kerbal Space Program, seeing as gravitational fields are handled as spheres of influence. There is this one Lagrange point in particular, which has the same orbital radius as kerbin but is always on the other side of the sun which I wanted to know whether it existed or not.
