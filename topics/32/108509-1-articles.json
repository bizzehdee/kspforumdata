Next KSP will take your soul and you will lose sleep and next thing you know everything you look at reminds you of KSP...

The game challenges your intelligence and creativity while posing a great number of challenges you can set for yourself so it doesn\u0027t get old easily. I\u0027ve never played a game that taught me even remotely so much while remaining enjoyable and probably never will again. I\u0027m suffering from a permanent burnout now it seems but new features of 1.0.x and a completely new FAR could change that when the rest of the essential mods update.\n\nEdit: grammar\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T12:02:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 12:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by theend3r**"},{"CreatedByName":"Yakuzi","CreatedById":85181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T11:59:26Z","Content":"1.

Minecraft\u0027s progression is based around collecting materials and reprocessing and crafting them to make new things. The problem with this is that at some point, you will inevitably run out of things to do. Mods can alleviate this problem, but only to a certain degree.\n\nThat doesn\u0027t happen with KSP. There\u0027s none of this scavenging and reprocessing fuss before you can build things. It just hands you all the tools you\u0027ll ever need, and says \u0022You can do whatever you want - your imagination is the limit!\u0022. And when something does work, it gives you this awesome sense of accomplishment that encourages you to try even more ambitious things. And while it does get boring sometimes, it always keeps you coming back for more because there\u0027s just so much to do. Even after playing it for hundreds, even thousands of hours, it can STILL offer new and interesting things to try.\n\nTo me, this is what makes KSP so addictive. The laws of physics are my only enemy. An enemy that is unforgiving but not unbeatable. An enemy that rewards you not only for success, but also for failure.

It all started when I was 11 years old and heard about Halley\u0027s comet passing Earth on the news (just gave away my age ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) ). They told the next time it will pass, would be 76 years from then. And that got me thinking I would most likely never experience this event again in my life time, which sparked my interest in the vastness of the universe. \n\nBeing a computer aficionado, needless to say I have played tons of space games. But it was all just games; sci-fi. KSP is different for me. It makes me feel like I am the scientist who makes it all possible to go to space in more or less realistic circumstances. It lets me explore worlds on my own, but only if I am smart enough to figure out how.\n\nKSP is much more than just a game, it is a learning tool. Thanks to KSP I now have a way more realistic view on how space travel works. The downside of this, is that every inacurate representation of space flight now stands out. When I look at StarWars for example, I can\u0027t help thinking: no way you can fly directly to that planet\u0027s surface from orbit.\n\nKSP caters my inner nerd like no game has ever done before."}]}
