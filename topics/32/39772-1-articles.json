If it stays in place once its on the surface you could always attach disposable thrusters on to it. Pop them off when it lands. Lots of ways of doing that. If the size is a problem you could having dock ports attached to decouplers, so you could add the thrusters in orbit and dump the ports and thrusters once you have landed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tom1499","CreatedById":38308,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T06:42:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sma\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sma\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELooks nice, and yeah I would use a sky crane as well.

Thinking about it, if I were going to do large kethane tanks, I might land them vertically, like silos, though they would be prone to falling over then. I think what I\u0027m going to do to restart my kethane mining is start on Kerbin before going out further. I want to try and create reusable ships similar to Scott Manley, and instead of building a whole new launcher each time, I want to just build the payload, then grab it and stick it on top of a launcher. May need quantum struts though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dave4002000","CreatedById":41394,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T13:00:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d attach a couple of LF/O tanks to the ends of the kethane tanks, then put 4 909\u0027s on the bottom of the drills and run fuel lines to them. As long as your launch vehicle gets you into orbit around the Mun, that should give you enough control and dV to get it down on the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a note about the generators. You definitely don\u0027t need 4 generators. 1 generator plus the solar panels is MORE than enough to run those 4 big drills. I\u0027d take those off, put a cubic strut over the CoM on the main body and attach one keth generator to that. It\u0027ll save you some weight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rosenkranz","CreatedById":57152,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T14:27:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually since you can drill while at time warp, do you really need 4 drills?

Start connecting more keth tanks with KAS winches and more drills are definitely better. All of my kethane miners have either 3 or 4 large drills on them. Mainly because i\u0027m filling a LOT of big kethane tanks, but also because more drills just looks cooler...haha\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Donziboy2","CreatedById":74984,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T16:45:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI always find it easier to make large things like that mobile.
