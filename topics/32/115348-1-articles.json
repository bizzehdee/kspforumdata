It concerns the way the weight of a Kerbal is counted. In a command pod a Kerbal weight nothing, the weight of the commandpod remains the same independent of if it contains kerbals or not.\n\nThis is not the same for the the external command seat. the weight of the seat depends on if it is occupied or not. Hence the intressting observation: If you take a command pod, strap a command seat to it, launch it and then moves the Kerbal from the pod to the seat and presto, the total weight of the vessel increase.

They must be squished so much that they don\u0027t have any mass.(go ahead, put that in the \u0027things you heard people say that makes you face palm\u0027 thread) How else do they fit their helmet through the door?"},{"CreatedByName":"Oxytropis","CreatedById":67677,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T23:38:44Z","Content":"When they try and enter the capsule they are immediately teleported to to another dimension that resides in a box at bottom right of the screen. They no longer exist inside the capsule therefore should not add any weight. Working as intended if you ask me."},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T23:53:55Z","Content":"I think they mentioned it some time ago and it was half-intentional, or something? They didn\u0027t bother adding weight to the vessel because they are small numbers that don\u0027t matter that much. Unless you\u0027re evacuating Kerbin. Or take a whole ton of Kerbals to colonize the galaxy."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T11:34:59Z","Content":"Enclosed pods are clearly TARDISes.

This 1.0 is more like a 0.95 version IMHO, they should have waited until Unity 5 had been fully implemented\n\np.s.: yes, I\u0027m forgetting english grammar"}]}
