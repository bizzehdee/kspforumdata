It concerns the way the weight of a Kerbal is counted. In a command pod a Kerbal weight nothing, the weight of the commandpod remains the same independent of if it contains kerbals or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not the same for the the external command seat. the weight of the seat depends on if it is occupied or not. Hence the intressting observation: If you take a command pod, strap a command seat to it, launch it and then moves the Kerbal from the pod to the seat and presto, the total weight of the vessel increase.
