I seriously doubt so. \u00A0We create satiric cartoons because generally it\u0027s seen as poor taste to display to kids scenes of death and physical harm\u00A0of human beings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP has been marketed as a game for all ages. \u00A0I\u0027m sure\u00A0that constantly seeing humans die in explosions and horrible craft-disintegrating impacts wouldn\u0027t allow for an \u0022E\u0022 ESRB rating. \u00A0Regardless of the rating, I\u0027m also sure a lot of parents wouldn\u0027t allow their younger children to play such a game if it featured humans dying\u00A0and not fictional creatures. \u00A0Did Squad mean\u00A0to advocate that it is a laughable matter when human beings die in the name of exploration and scientific advancement? I sincerely doubt it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I do believe (yes, just a belief because\u00A0I\u0027m not a member of Squad myself, but I give people the benefit of the doubt) is that Squad meant to bring a lighter, slapstick tone to Kerbal Space Program so that younger audiences weren\u0027t necessarily traumatized or horrified by inevitable failure when they were trying to design and test their rockets. \u00A0I believe the intent was to stimulate the imagination and encourage interest in physics and science, not to be callous in the face of legitimate human tragedy. \u00A0Children will learn about the realities of the real world soon enough, long before they get a job working on real rockets with real people on them. \u00A0But for now, I think a little humor with small, green, cartoon-ish looking Kerbals in fake scenarios of peril is just fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hotaru","CreatedById":135669,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-01T02:04:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223162101\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022165016\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221504229277\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002267915\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Raptor9\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n37 minutes ago, Raptor9 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSquad meant to bring a lighter, slapstick tone to Kerbal Space Program so that younger audiences weren\u0027t necessarily traumatized or horrified by inevitable failure when they were trying to design and test their rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect you\u0027re right that this was the \u003Cem\u003Eintent\u003C/em\u003E, but I think it had the opposite effect to what was intended.
