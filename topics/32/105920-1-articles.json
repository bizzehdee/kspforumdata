I must say Squad has done amazing things since then. In 0.90, one thing I enjoyed was how career mode made you make all kinds of interesting rockets with new constraints. I quickly grew to admire SRBs in a way that was never true before. They had a good chunk of dV on the cheap, and were just tweakable enough in thrust and solid fuel to let you make the rest of the rocket as recoverable as possible. This kept launch costs down, which seemed like a really good thing since that is also SRBs role in real life. However, in 1.0 the trusty BACC seems severely nerfed to me, such that there is little reason to use it over LFO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChecking the BACCs new stats, its mass actually dropped 1.9kg (24%) while its solid fuel load dropped 30% and its atmo ISP is way down 28%. While all engines went down in ISP, the LV-T30 for example only droped 12.5% atmo ISP. Despite all those size and efficiency nerfs, its costs in 1.0 increased 50%. Further comparing it to an similar weight LFO stack the BACC is longer with a higher drag value, generates no electric charge, and is not throttable. All in all, I don\u0027t think it fill its cheap booster role anymore compared to 0.90. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn some ways this will be good, as the one true way to build a rocket will again be thin LFO vegetable style.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECyberSoul\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sedativechunk","CreatedById":112761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T09:27:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBesides reading stats have you actually played the game in 1.0?

It\u0027s not that they\u0027re useless, but relative to actual SRBs, with their high thrust/TWR, and relatively lengthy burn times, KSP\u0027s SRBs don\u0027t act like SRBs anymore, and they aren\u0027t really worth messing with as they currently stand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving your SRBs assist you through the first 8-10,000m is helpful, however having to jettison BACCs 25 seconds into flight, completely burnt out at an altitude of perhaps 3-4000m, with 66,000m of soupy atmosphere left to punch through, not so much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, the models and their stats simply don\u0027t add up. They\u0027re all over the place really, and it\u0027s not just the SRB\u0027s. A notable example off the top of my head is the recently increased fuel capacity of the Oscar B tank...according to it\u0027s physical size it should have roughly 1/7 to 1/8 the volume of the T-100, but it now boasts fully half the capacity of the T-100. As for the SRB\u0027s, I\u0027m not sure why they\u0027ve been assigned such arbitrary values, but this coupled with the recent nerfing has totally killed them for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust check out the wildly varying fuel capacities...evidently fuel capacity and physical dimensions aren\u0027t related.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NGg8t2nh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NGg8t2nh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to their physical size, the RT-5 is roughly half the length of an RT-10, which is roughly 40% as long as the BACC, and the BACC is slightly more than half as long as the KD25K. Therefore, as you can see, the values assigned to them are seemingly rather arbitrary. Perhaps the smaller 3 can be forgiven their relatively minor inconsistencies, but the KD25K is just plain nuts. In fact, it seems as though all of the NASA parts were just thrown in to the game without much thought.
