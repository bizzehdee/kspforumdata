Using this idea, I wondered, is it possible for a Kerbal to \u0022Get out and push\u0022? Now, rather than just asking the question, I went and tried it out. I put a command pod on a highly elliptic orbit with periapsis just outside of atmosphere, waited to apoapsis, then had my brave Kerbalnaut get out and rcs against the pod for a few seconds. I only managed to change the velocity by a few m/s, but I got some \u0022free\u0022 delta V and managed to save a Kerbal that would have otherwise been doomed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I don\u0027t think this is a game changer in any way. To go anywhere meaningful you would need enormous amounts of time babysitting the command pod, but I do think it\u0027s amusing, and a testament to the physics engine, even in its alpha state. Also, it means that stranded Kerbals in a pod in deep space aren\u0027t as doomed as they may have thought--they can always just push their pods to the nearest planet, and hope that the devs don\u0027t add a limit to the amount of EVA RCS fuel a pod carries.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-01T03:34:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI actually tried this back before the EVA pack had limited fuel.
