I generally use docking for anything else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can deffinitely do single launch rockets for Duna, but those are one way missions. For return capable manned missions for anything beyond Mun/Minimus, in my experience it either takes rockets beyond my general patients, ability or CPUs capabilities to construct/launch or else it takes assembling something in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do/did use a refueling station in orbit, but that was usually just to top off a ship once fully assembled if it came up a little short. Right before .20 came out (I started from scratch on purpose) I did construct a Kerbin/Mun NERVA powered orbital ferry for taking base modules to the Mun as well as resupply for my Mun crane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027d take the base module and extra fuel to Mun orbit. Refuel my Mun station and leave the module docked with the station and return the ferry back to Kerbin orbit and dock with the refueling station. I\u0027d then refuel my orbital crane docked at the Mun station, attach my base module to it and then land it at my base. Launch the crane back to the Mun station, connect my base module to my base, rinse and repeat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI only managed 3 iterations of this process before .20 came along (I was busy with a giant Jool station/mission when the .20 balloon came up).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll probably do it again at some point. I\u0027ve only progressed to Mercury/Gemini missions at this point since restarting with .20. We\u0027ll, I\u0027ve kind of skipped ahead and launched a very small station, but it is roughly Agena sized. Next I\u0027ll probably launch an actual Agena module and rendezvous with it, boost to a high orbit and then re-enter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I\u0027ll probably add to my mini-station a small amount. Launch probes to the Mun and Minimus. Then Apollo missions (to Minimus as well). Then probe missions to other planets and moons. Then deorbit my mini station (or actually I might boost it to the Mun/Minimus or save it for another planet) and build a big station. Then do some orbital construction/rendezvous for manned missions to the other planets. By then .21 might be out and I might consider (or be required) to start again. Oh, there might be a really serious attempt at base construction on Duna and/or the Mun this time around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scrogdog","CreatedById":66879,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T17:24:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pizzaoverhead\u0022 data-cite=\u0022pizzaoverhead\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou can trim controls to have a constant input by using Alt \u002B (WASDQE).
