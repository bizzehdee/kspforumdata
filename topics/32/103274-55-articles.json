One thing you cannot do is properly recreate the Saturn V fairings. The thing I enjoy most about this game is building, and to have a feature as promising for aesthetics as fairings be so limited is just a big let-down. If you look at my post history, I\u0027m not the type of person to be constantly getting down on Squad.

Because there is already an old mod with procedural fairings that works pretty good and looks nice. But you know, I changed my mind after seeing new fairings in twitch stream. I must say that the fairings is great. And I mean the way they look in the editor. I think the way the fairings come off to show the payload is soooo amazing that I really can forgive the squad this confetti. I know it will be fixed sometimes (maybe even by a mod in a few weeks after release), but the developers worked really hard to make it work nicely. And they worked hard on the new update to make it really worth the \u00221.0\u0022 in the bottom-right corner. And we all should respect it.
