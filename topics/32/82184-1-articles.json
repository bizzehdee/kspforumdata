One problem I see with the collect-to-complete process is it promotes the opposite of slow, involved play- go in, get the important stuff done, get out.

The moon landing was widely anticipated, and watched. Plus, many people follow the progress of space probes, and definitely would follow the activities of a long term manned mission. Perhaps there could be some sense of kerbal civilisation watching you as you progress, (Maybe, kerbals who cheer as you land, news articles at the space centre recapping your movements over the planets, stuff like that,). Ideally, this respond to what you do, rather than anticipate, or prompt, so it feels like they\u0027re looking to see what you do, rather than telling you to do stuff.

You can always launch a whole new mission to visit that biome across the way, so why bother taking a long trip in a rover?
