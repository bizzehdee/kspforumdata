For the purposes of introducing students, most likely in the Middle School range, I think KSP has enough of the pieces and entertainment value (despite all the atmospheric physics issues that everyone is so quick to point out) for introducing spaceflight in general that I am liking it more and more each day.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T11:15:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Franklin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Franklin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKSP skimps out on a lot of important elements in spaceflight and exploration.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the intended role for KSP as educational software is not so much to teach about spaceflight and exploration generally (including logistics) even though some of that comes into play, but specifically to teach about Newtonian and orbital mechanics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bishop149","CreatedById":82368,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T13:28:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hattivat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hattivat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EInside the atmosphere, KSP is counter-intuitive in the wrong ways. That is, it contradicts child\u0027s intuitions in places where these intuitions are actually correct, which is obviously counter-productive in a teaching tool (examples: square rockets flying better than streamlined ones, reentry flames doing no damage whatsoever to the craft). Outside of the atmosphere, KSP can be remarkably good at developing an intuitive understanding of complex orbital mechanics in the player, even if that player has experience with graduate-level physics, as illustrated by Randall Munroe. Whether or not this is something we want/need grade schoolers to learn is another question.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d go with this, inside the atmosphere KSP is probably not a good teaching aid because the areodynmaic model it uses is better optimized for having fun / playing around with rather than realism and unlike many here I don\u0027t have a huge problem with this,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving said that whilst the aerodynamics are all wrong the process of getting a rocket to orbit is moderately accurate, things like optimal ascent profiles, the way engine efficiencies work, effect of atmosphere density with altitude, the difference between rockets and space planes in terms of ascent profile. . . all things that KSP can very well get the jist of across whilst not being actually realistic about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce in space however I think it become more useful, even as a scientist I didn\u0027t really understand basic orbital mechanics until started playing KSP. I know its all a simplification because KSP doesn\u0027t simulate the gravitational effects of multiple bodies at the same time, but who really expects kids to start struggling with n-body physics and making such simplification for teaching at lower levels is hardly anything new (see the incredibly simplistic \u0022electron shells\u0022 taught in chemistry at high school level)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AgentMOO","CreatedById":126295,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T14:33:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EQ:Would you recommend this for use in the schools? \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EA: I would, yes. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EQ:What\u0027s the earliest age/grade would it be useful for?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EA:IMHO since Kerbals blow up..\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E around eight or older.
