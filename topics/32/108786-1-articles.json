TL;DR, Jeb and Val represent the player. Notice how Jeb/Val have built up a following; they have a personality in a game where their only defining feature is that they have bads=yes. Jeb and Val represent the player because as the rocket is launching, we aren\u0027t scared or worried, we are (hopefully) having a great time doing so. Landed on Mun? Super Big Smile. Burning through the atmosphere? Super Big Smile. Huge Explosion? Super Big Smile. Perfectly executed Hohman Transfer? Super Big Smile. Completely botched staging event? Super Big Smile.\n\nJebediah and Valentina are the closest one gets to having a player avatar. As such, I tend to play with them pretty often ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif).
