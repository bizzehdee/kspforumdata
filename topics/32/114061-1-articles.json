The space station suddenly exploded, with debris flying everywhere at high speed.\n\nI was ever so slightly shocked.\n\nLooking at the debris in the space center I discovered what had happened. I had a science station in an elliptic polar orbit, which hit 100km at one pass by the equator. The chances of collision were... well... 100% obviously.\n\nOf all the things I\u0027ve done in KSP over the years, that is one of the dumbest and also most spectacular."},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T22:57:25Z","Content":"You get a cookie if you can replicate it."},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporo","CreatedById":110800,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T22:58:43Z","Content":"This is incredibly unlikely to happen.
