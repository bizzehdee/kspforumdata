Specifically, the actual building part. It kind of threw me off that it\u0027s a rocket in and of itself, but eh. Whatever. When I land this thing, how do I \u0022deploy\u0022 it? How do I get an actual pad? And how do I supply it with parts? Do they have to be docked? Or do they just have to be within a certain AoE? The smelter and parts manufactury, how are they supplied with parts also?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m considering both a Munar construction depot and a colossal mothership that can manufacture its own throwaway landers and probes.

Of course, I didn\u0027t realize I\u0027d need to put a docking port on it, so there it is, taking up valuable real estate, being worthless. I go back to the VAB, and design a little ore miner, plus docking port so I can get the bloody ore off of it. I go back to the constructor and... surprise!

(Not having KAS installed.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ended up building a girder platform for the launchpad to sit on that I could stick docking ports on to connect to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I have a layer of girders laid horizontally with 3 Docking Port Jr\u0027s per side, that gives me 12 docking ports so one of them will have to be usable when I deploy the pad. I then stick the pad on top and strut the hell out of everything. When the pad deploys it is fully supported by girders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only catch is you have to use gantry cranes and hold the ships off the launchpad. Otherwise when the physics kick in for the ship you are trying to launch the girders underneath act as a trampoline when the ship settles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that there is a \u0027phantom\u0027 attachment point way off to the side that you can stick a docking port on to attach things to as well.
