This would be a challenge sort of the inverse of seeing how far you can push the stock parts. The idea would be to run a space program, and land on as many planets as possible only using parts that are bespoke for the program, much in the way that a lot of real space technology was developed, by the program itself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m actually not sure of anyone has done this yet, I haven\u0027t seen anything on youtube or google showing something like this. Imagine a space program where all of the parts were actually created custom for the specific game. I\u0027m sure there is some overlap between talented modders, and talented youtube creators which could really make for an interesting video series. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe natural progression of this could be a collaborative effort, where the one who runs the program could get a group of various modders, acting as \u0022Aerospace Companies\u0022, and could submit specifications for various engines, tanks, and payloads, and have a government style procurement process to select the parts that go on the missions. They could even release the parts at the end of the series as it\u0027s own Mod Pack, which of course would be well tested, and documented via the Youtube series. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWho knows, this could lead to the development of some really interesting custom solutions and parts that otherwise wouldn\u0027t come about just be people working independently on their own endeavors. I am definitely going to try this at least personally, but I certainly do not have the time to create a youtube series (not for lack of technical knowhow), but I would love to see what people could do with this idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Just to be clear. The idea is creating a space program that uses no stock parts, and no existing mod parts. The only parts that would be used would be created completely from scratch for the \u0022Custom Space Program\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I will be posting my personal progress with this here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83818-Custom-Space-Program-Small-Steps\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83818-Custom-Space-Program-Small-Steps\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-22T05:23:32Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2014 05:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by saabstory88\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EClarification, Link\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T16:59:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat would be a huge, awesome project.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T18:00:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrilliant\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T18:51:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am unable to model (blender or image creation I\u0027ve been unable to even try), though config files are another story.

I will try to publish some pictures as I enjoy my own personal journey with this idea, but I think that having this idea be the model for a community project would be ideal. That being said, it would be fantastic for people reading this who are friendly with both video and mod content creators, to let them know about it, and see if anyone is actually interested in the concept. I can\u0027t wait to see what this creative and talented community could do with such a series. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn reference to the idea of tech tree integration, a traditional model may actually not be necessary. I have only begun to dig into the specification of the game engine and programming specifications (I have some experience with file structure due to fixing game glitches, and appreciate greatly those who have guided me in the past). I would imagine that the game would be run in sandbox for such an endeavor, without the stock parts even loaded. Whether this can be done is the only thing I am unclear on, and will defer to those with more experience as to its implementation. I feel it is irrelevant to have the traditional progression for the two following reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. There are no existing parts. They must all be created for a purpose, and the next level of technology will emerge for missions of increasing difficulty. The person who is creating the series, and is requesting the part design parameters will have the want for a series which will keep the viewer engaged through ever more daring missions. A mission straight to the surface of Laythe would only be one piece of content, and not something that will drive their subscriber base. Of course there will be a certain amount of good judgement needed on the part of the space program director.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Mod creators strive to make balanced parts already. It is in their best interest to have and interesting and useful mod pack at the end of the series. Having a good directive to create a part to complete specific tasks will ensure that their parts have real, in game applications, and proven testing. Also, creating parts with differing performance parameters from the competing modders could provide differing unique, and creative solutions to problems. It would be and an interesting roleplay adder for the group of companies to \u0022not be able to\u0022 create, say, and engine which has outlandish specifications from the program director.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it is desirable for a \u0022Science\u0022 system to be implemented, perhaps part parameters could be set to provide science based on successful engine stand test firings, and short flights of the actual components. This could create a more realistic way to proceed to the next tech level, especially if the part output rate of the modders exceeds that of the producer of the videos. As we know from real life, these sort of things actually advance spacecraft design, as opposed to returning experiments from distant worlds. If a funding system is desired for the video series, then that could be a useful purpose for traditional experiments, where a robotic discovery spurs the funding for a manned mission. This could of course be accomplished by roleplay alone, without a necessary programatic game requirement, however I\u0027m sure there are those who would love to play around with a system like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are some of my idea\u0027s for now, and I would love to hear the opinions of some content/mod creators on the matter, even just to inform my own trials with this process.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-20T19:59:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2014 07:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by saabstory88\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EGrammar, spelling\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PlonioFludrasco","CreatedById":98915,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T20:15:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome!! \u002Brep, even I\u0027m not a modder and I won\u0027t take part\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Norpo","CreatedById":113342,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T20:38:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis seems like a great idea\u003C/strong\u003E: especially for making new parts for the public, what better way is there to make balanced, usable parts with a goal than to make them designed for that goal specifically?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you mentioned \u0022interesting custom solutions\u0022, I wonder if it would be possible to add other mods such as TAC life support, but not add the actual parts from it, also maybe mods that add new goals (KSP interstellar, for example)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"saabstory88","CreatedById":110598,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T21:40:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnder my current understanding of the game engine, which is no where complete (have to wait to tonight to really start digging in), but resources, the necessity for their consumption/mitigation can be implemented independently of individual parts. This would only make sense being that there are no mandatory parts that must be included in a spacecraft for these effects to occur, in respect to mods like TAC-LS and DREC. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would love to see these effects to be implemented as some sort of modular global framework, which is decided upon at the beginning of the video series, and distributed to all of the participating mod creators, and which is not modified per save file/video series. Depending on the licenses of the particular mods in question, source code could be reused to create a custom master framework which includes these algorithms and properties. Again, discretion is needed. But of course, unless you are trying to implement something like Ferram (which you should just install as is anyway), none of the resource depletion in these aforementioned mods, should be that hard to add. I\u0027m not yet familiar with how to game engine handles it, but linear change in a resource over time should be a cake-walk. Having a standard framework build for the series will be essential anyway, as naming conventions, and features of parts should be comparable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T22:26:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis seems like a really cool idea.

I may just find a way to export the physical models from there, and U/V map in blender. Anyway, the point is, a day and a bit in, I am nearly ready to launch a custom built sounding rocket. I will add a forum post to the appropriate forum when I really get going, possibly later tonight. As to that, with something like this that will progress, is it more appropriate to post in Mission Reports, or Spacecraft exchange? Especially since half of the challenge is building the models.
