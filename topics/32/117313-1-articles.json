I was kind of amazed when i tried it the other day. The implementation was actually quite clever too. Hit C while on EVA and get first person mode. If you have KIS installed, you can even see the screwdriver etc. if you have that equipped. Well, i was orbiting kerbin and floating just above it in first person EVA was much more intense than having the camera view from behind a kerbal (who also happen to be blocking the view.) I hope the devs would be able and willing to implement something similar so everyone can experience it and not having to install a mod for it. That is all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T11:55:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah.
