Which means female kerbals are very scarce in this society, while males are constantly being born. This is why kerbal rockets fail so much, to limit the male population. And female kerbals are treated in very high regard in Kerbal society, which is why none of them join the space program, because no one wants to lose a female. Also, males being part of the space program is a way to prove you show more dominance than the other males, much like other male creatures fight to the death for females, if male kerbals survive their spaceflights the females think of them as the better potential mate. Soon, we will be swarmed with kerbals on the same level as Jebediah Kerman, which would only be good.

This is a game designed by human beings for human beings using human frames of reference.

What a coincidence!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point in our culture, and in video game culture specifically, the inclusion or not of female characters to go along with the male characters is a deliberate choice.

The grand total investment needed would be a few dozen names added to the random name generator, and perhaps a couple close cropped hair styles that would not interfere with the current EVA suit models.

The history of space flight has always involved pushing boundaries and celebrating the best and brightest.
