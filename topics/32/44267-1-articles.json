I\u0027m not just not certain I have enough Delta-V to map Eve and Gilly both in one pass, and I\u0027m quite sure there\u0027s no other system left unmapped that it has enough Delta-V to completely finish mapping either. I do have a *minor* need to remap Kerbin anyway, because my Oceans are mostly black (I didn\u0027t discover the \u0027delete hilo.dat\u0027 trick until I got to the Mun and it was coming out almost completely white.) So I may bring it back, have it Remap Kerbin so there\u0027s no need to have a later Probe do it, and then land it just because.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure yet, I\u0027m still waiting on the Dres mapping to finish.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-30T06:42:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2013 06:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dogface","CreatedById":75396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T11:37:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Unistrut\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Unistrut\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might also grab the spaceport version and make yourself a Grand Tour shield.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission Ribbons V 6.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/missionribbonsv60/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/missionribbonsv60/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceSphereOfDeath","CreatedById":69754,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T07:50:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Evrion\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Evrion\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Personally I don\u0027t like lying and think the ribbon acts as a good \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003Egame time spent\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E measure, so I keep my reasonably up to date.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUmmm, *looks at signature*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn topic, I would only give my self one, from the body that I transfered to kerbin from,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI.e kerbin-\u0026gt;Jool-\u0026gt;dres-\u0026gt;eve-\u0026gt;kerbin.
