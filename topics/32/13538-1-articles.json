Also, I could be wrong, but I mostly use the SAS units to mitigate craft rotation. So, I reworked your craft a bit, replacing all of the SAS units with a single ASAS. Your craft climbs straight as an arrow until about 60km. Then, the rotation starts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"melenkurio","CreatedById":20627,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-02T22:00:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the modified version but it still drifts to the site if I launch it :/. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"melenkurio","CreatedById":20627,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-02T22:37:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell I got a similar one to work already but I have some questions: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow should I build a big rocket without tricouplers?

First I made the central initial stage the slightly smaller 45 gymbal rockets, helps keeping alignment and pulled off the outer SAS. I pulled out the command module SAS for an advanced SAS. I put three fuel tanks instead of the four on the lander bay to help balance. There is still some drift, but that was caused by some flexing in the booster engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"melenkurio","CreatedById":20627,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-02T23:45:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022VincentMcConnell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022VincentMcConnell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want, I\\\u0027ll make you a capable Mun and Minmus craft right now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere.

The best stable test is a short single column rocket. Very simple for just to space and back, see if it is banking. There is something else that can happen on older machines, and is an error when loading up the rocket that can cause thrusters to break off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you load the rocket, do you hear the sound of say a stage separation and next time you go to it, does it ask you to clear the launch pad? If a nossle is breaking off, you will end up with uneven thrust. Also see if there is any failures in your mission report to see if any failures are occuring before launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-03T00:58:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022melenkurio\u0022 data-cite=\u0022melenkurio\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell I got a similar one to work already but I have some questions: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow should I build a big rocket without tricouplers?
