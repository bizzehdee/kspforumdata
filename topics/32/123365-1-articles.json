In time you start to learn just about how much your orbit will change as you pass through the atmosphere. It takes a little while, but it is indeed easier to learn on a plane first IMO. For a plane all you have to do to move your trajectory is pull up or nose down where as with a rocket you usually get to bring in the trajectory but if you come in too short there is no going back.

In time you start to learn just about how much your orbit will change as you pass through the atmosphere. It takes a little while, but it is indeed easier to learn on a plane first IMO. For a plane all you have to do to move your trajectory is pull up or nose down where as with a rocket you usually get to bring in the trajectory but if you come in too short there is no going back. Alternatively you could use the Trajectories mod but after a while you just start to recognize where your initial trajectory from orbit should be.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have problems hitting the area between the mountains and the shores. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd that landing legs on the rocket adds drag at bottom who make them unstable on reentry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave an crew shuttle who I\u0027m able to do this with but for most payloads I don\u0027t bother, tend to be more effective to use the engines on the payload as second stage for the last 3-500 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo, operationally what you describe is an RLS or RLV. References to SSTO often imply an RLS and a craft can be both but they aren\u0027t mutually inclusive. Really, people should stop using the acronym SSTO on the forum if their intent is to convey its re-usability and use RLS (Reusable Launch System) or RLV (Reusable Launch Vehicle) instead. None of the three exist in the real world, the Space Shuttle is the closest to a successful RLS but it still wasn\u0027t 100% reusable and the Falcon 9, if it ever works, will be a true RLS. There are no SSTOs, even in prototype, the Skylon is the only active project I know of.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue however an non reusable SSTO is pretty pointless anyway with a few exceptions like where you fill it op and send it somewhere else. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn reusable two stage system like falcon 9 reusable is not practical in KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn RLS with a core and SRB to help during launch can be more cost efficient than an pure SSTO rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
