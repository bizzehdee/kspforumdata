Even in games that are multi-threaded, they usually don\u0027t benefit from more than 4 cores. As for the overclocking, they should overclock about the same with \u003Cem\u003Econventional\u003C/em\u003E cooling methods. Those world records are done by disabling 7 of the 8 cores and then cooling the CPU with liquid nitrogen or helium, so don\u0027t expect those kind of results. 4.5 Ghz is probably typical for either CPU, maybe higher if you get a good batch.\u003Cp\u003EBesides, AMD has said their new architecture will come out in 2016, and it\u0027d be a bummer to upgrade to a CPU that is the same architecture with more cores, then have a new option come out less than a year later (if AMD can hold that deadline and deliver as promised, that is).
