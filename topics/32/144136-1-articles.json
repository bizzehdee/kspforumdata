Controls. I do not possess a PS4, but I have tried using a PS3 gamepad for flight control on my PC, and found (like any HOTAS/Joystick/steering wheel would) it actually added a great deal to the experience. That said, it was no substitute for a mouse and keyboard in the editor or for operations like transfering crew or activating particular modules, lights or experiments. In short I can manage with just the keyboard/mouse, but the more-dynamic controls of a gamepad add a great deal to the flight experience.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Performance-wise, the description from this review sounds \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E like my experience of KSP on my potato anyway - frame-rate dips when crafts get outsized and the scene gets crowded.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut here I am comparing something I\u0027ve never tried with something I\u0027m \u003Cem\u003Eextremely\u003C/em\u003E fond of. Having become attached to certain mods and the general freedoms afforded by using a keyboard/mouse setup over a gamepad for everything, I would expect the PC experience to suit me better - which is just as well, because that\u0027s all I\u0027ve got. But if I\u0027d never played on PC and my first introduction to the game was on console, I don\u0027t think I would be at all put off but something being marginally worse than it was on a PC version that I had also never experienced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-19T15:20:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think I can reduce my main point down to the fact that I don\u0027t think the score of 9.0 takes the console issues into account at all.

I wanted to play one of my favorite games again, and with two years of updates to boot, but of course I was a little skeptical. When I started playing I was unsure if the port was up to par, but after more EXPERIENCE I realized how well it does work on PS4, and just like on PC there are issues and they are no doubt being looked into and worked on.
