I just run into a new game on Unity engine that required dx11. Thought that was reserved to the boring, same-every-year AAA games. But this one was a pretty simple indy title, not too graphically intensive, so I was surprized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould something like that happen to KSP? Should I start digging around scrapyards in order to find a new GPU? Or the devs of the game I tried were just lazy, so they ignored coding compatibility for older standards?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-15T10:54:31Z\u0022 title=\u002201/15/2016 10:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Evanitis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-15T11:13:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am seeing talk about dx12 for untiy 5.

Unity 5 is meant to be capable of running DX12, but can still run on DX9 and anything newer, as well as several other graphics technologies such as OpenGL and whatever Macs use. Most computers from the last few years have DX11, so unless you\u0027re running it on a dinosaur from last decade you\u0027ll be fine. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
