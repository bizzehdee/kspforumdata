My pilot was Orble Kerman. I would have preferred to send the Big Three, but apparently Jeb was hosting poker night at his place, so those three were out. I was wary, Orble being a new pilot, but he distinguished himself marvelously when, at about 18,000 meters above the Great Western Desert, my plane suffered some random unplanned disassembly. In short, I don\u0027t know what happened, but half of my starboard wing, with one of my engines still attached, broke away from the plane, and took one of the parachutes vital to my ejection system off with it.\u003Cp\u003ENaturally this put me in a lateral spin, and I go through the \u0022Oh $%!^ we\u0027re gonna crash\u0022 checklist to try and get back under control, killing the engines, waggling my control surfaces, toggling SAS, praying to the Deep Space Kraken to be merciful.
