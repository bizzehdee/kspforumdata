The input to output translations differ in joysticks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome joysticks have a 1:1 (linear) ratio between input and output, others do not (non-linear). This linearity of input/output is important because it greatly affects the responsiveness, accuracy and general feel of the joystick. One would think it is as simple as \u0022pull the stick this way, and the software will output the same corresponding maneuver\u0022, but while this is mostly true, it is not the whole truth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA non-linear output model will reduce sensitivity close to the center of the stick\u0027s freedom of movement to allow higher accuracy, while gradually increasing the sensitivity further out the edges. This is to allow higher precision with small movements. However, it also introduces problems as your hand-to-eye co-ordination will be much more challenged, having to not only estimate the hand movement, but also take into account that different lengths of the hand movement corresponds to different lengths of movement in the output.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost people do not even notice this or care, but an enthusiast will very much be frustrated with having the wrong form of output. By the way, manufacturers do not tell you any of this. You will have to do the research yourself. In KSP, specifically, it would not matter too much in most cases, but in other games where you more actively use the stick, it may have a much greater impact on your abilities to use the stick. It is, of course, possible to get used to it either way. I just think people need to be informed. For the record, real life sticks in real airplanes often have some non-linearity, but is negligible, not nearly as severe as some of the PC entertainment joysticks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T21:46:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can recommend the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kurtvw","CreatedById":83214,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T21:52:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDidn\u0027t read all the responses, so sorry if I\u0027m repeating someone elses opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECH 568 Combat stick is the finest joystick I have ever laid hands on, this one on my desk is 12 years old now and still works as well as the day I bought it.
