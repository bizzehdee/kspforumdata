There are scientifically interesting elements with funny names beginning K. They give science points depending on how abundant that stuff is. There are negligible concentrations in most places, but couple of very rich deposits in some biomes on some planets. Some elements are possible to find by using mapping orbital spectrometer, but some need rover exploration or low altitude flight in atmosphere. Or even boats.

I might want to open my parachute at something between 50 and 350 m of the surface or have exactly 32,4 L of LF in a tank, thank you :/ The second is the fact that, when you crash a ship and open the choose autosave window via Alt-F5, the Crash report window gets in top and you can\u0027t push it to side or put it behind the autosave one.
