I currently have a vessel orbiting Ike that is supposed to detach a rover for the surface. The only problem is i forgot to put a docking port in. So i cant detach it. I am looking for suggestions for what to do. I thought about changing the kerbal on board to an engineer via the save file, and hacking in a screwdriver as well. But that seems complicated and risky, potentially jeopadizing the save file. I also thought about editing in an entire new craft. But not sure how to go about that. I am basically looking for any help, before i send a replacement craft. Thanks in advance:) Dearest KSP Noob.\n\nPS. To whom it may concern i included a picture of the craft. There is supposed to be a small docking port or decoupler between the Probe core and the small fuel tank on top of it.\n\n![kpZaGUK.png](http://i.imgur.com/kpZaGUK.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-03T00:48:54Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2015 12:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by abowl**"},{"CreatedByName":"mckamx","CreatedById":116032,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T00:50:31Z","Content":"[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113111-1-0-4-Kerbal-Inventory-System-%28KIS%29-1-2-1](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113111-1-0-4-Kerbal-Inventory-System-%28KIS%29-1-2-1)\n\nAllows you to attach components that you forgot, or just decided you didn\u0027t need until you got back to kerbin (e.g. parachutes)."},{"CreatedByName":"abowl","CreatedById":110827,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T00:52:29Z","Content":"Ye, i have that mod.
