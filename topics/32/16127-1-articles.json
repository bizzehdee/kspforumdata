Once there, burn the rockets until the orbit extends (elliptically) out to mun, then time warp. Eventually, you should fall under the Mun\u0027s gravitational influence. Once there, burn again to put yourself in stable mun orbit. Getting home again you do the same thing in the other direction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dav1d89","CreatedById":33319,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-09T17:53:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGet into a stable relatively low orbit (but not so low you are in the atmosphere) Heading eastwards\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait for the mun to appear over the horizon or Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurn until your orbit reaches the muns soi, the graphic in map view should confirm it\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
