There is actually a term for that: supercargo. Usually pertains to any extra cargo you can take on to fill any remaining empty space before leaving port, but many a mariner doesn\u0027t hesitate to tack the name onto passengers.\n\nI\u0027ve actually taken experimental parts along on a flight a time or two for some extra funds(and science). Nothing quite like having a radial decoupler set on the side of a satellite launch that has nothing attached to it. (5..4..3..X-7 activation..2..that made a boom..1..and we have liftoff of the Phoenix Orbital Relay...)"},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T09:24:07Z","Content":"No contract compares in cheapness with the \u0027send scientific data from X where you already have a craft\u0027 type.

I finished multiple contracts in one misson the other day which consisted of; suborbital flight over kerbin, orbit kerbin, orbit the sun, flyby the mun, orbit the mun, fly by minmus, orbit minmus, land on minmus, plant a flag on minmus, collect science on minmus, leave a surface base on minmus, and get back to kerbin safely. That was 12 tourists and 6 kerbalnauts (I wanted them to get experience).\n\nThe total payout was a little over 2 million after expenses which included spending 950k on a rocket I probably could have built for less than half of that."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T14:50:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E No contract compares in cheapness with the \u0027send scientific data from X where you already have a craft\u0027 type.
