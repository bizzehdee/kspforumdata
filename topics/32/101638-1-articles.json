But exterior ground surface has one important difference: it\u0027s being observed from insane range of distances, from extreme close ups when Kerbals traverse the place on foot to dozens of kilometers in flight. Tests, though, have demonstrated that writing a decal shader that would be reliably sorted properly over that whole range is nearly impossible.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeh.
