The smallest 2 or 3 of them no longer have any built-in torque (which comes from reaction wheels). Thus they alone cannot turn your ship and you need to add some other parts that can, which kinda defeats the purpose of using the dinky probe cores.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust to be sure we\u0027re on the same page with the terminology.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll probed cores and cockpits, regardless of size, have the SAS function built in. SAS is now just stabilization attempting to use whatever means of control are on the vehicle to keep it pointed in the desired direction. Also, when you give control input on 1 axis, SAS holds the other 2 axes still (in theory). So, SAS requires some sort of control (RCS, canards, reaction wheels, etc.) or it does nothing. And the avionics package for planes just does SAS, too, so it\u0027s now redundant because every core and cockpit already does that. You can turn SAS on and off with the T key.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for the confusing part: reaction wheels. These things provide torque to turn the vehicle but consume electricity while doing so. All stock cockpits and the large and medium probe cores have some weak reaction wheels built-in, but not the smaller probe cores. What makes this confusing is that the old parts for SAS and ASAS modules, which still look the same and are still labeled as SAS and ASAS modules, are actually now strong reaction wheels. So, adding the \u0022SAS\u0022 and \u0022ASAS\u0022 parts is adding pod torque, simple as that (and also adding power consumption).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for having torque is so you can turn the vehicle without needing control surfaces, RCS, or whatever. The amount of torque needed depends on the size of the vehicle and also its proportions. For example, short, essentially cubical/cylindrical probes have low moments of inertia about all axes so can get by with a little torgue, probably just a large/medium probe core. But a long, skinny probe of the same mass with the same torque will roll very well but be slow in pitch and yaw. And of course, the bigger/heavier the probe, the more torque you need, so maybe add a set of reaction wheels (as in the old SAS/ASAS parts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote, too, that when SAS is turned on, torque seems to be its 1st choice if there are multiple means of control. So, if you have any reaction wheels (built into the cockpit/probe core or extra), and you run SAS, you\u0027ll probably be using a little electricity constantly. Thus, every vehicle which reaction wheels (which is everything but the smallest probes) now needs RTGs or solar panels just to stay alive very long. And the more torque you have, the more electricity you need.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arq","CreatedById":71084,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T04:51:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E@ Mr. Popcup:\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt really depends on the probe core you use.

For most probes, the probe core torque is usually sufficient. If it is so much heavier that the torque is insufficient, the mass of a reaction wheel is usually not too detrimental.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrPopcup","CreatedById":75533,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T11:10:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks everyone! i\u0027ve got my answer!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ arq, I have updated to 0.21.1 just yesterday, wasn\u0027t available that much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ Geschosskopf, thanks for the great answer! explained everything I wanted and even more!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E note: I asked because I didn\u0027t know that SAS was built in command modules, but now I know!\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
