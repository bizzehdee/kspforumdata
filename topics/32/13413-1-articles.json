When you leave a ship in orbit to fly another one, if that ship\\\u0027s orbit crosses into the atmosphere during its perigee, it will ignore the friction of the atmosphere and fly through as if it wasn\\\u0027t there. But that is with the current rules. I do believe I remember Harv mentioning some work being done on having the on-rails system recognize when a ship hits atmo. Don\\\u0027t quote me on that. It\\\u0027s not mentioned in the list for 0.16 so if it is something being worked on, it isn\\\u0027t projected for anytime soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, I\\\u0027d like to throw some science in the room. Careful, you may get some on you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a perfect vacuum, a craft at orbital velocity around a solitary gravity well(like a planet) will remain at that speed indefinitely, as it has no forces to counteract or interfere with said velocity. Add a moon to that planet, and that becomes a force to interfere with the craft\\\u0027s orbit, skewing it to either go down to the planet eventually, or even get thrown out of the well and either the moon captures that craft, or it leaves the vicinity altogether.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there is the part where space is not a perfect vacuum. There are molecules in space all around, even between the stars and galaxies. Those all bump into the craft and do their part to slow that craft down. When you are in Low Earth Orbit, as the ISS is, then there is a much thicker amount of molecules for the station to deal with. The ISS is consistently making course corrections to remain in orbit. If it was left to its own devices, its orbit would eventually degrade due to friction from the atmosphere still present at that altitude, as well as the tugs that the Moon, the Sun, and the other planets in the solar system exert on that wee little station. I wouldn\\\u0027t think about it too much, as most of it is minuscule by itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\\\u0027s all that in a nutshell on how any orbit has forces against it in reality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDessert?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"geb","CreatedById":5399,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-29T08:51:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP, all masses are point sources and so gravity fields are perfectly spherical. There\\\u0027s no gravity perturbation. That means that in the game, only air friction makes an orbit decay, and the air stops at 70km up. Above 70km, orbits are permanent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOut in the real world, orbits can decay even around totally airless worlds. Anything rocky has lumps in its mass distribution, which make its gravity field lumpy too.
