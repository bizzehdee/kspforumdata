Link your Saves, Screenshots, and GameData folders from each machine to corresponding folders on your NAS.

Simplest approach is whole KSP folder on the NAS, and map that as a drive on your computers. The chief drawback is one settings.cfg for all PCs, which is an issue if you have different OSes or hardware setups. Better might be to mount the Gamedata and saves folders, while keeping the rest of the install including the settings.cfg on the local PC; that will also speed up loading a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ishootdeadppl","CreatedById":143107,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-30T19:13:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically install the game on each computer, \u00A0copy and merge the desired folders into one on the NAS, and replace each folder on each computer with a shortcut to the NAS folders? \u00A0Is it really that easy?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s definitely two different systems (one desktop with dual monitors, the other a\u00A0laptop) so I\u0027d only want to move the generic stuff.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Speadge","CreatedById":145302,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-30T19:19:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222301519\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126666\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221448910831\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022143107\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ishootdeadppl\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 minutes ago, ishootdeadppl said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically install the game on each computer, \u00A0copy and merge the desired folders into one on the NAS, and replace each folder on each computer with a shortcut to the NAS folders? \u00A0Is it really that easy?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s definitely two different systems (one desktop with dual monitors, the other a\u00A0laptop) so I\u0027d only want to move the generic stuff.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nits not. symbolic links are not the normal desktopt links. u might want to check wikipedia for this.
