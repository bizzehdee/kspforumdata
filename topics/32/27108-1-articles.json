Trying to dock with it the ship just pushes against it without merging. Which is really weird since that node UNdocked just fine after launch. Anyways, is there any way to fix this without scrapping it and launching a whole new module? Some way to tweak the persistence file perhaps?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/576737662497200901/F3EFE6D16D4C50695DBFCC6FDA67A7BD40F70EE5/1024x576.resizedimage\u0022 alt=\u00221024x576.resizedimage\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T13:25:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can replace one ship in a persistance file with another ship fairly easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would do is\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebackup your main persistance file\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elaunch the fixed version of the ship (in a new sandbox if you don\u0027t want time passing, debris etc in your main game)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eopen the new persistance file, find the relevant ship\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecopy all the PARTs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efind the ship you want to replace\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecopy the fixed ship\u0027s PARTs over the broken ones.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T05:19:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanx for your input.
