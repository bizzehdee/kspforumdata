Last one was getting a ship to dock with another, I could get close enough but never knew what to do at that point. I took a break from doing it for about a week launched a mission and like magic it just happened, and now I can do it without much though. I think it is a fresh perspective of the problem without the lingering reminders of failures still fresh in my mind that helped get me through. As far as reading the forums while a mission is in progress I doubt I could as I have that nagging feeling that something bad is happening if I am not looking at the screen, much like what happened while letting the game run one night while I slept (Kraken ate my first Duna mission while I slept).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-11T00:01:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m at the same stage.
