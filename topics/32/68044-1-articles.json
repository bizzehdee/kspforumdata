This isn\u0027t a religious thing, I played .21 with MechJeb and tried a couple of other mods, but for career mode I just found I wanted to do it because, for me, it made sense. I have played other games that I added little personal rules into just to enhance the play/realism/style for myself. In .23 I decided I also wanted to do my career mode against the game clock (I was only on day 12 in the game when .23.5 came out and had more than 8,000 of the requisite 10,738 science points). I also wanted to make a Kerballed return trip to the surface of every celestial body except Jool and Kerbol by as early a date as possible. Since I was able to, I decided to keep my Space Race save going in .23.5 - so far I am still on Day 12 but have launched two vehicles towards the biggest asteroid that showed up using new parts and with enough fuel to, I hope affect the bodies orbit in time for it\u0027s first pass by Kerbin to do an atmospheric breaking to an eliptical orbit then, over a long series of shallow dips into the atmosphere, put it into a nearly circular LKO. If I don\u0027t have the d-V for that I will put work on acheiving that on a subsequent orbit. By then of course I might have captured a smaller one, and certainly will have sent lots of ships out. If I have maxed out science by the time .24 comes out, or if .24 doesn\u0027t support keeping the same save going, I will start over the career mode. I probably have enough science to max out my career mode now, it is flying in from Minmus, but it is a couple of days away still. I have my Eve armada to launch yet, and now, with the new parts, I want to send a new support ship with a lot of extra fuel to Moho to meet my expedition that the lead ship has been on its way since Day 5 of the Kerbal Calendar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see a lot of discussion about what is realistic and what isn\u0027t, and as long as the physics of spaceflight is real (even if planetary and solar densities are a little on the high side) I will not really complain. Sure I would like realism, ION engines that were realistic, but could stay under thrust when not in focus, would be great, but the current compromise is fine. I would love to see icy trojan asteroids of Jool. I would love to send them to LKO and make fuel out of them. Sure adding life support needs and real re-entry physics would be nice too. But even without all of those things, the game will last a very long time for me with what it has before I get bored.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T17:10:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause ever since I was a wee lad I dreamed of making my own space program.
