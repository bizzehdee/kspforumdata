Possibly not all in that order... I may wait to refuel at my Minmus depot depending on what everything looks like after the Kerbin side of the mission. Maiden mission may be a stretch because it\u0027s really just the tried and true Valkyrie with extra cargo space and more fuel. These satellites are of my \u0022new standard\u0022 variety... They have docking ports on them for easy retrieval. That way I won\u0027t have to bring KAS supplies into orbit for routine retrieval missions, saving weight and space and also because it\u0027s really a pain to use winches in zero-g. The craft itself is still transitional meaning it has docking ports AND winches in the bays for compatibility until all the old probes have been recovered. It also carries a small liquid fuel / oxidizer drop tank on this mission to give it an extra 800 DV or so (I think was the figure) which was supposed to help it get to Minmus for its refuel but it\u0027s questionable at this point. The extra cargo space is probably useless for anything except this exact mission because I didn\u0027t do anything to increase the payload capacity over the standard Valkyrie; but these probes are light and the extra fuel needed to be added without changing the basic design of the craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side note, I really like the new look of the oversized tail fins / elevators I changed a while back.

And oh yeah, he landed at night. The landing was VERY hairy; I was sure the gear would explode at least three or four times and it almost wobbled too far twice. But somehow Jeb\u0027s sheer awesomeness pulled it off and next thing you know he was taking his first steps on Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaking off was even scarier, because Duna\u0027s atmosphere simply wasn\u0027t thick enough to get the lift needed to pull away from the surface. In the end I had to wait until my ground-based acceleration took Jeb over the top of a hill, at which point the now-airborne design could pull its nose up. But again, it somehow all worked and the Weasel returned to Duna orbit, albeit with more fuel expended than I was comfortable with. The trip home was fairly uneventful, other than the fact that I returned to Kerbin with zero oxidizer, xenon, or even monopropellant, and only about 100 units of liquid fuel...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes, I\u0027m amazed that Jeb is still alive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ravenchant","CreatedById":84260,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-05T11:19:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI put up a Salyut in the multiplayer server of KSP Subreddit.

Had a few hairy moments getting turned around again (one of my RAPIERs flamed out on me unexpectedly - which is what I get for closing the intakes at low altitude - and sent it tumbling, but I was able to recover). Landing went smoothly right up until the end...I either didn\u0027t land with my wings level or the stance of the rear gear was too narrow; either way the plane tipped over and I sheared off the outboard starboard wings. I was able to correct and get the plane stopped - which was good, since I had forgotten how to activate the ejection sequence - so the whole rescue mission cost me the price of three Swept Wings, an Elevon 3, a Communotron 16 (the real \u0022payload\u0022 of the whole mission) and the fuel.
