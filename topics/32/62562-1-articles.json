Specifically, there seemed to be a threshold below which (i.e. zoomed in) I recieved 14/15 fps in map view, and suddenly after moving beyond this boundary it bounced up to the significantly better 22 fps. This made no sense, until I saw that whilst zoomed relatively far in Kerbin obstructs the visibility of orbit drawings, so you couldn\u0027t see any lines directly behind Kerbin, however, after zooming out a certain distance, the section of the orbits that went behind Kerbin become visible, accompanied with a sudden fps jump.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to no if anyone else has experienced this (if not I\u0027ll put it down to mods misbehaving \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E). It would be interesting to see if any settings.cfg files can be modified to remove the obstruction completely, thus permanently increasing the fps in map view.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
