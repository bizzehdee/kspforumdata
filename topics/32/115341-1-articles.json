At least for people like me, a numbers/science/space geek.\n\nIm loving it, but this love gets very much distracted by some annoying stock Bugs(SB), plus many more Mods induced bugs(MB) and crashes. These Mod related bugs sure SQUAD is not to blame for. If they r indeed mod related. Im not a coder, just a casual gamer.(think about streaming resently)\n\nI feel besides the SB and MB, KSP has so much more potential in terms of maybe Coloniazlisation, and reality related activities like warpdrive and other awesome and Engines/science experiments. And maybe add some Science to find Other life forms on other planets, solarsystems. I personal would be amazed if they implement some kind of minigames to different Science experiments, to maybe maxamize the science on the first go and/or playing around with the informations provided by the given science experiments. \n\nI know there are lots of mods for this, but then we have MB.\n\nTo the Point:\n\nI personally think if we as a community support SQUAD with something like Crowdfunding or mabye give ideas to make the twitchstream more exciting, or whatever.\n\nWe maybe can accelerate the process of fixing bugs, adding new cool stuff or maybe get more Mods to offical status. \n\nJust curious if u guys would toss in some coins to help making this amazing game even more amazing. - Just imagine if every KSP-Player chips in 1 Dollar, what could happen?\n\nWhat is Squad point of view to this idea?\n\ngreetings\n\nLukas Kerman"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T21:28:58Z","Content":"Squad already has plenty of cabbage if their Steam sales are any indication.

Someone has made a lot of money already. I see no reason to give them any more to improve this game. I would see it as fair if they supported and added content for another 5 years and kept $10M in profits or funding for their next project so they don\u0027t need to stuff around with crowd funding. KSP 2 done with a larger budget from the outset for example.\n\nObviously this is a dumbed down version and doesn\u0027t factor is many expenses (Steam\u0027s cut etc) but it also doesn\u0027t factor in ongoing income from future sales of game copies and merchandise."},{"CreatedByName":"samstarman5","CreatedById":12469,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T02:24:44Z","Content":"Squad does not need any crowdfunding assistance or the like. If you really love the game, then encourage more people to buy it. You say you are a streamer, so use that as an avenue to reach out to people to get a copy.\n\nYou also say you are not a coder, so you should understand that Squad is not responsible whatsoever for bugs with mods. That rests entirely on the modders. It is the modders\u0027 responsibility to keep their own mod up to date with new versions of KSP, and not Squad\u0027s. Bringing that up infers a lot of ignorance on your part, and is unfair to Squad. You should really take the time to learn the difference between what a developer produces and what a modder creates. Another thing to keep in mind is that, without a license, a modder can not gain monetary compensation(short of donation) for their work. Squad has the ability to at any time to seize control of any mod made for KSP and use it at their discretion, or not use it at all. I figure this is information you should know before coming up with more funding ideas.\n\nI love KSP, myself, but there can be too much enthusiasm, especially if you go into it blindly. Squad is doing a-ok, and while some people may have a differing opinion on the direction that the game is taking or whether or not it should have been released as a v1.0, the game is actually quite solid and doesn\u0027t need any other financial support other than to have more copies sold.\n\nIf you do ever get people who feel hesitant about plunking money down for it right away, remind them there is a demo version that is getting a huge update soon, but as it is now still gives a new player a good feel for the mechanics of the game. It won\u0027t hurt to even give that a showing in your streams, if you have the time to."},{"CreatedByName":"mrclucks","CreatedById":139561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T02:25:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m actually rather done with support for KSP at the moment.
