You haven\u0027t actually tried it, whereas I do it all the time. I know which approach is quicker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Thinking about it.... I suspect that the disconnect is in how you imagine the spreadsheets are used. I think you\u0027re imagining them as being used in a similar role as the mods, but they\u0027re not. I think that you picture them as being far more constrained than they actually are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It\u0027s hard to picture the implementation of math in a context other than how you use it, but the natural progression is to *not* apply the math simultaneously \u003Cem\u003Eas\u003C/em\u003E you build, but rather apply the math \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ebefore\u003C/span\u003E you build.

They would try different combinations on paper, figure out which works best, and *then* build the ship. Building the ship is a complete waste of time in the process of figuring out the best ship, so we just plain don\u0027t do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, we get sick of doing the math the hard way and set up a spreadsheet to do it the easy way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Eventually, it occurs to us that we\u0027ve been doing the whole thing wrong and start working the equation backwards instead of forwards. In the process of designing, \u0022DV\u0022 makes a much better question than an answer, right? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So we start applying the math that way... and get sick of it and build a new spreadsheet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E And now suddenly we\u0027re theoretically building the same stage with all possible different engines at the same time with just enough fuel tanks to do the DV we need. and simultaneously finding the total mass and price tag for each one. A few clicks, and we\u0027re accomplishing what would take weeks to trial-and error in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E And the process continues to feed on itself, but what doesn\u0027t change is *how* the math is used: Not during construction, but rather before. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E We actually have no need for a display of things like cost, mass, DV and the like when we\u0027re building (except, perhaps, as a sanity check).

As the payload isn\u0027t too big, I\u0027d probably design a standard 2.5-stage rocket. The first step would therefore be creating a new sheet, copying the 2.5-stage template to it, and setting the payload stage to 120 tonnes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second step is creating the initial upper stage. The size of the payload suggests a 3.75 m upper stage, so I\u0027ll start with an S3-14400 fuel tank (82/10 tonnes) and an KR-2L engine (6.5 tonnes, 2500 kN, estimated average Isp 380 s). I don\u0027t know anything about the payload, so preparing for the worst case, I add 0.5 tonnes for a probe core, 0.4 tonnes for a decoupler, and 0.2 tonnes for an adapter. The spreadsheet tells me that the initial (surface) TWR for this stage is 1.22, and the stage provides almost 1570 m/s of delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext I create a placeholder for the lower stage. As the upper stage has one S3-14400 fuel tank, I start with three of them in the lower stage, and a KS-25x4 engine cluster (9.75 tonnes, 3200 kN, estimated Isp 360 s) as the engine. The 3.75 m decoupler is massless, so there is no overhead in this stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, the total mass of the rocket is around 440 tonnes. As I\u0027d expect that the mass of the final lifter would be over 1000 tonnes, I choose 3.75 m boosters over LFBs. I start with two boosters with KS-25x4 engine clusters (estimated Isp 330 s, which also applies to the lower stage as long as the boosters burn) and two S3-14400 fuel tanks each. The overhead from decouplers is 0.05 tonnes per booster. The spreadsheet tells me that the initial TWR is 1.20 (about right), the TWR after booster separation is 1.02 (a bit low), and the the total delta-v is 4919 m/s (too low).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the first fix, I try adding a third booster. That changes the initial TWR to 1.32 (about right) and the total delta-v to 5302 m/s (too low). Then add an S3-3600 fuel tank to each of the boosters. The delta-v is still a bit too low, so I try adding an S3-3600 fuel tank either to the lower stage or the upper stage. Adding it to the upper stage gives better results, so I choose this as the final rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe total mass of the rocket is 1068.75 tonnes, and the total delta-v is 5512 m/s. The initial TWR is 1.22 for the entire rocket, 1.01 after booster separation, and 1.11 for the upper stage. This seems acceptable, as my Isp estimates usually compensate for gravity losses from low-TWR lower stages. Designing this rocket took only a couple of minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-12T12:17:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Freshmeat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Freshmeat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAll the negative vibes aside, I would like to hear how you go about it in practice. \u003Cp\u003EWe all design for a given dV, based on mission requirements, but once you figured that number, what is your next step?

That would be an exact calculation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat i thought you meant it just ignore burn times and calculate thrust-weighted average ISP and use that to get deltaV, ignoring burn times (assume you dont jettison spent engines when they run out of fuel). This is a conservative estimate, as real-world deltaV will be higher. This is not an exact calculation; it is a conservative estimate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECan you give me a bit of time?
