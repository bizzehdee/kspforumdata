I haven\u0027t trusted professional game reviews since the 90s and haven\u0027t read one - except to see how bad it is - since Lets Plays on YouTube became a big thing. If I want to see if I\u0027d like a game I try the demo and/or watch a few people playing. I can usually tell pretty quick if I want to buy the game.\n\u003E It\u0027s not the reviewers\u0027 fault, any more than it\u0027s a boulder\u0027s fault for rolling down a hill and over your car. If they took days, weeks, or months to review every game, by the time their review came out nobody would care and they\u0027d have died of starvation anyway for having not made any money over that time. The system itself is broken.\n\nI wouldn\u0027t say the system is broken, it\u0027s more that the system hasn\u0027t matured. Gaming media is still pretty much an enthusiast press - I don\u0027t know if any of them, even IGN, are big enough to have their editorial staff be completely separate from their writing staff."},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T02:39:54Z","Content":"Not to mention that watching a video of a game (or better yet playing a demo) gives you a much better feel for the game.

But ultimately Squad has done an outstanding job. \n\nI would myself rate it around 8 out of 10. Based upon a rating scale of 1 game is utter crap, 5 game is meh, 10 game ushered in a golden age of gaming.\n\nI don\u0027t think breaking the score down into various components is entirely useful for me, as my assessment is really only going to be on my enjoyment of the game.... and depending on how much fun I\u0027m having, some of the typical components that people rate may not carry much weight. Also I can put up with a lot of faults if I\u0027m having fun. And I have enjoyed the .... of KSP. \n\nBut ultimately, these things are entirely subjective.
