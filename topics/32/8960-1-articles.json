I find that debris that has landed seems to get removed after a while. I\\\u0027m not sure if its based on elapsed time, or if you have to do like 10 launches, but stuff does go away. I\\\u0027ve landed twice on the Mun since the last update wiped my persistence with the re-install, and both of the lander pods I left behind have vanished. Its a nice feature to clean up clutter (I wish orbiting debris would blow up too, or maybe it does and I don\\\u0027t know yet because its all from the last two flights), but it means your crash site won\\\u0027t be there forever.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-01T04:35:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice job.
