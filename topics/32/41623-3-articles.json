I wouldn\u0027t necessarily say that the patience required with KSP actually deters younger gamers but rather filters them instead leaving only the open minded and strong willed gamers, regardless of age actually. Probably another factor in the quality of the community the game has picked up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally though KSP is the sort of game I would have also enjoyed as a kid. I didn\u0027t play Sonic as a kid because he was colorful and fast, I played it because acing the game was hard as hell and it gave me a goal to strive towards. That\u0027s a huge factor in what makes a game a 20 hour time killer and a 400 hour deal instead. KSP obviously falls into the latter but for me so do a number of games that are historically considered abysmal so maybe my taste in games is kind of exclusive. The only thing that would have deterred me was that I didn\u0027t have the knowledge to build a decent PC until I was about 18, so I stayed away from PC gaming all together and stuck to the consoles. That could even be a factor in KSP\u0027s userbase.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BostLabs","CreatedById":57527,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T23:34:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Coneshot\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Coneshot\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI was playing Lunar Lander text only on what was at the time a cutting edge 8088 at age 12.. there was no way I could pass this one up now ;-)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Vic20 had a lot of use with a game called Jupiter lander I think.
