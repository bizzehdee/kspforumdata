Spaceplanes take longer time to ascent too - I think of those tedious minutes that I waited for my SSTO to claw its way through the atmosphere... No, I stopped building them. I\u0027m on a tight budget and money do matter.

You can get away with much less. My SSTOs used about 1 RAM intake per 4 tons and they made it orbit almost purely on jet power.

A high-part-count craft will be flying at about 27,000m accelerating just barely, while the fuel burns at full throttle. A bigger portion of the fuel will be needed for the jets, this can compromise the interplanetary capability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re going for less intakes try to avoid putting dead weight like girders, i-beams, tail cones, NCS adapters...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines are dead weight too: If you\u0027re going to Laythe you don\u0027t need high TWR in space, so minimize the rocket engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-11T07:22:33Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2014 07:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Overfloater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
