Back in .22 there was no need because you could spam transmit. So far i went to minmus with 8 goos and 2 sci jr\u0027s. And from keeping all the data i was able to get full science out of all the goos(and science jr)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately i lost the whole load on reentry-go see the parachute thread. I\u0027ll be back on minmus with a few tweaks and let you know the final count. Ill also send a goo cluster of maybe 16 to eve to test even further. These are just preliminary results so stay tuned.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Caelib","CreatedById":59329,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T05:56:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDont forget you can EVA and transfer the data from those science parts into the command module -- this way you only have to return the command module.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T06:33:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Caelib\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Caelib\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDont forget you can EVA and transfer the data from those science parts into the command module -- this way you only have to return the command module.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich now also makes Apollo-Style landings feasible again (i.e. Spaceship \u002B separate Lander).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the new science lab means that you don\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t need clusters of science, if you just equip your spaceship with a science lab (and then repeatedly dock the lander to the orbiting spaceship in order to transfer science and reset the science modules on it)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T07:11:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Caelib\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Caelib\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDont forget you can EVA and transfer the data from those science parts into the command module -- this way you only have to return the command module.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you get the kerbal to interact with the modules?
