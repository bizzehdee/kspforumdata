Being able to set the full deployment altitude makes setting up staged deployment for heavy rockets work better. I\u0027d used manually-staged deployment of multiple chutes before, but you always had to wait for the first chute(s) to deploy at 500 meters before you could pop out the later chutes. But with tweakables, you can set the first chute(s) to open fully at 600 meters, and the rest to open fully at 500 meters... BUT now you can pop them ALL out early on so they can help slow down the ship while in reefed (semi-deployed) state, rather than only having the first chutes available for that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sof","CreatedById":65663,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T11:47:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe already have liquid fuel only tanks for use in aeroplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VenganzaD","CreatedById":38645,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T15:30:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sof\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sof\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWe already have liquid fuel only tanks for use in aeroplanes.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile not extremely practical, I imagined something like the FL-T800s with monopropellant or Stratus\u0027s with Xenon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reicht","CreatedById":97211,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T15:43:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Eric S\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Eric S\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWORDS I think it\u0027s possible that this was the first pass on tweakables, and that the more complicated tweakables will come later.\u003Cp\u003EWORDS\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in your opinion the game isn\u0027t finished yet?
