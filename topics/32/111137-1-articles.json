Now I\u0027m wondering if I reached escape velocity or not.\n\nTo know that, you\u0027ll need to know the standard gravitational parameter and the radius for the current body.\n\nFor Kerbin, as 1.0.2, it\u0027s \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B5 = 3.531\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D10^12^ m^3^/s^2^ and r = 6\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D10^5^ m (because Wiki says so).\n\nAssuming this number, one can calculate the escape velocity: 2^0.5^ \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D orbital velocity = (2\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B5/r)^0.5^ = ( (2 \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D 3.531\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D10^12^ m^3^/s^2^) / (6\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D10^5^ m \u002B 8.5\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D10^4^ m) )^0.5^ = 3211 m/s.\n\nAccording to these assumptions, I did indeed reach escape velocity, but as anything else in the game; things can change and do so regularly. Do anyone know the numbers for 0.7.3, and for other versions as well? It\u0027d be interesting to know!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T13:51:44Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 01:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Instresu**\n  \nOpps."}]}
