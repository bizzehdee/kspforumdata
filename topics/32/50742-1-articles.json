All was going well (apart from the pitiful thrust which ONLY just got me down in one piece) and managed to land with only 2 units of fuel left. yea i need to send a recovery team, hopefully Jeb has enough snacks. anyway, in my eagerness for my first manual mun landing, i quickly EVA\u0027d bob, planted a flag, performed some science, then had a little walk around. I jumped back in, again realizing i had no fuel, i decided to EVA Jebediah and out he jumped, i didn\u0027t have any ladders so i just jumped off of the 3 meter tall capsule, but his jetpack didn\u0027t work and he slammed into the ground. Here\u0027s were it got very weird. i couldn\u0027t control him, he started flailing around madly, not responding to anything, and the screen went completely black. i thought \u0022 well damn, another kraken\u0022 but not this time. the sound clip of an explosion started to repeat and all that was left on the blank screen was the altitude meter, quickly randomizing numbers until it stopped at \u0027666666\u0027. And all of this just happened at 20 past 1. In the morning. And i\u0027m home alone locking all the doors. Has anyone else had such a scary kraken experience before?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UncutSupersonic","CreatedById":61621,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T00:39:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the hell kraken it happens from time to time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thogapotomus","CreatedById":83257,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T00:41:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027d be creepy at night, but yeah its another form of the kraken.
