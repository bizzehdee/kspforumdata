Ideally, the craft your essentially driving into would have an automatic RCS system to keep it steady, which would work best with a grapple system so that instantaneous forces acting upon it would never need to exceed its thrust capacity. But that wont happen, so you\u0027ll have to make any corrections once the docking is complete, with either craft. Fortunately, if your gentle, it shouldn\u0027t be too bad. And if you dock small to large, then the bigger the large craft the less it matters. Undocking is a bit better. Just let go and use your RCS system to back off, using short bursts. Ideally your RCS system would not have any thrusters too close to the other craft, so that they don\u0027t push it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking more about how close can a sattelite be when I go flying past it with 3 big rocket engines at full power, without blowing it up or knocking it out of orbit.
