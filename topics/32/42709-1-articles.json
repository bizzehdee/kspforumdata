If you have a docking port on an arm with DR hinges then docking will cause the hinges to stop working, quick save and quick load can get them working again but parts often end up mis-aligned. The solution is have the docking port attached to the DR arm via a KAS winch, then before you do any docking, first release the winch and then retract it again, this allows you to set the winch mode to be undocked.

There\u0027s a funny glitch where the rover and debris jumps into the air when you grab it with the magnet, but these wheels are strong enough to take it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gNtw94E.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gNtw94E.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis rover\u0027s primary use was transporting Jeb, I wouldn\u0027t trust it with sensitive pieces of equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ASnogarD","CreatedById":70903,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T15:09:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a older version of my mining rover...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1289.photobucket.com/albums/b509/ASnophoto/KSP_MiningRover2_zps4b2cd14b.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP_MiningRover2_zps4b2cd14b.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... however such designs are typically inefficient, and while it sounds good to have a vehicle that can travel around and relocate at will the vehicle isnt very good at actually mining much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has a crane, a kethane drill mount able to be packed away for travelling, a set of KAS winches to attach to multiple vehicles and some portable attachment nodes in case the target vehicle hasnt got a KAS attachment node, it can fly (sort of) with built in engines and RCS, landing gear to hold the craft stable when it gets to its mining location, solar power and kethane power generators, xenon gas \u002B mono prop gas containers to top up vehicles that need those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can travel at a respectable 13 - 15 m/s safely but can reach 20 m/s on flats but then is prone to toppling and blowing up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am still working on the upgraded version I sent to the mun, trying to work out the kinks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrJonez","CreatedById":36466,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T16:25:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStarting to wonder if I shouldn\u0027t just put rover wheels on the damn modules so they can move themselves around \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sirkut","CreatedById":57229,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T18:51:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tried to pick Jeb\u0027s pocket.
