KSP!\u00A0 I\u0027ve only had it since February (a gift from a friend) and I\u0027ve already spent a huge chunk of my newly retired life playing in the sandbox, building and launching cool stuff!\u00A0 I\u0027ll spend the rest of my life (I\u0027m 63) building my space faring civilization.\u00A0 Maybe I\u0027ll model it after Iain M Banks \u0022Culture\u0022.\u00A0 That would be cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.\u00A0 I\u0027m an idiot.\u00A0 I\u0027m sure the answer to my question is incredibly obvious and I\u0027m just too stupid to figure it out.\u00A0 So there\u0027s that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of my challenges, even with MechJeb 2 and autopilots (not ashamed or embarrassed) is getting my\u00A0 ScanSat in a polar orbit around the Mun.\u00A0 I keep crashing (see point 2 above).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027m really, REALLY anxious to try out the 1.7 Room to Maneuver update!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I fire up KSO, it tells me that there is a new version, but the Update button is grayed out, and I can\u0027t find a link ANYWHERE on kerbalspace.com, the KSP forum, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E, the KSP FB group or anywhere else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really want the Update, but I can\u0027t find it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was a Systems Analyst for over 30 years and worked on TONS of system migrations and updates.\u00A0 If you are going to announce a major upgrade to your system, shouldn\u0027t \u0022Job 1\u0022 be to making\u00A0it super easy for users to get the upgrade?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, I\u0027m probably just stupid.\u00A0 Feel free to flametroll me (after you give me the link).\u00A0 I can take it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-11T01:04:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere did you buy it from \u003Ca
