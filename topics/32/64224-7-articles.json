On the side I\u0027ve been launching satellites around Kerbin, and at least one to Eve and to Bop for communications relays. I use the antenna range mod, but modified values. Slightly increased the Whip\u0027s range and the second antenna\u0027s too, but decreased the third one\u0027s range because it could pretty much work anywhere in the system. I don\u0027t want a loss in communication to make probes stop working though, I just want to have to use relays for farther out missions. I also like the idea of a relay\u0027s orbit putting it on the other side of the main body in whatever system I\u0027m in and I temporarily lose comms.
