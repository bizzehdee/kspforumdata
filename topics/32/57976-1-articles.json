I\u0027d also love to see a video of it in action, nothing professional, just a quick demo if anyone has the time!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m seriously considering getting one but I\u0027m still not convinced. Although, I did just buy a new $3000 laptop to play KSP on so maybe a $140 mouse is the least of my concerns...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T03:16:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuite the laptop you must have there. Honestly, I wouldn\u0027t spend that much on an input device, I just got a joystick and it even is only so useful. So unless you can use it for things other than KSP, like CAD, I wouldn\u0027t think its worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"flightmaster","CreatedById":32617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T04:50:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah it\u0027s mental... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s what\u0027s running through my mind, whether it\u0027s going to be money well spent or if I\u0027m just going to shelve it after 2 days.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Decho","CreatedById":66774,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T12:02:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d be interested if anyone wants to do a demo of one in use with KSP. I doubt I\u0027d be getting one soon as I just got a new (and distressingly expensive) keyboard, but it does interest me, and I do a little 3D modelling so I\u0027d probably use one for that as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nine_iron","CreatedById":37971,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T13:38:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPretty much every1 at my work has a 3D mouse as they use solidworks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found it pretty useless for draftsight though which is all I use.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
