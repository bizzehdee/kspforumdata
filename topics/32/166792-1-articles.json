To get the ball rolling, I\u0027ll tell one of my stupid mistakes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter about 50 hours of playing, I had just managed to successfully build an interplanetary science ship and land on Duna. After I sucked Duna dry of science, I launched and realized I had \u003Ci\u003Eludicrous \u003C/i\u003Edelta-v still left, even after all the hopping around Duna I did. To be fair, I was using modded engines, but I still had the delta-v. At the time, I was still pretty clueless on how to transfer between planets, so when I decided I wanted to go to Moho, I created a\u00A0\u00A0maneuver node that dropped me from Duna\u0027s orbital height down to Moho\u0027s orbital height and into an encounter. Unfortunately, I didn\u0027t realize that to complete the maneuver, I would have to reduce my orbital velocity to zero, and essentially fall towards the sun until Moho got in the way. The issue was, with my 100kn total thrust, coupled with the fact that the solar gravity would accelerate me to a few hundred km/s, I couldn\u0027t slow down and ended up dunking\u00A0my team of six 5-star Scientists into the sun.\u00A0Woo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-23T16:26:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPress F9 when my latest F5 was in the start of my game.
