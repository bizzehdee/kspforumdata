Of course I can understand that due to game limitations it won\u0027t be quite obvious, but if one blocked the edge of kerbol through the edge of screen, I would think one could see a dot.\n\nIf so it would happen more often than venus because of a lesser inclination, and I would like to observe it"},{"CreatedByName":"jarmund","CreatedById":126888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T08:48:36Z","Content":"Maybe. I know there are a lot of visual mods that improve things. Sadly I do not know the name of any, but i know for a fact that one enhances and improves how objects, planets included, appear from far away.\n\nI haven\u0027t heard of one, but it sounds like one of this things that just has to exist: A telescope/observatory mod.\n\nCombine the two above, and you should be able to."},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T12:08:53Z","Content":"Yes you would need some very serious enchantment, around Minmus orbit kerbin can block the sun, solar panels give the blocked by sun message, however its not visible, same with Tylo in low orbit around Jool."},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T22:12:00Z","Content":"Distant Object Enhancement will make the other planets a lot more noticeable in the sky, it should be a matter of pointing a telescope mod at the Sun once Eve gets close."},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T06:02:09Z","Content":"I did notice this today in map view.
