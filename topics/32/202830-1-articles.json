Every part must fail, so indeed, I must also design a backup for everything. I am not familiar with your mods, but i guess they do something similar. So I design everything with that principle in mind. The lander would have been sound with a single terrier, but i put 8 radially mounted engines because it can take failures, even though it hurts deltaV. The shuttle bringing the lander from the mothership to low orbit started with 4 engines, but it could keep working even after losing 3, and if that happens, I can dock it to a drop tank with additional engines. In my previous mission I had my Diggers tasked with resupplying at Duna, each one was made to be able to orbit with a broken engine, and I brought 4 of those vehicles as backup. And I lost count of how many redundant life supports and communications I have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I like designing stuff that way. And indeed, when things go wrong, they get interesting. Some of my finest moments happened when the original plan didn\u0027t work and I had to figure out something else to do with my resources.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut that\u0027s part of the difficulty I did choose. I am never tempted to cheat to revert an annoying malfunction. Doing it would be admitting failure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, real space agencies can calculate exactly when to start the suicide burn to be more efficient. And they can calculate exactly where they land. I cannot. So perhaps I start the burn too late, and I crash on the ground. Or maybe time warp is no longer allowed below 25 km, I won\u0027t start braking until I reach 10 km, it will take many minutes, so while I wait I go do something else, then i get distracted, and I am reminded of ksp only by the sound of explosions. or perhaps I manage to land on a steep slope where I fall down. Or, I turn around my ship so that the fuel tanks protect the crew from the solar storms and their radiation, then I time warp. But as the ship moves around the sun, it gets turned around, the crew is no longer shielded, and at high time warp everyone dies before I even get the first danger message. those are not fun ways to lose\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nin fact, those are all things that would never happen if there was a real mission control and real pilots to take care of gritty details. I like designing and planning around part failures, radiation belts, and such. Those are the obstacles I want to overcome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy own attention span, on the other hand, is not. And I want to be able to revert any mistake caused by that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also want to be able to experiment. Would that ship survive a steep aerobraking? how long can I stay inside the radiation belt before it gets really dangerous? well, in real life they\u0027d do all the complicated calculations.
