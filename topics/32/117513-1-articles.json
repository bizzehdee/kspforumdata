All newly evolved single celled creatures spontaneously combust.\n\nTaking a bird to Kerbin would just be cruel. All those feathers!\n\nAnyway, joking aside;\n\nMy octagonal struts haven\u0027t always exploded in 1.04.\n\nThis particular case they do.\n\nDo they only explode when attached to a specific object?\n\nDo they only explode when a specific object is attached to them?\n\nDo they only explode when a specific object is also on the same vessel?\n\nDo they only explode when in combination with two or more other objects?\n\nIs there a random seed used in the heat equations? \n\nIt\u0027s all verrrrry iiiinteresting."}]}
