When I studied the possibilities i couldn\u0027t figure something out.\n\nSo here\u0027s my question: If you already collected and send your science samples back home to convert it to science (like the normal way to collect science), does the MPL still generate an optimum of science over time with the same samples (wich you did collect again) of the ones you also did send home?\n\nThanks in advance!"},{"CreatedByName":"moronwrocket","CreatedById":134908,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T15:02:56Z","Content":"Ferdini, check out this thread:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117461-New-Mobile-Processing-Lab-mechanics](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117461-New-Mobile-Processing-Lab-mechanics)\n\ntl;dr\n\nYes, the MPL will generate new science over time with any samples \\*that lab\\* has never seen before. Think of each new lab as housing a newer, better generation of science instruments, so it can re-run the same samples. There is a bonus if the MPL is in the same sphere of influence as the sample source (ie, a lab in Munar orbit gets a bonus with Munar samples). There is a big penalty with an MPL on Kerbin\u0027s surface."}]}
