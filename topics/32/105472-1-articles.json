There are a number of points where the refresh routine for funds, reputation, and science should be called, but are not. Another one is after accepting a contract: reputation and science don\u0027t get updated, though Funds do. So if you have a strategy that converts funds to reputation or science, you won\u0027t see the change (or have access to the benefits) until you switch to a scene that refreshes those two values.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
