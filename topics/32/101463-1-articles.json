I like the idea of the upgrade path to buildings and Kerbal XP and stuff, but the regular career is a bit to grind-intensive to get the money, and when I do finally decide it\u0027s time for the grand expedition to a far off planet, I feel all bad about the money I\u0027m \u0022wasting\u0022 that took so long to earn. My new strategy is to run career mode in \u0022custom\u0022, and push the starting funds and contract rewards funds all the way to the right. It basically gives me all the funds to do what I want to from a few simple contracts.

One theme I see is that people allow the contract system to define their space program for them, and that is really not how the system is supposed to work. A contract should be something you can accept or decline. A contract is not a mandate being handed down by your boss, it is an opportunity for you to have some fun. When I design a contract, I try to think of things that I have never done in Kerbal Space Program, and how I would encourage myself to do those things. They are random to encourage the player to leave his comfort zone, and try new things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example, as a Kerbal Space Program player, I never did do any stationary orbits. As I was designing the satellite contracts, obviously I had to do a couple. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E It was something I\u0027d never done before, and the target orbit line showed me how to do it, without me needing to crunch any numbers myself. The first time I tested it, I hit the time acceleration button and watched the planet hover in front of me, and I sat there, amazed. The game just basically showed me how to do something that I had never done. I was given an opportunity by the contract system to have fun and learn something new.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe opposite end of the spectrum is absolute control, and something I think you\u0027d enjoy: being able to craft your own contracts as you need them. However, consider the implications of that: humans are creatures of habit. If anything, I think that would encourage repetition, and possibly make things feel more \u0022grindy\u0022. Players would rarely, if ever, leave their comfort zones. This is definitely something I have considered, but I think the solution lies somewhere in the middle of the spectrum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
