Its all about transistors. The quad core cpu used in most modern cell phones is no match for single core i5. The IPC in cell phone cpu is many times lower than its counter part on desktop market. To put things into perspective. The Samsung Galaxy S3s cpu has a rough transistor count of 26,000,000. The i7 from last year has a rough transistor count of 1,400,000,000. The i7 from 2008 has 731,000,000.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDont believe all the media hype. Mobile gaming will never take over from consoles and PCs. Even though mobiles cpu increase in power each year so does the desktop versions. It would be physically impossible to put a big enough chip in a cellphone to be able to play modern type games with all their fidelity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"redarrow141","CreatedById":67116,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T15:49:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve run the VAB through a remote desktop app on my nexus 7 and my HTC One.
