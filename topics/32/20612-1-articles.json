I\u0027ve landed on the Mun a few times and was thinking about Minmus but not only does it look intimidating with all of its hills but I think I\u0027m ready to take it to the next level and place feet on the surface of another world, not just a moon. I\u0027m at a toss up between Duna and Eve at the moment. Duna looks kind of fun but everytime I look at Eve I\u0027m memorized by its beauty. I guess it comes down to which one is easiest to reach and land on without complex math or mods (currently playing vanilla except for ISA MapSat)? Which one takes the least amount of fuel to just \u0022wing it\u0022 and is the easiest to intercept and land on? Also can anybody offer up any helpful tips and suggestions that a noob like me should know before exploding out of my atmosphere and rocketing towards my first interplanetary voyage? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E I have no problems with making it a 1 way trip atleast until my skills have advanced enough to rescue them at a future date and my kerbalnauts know the risk.
