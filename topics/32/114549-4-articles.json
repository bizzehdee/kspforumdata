It\u0027s not convection, certainly--that\u0027s just totally the wrong mechanic for this. There would be some radiation, but as the radiation goes in all directions, most of it is heating the surrounding atmosphere, not the ship. And no individual air molecule is in contact with the ship long enough to do much conduction. However, that air molecule is hitting the ship at Mach-whatever, which generates heat all by itself at the point of impact. Thus, I\u0027m pretty sure the main way of heating the ship is by mechanical friction. I suppose any radiant heat it absorbs is indirectly caused by the mechanical friction of compressing the air, but I don\u0027t see that in itself as the major heating cause.\u003Cp\u003EInstead, I believe most of the ship\u0027s kinetic energy loss does indeed go into compressing the air, which heats it, and then that heat is released and transfers to the surroundings as the air decompresses after the momentary passage of the shockwave. But most of that heat radiates in directions other than towards the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe air is compressed, forming a shock wave (the ship is coming in faster than the air can get out of the way). The compression heats the thin layer of air in front of the ship, which radiates about half of its energy into the ship (since it\u0027s quite close). You also get a sheath of hot, ionized air streaming back around the ship, and I would expect about half if the radiated energy from the sheath to radiate inwards (although I wouldn\u0027t expect this gas to be as hot as the layer in front of the ship).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t matter if any particular atom quickly slides past the ship along the shock front...you still have a continuous stream of excited atoms radiating energy inward. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I too don\u0027t understand what \u0022convection\u0022 has to do with it.

It\u0027s effectively part of the ship for heat transfer purposes. So using the name \u0022convection\u0022 is technically incorrect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note the part at the end about reentry vehicles, how with a heat shield, most of the heat released as the shockwave decompresses radiates away from the ship like I was saying. And the shuttle, it was basically coated in heatsink. It worked on the same principle as wood-frame buildings with gypsum board on the walls covering the wooden studs of the structure. You put a material with a high specific heat between the fire and the easily damaged stuff. Specific heat is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of a unit mass 1 degree. The more energy this requires, the less hot the material gets in a given time, so the less heat it conducts to the underlying structure. Of course, houses still burn down because the gypsum board is pierced for light figures, HVAC ducts, and the very low specific heat nails holding it to the studs, but that\u0027s the theory anyway \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same thing also works with the materials the other way around. A thin layer of low-specific heat, heat-conductive material on top of a mass of high-specific heat material is also protected.

Or as we say in the fire service, heat release rate. Watts instead of Joules. This is way more important than temperature. For instance, suppose you have some sort of candle that burns at 1000^F and produces 1 Watt.

You can see that my trajectory is currently set up for an encounter with Laythe tangentially to its orbit. If it wasn\u0027t set up already, I could tweak the prograde/retrograde and radial/antiradial and normal/antinormal handles on the maneuver node to get the trajectory into about the right area. OR, since I have the Precise Node mod installed, I could directly edit the maneuver components in the fields of the dialog box (or left- or right-click the buttons to increment the values by the amount selected in the dialog box).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6GRMdNf.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226GRMdNf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next image below shows the effect of decreasing the prograde by 0.01 m/s...the dotted line would be the result of that change.

The dotted line shows that the resulting trajectory would swing inward a little, and would also result in the ship getting to Jool a little sooner so that Laythe would not be as far around in its orbit. So even small changes in the prograde/retrograde component can make a big difference in the arrival time and where Laythe will be in its orbit (because this maneuver is being done a LONG TIME before the encounter). The maneuver can certainly be done closer to Jool (even within Jool\u0027s SOI), but at a higher cost in delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rQbIyNv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rQbIyNv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you tweak the prograde component, you can get your ship to arrive when Laythe is at the right place in its orbit.

It requires making many changes to the prograde/retrograde and radial/antiradial components to arrive at the right place at the right time...but it\u0027s fairly easy to do with Precise Node.
