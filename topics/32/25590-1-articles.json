I\u0027m gonna ask anyway. So I landed my Mine Craft v3.0 on the Mun. First actual successful landing but with my discovery of MechJeb I figured I would go for broke and make my first craft a landing rover. ANYWAY after a few days of R\u0026amp;D on how much TNT I had to strap to this ugly non-aerodynamic monster to get it to space I finally landed and then that was it... My problem is how do I get to launch another craft with this one on the Mun? I hit escape to return to the KSC and it was grayed out, all I could do was end the flight which my craft now doesn\u0027t show up on my map or in the KSC so apparently its no longer active. How do I launch multiple active missions? I know it has to be something simple \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thes50","CreatedById":13495,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T18:23:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst things first, check you\u0027re using a recent, 0.19 being the most recent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, sometimes the game can be a bit picky about letting you switch to the space center.
