With new heating, its is impossible to get anywhere near 1500m/s before you need to switch to rockets (in 1.0.4 you could get to ~1600m/s with a very sleek and low drag vessel). This is taking quite alot of dV away from spaceplanes, and actually ruins some of the very minimalistic just able to barely get into LKO variants. The other major thing is the apparent massive drag increases at medium altitudes. It doesnt affect lower level airplanes that stick to teh deck (actually drag to get to mach1 seems lower), and it doesnt affect rockets much either since those dont spend much time at medium altitude. But spaceplanes, that have their most critical moment being when switching from jets to rockets, have to hang around 20-40km and build alot of speed. Many previous vessels have lost from 1000-2000 dV after reaching orbit cause of these changes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, while me (and im guessing many others) will adapt and just find some new way of making long range spaceplanes, was this change really necessary? Id like to know why it was made this way, cause all the new atmo/heating seems to do is screw over many 1.0.4 spaceplanes, and even though spaceplanes still work and are able to get to orbit, we get way less payload, less range, and any very low TWR model cant even get into orbit anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough the change from 0.90 to 1.0 was expected, why has teh aero been constantly changing ever since game went out of beta and ruining too many crafts? can we at least get it to a point where everyone is happy and LEAVE it there so that people wont have crafts breaking every single update?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-13T07:35:13Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2015 07:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSACheese","CreatedById":150877,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T01:15:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELoving the update so far!
