I have never had a mission go do smoothly. Seeing catastrophic failure is a hidden appeal to KSP but it\u0027s those successes that keep me going.

Back in 0.18 I built this 3-man Saturn V replica. I was so sure it would fail that I flew it in my \u0022Simulator\u0022 save file to keep my \u0022real\u0022 crews safe from harm. I didn\u0027t spend any time figuring out delta V or TWRs or any of that; just slapped it together in ten minutes just by what looked right. I didn\u0027t expect to make orbit without some explosion or staging mishap doing me in, but to my complete astonishment, I ended up flying a textbook Apollo moon mission. I wish my luck was always that good!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
