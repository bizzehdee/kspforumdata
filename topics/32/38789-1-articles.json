Rotating the Kerbal works... occasionally... and for a fraction of a second at a time. And I\u0027ve never even managed to get far enough to save my Kerbal to Facebook or whatever, so who knows if that part of the app actually works. At first I thought this may just be teething problems, but there has never been an update to even try and iron out these links\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday I thought I would check how the app runs on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus, in case it\u0027s just my tablet that couldn\u0027t run it properly for whatever reason, but trying to download from the store gives a \u0022couldn\u0027t install on USB storage or SD card\u0022 or an \u0022incorrect package file\u0022 error. Is it still even supported? Is there ever any plans to update it or will this dead app remain on the Play Store for eternity?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI bought the app to support Squad, and for that reason I\u0027m not asking for a refund or anything. All I want to know is will this app ever see love, or is it a lost cause?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sporkafife","CreatedById":38208,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T18:15:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBump D: Anyone have any ideas about the future of this app?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T18:53:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you email Squad at \u003Ca href=\u0022/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bf9a88fdd0cfcbd6d0d19a88fb\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan class=\u0022__cf_email__\u0022 data-cfemail=\u0022e695939696899492a68d839484878a95968785839694898194878bc885898b\u0022\u003E[email\u0026#160;protected]\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E regarding this?
