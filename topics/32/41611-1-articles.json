It\u0027s in conjunction with a value for Stall. I wonder if it doesn\u0027t mean at terminal velocity. The faster your jet is flying, the more air compression you are receiving from ram air effects, the less the compressor section of the engine has to work, the more the power the engine is generating can go towards thrust. At stall, there is less ram air compression, the more the compressor section has to work, the less the engine\u0027s power is converted to thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shand","CreatedById":57781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T14:12:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eeither way, there is a fundamental issue of if oxidiser is included in the ISP - since the oxidiser is the intake air, but i beleive the calculation just uses the fuel used? i may be wrong there, but that would explain the insane ISP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anton P.
