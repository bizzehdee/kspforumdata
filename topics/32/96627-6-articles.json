Just look at the rest of the game as it already is. Within reason, space flight works like it should. It\u0027s realistic. It\u0027s physics. Does this prove difficult for new players? Sure. Does it prevent you from flying around the solar system willy nilly? Yep. But that has never stopped people from having fun.

Yes. But it\u0027s already in a state that people dislike, and those people have gotten along just fine with mods. Mods are one of KSP\u0027s brightest jewels. They support all kinds of functionality that most players don\u0027t care for. If you want unrealistic aerodynamics, \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u0027s totally okay\u003C/em\u003E!

Don\u0027t know how much tweaking would be needed to fix that. However, it is abolutely unstable in stock as well, so it\u0027s a poor test case to begin with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the \u003Cstrong\u003EStearwing D45\u003C/strong\u003E is probably not longitudinally stable in FAR and I couldn\u0027t get it to take off there. Looks pretty drag-heavy too. However, it is also unstable in stock, but you can at least fly it, unlike the 4A mentioned above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the \u003Cstrong\u003EAlbatross 3\u003C/strong\u003E is longitudinally unstable in FAR, flips out and crashes on takeoff. I suspect this is because in FAR all body parts can generate lift, while in stock only the wings do. I suspect this design could be made stable without too much trouble by adjusting the wing locations and fuel balance, or the angle of incidence of the wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAll other aircraft\u003C/strong\u003E flew wonderfully either out-of-the-box, or with minimal changes to the control surface settings. So using the stock aircraft as the basis for deciding whether an aerodynamics model is good or bad doesn\u0027t seem like such a naive attitude.

Because if the new system is done right there WILL be less dV to orbit. And I think people just have to accept that. I like FAR\u0027s 3,600dV to LKO. Despite what most people think I find that way more realistic. Two stage to orbit rockets are very common. I said in the aero thread that the Mercury boys rode to orbit on a single stage of fuel. So to have ssto rockets carry a kerbal into orbit imo isn\u0027t bad. And then once you add more kerbals and complexity into a mission rockets get as large as they should be with FAR.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to have bigger planets in the game, because the 3200-3500 m/s required to reach orbit from a stock-sized Kerbin with a reasonable atmosphere is just too little. If you use vertical staging with stock parts and want to maximize the payload fraction of a launch vehicle, the usual rule of thumb is 2000-2500 m/s per stage. In the stock game, a good two-stage rocket gets you to LKO. With FAR, you can orbit Mun or Minmus with the same rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game is currently balanced for 4500-5000 m/s to orbit. When I build stock rockets, I usually build 2.5-stage designs with side boosters (without fuel crossfeed) and two vertical stages. With FAR, I just double the payload fraction by replacing the upper stage with more payload.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Janos1986","CreatedById":132068,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-15T10:03:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI feel I have to get used to FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETruth is, I got used to the buggy stock aerodynamics and now my instincts are set to create planes for that physics model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I tried FAR last time and tested one of my finest craft, it didn\u0027t go very well.
