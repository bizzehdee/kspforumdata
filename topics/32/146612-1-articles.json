I currently have the ksp demo on my mac and im in love with the game. I wanna buy the full version but im torn between buying it for ps4 or for my mac.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a macbook pro 15 inch with retina display, and id buy the computer version in a heartbeat if not for one caveat. My laptop heats up when i play and it drains the battery. When i plug my charger in and play the charger heats up a lot too. Its mildly annoying, but more importantly than that im concerned about how this could impact my macbook. I paid a pretty penny for this thing not even a year ago and im worried that constantly heating up the components will impact its longevity. Im aware that they have a system in place where if the temperature rises too high it shuts off before any major damage is sustained, but im worried that chronic heating will have some effect on it. Not to mention that batteries can only be charged and discharged so many times, and playing a demanding game like ksp drains my battery quick.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ps4 is another story. Id able to play the game on a beautiful large TV, not worrying about overheating or battery levels, and it would take away the risk of me hurting my macbook. My only two issues are the optimization and the controls. Ive heard people say that its buggy or that it crashes and resets all your progress. Unless thats been patched im not buying a game for $40 that resets my entire save file randomly. Also if anyones played the ps4 version id like to know how the controls feel. Ive looked over some of the control guides and they seem incredibly complicated. Obviously you dont have a mouse and keyboard to work with but my worry is that the controls are either very hard to learn or that the clunkyness of it all severely detracts from the experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you managed to make it this far please give me some input, because im really torn on what to do and i really want to buy this game. Is there a demo scheduled to come out to console so i could test it out? Any input is appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-26T23:00:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuy on Mac, get hdmi cable, turn down graphics settings or buy cooling base, use charger.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxxQ","CreatedById":102622,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-27T00:19:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222731595\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022146612\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221472252452\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002297357\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wallygator\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Wallygator said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuy on Mac, get hdmi cable, turn down graphics settings or buy cooling base, use charger.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI second this (although my gut instinct is to say something along the lines of getting a proper PC with windoze or linux on it). \u00A0The biggest advantage to playing it on any sort of PC is mods. \u00A0There aren\u0027t going to be mods avaiable for any of the console platforms, and even if you decide now that you won\u0027t use mods, the option is there if you ever change your mind. \u00A0Options are good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-27T00:26:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy i7 iMac does fine.

At this time of year it gets hot just streaming video, so that\u0027s not something I\u0027d even bat an eyelid at - the overheat failsafe is there and it does work. Plus you can plug it into the TV (with the relevant cable/adapter) just like the console, and even bluetooth a console controller to it if you\u0027re technical enough to work it out (and a bit mad).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOverall, the PS4 version will (post-patch) be a more straightforward plugnplay livingroom game experience, but with the Mac you\u0027ll have many more options about how and where to play, and customisation in the form of mods, AND longevity beyond the next generation of consoles. The flipside is potential wear\u0027n\u0027tear on the hardware (but what did u buy it for except to use it?) and possibly a little more expenditure on accessories.

Both, the OS X and Windows build of 1.1.3 tend to crash quite frequently, and the Linux build is only slightly better regarding stability, but has other (mostly graphical) issues. (Disclaimer: That\u0027s based on my personal experience - might be that others don\u0027t have frequent crashes on Windows.) Still, with the PC version you have the option to downgrade, and 1.0.5 is pretty stable (though performance is worse). Also, you\u0027ll get updates sooner, and probably 1.2 will solve some of the worst issues we currently are experiencing. In addition there are some extremely cool mods out there, which greatly enhance gameplay, and without which I hardly would want to play any more (for me \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E is a must...).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next thing is that on PC you won\u0027t be forced to upgrade to newer versions (not even if you buy through Steam, as KSP doesn\u0027t have copy protection -\u0026gt; just copy the installation folder somewhere else and Steam won\u0027t overwrite it ^^), what can become important as version upgrades might break savegames.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
