Is it the preparation stage where you work with number and building your craft? Is it the launching itself and seeing your handiwork blast off with the force of multiton explosions? Is it the moment when your craft finally achieve orbit and coast along in serenity? Is it ...uh...the transit stage (does anyone actually enjoy that?)? Is it when you reach your destination and seeing your plans coming to fruitrition? Or maybe is it the returning trip, if you had one? Or perhaps you just want to see stuff blow up?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"justidutch","CreatedById":99185,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T20:22:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy favourite part is eating the snacks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T20:23:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love when I get to my destination.
