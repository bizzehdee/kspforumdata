Is it the preparation stage where you work with number and building your craft? Is it the launching itself and seeing your handiwork blast off with the force of multiton explosions? Is it the moment when your craft finally achieve orbit and coast along in serenity? Is it ...uh...the transit stage (does anyone actually enjoy that?)? Is it when you reach your destination and seeing your plans coming to fruitrition? Or maybe is it the returning trip, if you had one? Or perhaps you just want to see stuff blow up?"},{"CreatedByName":"justidutch","CreatedById":99185,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T20:22:15Z","Content":"My favourite part is eating the snacks"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T20:23:45Z","Content":"I love when I get to my destination.

Really. Planning, l(a)unching, orbit, making the transit, arrival and return. My missions are not the best planned, I often leave Kerbals longer on space stations or do another spontaneous rendezvous after realizing that Bill lost his KIS drill again ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif). But most of the mission is already thinked trough a while ago. Somehow I love doing transit burns that go interplanetary. Just that feeling that your handiwork is blasting of to a new world, to discover something the Kerbals never knew before.\n\nEdit:\n\nAlso, I love when something goes wrong on launch but I can regain control again and complete it successfully. That happened once. Jeb and Bob where blasting off to Minmus, but I realized that my asparagus staging was wrong. The rocket started to flip, but I released those boosters immediately. Luckily, they only destroyed the launch escape system. The rest went all fine, the mission was a success!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-05T18:51:11Z\u0022 title=\u002207/05/2015 06:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ZentroCatson**"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T18:54:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E planning, or actually, building something.\n\u003E sometimes, i dont even know what i\u0027ll use them for.
