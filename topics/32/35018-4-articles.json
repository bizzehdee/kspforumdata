Harvester has been working on a neat process to get more details out of a surface, as currently all of the surfaces on the planets are simply hand-painted height maps, which results in fairly low details (seriously, would \u003Cem\u003Eyou \u003C/em\u003Elike to paint an entire planet\u0027s-worth of interesting topography?

None of the orbiting bodies have any influence over one another.

See, terrain creation is done beforehand, during development. All that\u0027s being displayed is a surface mesh on a sphere that was created and exported during design time. What we see in the game is a terrain mesh that increases in detail as we get nearer to it (so the game doesn\u0027t have to bother with rendering polys that would most likely not be visible to the player from a distance anyway). Otherwise, that terrain detail is static and pre-defined. What folks are getting antsy about is seeing more details in the terrain, which would be made possible by creating an algorithm to produce more detail and taking the time demand of hand-painting heightmaps off the developers\u0027 shoulders, which can then be exported and applied to the planets/moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hannu\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hannu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I do not know is that possible in Squad\u0027s game system.

Too much detail can bring the game to a crashing halt just as certainly as a thousand-part ship. Every polygon requires computational time to render, and the engine\u0027s desire to work out current physics interactions with each and every part of a ship at any given moment only add to the load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy original point was that, because the planetary terrain meshes are static and pre-defined, \u003Cem\u003Eand \u003C/em\u003Ebecause those details aren\u0027t even loaded and displayed until the player comes near enough to one of them anyway, it\u0027s not as system-damning to add even dozens more celestial bodies as some people insist on claiming.
