One of them was a lander, and It\u0027s still alive. The first one I deployed is still alive at 2 million km. But the middle one, the second probe... has utterly vanished. There is no record that it existed at all. The debris from it was cleaned up for the third launch, and the probe itself no longer exists!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt started when I took a routine look at the Tracking Station. Everything seemed fine, but it said one of the probes was on a Sub-orbital Trajectory towards Minmus. What? I took control and things went completely \u003Cem\u003Eout\u003C/em\u003E of control. The NavBall was completely black, and the altimeter was going absolutely haywire. No sense at all was made that day. Then, to top it off, you couldn\u0027t see the probe itself. THEN I looked at the Map view, and the universe was gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I quit the game, went back in... and even the Space Center was gone! It was only after I restarted the game that everything was back to normal...

It was partially my fault, and partially the game\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI spent several hours building a sweet space station. Halfway through, I decided to throw some engines on it and make it a travelling space station. Then I decided that it needed probes to launch at planets and moons that it visits. So I made a section with several clampotron jr\u0027s, and then sent up some probes to attach to them.
