After watching several with people building bases then moving them one piece at a time, I began to wonder how they had so much patience to spend hours moving it. Therefore I\u0027ve come up with my own solution, the mobile and self deployable upright base module. I spent a few hours working on various designs and working out kinks but I finally succeeded and am quite proud of myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntroducing my first redepoyable section, the Self Propelled Automated Science Module (SPASM)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFour module long train moving to the deployment grounds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1134.photobucket.com/albums/m612/AffreuxLex/KSP/screenshot27.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot27.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe four SPASMs set up at each deployment interval.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1134.photobucket.com/albums/m612/AffreuxLex/KSP/screenshot26.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot26.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis module will travel in a train setup to avoid multiple trips. Upon arriving at it\u0027s destination it can split off and go to it\u0027s designated spot. From there it will deploy into an upright position (Especially useful for Kethane operations). Using the deployment keys in reverse will return the module to a horizontal position where it will be prepared to create a new train to another location. I built this one with only vanilla KSP parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T17:34:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAmazing.

Also, if someone likes the design they don\u0027t need to download anything to copy it and try it for themselves. Can\u0027t upload the .craft file at the moment though. I originally built the SPASM with the tug attached so I went and deleted all the parts then edited the .craft file so that I could get rid of the tug command module. I irretrievably messed up the file. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E So now I\u0027m trying to figure out what I did wrong and fix it or I\u0027ll just have to rebuild it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-29T17:57:07Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2013 05:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by AffreuxLex\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThatBum","CreatedById":57405,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T18:06:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause of how the tree structure of parts work, removing a part will remove all its child parts.
