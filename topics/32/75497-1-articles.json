That being said...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[initial ideas] I\u0027m actually farther along than I should be for this one, as I have (more or less) successfully created a Kerbal model in the game already. It\u0027s not quite the quality of the Dragon in my signature (go check it out if you haven\u0027t already), but it\u0027s certainly recognizable, and it will do well as the base of my trophy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe exterior\u0027s made with Structural Panels, but the interior is mostly girders. Also, the head\u0027s a 2.5m fuel tank. The model can currently stand upright but it\u0027s a little wonky with its mass balance, and would tip over easily if transported somewhere. (My initial plans are to leave him on the top of the VAB, so that all of the little Kerbals can gaze up and be awestruck. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ) I\u0027m thinking of also adding some lights, both to color the Kerbal and to illuminate his surroundings at night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, the model\u0027s fairly well-made but missing a face... so it\u0027s a little Slender-Kerb-ish. I\u0027ll be posting the pictures on Saturday... and then I\u0027ll work more on the design to make it appropriately Kerbal Cup-ish. [/initial ideas]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have any questions about the construction of the basic Kerbal model, please ask! I\u0027ll try to answer them from memory the best that I can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~~~\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT #1\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the model that I\u0027m using. I know that I missed the deadline, so I\u0027m just going to make some minor modifications and then get ready for the next challenge...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YmEAi15.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YmEAi15.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, it wasn\u0027t originally built for the Cup, so it\u0027s not a perfect match. I still think that with a little polishing, it could obtain a standard of quality higher than that of some of the Redditeers\u0027 Kerbal models. So, that\u0027s nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still wish that I could have built this a bit better, for the sake of the Cup.
