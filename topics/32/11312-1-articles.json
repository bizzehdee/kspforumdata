The ship will refuse to pitch up once we get into denser atmospheres and I can no longer control it. The vehicle I used is shown below with a payload in between the two main fueltanks (design loosely inspired by WhiteOwl\\\u0027s AT-9). Any tips on how to stabilize its descent?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T04:25:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVertical stabilizers, canards.

You have a whole lotta wing at the back and no weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry one or all of these things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

I\\\u0027ll try your suggestions. I was thinking of adding canards but I thought that would make it too unstable on liftoff as the whole design is meant for vertical ascent (two stages, I just removed the first stage to make it more presentable).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
