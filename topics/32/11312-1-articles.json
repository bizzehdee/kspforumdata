The ship will refuse to pitch up once we get into denser atmospheres and I can no longer control it. The vehicle I used is shown below with a payload in between the two main fueltanks (design loosely inspired by WhiteOwl\\\u0027s AT-9). Any tips on how to stabilize its descent?"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T04:25:30Z","Content":"Vertical stabilizers, canards. Just two wings alone will make it nigh uncontrollable!"},{"CreatedByName":"SmiteZero","CreatedById":10862,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T04:26:47Z","Content":"I\\\u0027m going to take a guess and say that the Center of Lift in your design is rearwards of the Center of Gravity. You have a whole lotta wing at the back and no weight.\n\nTry one or all of these things:\n\n1. Remove a wing section from the rear.\n\n2. Add more weight to the rear.\n\n3. Add winglets to the nose.\n\nAnd you need some vertical stabilisers somewhere to stop it flying like a fish."},{"CreatedByName":"AlternNocturn","CreatedById":17872,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T04:45:30Z","Content":"Thanks for the replies! I\\\u0027ll try your suggestions. I was thinking of adding canards but I thought that would make it too unstable on liftoff as the whole design is meant for vertical ascent (two stages, I just removed the first stage to make it more presentable)."}]}
