And i don\u0027t feel cheaty one bit. In RL even Apollo and LM used autopilots, and no one was griping about this as long as pilot had an option of taking control at any moment. With 13 active flights as far as Jool system i prefer to concentrate my time on planning, coordinating and overviewing everything - not on fiddling for a hour with two orbits to get my fuel tanker docked to space station for a tenth time. In the beginning micromanaging is enjoyable activity. But when you have two Kethane extractors, space station and interplanetary tug orbiting only Mun it becomes tiresome. And i\u0027m planning to have similiar setup around Minmus, Ike, one of Joolian moons and maybe even Dres. There is only so much time i can spare for playing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E My advice is: do what you feel is fun, and don\u0027t feel guilty for it.
