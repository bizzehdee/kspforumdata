I was able to land near the large, dark, prominent crater \u0022scar\u0022/canyon, and I went to go explore the valley. Well, at the west entrance, there appeared to be a face on one of the walls of the canyon. It\u0027s not like the OTHER face easter egg *cough cough*, it\u0027s not very apparent. There appeared to be another \u0022face\u0022 near the middle of the canyon that looked similar to the first one I had seen. This could just be my brain playing tricks on me after roving to the canyon, which took a good two hours. It could also be me just seeing things that aren\u0027t there. Either way, I just want your guys\u0027 input on this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/clH5g\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/clH5g\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI outlined the \u0022faces\u0022 in red in paint with my super-skilz (sarcasm intended) in case you couldn\u0027t see what I was talking about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESide-note, for some odd reason, I keep on thinking that the two \u0022faces\u0022 look like characters from Star Trek (1.
