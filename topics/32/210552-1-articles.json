So, here\u0027s what I try to do: I\u0027m selecting contracts that could be somehow done together in the same flight. Is not always efficient, but it\u0027s a challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EI would like to share with you one of those combo-contracts and the craft which made it possible:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EMy latest challenge was composed of two contracts:\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n- get two tourists on a suborbital trip (their faces when the craft took off, just priceless\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:lol:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_laugh.png\u0022 title=\u0022:lol:\u0022\u003E)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- test J-33 \u0022Wheelsey\u0022 turbofan at 2000-4000m altitude, and a speed between 170 to 250m/s\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n... Anyway, the two seemed somehow contradictory at a first look, as one required a rocket, the other one an airplane. Why not do a rocketplane then, and solve them both? And as long as we\u0027re there, why not add some extra scientists and a bunch of instruments, and collect some science and crew reports while at it?\u003Cbr\u003E\nSuffices to say that it took me a bit of experimentation, as I went from cheap and simple to complex and expensive... and at first i barely reached 16000m, then somehow I made to 20000, and then, when I reached 60000, I though that was the limit and I won\u0027t be able to pass 70000, but that was just my self-doubting.\u00A0 Eventually I got there, landed the scared passengers safely and without making them sick (yep, it was among the requirements)... but, not the entire plane landed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs you\u0027ll see in the images below, the craft is meant to lose its parts as it goes, it\u0027s loaded with decouplers, the first ones to go being the landing gears (who needs landing gear anyway?\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:unsure:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_unsure.png\u0022 title=\u0022:unsure:\u0022\u003E). And descending from suborbital, on a very steep trajectory wasn\u0027t too much fun either, as I had a very narrow window for deploying the Drogue chutes, good thing I got redundant on those (had 4, two of which were blown away by the overheating and speed, but they slowed the craft just enough for the other two to deploy and do their job... from there, it was all routine).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EThe way it happened:\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1 - took off using the wing jet engines (all engines had 10% fuel only)\u003Cbr\u003E\n2 - short after taking off, lose landing gear (was fitted on decouplers, like most parts)\u003Cbr\u003E\n3 - get temperature measurements, as accelerating towards the first contract, with all those nipples under the belly (turns out one can get all measurements one wants, in a place, as long as enough instruments are brought along, and they all count equally)\u003Cbr\u003E\n4 - kick in the\u00A0\u0022Wheelsey\u0022 engines, those surely made a difference, despite the small air intake fitted on.\u003Cbr\u003E\n5 - get the liquid fuel rocket on (preset at 70% thrust), this happened at around 10000m, as the vertical speed was dropping under 100m/s, and that made the jet engine viable until just under 20000m, when they flameout.\u003Cbr\u003E\n6 - not long after, I dropped the wings, as they would only cause drag\u003Cbr\u003E\n7 - once the jet engines flamed out, I dropped them all and boosted the rocket engine to 100% (still keeping the canards, will need them later). From here, is just a rocket with canards...\u003Cbr\u003E\n8 - for the descent, I still happened to have a bit of fuel, which I used to slightly reduce the descent speed just before hitting thicker atmosphere, it didn\u0027t do much, but it helped to open the chutes before getting all fried.\u003Cbr\u003E\n9 - dropped the rocket engine and tanks and now it\u0027s only a glorified capsule (poor tourists, only if they knew how little was standing between being crushed to death and living to tell)\u003Cbr\u003E\n10 - deployed the drogue chutes, which didn\u0027t pop until the atmospheric thickness became viable (just at the same time when air friction was starting to cause plasma), the first two failed immediately, but they allowed the other two to just make it...\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n11 - dropped the canards, as now they had no purpose, dropped the heat shield at the back of passengers compartment (yes, i had one, where the liquid fuel was attached)\u003Cbr\u003E\n12 - deployed the main parachutes and landed safely, taking those poor stand-up guys money... plus a lot of science that I got to collect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould you have it done differently?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot1.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002242.19\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ibb.co/pjqh5hC/screenshot1.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot2.png%5B\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002242.19\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ibb.co/R4ZtRBj/screenshot2.png%5B\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot3.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002242.19\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ibb.co/kB09n34/screenshot3.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot4.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002242.19\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ibb.co/5LJ22Mj/screenshot4.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-11-10T18:46:39Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2022 06:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Matrazuchi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeadJohn","CreatedById":201293,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-10T19:47:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224197569\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210552\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221668105840\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022223683\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Matrazuchi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n48 minutes ago, Matrazuchi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould you have it done differently?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou didn\u0027t do anything wrong, just commenting on what I might have done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMismatched part sizes cause extra drag.
