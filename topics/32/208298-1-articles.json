At the equator, sea level temperatures vary between a nighttime low of 9 \u00B0C and a daytime high of 15 \u00B0C. Mid-latitudes are only slightly cooler than the equatorial zone \u2014 at latitudes below 63\u00B0, the sea level temperature never drops below 0 \u00B0C. At the poles, the temperature varies between -26 \u00B0C and -24 \u00B0C. The globally averaged sea level temperature is approximately 9 \u00B0C.

There are just too many problems to overcome, the most obvious being light, or lack thereof?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaythe (and all of Jool system by extension) has a maximum insolation of just 4% of Kerbin, meaning that any given area perpendicular to the sun receives only 4% of the solar energy at Jool compared to Kerbin. Assuming that Kerbin is the same as Earth in this respect (and I believe it is), average illumination is around 1360 watts per square metre; the atmosphere absorbs the majority of this though, so the ground only receives about 340 watts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssuming Laythe\u2019s atmosphere behaves the same, average illumination on Laythe\u2019s surface would be about 15-20 watts per square metre- far too dim for all but the most heavily optimised low-light plants to survive, let alone grow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is just once facet of plant survival though- while light is vital for photosynthesis, it\u2019s not the only problem a hypothetical plant (or photosynthetic algae) would face:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTemperatures on Laythe range from relatively cool to well below freezing, with significant ice caps at each pole. Lower temperatures lead to slower biological processes, plus the risk of an aquatic organism getting swept up to the poles by ocean currents where it would freeze and die. The Laythean organisms would therefore need to be very cold-adapted and able to survive freezing conditions for potentially long periods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVolcanic activity generates a lot of sulphur and carbon dioxides, leading to ocean acidification. A moon as volcanic as Laythe with many geysers and subsurface hydrothermal vents would be pretty inhospitable to marine organisms, with acid rain posing a serious problem for land-based ones. It would also make the air pretty noxious and could explain how Laythe manages to hold enough heat to keep its oceans liquid- a runaway greenhouse effect caused by volcanic CO2 trapping what little heat comes in from the sun. This Laythean organism needs to be highly acid-tolerant and capable of dealing with very high levels of carbon and sulphur oxides, which are toxic in high doses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVolcanoes also tend to emit lots of heavy metals which can be harmful to life, so the Laythean life form needs to be very good at either not absorbing them at all, or getting rid of them. Plants on Earth have a variety of ways of doing this, mostly involving dumping the metals into specialised storage areas in their leaves or roots, but such organisms are relatively rare and highly specialised to grow in these contaminated soils.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing so close to Jool also presents an even bigger hazard- radiation. Deep inside Jool\u2019s magnetic fields, Laythe would be constantly bombarded by ionising radiation that can destroy DNA and while its atmosphere could block some of that out, the surface is still going to be far more radioactive than almost anywhere on Earth or Kerbin. Again, organisms exist that can cope with high radiation levels using a variety of systems to protect and repair their DNA, but again they\u2019re specialised to do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaythe\u2019s atmosphere is relatively oxygen-poor too (at least, according to the numbers I\u2019ve seen) and despite producing oxygen via photosynthesis plants and algae still need some oxygen to live off of while the sun isn\u2019t shining. Regular eclipses on the Joolward side just add to the oxygen stress by reducing the time they have to generate oxygen. Perhaps a method of storing oxygen for later use would be necessary, or else some very efficient gas exchange systems to extract as much oxygen as possible from the air along with low-oxygen adaptations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u2019s the problem though: each specialisation requires precious resources to be put into it, reducing the growth rate. A single organism that can survive low temperatures, low light intensity, high radiation, high metal concentrations, high levels of CO2 and sulphur oxides, low levels of oxygen \u003Ci\u003Eand\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0high acidity is just too far-fetched for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLife on hydrothermal vents, on the other hand, makes a lot of sense- almost immune to radiation deep under the water, using the minerals and heat from the vents to survive, unconcerned by oxygen due to anaerobic metabolism and using the metals for cell walls or shells, thriving communities could well exist deep within Layrhe\u2019s oceans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Manul","CreatedById":189366,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-27T17:41:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224138254\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208298\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221653662000\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199902\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jimmymcgoochie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, jimmymcgoochie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssuming Laythe\u2019s atmosphere behaves the same, average illumination on Laythe\u2019s surface would be about 15-20 watts per square metre- far too dim for all but the most heavily optimised low-light plants to survive, let alone grow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaythe\u0027s atmosphere is half as thick as on Earth and less dense so it should absorb less light (yesss, less radiation too).
