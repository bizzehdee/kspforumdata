This second time I actually positioned the periapsis just before the space center\\\u0027s continent behind the mountains at a near 70km height. This was really an educated guess, and it worked out pretty well after a few adjustments when you\\\u0027re already in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s pretty nerve-wrecking nevertheless. x] I\\\u0027ve gotten used to getting into orbit, but the descent is always tricky with this space shuttle. I\\\u0027m always paranoid that if the speed and angle of descent is too fast and steep, the ship will flip and fly backwards (because it has the tendency to do that, and I fail to recover). I\\\u0027ve gotten better with the fuel consumption, though, which is always a plus.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ted","CreatedById":26298,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-16T23:03:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve had a few instances where upon descent back into the atmosphere I\\\u0027ve become stuck in a never-ending spin because I re-entered too steeply. One of the worst things about re-entry via space-plane is that it takes so long, it can be a good ten minutes until you\\\u0027re near the KSC, very frustrating if things go badly at the last minute.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jayther","CreatedById":28838,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-16T23:30:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, the never-ending spin is quite annoying. I\\\u0027ve found that ASAS (or the Avionics package) tends to do this because it will always try to go back to the original position, but the speed of the spin is so fast that the ASAS sometimes makes it worse (and with Avionics package, it\\\u0027s not enough to stop the spin at all).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution I came up with was with the same trick I use with just rockets, where I tap the SAS key (not the toggle) multiple times so it will gain a new target direction for the ASAS, thus slowing it down at least. Even with this solution, though, if I fall into the atmosphere too steep, I will at least stop the spinning, but it will be stuck flying backwards. This usually happens in my failed launches (I don\\\u0027t reach an orbit) where I go down at a steep angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, I agree with you about reentering with a space-plane. So much time invested only to fail at the end.

The shuttle has the tendency to pitch down, which is why the shuttle\\\u0027s back is facing towards the ground (like how real space shuttles actually launch). Even then, I still had to hold the pitch up key to counteract the shuttle\\\u0027s tendency to pitch down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you mean keeping it balanced roll-wise, it\\\u0027s really just minor adjustments during takeoff and keeping an eye on the navball.
