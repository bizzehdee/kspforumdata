A very propitious and philosophically important number. In previous versions, apparently the 42nd was a structure\u00A0called the VAB South Complex Building -- which seems to no longer exist. It is certainly not listed in the wiki under the VAB biomes list anymore, and I can\u0027t find it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo can it truly possibly be that there are only 41 biomes on Kerbin now? How could such a travesty be true? I was hoping that \u0022Deep Underwater\u0022 would be the new 42nd biome, but the other submariners and I tried that, and it doesn\u0027t work.

At a full tier 3, the VAB South Complex no longer exists -- and I\u0027m sure it did exist in some previous version of the game. And it\u0027s not listed on the wiki Biomes page, anymore, either.

So the nice thing about a SeaCave, or DeepUnderwater,\u00A0or an additional \u0022Ocean\u0022 biome is that you can still become\u00A0both landed and splashed in each.

And then the kerbonaut\u0027s RCS jetpack suit needs a slight negative bouyancy\u00A0so you can do EVAs and take surface samples down on the bottom just like on land.
