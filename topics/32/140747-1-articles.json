problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut consider what KSP has given you (probably hundreds, even thousands of hours of entertainment), and what you have given KSP (probably US$20, plus or minus a few dollars).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless you\u0027re asserting that this is not a fair trade of value for money... why such vehement complaints?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe my perspective is skewed, since I\u0027ve been a professional software engineer shiping products for companies large and small for over 20 years, and therefore have some idea of what\u0027s involved in shipping software.\u00A0 For anyone who \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eisn\u0027t\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E professionally involved in shipping commercial software, it\u0027s worth noting a few things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ereally hard\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 And it takes \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eenormous\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E amounts of work and time, both to create it in the first place, and to find/fix bugs in it.\u00A0 It\u0027s not free.\u00A0 There\u0027s no magic wand you can wave to make it perfect.\u00A0 And the world won\u0027t stand by and wait for you to spend a decade polishing the product-- you have to ship.\u00A0 And that means it\u0027s mathematically impossible to put software out the door without bugs in it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust how \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emany\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E bugs are in it will depend a lot on how big your staff is.\u00A0 If you\u0027ve got a couple of hundred engineers working on it, and a comparably sized full-time professional QA staff, then you can really go to town on it and make a seriously polished product.\u00A0 But if you\u0027re a tiny indie company with only half a dozen or so developers and a small testing staff, you simply can\u0027t deliver that same amount of polish.\u00A0 It\u0027s not as though you can take 20 times longer to ship in order to make up for having 1/20th the staff.\u00A0 You just have to go out the door and accept that the edges are going to be rougher than if it were a product from one of the major heavy hitters like EA or Blizzard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you purchase a product from one of the big AAA producers, you\u0027re getting \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eenormously\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E more engineer hours per dollar than you get from Squad, and it shows.\u00A0 They can do that because they work with economies of scale.\u00A0 If you\u0027re selling a product for US$50 or more, and you\u0027ve got a target market of tens of millions of people, and you charge cold hard cash every time you ship a new update, then you can afford to throw a lot of engineers at it.\u00A0 But when you\u0027re only selling a tiny fraction of the number of units, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eand\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E the per-unit price is a lot cheaper, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eand\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E you keep producing updates and upgrades for free... you can\u0027t go out and hire a hundred engineers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike or not, what you\u0027re getting when you purchase KSP is an artisanal, hand-crafted product.\u00A0 It\u0027s the equivalent of buying a handmade pottery mug in a local craft store rather than picking up a slick factory-produced product at a major department store.\u00A0 It\u0027s not really any cheaper to you, and it has some rough edges.\u00A0 But you get it because it\u0027s appealing and quirky and you like it, and you like having a direct personal contact with the artist who\u0027s right there to answer your questions about it and listen to you, and the rough edges are the cost of doing business.\u00A0 And what you\u0027re receiving is the result of a handful of incredibly hard-working, dedicated, passionate people who are pouring their heart and soul into trying to delight you.\u00A0 Trust me, software development is hard, thankless work.\u00A0 You don\u0027t do it unless you really care about it and believe in what you\u0027re doing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s not to say that Squad is perfect or never makes mistakes.\u00A0 Everybody does.\u00A0 Just... try to be a little realistic, folks?\u00A0 And when you yell at them for shipping 1.1 too early, consider all the people who were yelling at them for shipping too late.\u00A0 And remember what it is that they have to work with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd maybe tone down the rhetoric, just a
