Obviously I very quickly encountered the asparagus configuration where you progressively siphon fuel from the outer engines to the inner engines and break off the empty ones symmetrically. I like this configuration a lot and in space or high orbit, it works like a charm. However as an initial stage, I find that while it is extremely fuel efficient, it lacks the raw power (I believe that\u0027s delta v?) to get you out of Kerbin atmosphere quickly. Mostly because it dumps two engines rather fast and the longest time out of the entire flight is spent on one engine. Granted, at that point you should have cleared atmosphere and be using that one engine in a vacuum, but still, the quick dumping of two engines greatly decreases the early thrust which is what you want for escaping the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo while being bored at work and thinking about my rocket designs today, I came up with the following: what if you used a configuration that focuses on keeping as many engines live and firing for as long as possible? So I came up with the following: a reverse asparagus design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow does it work? well much like the asparagus design, it consists of a center tank with a number of side rockets. Each rocket is linked to the stage above it by a stack decoupler. The center tank feeds fuel to all the side rockets at the same time, and the side rockets pump fuel from one to another in the classic asparagus design. So when you lift off, the center tank will run out fairly rapidly. Because of this, it\u0027s best to have a big center tank with a big engine (or even several medium sized ones by using the tri- or quad-coupler). Your first step is to ditch the center tank. This is quite a hairy manoeuvre and requires enough clearing between the center tank and the side rockets (make sure to use TT70 decouplers rather than TT38 ones in the stage above this one) but once the center tank is gone, you are left with all side rockets firing and can simply peel them off in a symmetric fashion as you would with regular asparagus. The biggest upside to this configuration is that every stage after the initial one has 1 more engine burning than the classic asparagus configuration. And your final and longest step uses 2 engines the entire time instead of 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that this only works as a lower stage because it requires you to dump the center tank first and then peel off in the classic asparagus design way. You need those side rockets to still be attached to something at the top when the center tank falls away. Also, you\u0027ll need struts linking the outer rockets to each other to prevent them from swinging wildly out of control and colliding. The struts should break easily as you separate them off though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done some initial launch testing, and so far results were very promising. The reverse asparagus reaches an apoapsis almost 50% higher than the regular asparagus configuration on identical vehicles (the only difference being the direction of fuel pumping on the fuel lines and a few extra lines on the reverse one) when shooting straight up from launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a total noob though, so if the more experienced players could give me some idea as to whether or not I\u0027m on to something, give some ideas for more thorough testing and tell me whether or not this has been done already, that would be awesome \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep those rockets firing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECirocco\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Soda Popinski","CreatedById":92416,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T21:23:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPictures might help.

Because you have no center stack anymore (as that is the first to go), the rocket is hollowed out and lacks a bit of stability. This means that in the reverse asparagus, you need to wait a few seconds after the engines burn out to give the rocket time to stabilize before you decouple. If not, collision of the stacks is almost assured. This is the biggest problem I can see right now, and I\u0027m trying to resolve it by trying to add more stability to the outer rockets, especially the final 1-2 stages.

That would minimize gravity losses (the loss you have from using your thrust to fight gravity; the clearest example is when you are hovering and constantly burning fuel while getting no change in velocity)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there is another factor which is air resistance. Air resistance force is proportional to your velocity squared. If you travel 3 times as fast you will encounter 9 (3^2) the air resistance. You will also escape the atmosphere 3 times faster. So you will have 1/3 of the gravity loss, but you will have 9 times the air resistance loss. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt turns out that the air resistance loss would significantly greather than your gravity loss and your ascent would actually be very inefficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt turns out that the best balance is to keep your gravity loss and your air resistance loss to be equal to eachother. To determine what that speed is we use \u0022terminal velocity\u0022. It turns out that an unpowered falling object will have a force of gravity pulling it down with the same force as the air resistance is slowing it down. Because the forces balance eachother out at terminal velocity, the speed of the falling object remains the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are correct that you want more thrust at the very beginning to get from 0 m/s at launch up to about 100m/s which is terminal velocity below 1000m altitude. But to avoid losing dV due to air resistance you maintain about 100m/s vertical speed and slowly accelerate to about 260m/s over the next 11,000 meters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a chart of terminal velocity on the wiki here \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbin\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbin\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOften people use extra SRB for the initial impulse to get up to 100m/s quickly. But after that a very low thrust to weight ratio is adequate untill you get out of the thick atmosphere. After that a higher thrust becomes more efficient again because air resistance declines very quickly and as you noted in your original post, the faster you can reach orbital speed the less energy you lose fighting gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom 0 to 100m/s you want as much acceleration as possible (under 1,000 meters altitude) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5 m/s/s would reach optimal speed in 20 seconds at an altitude of 1000 meters.

But now I look at the problem a little differently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgreeing with above, the thing about having engines is depending on how you build your rocket, those engines might just be dead weight sucking up your fuel. A nice strong engine with descent ISP that can lift your craft is all you need, minus your payload, everything else can be fuel. So obviously you can play with multiple engine configurations but if you want to talk efficiency and cost, dropping engines is the most expensive, least efficient method. What I\u0027ll usually do now is reduce the size of my lifting stage, and place that fuel into drop tanks. The returns are diminishing, but TWR \u0026gt; 1.07 seems to work well for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETypically I\u0027ll do two sets of three, string them together and drop them as I rise. I may need some small engines on the third set of tanks but I\u0027ve found intelligent rocket design (I know, KSP isn\u0027t exactly founded on that, but FAR and DE support it) is easier to handle and generally just does a better job. I couldn\u0027t find a really good screenshot of something I\u0027ve already built, but this illustrates the most basic version. This ship has quite a lot of fuel on it, but the final tank is quite small in comparison, about 1/5 the total.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/687096419917486809/D3F947FE9BB23686526B1A8489067DCA0526AB9E/\u0022 alt=\u0022D3F947FE9BB23686526B1A8489067DCA0526AB9E\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-08T12:41:56Z\u0022 title=\u002201/08/2014 12:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Hyomoto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T12:41:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI used this idea on the landing stage of my Tylo lander - it had one large central tank which it dropped when it was empty, keeping small fuel tanks and engines around it. But the point was - it needed all those engines because only when they were all burning and the remaining fuel tanks were half empty it crossed TWR 1 on Tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor liftoff in atmosphere, too much TWR is as useless as too little TWR. To terminal velocity (which you can usually achieve quite fast) you can use any TWR your ship can hold, but after that, TWR 2 is optimum all the way to the upper atmosphere. Keeping your engines while dropping empty fuel tanks ultimately raises your TWR, meaning you either launched with too little TWR, or you have unnecessarily too much TWR and are burning fuel to warm up the atmosphere. Or both.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
