I often use it to hide a little bit of an engine or part inside another *partially*. Where I personally draw the line for part clipping to be \u0022cheaty\u0022 would be something like clipping 2\u002B engines or 2\u002B tanks exactly together; I tend to use it to make craft look beautiful, not to \u0022cheat\u0022 more fuel into what looks like one tank, or an engine with \u0022twice\u0022 the amount of thrust."},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T00:56:25Z","Content":"I would say that in some cases it could be an exploit, but not in others.

Even if you put one tank right inside another it doesn\u0027t gain you any advantage, you still have the same weight to lift and (correctly me if I\u0027m wrong here), drag for radial parts is calculated where the part is originally attached.
