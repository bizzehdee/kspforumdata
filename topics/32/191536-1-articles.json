After one of the recent updates I noticed drag was all over the place and my aircraft could no longer reach airliner speeds (Mach 0.72-0.84). I thought my save was corrupted or perhaps it was a mod, so I did a clean install and new sandbox save. Here are the results with the following constants: Stock Gull, modified without floats,\u00A0Mach 0.65 @ 6,000 metres. An aircraft with such few parts shouldn\u0027t be draggy and should fly like a dream.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EVersion 1.8\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of the drag is concentrated on the most frontal and rear components in a \u0027line of nodes\u0027; the advanced nose cone has a fair amount of\u00A0drag (0.60); the tail connector has\u00A0half of this (0.30) and the components in-between about half again (0.15), which makes sense because they\u0027re only causing skin friction with a tiny amount of form drag due to the angle of attack, negative in this case. Similar results with secondary \u0027line of nodes\u0027; the engine nacelle: Intake has 0.21 drag, engine has 0.17 and tanks have 0.02.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Ip95edl.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Ip95edl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EVersion 1.8.1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverall drag is far higher, and middle components must be creating some invisible form drag or something; the advanced nose cone has a slightly higher amount of\u00A0drag (0.83); but the\u00A0tail connector has\u00A0far more (1.15) and the components in-between almost that of the nose cone!\u00A0(0.74).
