Mainly with MK3 \u0022shuttle parts\u0022 housing a bunch of payload rather than using larger parts, since I have a pet peeve about being able to access my payload\u00A0;D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve found robotics give you\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Emuch\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0more flexibility with your entry profile and weight distribution, but its really touchy.\u00A0 Without those your looking more at other control methods, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E spam \u002B Vernor thrusters\u00A0to keep your entry profile without overheating. I haven\u0027t tried air-brakes for any of my \u0022Starship\u0022 wannabes, but for my \u0022Falcon 9\u0022 booster I do use them for re-entry, but \u003Cstrong\u003Eheating issues show up very quickly\u003C/strong\u003E (very similar to the real thing). Which requires you to either take a shallower profile or perform other in-flight maneuvers. I\u0027ve also used air-brakes to stabilize my Shuttle approaches, and they help a little, but can only be used sparingly due to thermal issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are generally looking at a more \u0022lifting body\u0022 concept than anything with large wings as unless you get it\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eexactly right\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0you wont be able perform the \u0022flip maneuver\u0022 to land, let alone control deal with re-entry heating by being able to orient fully side-on. Fully stock landing is its own challenge, where\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Esmashing\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0that retrograde button and leaving it to Jeb works\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Ewell enough if you get the throttle right, and maybe add some parachutes to help orient. However, If you have a large wing structure it might not be possible.\u00A0Mechjeb has a vastly better time getting the throttle perfect, but it also can trip up on the flip if there\u0027s to much aerodynamic mumbo-jumbo going on. This is with or without the air-brakes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor maneuvering they can help a little during re-entry and glide, but thermal is your main concern if your using then during it during re-entry. During landing you need other control methods to help with the \u0022flip\u0022 maneuver, so your air-brakes wont help there much either and its more up to your overall aerodynamics. Finally, robotics offer the most control and flexibility throughout the approach down to the landing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I can provide pictures of the iterations I\u0027ve built later if anyone is curious to see my part clipping skills)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
