Using two standard T30 engines and two T45 engines with one F400 fuel tank and 6 F800 fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously I can\u0027t see the pictures and thus can\u0027t see the rocket design, however I get the feeling that (as long as they can control the rocket) orbit should be achieved easily. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that much fuel being carried up I think they will have a vast amount of it left in reserve after orbit is achieved. Are you deducting points for things such as exess fuel being carried up when its unnecessary/inefficient?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see they are bringing parachutes also, I\u0027m guessing incase they fail... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint deductions incoming I guess if they crash and lose their expensive hardware so parachutes mitigate the failure cost?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose the \u0022point reduction\u0022 is sort of self imposed as if they are using up funds carrying extra mass it will eat funds from possible future missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FizziksGuy","CreatedById":63006,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T13:23:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWant \u0027em to aim high, and realize they only have 40 minutes a day for a few weeks to get up to speed, and do write-ups as they go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FizziksGuy","CreatedById":63006,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T13:27:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022musicpenguin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022musicpenguin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYeah, Let us see the screenies and reports!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmmm, you can\u0027t see the screenies and reports?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFound the problem.

I\u0027m assuming as their funds deplete and they need to hit more aggressive milestones they\u0027ll start working on being more efficient in their designs. The parachutes are for any parts of their rocket they return to Kerbin -- they get half the cost back as salvage if the parts aren\u0027t destroyed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Right now they\u0027re still mostly playing, as most of their teams are still taking AP tests here in school (I have about 1/3 of my class in here at any given time).
