Yes, it\u0027s been updated, multiple times. Nowadays, if you use excessive monopropellant you either have a bad design (RCS Build Aid helps there) or a bad approach technique (forgetting to use Smart A.S.S. to make the docking axes parallel). Of course, the are situations where you can\u0027t have a decent design or an optimum approach path, but that\u0027s hardly MJ\u0027s fault. MJ does sometimes like to approach at too steep an angle, but I use Navyfish\u0027s docking aid to monitor the situation, and if it feels out of hand I disable the docking autopilot and null the closing velocity while still moving laterally. When the angle looks better, I re-enable the autopilot.
