Hudfrid was the poor soul piloting that ship. The first thing that went wrong was that I overheated the Mainsail of the lifter, yet the remaining dV seemed to be enough for a successful landing and return. Well, the landing was successful, and the launch back to an orbit around the Mun worked as well, yet the remaining dV was just about 150 m/s (missing about 100 m/s, what probably would have been available if I hadn\u0027t overheated the Mainsail)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I quickly built a rescue ship, piloted by Jebediah, that got to the Mun easily, before Hudfrids life support would have run out.
