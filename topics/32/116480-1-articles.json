I\u0027ve never sent so much as a probe on flyby to either. Which one should I explore next?\n\nAt this point, I\u0027ve done manned landings (and safe returns) from everywhere except Eve and Tylo, so I\u0027ve got the skills. I just haven\u0027t had a reason or desire to visit either Moho or Eeloo until now. As I understand, the delta-v requirements for Moho landing and return are borderline astronomical (heh), and now you\u0027ve also got to deal with heat management. Eeloo is more of a waiting game: wait for transfer window, and then wait forever to get there even with time warp on. Also, you need RTGs and fuel cells since solar panels are apparently worthless at that distance from Kerbol. I also understand that Eeloo is, for a lack of better way of putting it, kinda boring. Nothing really to see or do there, whereas Moho is much more interesting. So Eeloo would be the easier choice, but Moho the more fun/interesting choice.\n\nCurious what people think; should I go to Moho, or Eeloo next?"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T12:25:53Z","Content":"Eeloo of course!"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T12:27:29Z","Content":"Moho is greater of an achievement to me seeing as it takes me longer to get there and it costs more fuel for me.

The transfer, capture, and landing are all routine. It\u0027s prettier than Dres but that\u0027s about it. So to make the trip worthwhile, you\u0027ll need to come up with some reason to go there other than flags and footprints. Such as the Karbonite Plus mod (Eeloo is one of the few places you can mine it). Or send a rover and circumnavigate the place--it\u0027s reasonably good rover country.\n\nA trip to Moho, however, is far from boring. The huge dV requirement comes not from landing (Moho\u0027s gravity isn\u0027t THAT strong) but from the transfer and capture. If you don\u0027t do a good transfer, it\u0027s quite possible to enter Moho\u0027s SOI and find you need 6000-7000m/s just to capture (on top of the transfer and plane-change dV). This is what normally happens when you try to go to Moho direct from LKO like you would any other planet. It\u0027s this cost to capture that is the main trouble with Moho.\n\nTo avoid the massive capture burn cost, you can use [Moccollo\u0027s Method](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/61478-Oh-bugger-Injection-burn-at-Moho?p=835667\u0026viewfull=1#post835667). Another trick (which I\u0027m currently testing myself) is to gravity brake off Eve en route to Moho, like the real probe recently did. In any case, forget normal transfer windows from calculators. Either leave Kerbin at the specific point mentioned by Maccollo and at no other, or leave on the Eve window and go to Eve first. It\u0027s going to be a longer trip than it might look just based on the distance due to the need to take the time to slow down en route one way or another, so pack a lot of food.\n\nOn top of this, since 1.x it\u0027s now HOT at Moho. If your ship already gets bothersomely hot just running the engines, expect real trouble doing long burns at Moho. It\u0027s probably a good idea to have radiators. But those don\u0027t help EVA Kerbals, who get thermal gauges as soon as they step outside."},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T13:15:16Z","Content":"Moho is a very hard nut to crack.

That said don\u0027t underestimate the Eeloo capture and Eeloo ejection burns if you go directly from Kerbin. A Jool assist can significantly reduce the delta-V required for those burns, at the cost of making an already long mission even longer.\n\nIf you have the patience for ion engines they are very practical for Moho, you can easily pack loads of delta-V, and the new SAS modes mean you can set your burn going then watch some TV or something. My Moho ship had so much spare I was able to stop by Gilly and Bop afterwards! Do be mindful of the duration of the Moho capture burn, you might well need to start it before even entering Moho\u0027s SOI."},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T13:40:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E On top of this, since 1.x it\u0027s now HOT at Moho.
