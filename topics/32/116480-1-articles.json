As I understand, the delta-v requirements for Moho landing and return are borderline astronomical (heh), and now you\u0027ve also got to deal with heat management. Eeloo is more of a waiting game: wait for transfer window, and then wait forever to get there even with time warp on. Also, you need RTGs and fuel cells since solar panels are apparently worthless at that distance from Kerbol. I also understand that Eeloo is, for a lack of better way of putting it, kinda boring. Nothing really to see or do there, whereas Moho is much more interesting. So Eeloo would be the easier choice, but Moho the more fun/interesting choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurious what people think; should I go to Moho, or Eeloo next?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T12:25:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEeloo of course!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T12:27:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoho is greater of an achievement to me seeing as it takes me longer to get there and it costs more fuel for me.

The transfer, capture, and landing are all routine. It\u0027s prettier than Dres but that\u0027s about it. So to make the trip worthwhile, you\u0027ll need to come up with some reason to go there other than flags and footprints. Such as the Karbonite Plus mod (Eeloo is one of the few places you can mine it). Or send a rover and circumnavigate the place--it\u0027s reasonably good rover country.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA trip to Moho, however, is far from boring. The huge dV requirement comes not from landing (Moho\u0027s gravity isn\u0027t THAT strong) but from the transfer and capture. If you don\u0027t do a good transfer, it\u0027s quite possible to enter Moho\u0027s SOI and find you need 6000-7000m/s just to capture (on top of the transfer and plane-change dV). This is what normally happens when you try to go to Moho direct from LKO like you would any other planet. It\u0027s this cost to capture that is the main trouble with Moho.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo avoid the massive capture burn cost, you can use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/61478-Oh-bugger-Injection-burn-at-Moho?p=835667\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post835667\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMoccollo\u0027s Method\u003C/a\u003E. Another trick (which I\u0027m currently testing myself) is to gravity brake off Eve en route to Moho, like the real probe recently did. In any case, forget normal transfer windows from calculators. Either leave Kerbin at the specific point mentioned by Maccollo and at no other, or leave on the Eve window and go to Eve first. It\u0027s going to be a longer trip than it might look just based on the distance due to the need to take the time to slow down en route one way or another, so pack a lot of food.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn top of this, since 1.x it\u0027s now HOT at Moho. If your ship already gets bothersomely hot just running the engines, expect real trouble doing long burns at Moho. It\u0027s probably a good idea to have radiators.
