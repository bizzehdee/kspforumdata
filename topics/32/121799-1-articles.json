I was pretty curious thanks to a recent RL career change, so decided to play EMS in sandbox to see how it felt. And oh a friend of mine, who did the narration for the below parody video, suggested I make some references to the old \u003Cstrong\u003EEmergency!\u003C/strong\u003E TV show!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo explore this topic in the name of fun and giggles, I constructed an air ambulance out of an existing Minmus surface base module and used a new building added in recently released \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/82785-1-0-4-Kerbin-Side-%28v1-0-5%29-Supplements\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbin-Side Kampus\u003C/a\u003E as a hospital.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was in for quite the surprise. It was very fun - Time constraints, having only 30 seconds of reserve fuel, lives in danger, impossible landing on a mountainside, all in a day\u0027s work! Except Jeb did not think it was so fun. He was meant to have \u0027simulated\u0027 having spinal injuries but in the course of production actually ended up losing all motor function! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the scenario, Jeb and his girlfriend embarked on a road trip to the \u0022Central African\u0022 mountains and managed to spontaneously overturn his 1989 Ford F-150 replica. An AL-5 air ambulance on standby at the Kampus Hospital helipad was sent to retrieve them while Jeb threatened to post about his \u0027faulty\u0027 truck all over the Kerbal equivalent of Jalopnik. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/RmIkxfk8RFQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter no small effort to maneuver what is indeed a space station module with tiny wings and huge engines onto rather treacherous sloping ground (required creative use of nacelle angles), one of Valentina\u0027s many sisters attempted to stabilize the casualty; Jeb having suffered spinal injuries during the crash. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn his zombified state was not able to climb up the short ladder into the ambulance\u0027s side door so was unceremonially shoved inside and off she goes! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EFull disclosure: The cripple could either stay there and get roasted by the afterburners, or use the \u0027dishonorable\u0027 revert function, so revert it was to simulate being shoved into the ambulance anyway!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe air ambulance raced back to KSC at transonic speeds to generate cool visual effects, landing on the hospital roof with barely 5% of fuel remaining; it might have just been a 50km rescue but turboramjets are not exactly the most economical of engines and I couldn\u0027t use basic jets as they don\u0027t generate enough thrust to be useful in this application.
