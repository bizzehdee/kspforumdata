This means that, unless kerbals RCS was developed before any rockets, kerbals built rockets, almost out of instinct. No third law means no calculating velocities and such, so can we presume our dear green friends do such things out of instinct. It would not seem out of place with their ideal characteristics for rocketry and being a pilot in general.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscuss.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OtherDalfite","CreatedById":8317,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T13:20:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, we presume the laws of physics without thinking about it.
