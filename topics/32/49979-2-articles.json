While I\u0027ve never had a Kessler type incident, I do try to stay on top of debris and get rid of it (regularly de-orbiting or terminating it), I have had three accidents worth noting. As I started construction on the space station I brought up sub-assemblies and docking them into a space station. I also brought up Fuel, Oxidizer and RCS Fuel to keep the stations tanks topped up docking the tanker then un-docking and de-orbiting. As well I would bring up ships bound for deeper space and refuel at my station. A couple of times with outbound ships I undocked, used a little RCS to start moving off, then would go into MAP to plot the next manuever (even though I used mechJeb, I found the map display useful, if fatally distracting) because not once, but twice turned on full thrust from there without checking outside MAP what was in front of my space crafts nose, this resulted in collisions, once at more than 50m/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter I was satisfied with my LKO station I decided I wanted to build a deep space craft (a super tanker/station that could fly to Jool with a bunch of landers and rovers), so when I started building that, it was attached to my space station. Soon the complexity of the combined object had maxed out my processing power and ram and I decided to separate them. I moved them just outside the limit of the [ and ] swap keys and the processing power demanded seemed much lower. However, I still managed a collision between a tanker bound for my station under rendezvous autopilot with my deepspace craft, it did enough damage to make me relaunch half of the major core, luckily as I had made the two halves symmetrical I had kept the design of the craft in my VAB files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a picture of the ship and station when they were still docked:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SeRgqnM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SeRgqnM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aragosnat","CreatedById":60487,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T21:46:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot yet.
