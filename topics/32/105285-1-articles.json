Ignore:\n\n*I\u0027m finding the vacuum-engine nerf to be really perplexing, particularly when looking at the thrust numbers. I thought the poodle was pretty under-utilized as it was, and now it has a quarter of its former thrust. The 48-7S only lost half its thrust (no change in mass), while the 909 lost about 70% of its thrust (also no change in mass). Considering the 48-7S was the one usually heralded as having the most over-powered TWR, I\u0027d say it\u0027s strange that it was nerfed less in TWR than the others.*\n\n*Most of the \u0022lifter\u0022 engines were tweaked by around 6-30%, thrust-wise, though the \u0022Mammoth\u0022 quad engine gained 546 thrust, plus 5.25 tons. Meanwhile the KR-2L lost about 60% of its thrust, while gaining 2 tons.* \n\n*So to me, it looks like the devs aimed for similar \u0022difficulty\u0022 to orbit as before, while making sure we get much longer burn times for orbital maneuvers, and more tricky lander design constraints.* \n\n*As an amusing aside, I remember them buffing up the ion engine recently, for the sake of fun.
