This seemed like far too\u00A0great a number (and rendered efficient mining impossible), so I hyperedited my lander into a 10,000x10,000 orbit and commenced landing operations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding took, near-as-makes-no-difference, 1,000m/s of dV. Proper suicide burning could probably get that down to 850 or so, although I\u0027ve yet to locate the suicide burn calculator on MechJeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter (yet again - in my defence, this was a test run and I didn\u0027t feel like waiting months for the drill to work)\u00A0hyperediting in a full 3,000 units of ore, I commenced the ascent, convinced that my lander - now stuck with only 1,016 m/s of dV - wouldn\u0027t make orbit. However, despite hugely inefficient burning and accidentally winding up on a 30-degree orbital tilt\u00A0(I need more TWR on my lander), I still managed to ascend\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0higher than thought - into a roughly 40,000x29,000\u00A0orbit (like I said, it was a pretty crude burn). Magic!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, it seems that Vall is significantly more practical for mining operations than previous. If you plant your refinery in low orbit (say, 30,000x30,000) you won\u0027t have too many woes bringing ore back at a profit. Additionally, whether due to more precise measurement or simply due to changes in how the game calculates things since the 1.0 release\u00A0(although the latter seems unlikely to me), the net dV requirement for Vall landing/ascent is only 1,850m/s or so, much lower than previous indications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe trip used a total of 4,800 units of fuel; I suspect that a bit more practice could shave off 300 units of fuel, give or take. The return offers 6,000 units of fuel, thereby giving an approximate net gain of 1,500 units of LFO per trip. While not outrageously practical - you\u0027ll need to mine a lot of fuel to get anything back to Kerbin - this does prove the viability of Jool-system mining\u00A0landers, which I\u0027ve seen a lot of people dismiss as impossible or impractical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, does anyone have a more practical way of mining fuel within the Jool system? I considered a Pol or Bop-based lander, but both of took so much dV to reach and get back from that you\u0027d never successfully provide enough fuel for system exploration. And what\u0027s the most ore you can \u0027bring back\u0027 in a single trip?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-31T04:54:24Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2016 04:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by March Unto Torment\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blaarkies","CreatedById":153700,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-31T06:20:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222484464\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022135470\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221459400009\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022149317\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022March Unto Torment\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, March Unto Torment said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n... in a full 3,000 units of ore, I commenced the ascent, convinced that my lander - now stuck with ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is doing it the hard way.
