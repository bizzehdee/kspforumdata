It sounds counterintuitive, but a reentry from a 71x71 km orbit is hotter and has higher g-forces than one from a 71x500 km orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt works that way because on a very shallow reentry, your vertical speed starts off low, making sure you spend an eternity in the upper atmosphere that heats you up without slowing you down significantly; and then vertical speed increases over time, so by the time you get into the dangerous parts it is so high that you \u0022lose altitude faster than you can slow down\u0022. This causes a lot of extra shock heating and a very late, harsh deceleration. Meanwhile, when you come in from a high apoapsis, your vertical speed starts off high, letting you blitz through the upper atmosphere; and when you approach periapsis, your vertical speed actually decreases, letting you go almost level in the middle part of the atmosphere where you can slow down easily without getting much heating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are playing stock KSP and your reentry vehicle is a mk1 command pod, you may even be able to survive a direct munar reentry without a heatshield because of this.
