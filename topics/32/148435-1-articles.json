The payload/skycrane proportions are also fairly representative of the real thing, i.e. the payload is usually a little wider even. I did test them on the launchpad -- delivered the payload to the nearby field and flew off (to my doom). I.e. they have way too much thrust to weight for most real missions as they can fly even under Kerbin gravity. The rover sizes are also similar to what I really use; the light one would be a prospector/science rover, the heavier one could be a mining station module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth are Twitch-powered: the very light one has two, the heavier one has six, and can only fly in Kerbin gravity with less than full fuel load. Under Mun gravity the heavier one could make do with three Twitches easily (including a full fuel load), while the light one could use Spiders -- four would certainly get the job done but it might work even with only two. Other than that, there\u0027s nothing there you can\u0027t see; the stack separator has the ejection force set to zero so your crane won\u0027t fly off when it separates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qTlPWUH.jpg\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qTlPWUH.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qTlPWUH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jnljJz7.jpg\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022jnljJz7.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jnljJz7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the helpful tips \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/167629-brikoleur/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022167629\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/167629-brikoleur/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Brikoleur\u003C/a\u003E!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
