I disconnect from the transfer stage, which has a probe core (a HECS), batteries, an antenna and solar panels. It\u0027s definitely a legitimate probe at that point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I then switch to the lander... the probe disappears. Poof, no longer in game. If it\u0027s still within physics range, I can switch to it, but it does not appear on the map, and cannot be chosen as a flyable vehicle from the tracking station. It just disappears. This, as you might guess, would make it difficult to get back to Earth. Luckily I had a recent save point that I could reload to try different things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter trying various solutions (including restarting), I tried to rename the vehicle, and reclassify it from being a \u0022relay\u0022 to a \u0022probe\u0022), now it works. I can switch to the lander, and the transfer stage\u00A0stays in the map view, and is a real, live vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022t8UC4ui.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022655\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/t8UC4ui.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the transfer stage and lander still connected, and I think you can see that it is all legit.
