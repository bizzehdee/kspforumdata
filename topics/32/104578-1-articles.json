Keep in mind that the 2.9979x10^8 m/s thing only applies to light in a *vacuum*. It\u0027s slower by a factor of the index of refraction in a medium. Typical fiber is around 1.44-1.45 index of refaction, giving you 70% of c. That\u0027s comparable to the signal propagation in a good copper wire (hundred-billion year old thicknet coax ethernet is also 70%, as a comparison).\n\n![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) I\u0027ve never heard of any fiber layer-1 designs that operate at 40/8. You probably have a DSL or cable solution, with fiber to the neighborhood or curb. \n\nFiber is generally only used in networking because it requires fewer repeaters (and it\u0027s easier to stuff multiple signals down the same wire). It\u0027s otherwise extremely delicate, bulky, dangerous and costly, and not used in other areas. That\u0027s why even actual fiber-to-the-premises end with a media converter that goes to E100/E1000. Nobody in their right mind would want a fiber-ethernet network unless their prem is HUGE or they like laser blindness. And even then, the fiber would be converted to electrical ethernet before it went into workstations/servers.\n\nThere\u0027s more to an internet connection than your last mile.\n\n1. Are you using wifi in the house? Wifi is absolute garage. The old 10-megabit ethernet standards (invented before time even existed) are competitive with the most MIMOest, modern wifi garbage (invented ten years from now). Heck, you could probably spank some wifi with half-megabit tokenring in certain limited applications.\n\n2. How well-provisioned is your neighborhood? Are they serving ten thousand customers off of a Cisco 1604/1605 with a T1 for a backhaul? Is the QoS gear (if any) capable of keeping up with demand?\n\n3. How\u0027s the infrastructure inside your ISP? Fully mesh network? Any packetloss on the transit routers? \n\n4. How\u0027s the secondary infrastructure at your ISP? DNS etc (I actually run my own full DNS server as my ISP, which is otherwise scoring fairly well in the technical areas, absolutely fails at DNS and billing)?\n\n5. How\u0027s the connectivity to other ISPs? Are the border gateways decent, or are they 1604s with T1s again? Are they peering with other providers that have your destination in them, or are very close to the destination?\n\nA lot of these questions are hard to answer, or are very conditional. Problems in the 3-5 range can cause services A and B to work fine but C to mysteriously fail. (problems 1 and 2 tend to result in everything blowing up, or at least anything that needs any significant traffic)\n\nAs an example, I generally don\u0027t have any problems with twitch or youtube (well since google overhauled it), even with my \u0027rusty old\u0027 15/10 copper connection.\n\nDid I mention wifi is trash garbage, and that furthermore it\u0027s utterly worthless and stupid, and also garbage and designed by idiots (do I have to mention WEP?)? Also that it\u0027s garbage. And trash. And rather rude words that would probably get filtered. Also trash.\n\nWifi is trash is what I\u0027m saying. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nI\u0027m not just a programmer, I\u0027m also a CCNA. Who hates wifi. Even if wifi is traveling at 99% of the speed of light, it still adds a minimum of 3ms to every hop (air is a lot clearer than glass).\n\nTL;DR: last mile bandwidth is about 5% of the equation. Fiber isn\u0027t faster, it\u0027s just longer (which is good for long range communication for obvious reasons). Wifi sucks."}]}
