I don;t have a single rocket all of which worked beautifully in .9 that does not tip early immediately of as I ascend. The yaw controls do not work properly neither does SAS. It does not respond to the controls and I cannot stop the tipping. Very frustrating. If they don;t fix this I\u0027m sadly finished with Kerbal. I watched Manley\u0027s video and frankly I can;t understand how he was able to control his rocket. None of mine are presently controllable. Also the extensive space station I built can no longer be flown since when I go to mission control and highlight it and the fly button never lights. they ruined this game frankly.\n\nSo what you\u0027re saying is it\u0027s you, not Kerbal."},{"CreatedByName":"Heart Under the Mountain","CreatedById":102910,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T03:50:29Z","Content":"After making my post, a number of ships in transit, and in orbit around Eve and Duna spontaneously exploded (Some of those ships I haven\u0027t accelerated or even touched in days to weeks so it must be some strange glitch on the atomic engines I can\u0027t explain. I have no idea why they just randomly exploded since they were just floating in orbits or drifting for hundreds of days, to over a year, towards their SOI targets while I worked on new ships at home).\n\nFortunately I had reserve funds, and time before mission deadlines, so that the losses weren\u0027t completely devastating. But I did lose almost all of my higher level Krebs in those ships/stations and a fortune in parts and fuel that were intended to return after mission completion.\n\nI\u0027ve just decided to completely eliminate the LV-N from my space program for now. Learning to use other engines with higher consumptions isn\u0027t impossible, and I\u0027ve managed a few good designs that require fuel hauler meetings in orbit to refuel, as well as fuel hauler launches to intersect the same planets for prolonged missions, but they can make it to targets and back without a great deal of difficulty, although at a much greater cost than my LV-N fleet had allowed. \n\nIt would be nice to see some heat sinks, radiators, refrigerants, or liquid cooling systems added though, if heat is now to be a more critical consideration. I tried builds attaching more parts to the engines, they didn\u0027t seem to help with the heat much except for using KAS parts that have higher heat tolerance. But right click options should also show level of heat in parts. Without it I can\u0027t really tell if my builds are in fact helping to redistribute heat, or by how much. And having the above cooling options, as well as the temperatures of parts displayed, would be a reasonable next step if they\u0027re making heat such a limiting factor now.\n\nThank you for your reply and links though, I will check them out and see if they\u0027ll help my still unexploded ships, stations, and bases to survive. Right now I have a bunch of Kerbs I evacuated, after the chain of losses, floating around in EVA orbits or standing around on planets and moons so they don\u0027t spontaneously combust lol."},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T08:02:58Z","Content":"Well now I\u0027ve officially gotten down and dirty with 1.0.2, and its not bad.

Plus shores and grasslands if you are willing to go a bit further. Planes can get highlands easily too.\n\n20 Science! per experiment, per biome... that is enough to get going.

Two things in particular that they did which are big steps up, IMHO:\n\n1. Greatly diversify the tech tree. It soaks up a lot more science to max everything out.\n\n2. Change contracts so that they\u0027re mainly just about money-- they give practically no science. You get science from doing \\*science\\*.\n\nThe thing I really disliked about career mode previously was that all the grinding I had to do to make the money caused so much science as a side-effect that there was no reason left over for me to actually go out and \\*explore\\* stuff! The collateral science from contracts, combined with the narrower tech tree, meant that I \u0022pegged the meter\u0022 and had everything up to the \u002290 science\u0022 limit researched, with science piling up and nowhere to spend it, until I finally earned enough cash to upgrade the science facility.\n\nThat part is fixed now, and I like it much better. If I want science, I gotta do science. Kudos to that.\n\nThat said: I agree that there\u0027s a certain amount of \u0022grindiness\u0022-- in particular, the upgrade costs to the science facility (and, to a lesser degree, the VAB) are so huge that it does turn into a grind for me.
