Physics class, don\u0027t fail me now...\n\nAs pressure increases, temperature also goes up because of the reduced amount of space that the liquid or gas or what have you will be compressed. I think that Eve\u0027s oceans could be liquid as the atmosphere is pushing down on the oceans, preventing it from freezing. I dunno though, I better let someone with a diploma check the facts, that\u0027s just my theory."},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T15:07:22Z","Content":"1.

If the oceans were to be made of rocket fuel, I see no reason for the planet to blow up without the presence of a comburant (an oxidizer). And there are no hints of any oxidizing agent on Eve really.

Sunlight passes through more air at sunset than at noon.\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering)\n\n\u00225 atm=2.24 times the air for light to pass through (from google)\u0022\n\nI don\u0027t know what you googled, but that is not even close to right.\n\n\u0022so the atmosphere must be kerbinlike.\u0022 - No, for the above reasons. You are really jumping to conclusions here.\n\n\u0022if it is, there is at least 1 atm of oxygen mixed in to the air,\u0022 \n\nIts not, and even if it was \u0022kerbin-like\u0022, we don\u0027t know how alike it is... maybe its mainly N2, just like Earh (and presumably Kerbin) have mainly N2 atmospheres.\n\n \u0022a fire with rocket-fuel oceans would mean the planet should have had exploded already. but it didn\u0027t so it\u0027s not rocket fuel.\u0022\n\nThere are alternatives other than rocket fuel or water, and its quite clear that the atmosphere does not contain oxygen.

Increasing the pressure (and the pressure is very high) further decreases the freezing point.\n\nSo in summary:\n\n\\* The temperature scan results shouldn\u0027t be relied on as far as \u0022game canon\u0022\n\n\\* There is nothing to say that temperature occurs at the poles (go find evidence if it bugs you that much)\n\n\\* The atmosphere does not contain oxygen so it could be a hydrocarbon, or a variety of other substances\n\n\\* At high enough pressure and salt concentrations, it does seem you can get water to be liquid at -40 (at least very high pressure[very high, much higher than 5 atm] can depress the freezing point by 20 degrees, and very high salt can also do that, I don\u0027t know if the effects are additive)\n\nOk?\n\nI\u0027m more interested in the flats of Minmus myself.... what are those... how did they form? why does it have no craters?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-09T15:36:38Z\u0022 title=\u002204/09/2015 03:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm**"},{"CreatedByName":"Roskerbos","CreatedById":110894,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T15:47:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Else, an iodine compound would make sense and would explain the purple colouration of the atmospere.\n\nActually, more likely a non-polar organic solvent such as hexane, with gaseous iodine *dissolved* in it. Only iodine itself is purple, and in polar solvents, even *it* becomes yellow-orange in colour.\n\nAn abundance of iodine on Eve would further explain the absence of oxygen in the atmosphere, however. Iodides are usually mild reducing agents, and react with oxygen, giving off iodine. Thus the oxygen has been locked in the planet\u0027s crust and a haze of iodine rich gas floats above.\n\nIodine\u0027s compounds can be any colour, and, very often, are no colour at all.\n\n![Kalio%20jodidas.jpg](http://www.hottdealss.com/Kalio%20jodidas.jpg)\n\n*Some potassium iodide, yesterday.*"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T16:30:26Z","Content":"In the SiliskoCanon\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2, Eve\u0027s oceans are filled with Angry Radioactive Death Quicksand.\n\nThe *original* idea was that the oceans were mercury, but that was stupid and impossible.

The colour pallet for the planets is as it is because it looks good and provides visual diversity. If Squad stuck to any notion of accuracy when it comes to light and colour in space, KSP would be almost black-and-white. (For reference see the TV series \u0022Space:Above and Beyond\u0022).

Clouds restrict the amount of sunlight that can get to the surface, and oceans mess with how heat is distributed.
