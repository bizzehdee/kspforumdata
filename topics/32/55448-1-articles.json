The medium dish can block solar panels, and it can only be extended by a probe core if the probe core has power. This way, the on state of one or more probes can be used to change the on state of another probe.

I\u0027m also demonstrating here that there is enough room to place the solar panels of two bits under the shade of one dish, thereby splitting the output signal into two bits, which could be further split again ad-infinitum. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe logic is run by cycling through all the bits and pressing action group 1 to attempt to extend their dish, and whenever it is the case that a bit is running out of power, it\u0027s dish must be retracted. :/ (which is the most glaring problem with the design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7DKzHSb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227DKzHSb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-07T10:26:55Z\u0022 title=\u002212/07/2013 10:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by nhnifong\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-07T10:50:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds quite Kerbal making a computer that only works for about 15 minutes a day \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKudos.
