(Also, to explain the odd numbers to any flux-accountants, the active radiators would steal internal flux from the engine. \u00A0It was indeed producing 14942.53kW for all tests, though.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/tsUx1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EI miss imgur album embeds\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-02-20T15:11:30Z\u0022 title=\u002202/20/2018 03:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 20, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Archgeek\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-18T07:17:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA while back I seem to recall Rapier engines had overheating issues.
