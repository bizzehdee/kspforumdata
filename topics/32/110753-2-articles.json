Even kickbacks don\u0027t do much for really big rockets.\n\nThankfully, 2 out of 3 of these things are really really easy to implement with just text file editing... which also means it wouldn\u0027t take much work at all for them to become stock.\n\nThe LF only tanks could use a reskin to be visually distinguishable (assuming they aren\u0027t the same part, but with something like that fuel switcher mod).\n\nThe ducted fan engine-\u003E I just use the basic jet from .18. The basic jet has had an art change... so the old one is free to be used.\n\nHandling the intakes is a bit more clumsy - as they need to supply a different resource than IntakeAir - but you don\u0027t want 2x the drag (although you can put 2 intake modules on the same intake, and then just close the one for the type you aren\u0027t using... but this is a clickfest when using multiple intakes.\n\nI find it best to use seperate intake parts... which means either they\u0027re not visually distinguishable, or you have to use an old part model (of which, there\u0027s the old ram, circular, and inline intakes)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T10:09:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t think you guys are completely getting the point of this thread.
