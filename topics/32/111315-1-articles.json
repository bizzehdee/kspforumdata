Then pitch up 20-30 degrees and you see what I mean, it\u0027s like pulling the handbrake!"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T01:26:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I feel that high atmosphere has more drag than in 0.9 for aerobraking.\n\nThat is because there actually *is* a \u0022high atmosphere\u0022. In 0.90.0 the atmo basically stopped past 45 kilometers. Now it stretches all the way to 70 km, though it is rather thin, but it still affects your orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T02:08:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Has anyone else noticed that solar panels don\u0027t break as easily while flying through the atmosphere in 1.0?

I\u0027m guessing it is some dynamic pressure threshold, so that speed squared and density are the main factors."}]}
