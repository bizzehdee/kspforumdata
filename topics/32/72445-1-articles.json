To do this, I actually had to figure out what Kerbal population densities might be relative to Earth\u0027s, based on their physical stature in regards to their planetary radius. And, as it turns out, Kerbals are HUGE...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome numbers I was working with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The Kerbol system (Kerbin and the other planets) is a bit less than 1/10th scale the real solar system. Kerbin has a radius of 600 km, whereas Earth has a radius of 6,353 km)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Stock Parts, are at 64% scale of their real-world counterparts. The Kerbals themselves, however, only stand at about 0.75 meters tall according to the Wiki- which means there are 42.23% the height of the average American male in his twenties (177.6 cm), for a comparison. So, rounding down a bit as Americans are a little taller than the average human (due in large part to the average height in Asia), let\u0027s say Kerbals are about 40% the size of a modern-day human male...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, \u003Cstrong\u003EKerbals are a bit over FOUR TIMES the size of a human relative to his environment! If a Kerbal were scaled to Earth, he would stand over 7 meters (22.97 feer) tall!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis meant for my asteroid-impact casualty-estimates, I needed to divide casualties by 2.5- as larger creatures have lower population densities... It also mean though, that \u003Cstrong\u003Edespite Kerbals appearing cute and tiny, they are actually HUGE compared to their environment!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. Oh, and by the way, applying the 10x scale to a Class C asteroid, you get a 70-100 meter asteroid instead of a 7-10 meter asteroid. The Tunguska asteroid was in this size range (60- 190 meters according to Wikipedia, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event\u003C/a\u003E), and it wiped out trees over a land area of more than 2,150 sq. km! It also entered the atmosphere by a *VERY* shallow re-entry trajectory, and so its explosive force when it airburst was \u0022only\u0022 that of 10-15 Megatons of TNT, instead of the average of 38 Megatons for an 100-meter asteroid entering at a 45-degree angle (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_impact#Frequency_and_risk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_impact#Frequency_and_risk\u003C/a\u003E). You might want to re-think just how \u0022harmless\u0022 a Class C asteroid is next time you see one hurtling towards Kerbin!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.P.S. With the laughingstock that is the current aerodynamics model, asteroids of any size aren\u0027t actually that dangerous- since drag exerted on them scales with their mass instead of their cross-sectional area in the stock model. If you\u0027re running FAR on the other hand, the larger asteroids should be able to reach the lower atmosphere at realistically enormous speeds, as big spheres of rock have very little cross-sectional area compared to their mass... With FAR, asteroids also become exponentially more dangerous as their size increases, like in real life- as the larger ones experience a lot less drag from the atmosphere relative to their mass...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-15T14:51:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2014 02:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SlimeCrusher","CreatedById":105427,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T14:44:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow...

Based on the decreases in the surface area exposed to drag with increasing size, and relative to mass with metallic asteroids, it appears that moderately-large metallic asteroids actually could easily reproduce the kind of spectacular flames in the lower atmosphere for a meteor that are normally only seen in Hollywood and fiction... (We also see flames like these during re-entry of smaller asteroids, most of them the size of grains of sand, in meteor showers...
