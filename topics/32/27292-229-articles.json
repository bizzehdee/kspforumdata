There was still a lot of RCS fuel onboard (probably 80% of the total) so it was much heavier than it was during testing. Everything was going fine, the chutes semi-deployed and put me on course for a landing very close to KSC, and then the chutes fully opened and the probe core (where the chutes were attached) broke off from the topmost RCS tank leaving just the core and the docking port floating down under the chutes and the rest of the ship fell the remaining 500m and exploded.

Jeb got out, walked around for a bit, gathered some science, planted a flag, and got back on board. He then proceeded to lift off and move eastward towards a crater, where he landed again, this time on much flatter terrain. Again, he walked around a bit, planted a second flag, gathered some more science, then got back in for the trip home. Made it home with no problems.
