Some of you may have read this before the great forum oops.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was working on a space station. I wanted to have life pods, but I wanted them to the minimum to do the job, no wasted part count or expensive parts. Basically, a probe core, battery, two solar panels (the flat non-deploying kind), a hitchhiker pod, a few parachutes, minimal RCS jets/fuel, and a few sepratrons. Most of the single items where on the bottom so that I didn\u0027t have to mount pairs of them symmetrically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, time for the first test.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUndock from the space station, use RCS to back away from the space station so that I don\u0027t smash the station just for a test. Aim retrograde and pop the sepratrons. Check periapsis, it\u0027s far enough into the atmosphere that I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll be making it back out of the atmosphere. So far so good. Time warp to hitting the atmosphere, and watch reentry. Pop the chutes. Chutes deploy, and then fully deploy without tearing themselves off the pod. I think I\u0027m just about done. It floats down, and my confidence builds. It hits the water... and blows up. I check the stats. Yup, the hitchhiker pod is weaker than capsules, so it will have to land more gently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo to the VAB, add another parachute. Throw it on a rocket, don\u0027t bother docking it to the station, just put it in a matching orbit and pop the sepratrons. Everything goes fine, it hits the water, and is fine, it just floats. GREAT! Hmmm... but what if it hits land instead of water? I don\u0027t think it will be that much worse, but we should check just to be sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERelaunch, and repeat. Manage to time the sepratrons so that I\u0027m coming in over land. Excellent, the test will be a success, even if the life pod isn\u0027t. Parachutes deploy. Pod comes down gently. Touches down, no explosions, YAY! Oops, it fell over because all the small stuff on the bottom of the pod. No biggie... wait, it\u0027s starting to roll downhill. It\u0027ll stop when it hits a radially mounted sepratron, right? Crunch... nope. Ooh, we\u0027re rolling faster. We\u0027ve basically developed the orbitally deployed wheel and forgot the breaks. OK, so they may get sick, but they\u0027re alive, right? Rolling even faster, bottom of the hill is coming up, I\u0027m thinking it will roll half way up the next hill. And again, I\u0027m wrong, it\u0027s going so fast that the slight bump at the bottom of the hill causes the pod to explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this, my friends, is why Kerbals should follow NASA\u0027s lead and have high speed cameras filming everything.

Today I tried again and flight went nicely and I got close after 30 minutes of flying and rendezvousing. Then I was 500m away when I noticed that monopropellant is very close to end. I decided that I will move whole space station to my new module because it got fairly big engine because there was supply trips going. Everything went fine and 40 meters before docking music stopped. I looked at altimeter and saw that I hit atmosphere and noticed that I somehow ended to very low orbit. I did emergency boost to my space station and got it back to orbit around 100 km, but I have to start launching new module again. Without music I would probably noticed later and would have ditched my whole space station to kerbin. I also use quicksafe, but I safed often because I think it was safe and quickload didn\u0027t help in this case. I am also beginner so docking attempt will always take something like hour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short: My own mistakes failed docking, but music of KSP saved entire space station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
