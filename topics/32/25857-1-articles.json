For the first launch of this probe I\u0027m sending it to a direct Kerbol collision course and I managed to get into a direct dive with the nuclear stage and the ion stage still full. The next one of these will be launched at the next Eve transfer window to use Eve for a powered slingshot for a low as possible Kerbolar orbit before circularising. The sun shield at the front provides protection to the rest of the probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i44.tinypic.com/4lq1xi.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224lq1xi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i40.tinypic.com/2dr6usj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222dr6usj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i39.tinypic.com/v6rhpe.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022v6rhpe.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i43.tinypic.com/2m4vakz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222m4vakz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T10:41:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a very straight trajectory!

Can someone with a geostationary satellite confirm? If I understand correctly when you switch to surface mode on a geostationary satellite it should read somewhere close to 0m/s, hence geostationary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that\u0027s correct then my 197,430.2m/s surface velocity can be divided into only two components:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. My orbital velocity of 430.8m/s going straight at Kerbol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Kerbol\u0027s sidereal rotational velocity, let\u0027s call it Xm/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I\u0027m going straight at Kerbol the equation is simply:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E197432.2^2 = 430.8^2 \u002B X^2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince 197432.2^2 is so huge compared to 430.8^2, we can say X is pretty much 197,432.2m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the ion stage, the probe is a prototype for upcoming low kerbol orbit probe, I figure I\u0027ll just use it for impactor experiment rather than designing a new probe for that job. Using the prototype will allow me to get an idea on how much electricity I can get close to Kerbol.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
