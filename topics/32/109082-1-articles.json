NO WAY! A glance to the staging on the left shows my three parachutes are in fact there.. so now I\u0027m confused.\n\nSo I stage anyway and get ready for my impending doom. But lo and behold, at 500m, my craft slows to 7m/s!! ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)\n\nSo I zoom in to look at the craft and try to figure out what happened and got this beautiful site!!\n\n![cuUhqW4.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/cuUhqW4.jpg?1)\n\n![zs7yLFE.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/zs7yLFE.jpg?1)\n\nThat landing though! ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n![8TzC5Hs.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/8TzC5Hs.jpg?1)"},{"CreatedByName":"Screeno","CreatedById":141893,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T20:02:34Z","Content":"Hahaha that\u0027s a hilarious glitch XD"},{"CreatedByName":"impwarhamer","CreatedById":80499,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T20:06:30Z","Content":"do you have tweakscale or something?
