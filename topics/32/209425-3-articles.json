This is important for your performance. Also, make sure your SSD is connected to preferably a native SATA600 controller, which is usually the lowest numbered SATA port on your motherbord. Do not, and this is critical for performance, use any SATA600 port controlled by a seperate chip, often something from Marvell.

I would shy away from those (including all the Vertex 1, 2, 3 and 4\u0027s and other OCZ series), since they have had major problems in the past and actually still have. The only Sandforces that might be reliable are the Intel ones, but just to be sure I would even avoid those. A lot of dead disks, corrupted data and other problems. Every time a fix is promised, but every time there still are problems. The specifications are lies too, since they are based on benchmarks with just zeros. Due to the data compression that Sandforce SSD\u0027s apply those kind of benchmarks make the disks look very good, but in reality it\u0027s bogus since no one writes only zeros and the disk is much slower with real data - often slower than the competition. A lot of people are fine with their Sandforce SSD, but a lot of them are having major problems. Do you want to participate in a crap shoot?
