I\u0027ve been doing that long before, being careful to place them as symmetrically as possible and as few as necessary(especially with career and parts costs).\n\nStruts are not a game-only implementation. They see plenty of use in the space program, or did at least when the shuttle fleet was in operation, and they do see use on the ISS. They just weren\u0027t used as visibly or generously as they are used in KSP. If you do have to use more struts because of a crazy build...then use more boosters. That is our mantra, after all."}]}
