My carrier craft have all the airbreathers, but those air breathers are all rapiers that go into closed cycle to boost the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E higher and get the orbiter even closer to orbital speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo it occurred to me... the unloaded carrier craft may be able to achieve orbit on its own with no orbiter. So, I started working on a new mission profile:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCarrier goes suborbital, orbiter gets to orbit with good fuel reserves. Carrier lands, refuels, and goes back to orbit with basically no fuel left. Orbiter and carrier rendezvous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this case, I get the entire craft to orbit (like an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E), but its more like 3 stages, and 2 things get to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the orbiter is carrying a detachable payload... this can be carried even further. 2 stage to orbit: decouple payload (Staging event?). Land orbiter and carrier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 stage to orbit again, Orbiter (with more fuel) redocks with payload, carrier lands and refuels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCarrier SSTOs, and redocks with orbiter plus payload. If the payload is a fuel tank, this can give the entire setup a substantial \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E margin.

In total I used 4 stages on the grand tour mission and 5 stages on the 100 Kerbals to Eve mission getting all stages back to Kerbin even all the Eve stages. The extra stages are because I did not intially plan to recover the grand tour lower stage from Eve and because I had to launch an additional adapter for the 100 Kerbals mission due to a design mistake. But in principle these two missions could be performed with three stages. The trick with Eve was to launch from the highest point and to do a suborbital catching maneuver.
