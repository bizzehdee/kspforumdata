When I play Grand Theft Auto, I frequently go many hours without stealing a car or shooting anyone, instead just getting out of bed, driving around in a car I bought on the in-game internet, maybe getting a haircut or buying some clothes, listening to the radio, playing a round or two of golf, BASE jumping off a mountain, and then going back to bed in the evening. In other words, doing nothing I couldn\u0027t, at least in principle, have done in real life. (Well, maybe not the BASE jumping.) For some reason, I find this almost endlessly entertaining.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn Skyrim, I\u0027ve had a few characters where I installed some \u0022hardcore mode\u0022 mods and enforced an \u0022always-walk\u0022 rule. Just \u003Cem\u003Eliving\u003C/em\u003E in the world became an adventure in camping, hunting, and cold-weather survival (and occasionally battling dragons). The mundane aspects of the world were what made it fun, playing that way. Having to worry about things like where to set up camp and whether I had enough firewood, not just random encounters and dragon attacks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore I was into KSP I played a lot of X-Plane, doing things like flying a Zeppelin from Frankfurt to New York in real time (about 50 hours) or a DH.88 propeller plane from England to Australia in a recreation of a 1930s air race. Time warp was an option in that game, but I never used it. The delayed reward of arrival at some distant destination after hours of carefully following rivers and monitoring radio beacons was half the fun. Again, endlessly amusing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess it\u0027s something about the fantasy of living in a slightly more exciting world than real life, or a fantasy version of real life where you can do what you want, take risks you wouldn\u0027t in real life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any case, though, I\u0027d never have put KSP in the \u0022mundane simulation\u0022 category. Although it can arguably be played that way (I certainly try!) on the whole it\u0027s a lot more action-packed than, say, driving an imaginary bus from Tuscon to Vegas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS.
