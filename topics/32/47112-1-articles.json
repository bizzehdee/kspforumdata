If I want to keep a stationary ship from drifting I\u0027ll let it control the reaction wheels sometimes, otherwise time warp is my ASAS (see signature). For that matter, I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever had ASAS use the RCS. It\u0027s like the two are mutually exclusive for me. I\u0027ve docked 80 ton vehicles with less than 120 RCS before because I use timewarp to stop my velocity instead of the highly inefficient ASAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the same time, I realize that timewarp isn\u0027t exactly a realistic feature, and using it as a \u0022kill-all-angular-velocity-for-free\u0022 button might be seen cheating as some. I just value the fact that I can either stop whatever vector change manually or timewarp, and that I\u0027m now completely isolated from the ASAS arguments which were ongoing back when 0.21 came out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, my question to you guys is, what do you use and why? Timewarp, ASAS, or manual-only?
