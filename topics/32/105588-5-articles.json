With this config I was able to get to a 105km apoapsis with a fair bit of fuel left in the upper stage. I took goo readings just below 70km and then again above it, and then did the science Jr. and crew report near apoapsis. The trick to recovering the science Jr. was to use all my extra fuel to do a powered descent, alleviating re-entry heating. I basically waited until I was at about 30km then fired my engines full-throttle, slowing to \u0026lt;600 m/s by around 18km.

From LKO I boosted prograde with the Mun maybe 1.5 Munar diameters above the horizon, to an apopapsis just a bit inside Munar orbit. This put me inside the Mun\u0027s SOI a fair ways in front of and inside of it, which put me on a retrograde trajectory that cleared the Munar surface by about 7000m and put me back in a Kerbin orbit with a periapsis of about 1000km. I had just enough fuel left at this point to drop this periapsis down to around 45km, which after a fairly tedious number of aerobraking passes got me back on the ground safely. The biggest difficulty here was that the heat shield has an alarming tendency to flip the command pod nose-first, something I sure hope the devs will fix.
