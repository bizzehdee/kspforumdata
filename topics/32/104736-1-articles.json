Updates are great when they are in form of \u0022support for some new bit of hardware\u0022, but the mindset of it\u0027s ok to be buggy and send out patches later is really bad. In theory sending out fixes sounds like a good thing, but as is often the case the original lead dev team has moved on so the patches are done by devs who are less experienced with the program. Again in theory that shouldn\u0027t be a problem but it requires two things to ensure that patches don\u0027t actually break the program further; 1) thorough, detailed documentation - every single function is documented, most lines of code have comments. 2) Automated tests which ensure functionality isn\u0027t broken, every single \u0027process\u0027 should be covered by the test suite (as a rule of thumb, every \u0022IF\u0022 needs at least two tests).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese things are requirements for a software system to be considered \u0022production grade\u0022 but I think a great many program fail to meet these requirements.

What scares me a little is the prospect of gameplay changes, but nothing looks critical. I think I want the time to explore the new world, and maybe a part of that is Squad catching up on the Wiki. If MechJeb and Mod Manager are working, it will be easier for all of us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy cunning plan is to install v1.0 in a different folder, and leave v0.90 untouched for if I get frustrated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s a sort of challenge for you: whenever you think of Jeb as pilot, substitute Valentina on the crew.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flayer","CreatedById":109391,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T14:35:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, from what SQUAD has released so far, I have no doubts that 1.0 will be a properly functioning product. Every feature they have implemented in previous versions seems to be working without any real issues. They have now revamped various features, optimized and fixed certain bugs. I honestly just have faith in their ability to program and their QA department that they will be able to deliver properly functioning features for 1.0. Now, there may be some things that I would consider are \u0027missing\u0027 from a \u0027proper\u0027 space game (life support, communication networks), but even without those features the game that will be released as 1.0 seems like a solid game to me. There is still a lot of content to be had in the stock game.
