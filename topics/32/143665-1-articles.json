It\u0027s any time a ship is under a large enough stress. 4x usually works fine with ions and nukes, but your otherwise perfectly fine ship with more standard engines could easily bend, twist, and in many cases explode under 4x warp. And those that CAN handle 4x warp usually require a lot of care. As in, you better not try to turn. As 4x is a LOT worse than 3x, I can only imagine that 8x would be even worse. Likely more than twice as bad, if you were able to quantify \u0022bad\u0022 in a meaningful way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-13T01:31:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomeone mentioned rovers.
