You can still use ion engines for small orbital adjustments on for example a probe.\n\nSometimes they could even come in handy when needing extremely small burns, like when adjusting for aerobrake long before you reach sphere of influence of a planet."},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T18:22:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yea, that\u0027s about it. It did seem to work like that but it doesn\u0027t now.
