Does rep gain go way down the closer you get to 1000?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, is there a spot in the gui to see the actual number of rep you have instead of just the top graph?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-19T18:45:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReputation distribution gets kind of weird. It\u0027s not linear like science or funds, I\u0027ve noticed that much. Certainly I should have hit 1000 reputation ages ago on my latest save, but it\u0027s currently stuck somewhere around 900 to 950. You can view your actual reputation up to 950 by trying to start the Aggressive Negotiations contract at 100%, as that requires 950 reputation to run at 100% and tells you how much you currently have if you don\u0027t meet that requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-19T19:16:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen exactly did it say \u002B0 rep?
