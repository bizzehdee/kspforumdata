I built up my core, with an included command center, and tossed it on my heavy launcher to see if I could get it into orbit. I could, with plenty of fuel left over, but there are a few issues with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Firstly, there\u0027s no RCS. I couldn\u0027t find room for nine parts for a typical RCS twin-ring complement and a tank, so I left it off. It\u0027s going to be oriented in a polar direction, so docking with it shouldn\u0027t be an issue - docking to something passive is how we dock in KSP anyway - but I just figured I\u0027d mention it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Again, because of the part count, there aren\u0027t any lights. That\u0027s not a huge deal, but it\u0027s mildly irritating to dock with something that\u0027s unlit. I\u0027d need four more parts to light it up properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did manage to include two RTG reactors, as requested. I\u0027m also considering leaving it attached to its original launcher, or what made it into orbit, anyway - that way, it can be moved if necessary, and there are some solar panels on the orbiter stage. It\u0027s probe-smart, so it can deorbit itself, so what I\u0027ll probably do is provide two files - one with the launcher still attached and one without, so whoever follows me can choose which version they\u0027d like to work with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s attached to a Rockomax node, so there are five open ports available for docking. They\u0027re all Sr. sized, as discussed.

It doesn\u0027t have to be perfectly balanced, either, as long as some of the modules have thrusters and there\u0027s a bit of fuel for \u0027em. Same goes for the lights, it shouldn\u0027t be too difficult for someone to set up a lighting rig.
