Then there were the quirks like having to build the delivery vehicle before the unmanned rover, or your delivery vehicle would have no Kerbals in it. Then there was the bug when you pulled apart a rocket and grabbed the pod, only to have it \u0027stuck\u0027 to the mouse, requiring restarting your build. And of course the \u0027damn, I don\u0027t like the pod I started with, have to rebuild the entire rocket to use a new pod\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this and more has been fixed by simply allowing us to change the main pod. BRAVO! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWant to use your perfectly working heavy lifter? You no longer need subassembly loader. Just load a rocket with that lifter, delete the cargo portion including the main pod, and build your new cargo on top of your proven lifter. This alone saved me hours last night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course a parts saver/loader is still needed, for times when you have a big station built in the VAB, and want to split it up on top of existing lifters, but being able to change the command pod at least negates this need when building new parts with a premade lifter. Command pod changing is the highlight of .20 imo.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aphox","CreatedById":32691,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T20:39:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll of my yes.
