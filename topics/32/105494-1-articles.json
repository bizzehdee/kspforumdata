I discovered to my greatest pleasure that doing inline fairings is now possible, so I had no choice but to make an Apollo style mission fully stock with the new things.\n\nI did it all in stock, and to prove to myself that the aero and reentry are very intuitive, and not even regarding the ISP changes, i went for it, with no F5/F9, in one try, and with Valentina on the controls.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

This was one of the most fun missions I\u0027ve done in this game.\n\nSo, what did you guys do for your first mission in the new 1.0?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T02:54:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 02:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Darkona**"},{"CreatedByName":"Maizel","CreatedById":138286,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T02:56:47Z","Content":"Rentry seems so weird to me.\n\nI launched some simple rockets, And on the way down I keep accelerating until about 20 k alt.

And viceversa. The air at high altitudes isn\u0027t as thick. That\u0027s the whole point of the new aerodynamics, and I think it\u0027s nice. That\u0027s why reentry heat is now important: you won\u0027t slow down as fast before you hit a denser atmosphere.\n\nSomeone correct me if i\u0027m too wrong on this ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T03:01:09Z","Content":"Mine? Just a simple orbital mission with Val.\n\nBut...\n\nMy first career orbit was hilarious. The rocket flipped in the atmosphere, doing a complete 360, and still made it to orbit.\n\nWhat was really weird, though... was that all of my female crews burned up on reentry on the first attempt.

Spent 25 Science for upgrades.\n\nSecond flight using two stage tweaked RT-10, standard 0.9 design, no heat shield, recovered pod and goo canisters only. Reached suborbital goal of 75,000 meters, did experiments, set contract and the altitude, speed, and distance records hidden ones. Total 45 Science and 378,866 funds. Note, Dropping from 75,000 meters is about the limit for no heat shields as well as G force stress. 10 additional contracts have now appeared.\n\nI consider the first two flights highly successful under the new Career."},{"CreatedByName":"Darkona","CreatedById":99172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T00:23:36Z","Content":"I\u0027m going to start a new career right now, because the main mods I use have been updated. \n\nAlso I believe I will need the stock bugfixes for 1.0 dlls, the heatshield thing seems awful.\n\nAnything you recommend putting in before starting a new career? I like mods."}]}
