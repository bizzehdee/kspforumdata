The Saturn V stages were designed with very thin skins that depended on the tanks and their fuel load to help maintain rigidity and structure during launch. NASA engineers were aghast when they first saw the R-7 launcher at the 1967 Paris Air Show. The Russians were picking up the tank from either end with cranes to move it into position. Similar actions with any of the Saturn stages would have destroyed them. The R-7 Tanks were built with thicker materials, which made them less efficient, but easier to transport and move around.\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice to swap out fuel types as we see fit, but I don\u0027t agree with being able to re-partition the tanks. Remember that all of the \u0027parts\u0027 originate from Jebediah\u0027s Junkyard and implicitly come \u0027as is\u0027. It goes against the cobbled-together theme of the game if you\u0027re going in and changing all the parts to precisely what you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI look at it this way, if I want to modify the fuel capacity or ad NOS to my car, I don\u0027t drop out the fuel tank, change its dimensions/add partitions and put it back. I add additional pre-made tanks to the trunk or other open spaces to my car and work on it that way. This is the same approach, but with rocket parts instead of car parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIrrelevant car analogy aside, you must realize that the Saturn V you\u0027re talking about was engineered to achieve a specific mission. I\u0027ve pointed this out before, but the engineers didn\u0027t haphazardly grab a few tanks, duct tape them together, and call it a day. The fuel tank ratios were specifically calculated to achieve it\u0027s mission. In this case, to be able to achieve orbit with the Apollo missions. It was then constructed to those design specifications. Had they realized in the design phase that they, for whatever reason, needed 20% more oxidizer and 20% less fuel in the first stage they would have adjusted the internal tank geometry to accommodate that alteration. They would not have thrown up their arms and said \u0022Well guys, our pre-packaged ACME brand tanks are the wrong size, somebody better tell Kennedy that we\u0027ve got to scrap the moon mission.\u0022 NASA didn\u0027t operate that way, the Soviets didn\u0027t operate that way, and SpaceX doesn\u0027t operate that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, no one is asking for this to be changeable in flight. That would be completely unrealistic, I agree. However, in the design phase (AKA VAB/SPH), there\u0027s no reason that the internal tank geometry couldn\u0027t, and wouldn\u0027t, be modified to suit the particular mission that tank is intended for within the volume limitations of that particular tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, consider the possibilities of using a single tank holding liquid fuel, oxidizer, AND monopropellent as a service module, as was done with the Apollo missions.
