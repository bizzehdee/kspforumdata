To them, proposing something prim and proper like a NASA VAB could be built by Kerbals is ridiculous. Well, I disagree. Take a good look at the parts: at the LV-N engine, at 3-man pod, at the landing legs, at ion engine. Those are cleanly executed pieces of impressive technology. Kerbals are indifferent to safety precautions and are very excited about explosions, yes, but they make an impression of extremely capable and very competent engineers. Sure, we know they probably turned a construction crane into a vomit carousel or raced on bulldozers in the process, but I don\u0027t doubt for one second they can build buildings similar to real ones, and I don\u0027t think it would be out of character for them. Plenty of other stuff like engines is fairly close to how our human rockets look. It\u0027s unfair to mistake Kerbals for Orks from a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CCertain Universe With 40k In The Name,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 or to expect them to build sloppy duct-taped huts. \u003Cp\u003E[snip]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I\u0027m not opposed to having fun at all. For instance, I have nothing against the KSP trailers made by our Pixar-tier magician Daniel Rosas which often depict Kerbals ignoring safety and having good fun. Part of the charm of KSP is the opportunity to take enormous risks, ignore established paradigms and experiment freely, which can often leads to great successes and interesting stories to tell. That is not clashing in the slightest with the fact that you have nice, cleanly made, technologically impressive spacecraft parts available to you, or well-built buildings to assemble your creations in - all without any sign of duct tape, rust or sloppy welding. So, basically, I feel objects in the game should continue to be clean and well-built to be consistent with the existing art style, and I\u0027m convinced reinforcing the widespread opinion of Kerbals being incompetent is very harmful for the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Socke","CreatedById":104842,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-08T05:09:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Daishi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Daishi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHm.
