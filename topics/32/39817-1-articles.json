Since 0.21 I\u0027ve been getting some really strange flickering shadow effects all over the space center. Then tonight I was playing around to see if I could improve my frame rates any.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a fresh install of 0.21.1 from Steam with only MechJeb installed, I used MechJeb to just take the Kerbal X to orbit and then land at the space center. It tried to put down in the middle of the tracks from the VAB out to the launchpad and tipped over. No biggie. I was just playing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, here\u0027s where it gets weird. I EVA\u0027ed my Kerbals and I was seeing the same strange flickering shadows. But then I noticed what appears to be a perfect shadow of a rotating satellite dish falling across the toppled top of the fuel tank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see from the video though that the tracking station is behind the Kerbals and debris of my Kerbal X. You should in no way be able to see a shadow of the tracking station from this angle!
