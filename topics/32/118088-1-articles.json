This accelerates your money earnings to such a degree that I consider it mandatory to be first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You can easily orbit Mun and Minmus, and also dip into solar orbit, within the constraints of the tier 1 VAB and launchpad. Therefore, you want the ability to go on EVA, and the ability to see patched conics, before you bother upgrading your launch infrastructure. The extra science from EVA reports lets you unlock bigger fuel tanks, which keeps the part count down, making the VAB upgrade unnecessary. And patched conics gets you to Minmus much, much easier than more launch mass ever will.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Once you actually want to land on another body, then it\u0027s time to upgrade your launch infrastructure in order to support that. Out of the two buildings to choose from, the launchpad tends to run into its mass limit sooner than the VAB runs into its part count limit, so that one comes first. You\u0027ll probably need both for a really sophisticated manned Mun surface science return mission, but you may be able to get a basic touchdown and return on Minmus, or some one-way probe landers, within 30 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Once landing missions start returning science home with regularity, you\u0027ll be running out of interesting tech nodes to research, so you upgrade R\u0026amp;D next.
