One other thing though, \n\n9. Administration building: Don\u0027t bother even one upgrade till you finish the tech tree or you just have money to throw around."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T08:27:21Z","Content":"I generally follow this order:\n\nMission Control -\u003E Astronaut Complex -\u003E Tracking Station -\u003E Launchpad -\u003E VAB -\u003E R\u0026D\n\nRationale:\n\n- You want to get extra missions as soon as you can, so you can start flying rockets that routinely do multple contracts at once. This accelerates your money earnings to such a degree that I consider it mandatory to be first.\n\n- You can easily orbit Mun and Minmus, and also dip into solar orbit, within the constraints of the tier 1 VAB and launchpad. Therefore, you want the ability to go on EVA, and the ability to see patched conics, before you bother upgrading your launch infrastructure. The extra science from EVA reports lets you unlock bigger fuel tanks, which keeps the part count down, making the VAB upgrade unnecessary. And patched conics gets you to Minmus much, much easier than more launch mass ever will.\n\n- Once you actually want to land on another body, then it\u0027s time to upgrade your launch infrastructure in order to support that. Out of the two buildings to choose from, the launchpad tends to run into its mass limit sooner than the VAB runs into its part count limit, so that one comes first. You\u0027ll probably need both for a really sophisticated manned Mun surface science return mission, but you may be able to get a basic touchdown and return on Minmus, or some one-way probe landers, within 30 parts.\n\n- Once landing missions start returning science home with regularity, you\u0027ll be running out of interesting tech nodes to research, so you upgrade R\u0026D next. Not to mention you want the ability to take surface samples with your landing missions.\n\nAfter that, the order ceases to be important. Though I like to upgrade mission control again quickly, because moar contracts = moar money = faster upgrading everything else. The tier 3 R\u0026D building is very important and absurdly expensive, so even if you\u0027re a long way out from needing it, you might as well start saving as soon as possible. If you then discover that you absolutely need a different upgrade first, such as wanting to get into serious spaceplanes, you\u0027ll have a big pillow of cash to draw from.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-10T08:40:22Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2015 08:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T09:30:29Z","Content":"I actually prefer to upgrade the SPH and runway over the VAB and launchpad... they get you the same limits, and you can launch vertical rockets from the runway by just rotating them in the SPH.\n\nAlso, its a bit easier to get 100% recovery of stuff that separates early... I like to use radially mounted small SRBs with parachutes that deploy right simultaneously with decoupling - they land back on the runway with their decouplers for 100% recovery (I use small SRBs so that they burn out fast, and and before leaving physics range).\n\nThen, once I ave turboramjets, I\u0027m all set for 100% reusable launch vehicles."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T09:50:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 1. Mission Control - more contracts\n\nThis. Not that you need more than two *actual* contracts all the time, but all these \u0022experimental\u0022 parts you are going to test *some day*... once you finally research their nodes.\n\n\u003E 2. Launchpad - That big thing you just built is gonna need a bigger thing to launch from\n\nYou will hit the tonnage limit before you hit the 30 parts limit. BACCs are sufficient for \u0022test on escape trajectory\u0022 and bringing tourists into orbit, but the craft will exceed the launchpad tonnage quite fast.\n\n\u003E 3. VAB - level 2 and no more. the 255 part hard-cap is actually a useful restriction, level 3 is just a waste of Kredits IMHO.\n\nLevel 3 is Custom Action Groups. It\u0027s useful once you start doing really complex stuff, much later into the game. Until then you can still assign unfolding all the solar panels to \u0022Abort\u0022 or toggle the braking engine with \u0022brakes\u0022.\n\n\u003E 4. Astronaut Complex - Freash meat for the Krakken.\n\nYou won\u0027t need more astronauts soon, but EVA equals EVA reports and ground samples, some of more bountiful science sources (plus the scientist can reset experiments, so you need only one materials bay and one Mystery Goo to the Mun for \u0022in space high\u0022, \u0022in space low\u0022 and \u0022Landed\u0022.

Also remember to do EVA reports from high and low kerbin biomes along the way. Return safely from Mun with goo canisters and materials bays.\n\n- at this point, it gets a little grindy because I have the tech to land on the Mun, but don\u0027t have research facility upgraded yet to allow for sample collecting. Why bother landing if you can\u0027t return with samples? Usually I\u0027m still a bit short on funds to upgrade that facility, so I do a few rescue or satellite missions to save up the money needed to upgrade research facility. I call those missions 3A, 3B, etc\n\nMission 4 - launch a 3 kerbal lander to the Mun. Land on Mun at Armstrong memorial, then do a quick hop to another nearby biome to gather science from 2 biomes. return to kerbin.\n\n- spend funds and science unlocking tech tree nodes. grab new contracts as appropriate\n\nMission 5 - launch same 3 kerbal lander to Minmus. Land in multiple biomes to get science and return to kerbin. \n\n- spend funds and science unlocking tech tree nodes. By now, should have unlocked the lab. grab new contracts as appropriate\n\nMission 6 - launch a space station containing a lab into Minmus orbit and launch upgraded lander to Minmus to grab science and fill up lab. Toss a couple scientists into lab and let them crank out science for me.\n\n- from this point forward, I can pretty much do whatever i want. I still have upgrades to do and tech tree nodes to unlock, but the funds and science to do those tasks should be easily generated. I can start sending missions to Duna, probes to Eve and Jool, etc. Ironically, this is usually the point where I start getting bored and just start a new career game."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T14:44:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Astronaut Complex again.
