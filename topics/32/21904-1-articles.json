Click on advanced search, then click on \u0022Search Single Content Type\u0022 even though it appears you are already on that tab. This will give you the option to search by the sub-forum. I usually restrict the search to post titles only and sort by number of replies. If you don\u0027t do at least that much you will find nothing. Without advanced search You could search for \u0022Kerbal\u0022 and none of the results would even have that word in the title. So either use the advanced search here and fiddle with all the settings or just use Google for older stuff\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Abraxas","CreatedById":31998,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-10T18:07:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@ kacperrtka26: I made some screenshots, maybe you know the answer (c; No RCS or SAS was used in the making, also a pic of my solarpanels: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/NA1C4,Dm8mx,wOTAa\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/NA1C4,Dm8mx,wOTAa\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ nhinifong: Thanks for the tip, I already wondered if the search function works properly!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-10T18:09:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you have your engines running, but you can\u0027t hear THEM?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kacperrutka26","CreatedById":18849,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-10T18:11:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe orbit looks fine to me it\u0027s out of the atmosphere, I don\u0027t really get the reason why it\u0027s falling though...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Abraxas","CreatedById":31998,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-10T18:12:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Veeltch: I have no engines, just RCS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@kac: I increased my orbit from 150 to 200 km and it still loses hight... well, the real ISS also loses hight and has to be RCSed up once in the while ^^\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-10T18:14:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing RCS may slightly change your Ap/Pe too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Abraxas","CreatedById":31998,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-10T18:19:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes of course, but I don\u0027t use any of it (nor RCS, no SAS) and still the orbit lowers in minimal accounts\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-10T18:24:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow much height do you lose Abraxas?
