I\u0027ve probably sunk over 100 hours into it so far. I have started from scratch three times. In 0.25, I actually launched the mission and completed every experiment except for those on Kerbin (I [posted about it](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/29533-What-did-you-do-in-KSP-today?p=1645408#post1645408) when I completed everything except the Kerbin system). I had a couple of science planes that I am confident could have done all of the Kerbin experiments as well, but it would have taken a while. I never finished because by that point 0.90 had been out for a while. Since 0.90 added many more biomes, I felt that there was little point in spending hours finishing a mission that was no longer comprehensive.\n\nCurrently, I have finished designing the space-only components for a 1.0 mission. They need a little testing and tweaking, but they are mostly done. I will start on the atmospheric components (the hard part) when Squad settles on an aero model. I worry that I won\u0027t be able to finish before 1.1, but hopefully not too much will be changed and the achievement will still be relevant.\n\nIs this a weird way to play KSP? Yes. Is it obsessive? Check. Is it the most fun I\u0027ve ever had playing a game? ABSOLUTELY.\n\nI will report on any completionist easter eggs I encounter, but I don\u0027t think there will be any.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T04:45:34Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 04:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by a2soup**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rickenbacker","CreatedById":2349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T07:53:08Z","Content":"Doing the full four experiments is MUCH easier if you have a scienctist along.
