I\u0027ve probably sunk over 100 hours into it so far. I have started from scratch three times. In 0.25, I actually launched the mission and completed every experiment except for those on Kerbin (I \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/29533-What-did-you-do-in-KSP-today?p=1645408#post1645408\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eposted about it\u003C/a\u003E when I completed everything except the Kerbin system). I had a couple of science planes that I am confident could have done all of the Kerbin experiments as well, but it would have taken a while. I never finished because by that point 0.90 had been out for a while. Since 0.90 added many more biomes, I felt that there was little point in spending hours finishing a mission that was no longer comprehensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, I have finished designing the space-only components for a 1.0 mission. They need a little testing and tweaking, but they are mostly done. I will start on the atmospheric components (the hard part) when Squad settles on an aero model. I worry that I won\u0027t be able to finish before 1.1, but hopefully not too much will be changed and the achievement will still be relevant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a weird way to play KSP?
