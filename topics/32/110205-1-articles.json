It should be just an annular eclipse. And there should still be some energy flow left at minimum during the eclipse, instead of \u0022blocked by Mun\u0022 and cuts down to a complete zero. My calculation is ~25% (simple 1-(226.67/261.6)^2), but I\u0027m not so sure since I assumed equal distribution of energy on the area of the sun we see, but this assumption may be false. A more reasonable assumption is equal distribution of energy on the surface of Sun, but I don\u0027t know how to calculate that.\n\nAm I missing anything or any stupid calculation mistakes? If not, then I\u0027ll probably feel better about my RT comm network around Kerbin where I forgot to handle eclipses. And probably file a (not-so-important) bug to fix the energy flow?"},{"CreatedByName":"Hotaru","CreatedById":135669,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T07:29:52Z","Content":"Having by coincidence just witnessed a solar (Kerbolar?) eclipse from Kerbin orbit, my observation backs up your calculations:\n\n![0w0A0e8.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/0w0A0e8.jpg?1)\n\nThe Mun is definitely noticeably smaller in diameter than the disc of the Sun, so this is an annular eclipse and at least a little energy should still be sneaking through around the edges. I don\u0027t know about the distribution of energy across the area of the disc, though, so I can\u0027t say if you\u0027re right about the amount of energy. I believe KSP determines an eclipse by where the center of the Sun is, not the edges, so you stop getting electricity precisely halfway through sunrise or sunset--it also doesn\u0027t seem to take into account local topography, which is especially noticeable on Minmus, where I\u0027ve frequently noticed my ships continue receiving power long after the Sun has passed below the apparent horizon."},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T08:21:01Z","Content":"In KSP you loose all power in any eclipse, even if the body in not even visible against the sun.

The glowing ball is just for looks. Therefore if a planetary body obscures part of that ball, nothing happens, but as soon as the center point of Kerbol gets obscured, flare is gone and so is your energy source.\n\nGranted, there are exceptions to this rule which apply when the \u0022shadow mesh\u0022 of the bodies doesn\u0027t match the terrain mesh.
