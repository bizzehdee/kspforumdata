Ram-air effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a standard spaceplane tactic; fly until your air-breathers choke, then kick the rockets in to revive them.

When you do that, your air readout will double (or triple, or quadruple) but the actual air available doesn\u0027t change. It\u0027s just an artefact of the physics compression.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clockwork_werewolf","CreatedById":90749,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T09:05:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYea it\u0027s due to the way time is accelerated in KSP. KSP can\u0027t just double the number of calculation per second as this would fry computers if you ship is bigger than about 250 parts (or what ever number of parts your computer could handle divided by 2). For 4x acceleration it would be about 125 parts. So what the game does is multiply the ingoing and out going numbers. The air coming in gets multiplied by 2-4 times for the air intakes. Now although the engines should be using 4 times the amount (I\u0027m unclear if they use 4 times the air, it could be a bug) The cut off point it still 0.10 air which is really 0.025 in normal time. The random air turbulence in 2-4 times speed makes suing this affect a little difficult in reality.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Epthelyn","CreatedById":57970,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T09:28:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Clockwork_werewolf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Clockwork_werewolf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe cut off point it still 0.10 air which is really 0.025 in normal time.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s where the bugs start to show up; I\u0027m not entirely sure whether that\u0027s actually the case. I\u0027ve had planes perform far better at higher and higher altitudes using physics warp than without, which either means that physics warp is messing with physics in such a way that is beneficial to aerodynamics or something\u0027s wrong with the way air is worked out. It may be the case that the lower limit of intakeAir before flameout doesn\u0027t scale properly and so the engines can run for slightly longer than they otherwise would. However, that only applies to certain aircraft, usually bigger ones with more engines and more intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T10:01:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, that does genuinely sound like a bug to me, though I don\u0027t know whether it\u0027s an actual bug in flight physics, or just with how the IntakeAir is displayed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T12:07:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Clockwork_werewolf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Clockwork_werewolf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYea it\u0027s due to the way time is accelerated in KSP.
