Back in those High And Far Off Days Of Gods And Heroes, Duna\u0027s atmosphere was very analogous to the clich\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9 description of Mars\u0027 atmosphere: \u0022too thin to ignore, too thin to be useful\u0022. Making anything fly at all was a challenge. Being able to control it was a bigger challenge. Being able to land safely was even worse. And then, having made something capable of all that, getting it from the ground on Kerbin to Duna was even harder. I had a challenge thread for making a flying machine for Duna, active for about 2 years, and only about 10 people ever managed to succeed at it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now we have 1.0.2 and it\u0027s a totally different story. Duna\u0027s atmosphere has become the opposite of the clich\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9. Now, it is most accurately described as being \u0022thin enough to ignore completely yet thick enough to fly in effortlessly should you so desire\u0022. It is now exceedingly easy to fly on Duna and I expect, if things remain as they are, that everybody will be doing this as a matter of routine in preferrence to long-range rover trips. Ironic, isn\u0027t it? So many folks whining about how the new aero stuff makes flying difficult, when on Duna it makes it way too easy. So I\u0027ve closed my challenge thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, whatever you think about the 1.0.2 aero stuff on Kerbin, when applied to Duna, it\u0027s not at all a good thing.
