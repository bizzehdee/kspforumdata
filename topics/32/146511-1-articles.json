Flea? Dawn? Spark? Oscar B, toroidal or that tiny MK1 from the beginning of the game? Went with toroidal and four spiders, which made the probe compact, as they lean under the corners of the telescope and don\u0027t extend downwards. Two 400-unit batteries went under the shield of the telescope, after a much deliberation on placement of the round battery brought nothing. Then I decided I\u0027m not sending one, I\u0027m sending three, and launcher design began. Tricoupler? Nah, they won\u0027t fit. Radial? Lame. I decided to use ablator-depleted heatshields as structural elements, separators and node duplicators, and stacked them vertically, I set up staging, covered everything in a fairing, added an extra separator on top to strut the payload to the fairing, then spent another fifteen minutes thinking up a graceful launcher.
