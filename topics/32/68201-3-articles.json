Pointing out how this engine completely outclasses the mainsail is like pointing out how the new five meter cluster engine completely outclasses the single five meter engine. You say the stats put the new engines high above the mainsails because their numbers look better on the screen, this is true when on the launchpad, but the mainsail is still more usable as a launch-from-lander-lifter (i.e., getting off of eve, duna, laythe, tylo, or some other planet). As with the RAPIER engines, yes, they were best for SSTO\u0027s, but they were also the worst at everything else.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T18:03:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SkyRender\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SkyRender\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELet me see if I have this clear.

By \u0022balancing\u0022 Sandbox mode and making everything equivalent, you nerf Career mode\u0027s potential by having zero incentive to actually advance in technology. As it is, you can unlock parts that let you easily access any location in the entire game with well under 2000 science in Career mode, because that\u0027s all it takes to unlock the first tier of 2M parts. There isn\u0027t really any \u0022point\u0022 in progressing further than that in Career mode right now, because everything is \u0022balanced\u0022 for Sandbox mode. But Sandbox mode does not need to be balanced, because it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003ESandbox mode\u003C/em\u003E. By definition, it is supposed to give you ready access to \u003Cem\u003Eeverything\u003C/em\u003E.

By \u0022balancing\u0022 Sandbox mode and making everything equivalent, you nerf Career mode\u0027s potential by having zero incentive to actually advance in technology. As it is, you can unlock parts that let you easily access any location in the entire game with well under 2000 science in Career mode, because that\u0027s all it takes to unlock the first tier of 2M parts. There isn\u0027t really any \u0022point\u0022 in progressing further than that in Career mode right now, because everything is \u0022balanced\u0022 for Sandbox mode.

Yet there was still endless debate about the balance of new parts when they were introduced. So obviously balance in sandbox is a real thing that matters to some players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it might be possible to have progression in career without strictly better parts. If all parts fall on the same TWR vs Isp curve, have the middle of the curve parts exposed first (the general purpose parts), then have the parts closer to the ends of the curve exposed gradually after that (the specialist parts). The higher TWR/lower Isp parts will enable bigger payloads into orbit, while the lower TWR/higher Isp parts will allow delta-V improvements on orbital craft. Yet all those engines would be balanced in sandbox mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus, it is also possible to have progression in the types of parts unlocked. Not having docking ports available limits the early game in some ways, same with solar panels, jet engines, or RCS systems. Unlocking those systems creates progression for the career player while not breaking balance for the sandbox player.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this is just IMHO, and maybe there are flaws in it that I\u0027m missing, which is why I started the career vs sandbox balance thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T19:07:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can see where you\u0027re coming from, but I have a bit of a different perspective (unsurprisingly, huh?).
