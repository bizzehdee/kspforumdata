MechJeb taught me how to get to Minmus. Because of it, I don\u0027t even need it to get there any more. My advice, if you really care about being \u0022good at the game\u0022, use it as a tool, not a crutch. If you don\u0027t care and you just want to have fun, use it as much as you want. I cannot stress this enough: If you\u0027re not having fun using MechJeb, don\u0027t use it. If you can\u0027t have fun without MechJeb, use it as much as you want. The point of the game isn\u0027t to prove how good you are.
