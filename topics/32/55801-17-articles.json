Majiir is doing fantastic work with Kethane and I can only imagine what he\u0027ll be able to accomplish if the devs truly decide to scrap resources altogether. However, as I\u0027ve explained on another thread, mods should not be substitutions for stock gameplay. If they do not enhance features already in the game then they are effectively substitutes for features that either should or should not be added depending on how they mesh with the overall theme of the game, and what they provide to the gameplay directly. Anyone on this forum will be able to explain more eloquently than I how relevant in-situ resource gathering is to real life space travel, and could go at length about all the benefits it would provide to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally think resources gathering would be amongst the heartiest of meat-and-potatoes content the game could provide and getting rid of it is essentially eliminating one of the most potentially interesting features. In light of this there is absolutely no reason for it to not be in the game. Arguments that it is \u0022too grindy\u0022 or \u0022too repetitive\u0022 seem to miss the point that grindy and repetitive does not necessarily mean bad (just look at Minecraft, which essentially boils down to \u0022lift block, place block\u0022). Arguments that it would be too complicated for the new player to grasp are not giving enough credit to the target audience of a game that is essentially about rocket science; we all know there is a base level of ingenuity and wit required to play this game to begin with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt any rate, resource gathering would and should be completely optional to begin with, and would really only have relevance after the tech tree has been completely unlocked (which is currently the weakest thing about career mode). I see resources as an excellent way for players to acquire funds, gain reputation, and create off-planet bases for jumping off to other areas of the solar system. Resource mining could even be a stepping-stone to building and fueling end-game technologies that would let players fly to other star systems and explore whole new sets of worlds (all things that would be available from the get-go in sandbox mode, but need to be earned in career mode).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as using mods to substitute for this basic gameplay, here\u0027s what I think as mentioned \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/61749-Just-what-is-the-community-to-SQUAD?p=841599\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post841599\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tntristan12\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tntristan12\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI honestly feel like no game should rely on a third party outside of the developers and the intended audience in order to reach the state of gameplay it was supposed to be at to begin with. If you will forgive me for indulging in a slippery slope / strawman argument for a moment, a very respected video game analyst named Jim Sterling (you can catch his segment the Jimquisition at \u003Ca href=\u0022www.escapistmagazine.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewww.escapistmagazine.com\u003C/a\u003E) once detailed a phenomenon where triple-A game developers would do an awful job porting console games over to PC with the expectation that third party modders would fix the port\u0027s flaws. That is *not* okay! In my own experience, I could tell you the endless frustration I had playing orbiter because I struggled to sort out all the mods I needed for basic features such as sound, high-resolution textures, EVA, and more extraterrestrial bases, but orbiter gets a pass on that because it\u0027s a free program only done as a hobby to begin with.\u003Cp\u003EBut KSP does not need to, and in fact should not have to rely on third party modders for basic gameplay features! Now, we can argue what constitutes a basic gameplay feature, and I would say that a prime target for this debate would be Mechjeb. I love Mechjeb, and I think it\u0027s a very useful mod, but the base game already provides a myriad of tools that allow players to control and guide their own spacecrafts manually so Mechjeb isn\u0027t really necessary to complete the gameplay experience. Resources on the other hand do not even have a basic current implementation in the stock game, and so adding them is perfectly reasonable to expect. So you say \u0022well Kethane already does that so why not install Kethane?\u0022 Well, I\u0027ve already explained why games relying on third party support for things they should have done to begin with is not an okay thing, but besides that Kethane adds an entirely new gameplay mechanic rather than just augment or modify an existing one. I hope you can see why this is a completely different thing than Mechjeb simply providing more information and tools to guide your spacecraft from point A to point B which you can already do in the base game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately the decision to add resources and/or multiplayer is squad\u0027s decision, and if they choose not to add one or the other you can bet there will be a host of mods to fill the demand. That said, I hope my post has made clear why third party modders should never have to do squad\u0027s work for them, and rather should create enhancements to existing features that give advanced players more tools to play with. And that\u0027s all I really have to say about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-16T15:46:36Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2013 03:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tntristan12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T16:20:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom reading all 40 odd pages of this thread I have noticed a few things that I would like to point out before adding my 2cents about resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENumber 1: I have seen many accounts of people complaining that Squad has given in to pressure from the community by \u0022ditching\u0022 resources and adding multiplayer, purely due to pressure from the community, appealing to a wider audience as it were.

But unless Squad was going to add some major infrastructure to the game and add many more mechanics such as large bases built by multiple docked parts nessacary, satellite networks needing to be complex, ect. Those people bored by the current game would expirence all that they could find to expirence rather quickly and that would be that. Another feature brushed under the rug. The same would be said for multiplayer, they would join a server, play with a friend or two, do the same stuff and call it a waste of time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, those player who are still finding new and exciting ways of having fun with little or no mods now, would see multiplayer, add a second person into the equation and square the amount of ways to have fun.

Nobody believes Squad is \u0022listening too much and not enough\u0022 at the same time. The problem is that Squad has been charading at transparancy for months now with their KSP weekly releases, without providing any true depth or insight into their decision making process, leading to this baffling reversal of their longstanding policies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dodgey\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dodgey\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENumber 2: A few people have complained that the \u0022ditching\u0022 of the resource system (I think thats what it should be called, moving on) is a violation of their rights as a consumer as they have purchased KSP under the pretense that it would be eventually be added, and having it under planned features and promising it is false advertising.\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, I would like to bring your attention to the terms page of the Kerbal Space Program website where it describes the terms of purchase and I quote: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Squad is not under any obligation to release any updates, expansions or titles at any time. Each release may very well be the last one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad is under no obligation to implement any given set of features prior to the final release for KSP or any future title. All posted lists of planned features are unofficial and do not imply a promise by Squad to deliver anything listed in them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad reserves the right to add, remove and modify content on any of its software at their own discretion, without prior notice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad is under no obligation to maintain any level of communication with the player community, choosing to do so at their own discretion.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do believe that this should end all arguments withholding with regards to people complaining about the lack of communication (blackout about resources post 0.19) and any \u0022broken promises\u0022 made by Squad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, yes we\u0027ve seen this mentioned a thousand times. The problem isn\u0027t that Squad is violating their TOS, which exists primarily to avoid frivolous lawsuits leveled against them over stuff like this, but that their recent actions have shown a disregard for their consumer base that has been widening ever since they started closing off experimental releases to the general public. The issues you\u0027re commenting on are long-standing and have just been getting worse as Squad grows larger and larger. There\u0027s really nothing new going on here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as Squad\u0027s TOS are concerned, I\u0027ve already remarked on this at length. Generally, just because Squad gives itself the right to do something doesn\u0027t mean that doing it is necessarily the right thing to do. My actual comments were:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tntristan12\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tntristan12\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI would just like to point out that just because you have the right to do something doesn\u0027t mean people aren\u0027t going to call you out on it, if it creates a divide between you and them. Squad has given themselves a contractual out, but that doesn\u0027t mean that ignoring the community and bullheadedly pursuing a path that is generally unpopular isn\u0027t going to impact the popular opinion of the game. It is their right to do whatever they want to the game to be sure, but if people stop supporting their development and spreading the word of how good the game is that\u0027s not in their best interest either. It\u0027s a tricky tightrope they walk on right now.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dodgey\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dodgey\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow onto my 2 cents about resources, concentrating on the content only. I have seen many people saying that resources would of added a new depth to the game and such however I fail to see how. I\u0027ve seen people say things like multiplayer would change nothing about the gameplay but if I had resources I would be about to create a self sustaining colonies ect when there is nothing else to explore. But unless Squad was going to add some major infrastructure to the game and add many more mechanics such as large bases built by multiple docked parts nessacary, satellite networks needing to be complex, ect. Those people bored by the current game would expirence all that they could find to expirence rather quickly and that would be that. Another feature brushed under the rug. The same would be said for multiplayer, they would join a server, play with a friend or two, do the same stuff and call it a waste of time.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResources are an integral part of space exploration. In order to sustain a long-term presence on other worlds (and this is true in real life as well as in KSP), a base would need to be able to draw from the environment. This would fuel all kinds of other, more interesting features such as life support, interplanetary economics, and would allow for the research and development of late game technologies that could (for example) only be built by resources mined on hard-to-reach worlds, and would allow you to go to other star systems (which is the holy grail of any space-faring effort). Even with its most basic implementation (Kethane is my go-to example), you would need to set up reconnaissance orbiters to locate deposits, scout out landing sites in the richest of those deposits, then engineer delivery methods for large, difficult to move pieces of equipment. This challenge provides a logical progression from the typical \u0022explore and do science\u0022 missions that KSP players are currently undertaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESetting up a mining op would also require you to set up an interplanetary freight system so you could move Kerbals and resources to your other outpost in as efficient a manner as possible, which is an indicator of a long-term permanent presence on other worlds. That in itself should be enough, even without the possibilities of using these gathered resources to build new rockets off-world, or sell them back on Kerbin to make a profit for your space program, or allowing you to research and power end-game technologies. I would NOT call that a waste of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dodgey\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dodgey\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow, those player who are still finding new and exciting ways of having fun with little or no mods now, would see multiplayer, add a second person into the equation and square the amount of ways to have fun. It\u0027s only limited by your own imagination. That\u0027s my 2 cents. Mods sorry if I said anything that I shouldn\u0027t have or brought up topics I shouldn\u0027t of.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not think multiplayer has any place in this game, which has always been a primarily single-player experience. The devs have always maintained this position until just recently, and their recent change in position is why people are so incensed now. If they did come out with a multiplayer, that would not be a bad thing in and of itself, but it should be the very last thing they do. Nobody wants to see them pour resources that could have gone into developing more interesting and relevant gameplay mechanics to come out with yet another incomplete gameplay mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nholzric","CreatedById":7793,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T17:16:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022czokletmuss\u0022 data-cite=\u0022czokletmuss\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut I actually think DLC is a great idea.

Second of all, KSP is ridiculously cheap - I payed for it $16 and calculating (price/hours of fun) it was one of my best decisions ever in case of entertainment. Third of all, it\u0027ll be a guarantee of a decent resources system. Why?

This is true of any game. However, most games at that point just end and you get to watch the credits roll by. With KSP, you are free to continue playing until you\u0027ve exhausted all possibilities, and beyond. This \u0022end-game lull\u0022 is a frequent issue with sandbox games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I disagree that resource mining-- \u003Cem\u003Eespecially \u003C/em\u003Ethe idea for resource mining that we proposed last year-- is the best solution to improve end-game activities. There are a lot of other cool things that we could add there, that would be a lot more interesting and fun, and that wouldn\u0027t require an overly complicated and honestly, very tedious system to give you new cool things to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat those things are aren\u0027t something we want to discuss yet. For all we know at this point, whatever new idea we disclose now might end up turning into a new \u0027resources\u0027, that later needs to get scrapped, so let\u0027s not get into that discussion now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that needs to be made clear though, is that a game in Early Access, while it shares a lot in common with the usual MMO-style development process (without any regard to payment model either, that\u0027s an entirely separate and off topic thing here), it is different in that while the MMO is essentially complete from the start, and receives new updates to extend the content for players who have done everything, the Early Access game is still incomplete, and must devote its development time to adding features that maybe might not seem important to experienced players, but that make it easier to be picked up by new players, or that make the overall game experience more \u003Cem\u003Ecomplete\u003C/em\u003E even if that doesn\u0027t make it more \u003Cem\u003Elengthy\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s not saying we won\u0027t ever add more things to do on the end-game level...
