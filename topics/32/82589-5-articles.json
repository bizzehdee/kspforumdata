That\u0027s essentially how the engine works, actually; the heat removed by the fuel/coolant is what drives it to such high speeds. It\u0027s not so much cooling during the burns that\u0027s the issue, it\u0027s when the reactor is idling without expelling coolant that\u0027s a problem. In KSPI, doing a cold reactor shutdown is something of an ordeal and requires a kerbal on EVA to turn it off and to restart it again. Since the LV-N doesn\u0027t appear to glow when not running, I guess it\u0027s doing some kind of automatic shutdown/restart? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027d agree that for the sake of stock KSP, all the little details being swept under the rug is just fine- I mean, the LV-N is far from the only example of that.
