I guess I\u0027ll use quick save and try to knock it off with a very low pass over a dune.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas on how to make a nice amphibious .625m jet?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso... deploying these is complicated. I have a pair of them, and I release one while the main payload is descending under chutes, and fly it to land at the water (mandatory: land the surface hab and rover-boats within 20km of shore... its not hard to be close to water on laythe though)... the other one though... if I don\u0027t land the first one fast, its tricky to launch. The jet has a \u0026gt;1:1 TWR, even in laythe\u0027s thin atmosphere, but if I decouple after I have the jet spool up, the engine flames out on decouple, and as I switch to it the engine thrust is low and increasing, as if it hadn\u0027t already spooled up... I got around this by using the re-root tool to make a part of the 0.625m plane the root... then control is maintained, as is engine thrust upon decouple... but then I need to make sure to launch the non-root part jet when descending under canopy, so the other can decouple and climb straight up...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would all be soo much easier if there were a viable method for having mini-jets launch and land from solid ground...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, they are still fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002236Dw9RP.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022626\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/36Dw9RP.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qBPkzDH.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022624\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qBPkzDH.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022B0791uf.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022624\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/B0791uf.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ut6VbST.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ut6VbST.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used HE to test them on laythe too... going to use them in career... but soo much stuff to do before the Jool window even opens, and then of course even more to do before they reach laythe (or maybe by that point, I\u0027ll have finished with the stuff in the inner solar system, and I\u0027ll be on nothing but Jool moon visits, and an Eeloo trip...
