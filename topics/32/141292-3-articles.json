Other biases may be cause by forum users more/less \u0022tech savvy\u0022... are they more likely to be people to have knowledge,\u00A0interest, and opinions about what is \u0022under the hood\u0022 or \u0022behind the curtain\u0022.

Squad is in a position to say what those costs are.\u00A0 The cost of delaying the release is at least a somewhat known quantity:\u00A0 it\u0027s making N players wait for the game.\u00A0 We don\u0027t know just how big a number that is, since Squad doesn\u0027t release that information, but let\u0027s say a million-- I\u0027d wager it couldn\u0027t be a whole lot less than that.\u00A0 So, make a million people wait an extra N weeks or months.\u00A0 That\u0027s a pretty big deal.\u00A0 That\u0027s a big cost.\u00A0 There\u0027d better be a big benefit to make it worth doing

many people are actually affected by these bugs\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Suppose it turns out that 98% of the player base is doing just fine-- would you make 98% of players wait months of extra time to save problems for 2%?\u00A0 Of course, seeing me casually toss out a number like 2% is going to make hackles rise-- the obvious rejoinder would be \u0022that\u0027s ridiculous, Snark, you\u0027re just pulling a number out of your posterior that seems to support your argument.\u0022\u00A0 And you\u0027d be right-- I can\u0027t say that \u00222%\u0022 is accurate.\u00A0 \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003EBut you can\u0027t say that it isn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E.\u00A0 You just don\u0027t know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, I think it\u0027s plausible that an awful lot of people complaining about \u0022bugs\u0022 are actually getting caught by player error-- that\u0027s what a lot of the folks complaining about landing gear are doing, at least in the many posts I\u0027ve seen on the topic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s also plausible that an awful lot of people getting caught by crashes are actually being done in by \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emods\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, which aren\u0027t Squad\u0027s responsibility.\u00A0 I don\u0027t have any idea what fraction of players run mods... but I think it\u0027s plausible to suppose that the large majority don\u0027t use them.\u00A0 To use a mod, you have to be fairly computer-savvy.\u00A0 The overwhelming majority of KSP players are \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Enot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E on this forum, which means that their voices are never heard here, and you and I never hear from them-- but \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003ESquad\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E has to take them into account.\u00A0 (My basis for that assertion:\u00A0 there are at least hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of KSP players.\u00A0 Not even 1% that many people are here on the forums.)\u00A0 The population here on the forums is a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Etiny\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E sample of the overall KSP population-- and I\u0027d wager that it\u0027s probably not a representative one.\u00A0 I\u0027d guess that the folks who post here are more likely to be the computer-savvy ones, the ones who are more likely to install mods, and who are therefore more likely to run into problems.\u00A0 I\u0027d also point out that happy people who aren\u0027t having problems generally don\u0027t have a reason to post, or to search for posts, which can mean that the unhappy-people-with-problems have a disproportionate voice here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd there\u0027s also the fact that there are other tradeoffs, as well.\u00A0 If Squad decides to push the big red shiny button and ship a product, even with \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eknown\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E bug problems (including bugs not found yet)... they get an immediate bug-finding benefit from the gazillions of users.\u00A0 Bugs will be found rapidly, which will make it easier to fix them rapidly.\u00A0 If, on the other hand, they didn\u0027t push that button and had to rely on their tiny in-house QA staff for all of that... it would take a much longer time to find and narrow in on the same number of bugs.\u00A0 So again, it comes down to a tradeoff.\u00A0 Release, and have the cost of some users with bug pain... in exchange for a much compressed QA cycle, which allows fixing them faster, and allows future versions of KSP to be released much sooner.\u00A0 Keeping it in-house avoids the bug pain for players, but could make for a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emuch\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E delayed release to try to hit the same quality bar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, it\u0027s a tradeoff.\u00A0 It\u0027s far from obvious which is the right choice, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eeven if you\u0027re Squad and have all the information\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 For people like you and me, who \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E have that information, then we\u0027re flying blind.\u00A0 So... you may be right-- but you also very well may not.\u00A0 And all I\u0027m saying is, when you\u0027re not in a position to know whether you\u0027re right, perhaps it would be better not to level criticism at people who have more information than you do and used that information when making their decision.\u00A0 And who don\u0027t have a crystal

For one thing, you yourself are presenting statistics from the polls as evidence of there not being a problem, which you must allow is no less questionable than the counter-statistics being used for the counter-argument. Secondly, as I remarked in previous posts, the polls consistently show that about 20% of responders are having what they consider game-breaking issues which they consider bug-related. There\u0027s still the view that actually, among the 65-80% of people who say they\u0027re playing regardless, there may be many afflicted with the same problem but who don\u0027t consider it game-breaking, or who are experiencing it in a less-severe fashion (perhaps because they have better processors or more RAM or something).\u00A0 While I grant you that this is all unquantified, problematic and questionable evidence, it remains evidence of an apparent bug problem that is apparently affecting a significant-if-unspecified fraction of players and apparently makes the game unplayable.
