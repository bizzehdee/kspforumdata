Sent the outpost and satellite from a single launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEntering Duna\u0027s SOI, I realized the satellite had the small OKTO2 core, which doesn\u0027t have torque, and I forgot to put a reaction wheel on it. So, as it would be unsteerable, I had to use the transfer stage, with the 5-Kerbal outpost, to maneuver the satellite into the required orbit. Released satellite, which luckily was in the proper orbit, contract completed. Phew!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile maneuvering into a low orbit over Duna, the ship lost electric power. I had put only flat solar panels on, radially mounted, and the ship had rotated pointing away from the sun. Bill went EVA, to push the ship around so a solar panel would get light. I normally mount one or two panels in odd positions to avoid that situation, but forgot this time...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeparated outpost from transfer stage, and realized there was no probe core on the transfer stage. Oh well, I\u0027ll deal with that problem later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutpost descending into Duna, deploy 3 parachutes. Only one deployed. Scrambled to get the other two deployed. On landing, the outpost was apparently too tall, and tipped over. That was a problem, as I had planned on separating a lander can, and returning Bill to the orbiting transfer stage, and back to Kerbin. Of course, the thing tipped over with the exit hatch facing down, so I couldn\u0027t even EVA to assess the situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter much thought, I decided to separate the ascent stage, fire the engines a bit, and see if I could right the stage without blowing it up. Success! Good thing I only brought Bill along, otherwise the other 4 Kerbals would have been stranded, going for the ride of their life in a 4-Kerbal container, which was now rolling down a hill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got the ascent stage back into orbit, and rendezvoused with the transfer stage. Docking was tricky, again I forgot to put a probe core on the transfer stage, so it was floating aimlessly in space, tough to dock with. Plus, for some reason I had placed the ascent stage docking collar on the bottom of the ascent stage, so I had to back into the lifeless transfer stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I got Bill back to Kerbin, where the last (I hope) oversight came to light. Bill (the only guy I sent) is a Scientist, and can\u0027t repack chutes.
