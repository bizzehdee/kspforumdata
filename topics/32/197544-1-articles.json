I know they are somewhat rare but on my old save I managed to find quite a few, (I also used the debug menu a ton of times in 2018 on my pc so that\u0027s maybe a reason I have not came across any now). On my newer ps4 save, which I started in 2019, I haven\u0027t came across any at all. I find this to be weird cause I can\u0027t count how many of those things I captured and brought to planetary orbits, is there any specific limitations to spawnrate, or a specific size for a glowing asteroid to appear in the game?\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. I don\u0027t use the debug menu now on ps4 cause it gets rid of achievements, also it\u0027s more fun to give myself a challenge and sense of legitimacy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
