Is that possible?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-18T17:56:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIIRC, not. But you can easily hide a given craft type (like \u0027relay\u0027) in tracking station or on the map - as you hover near the top of the tracking station or map screen, there\u0027s a white list of craft types, the last is \u0027relay\u0027 and clicking it so it turns dark disables displaying them. You can also easily change craft type (and name) from the tracking station. Select the craft, click the (i) icon on the bottom row. An info window with name and a bunch of info about the craft will pop up. Double-click the title bar (orange, with the craft name) and a dialog for renaming and changing craft type will pop up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyko","CreatedById":164179,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-18T22:49:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheck out these two mods. They both help you to simplify craft sorting or visibility. Maybe one of them would help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed5643809115\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/172162-144-dmagics-evolved-mods-tracking-station-evolved-v40-6-30-2018/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:228px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed6764725602\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/159930-141-toomanyorbits-v112/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:228px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
