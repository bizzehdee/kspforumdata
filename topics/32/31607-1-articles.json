I used to do paid photography on the side, covering events (and this was back in the \u003Cem\u003Efilm\u003C/em\u003E age). You have to take several shots of a scene, esp. a fast one, in rapid progression, if only to make sure you get the \u0022right\u0022 one. It\u0027s a lot easier now, in the digital age, because you don\u0027t need to buy rolls and rolls of film! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E You get to select from several frames on which ones are the best. Having covered some weddings, this technique can really shine, esp. in intimate moments like the couple eating their cake, and also in sports, capturing those moments on the finish line, etc. Same thing with KSP\u0027s screenshot button--I make it a point to take 5 screenshots in rapid succession, while I\u0027m doing a critical and memorable moment like landing or insertion to orbit--always nice if you have a set of photos to choose from.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"satcharna","CreatedById":61549,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T01:49:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E97,at least one per successful mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rage097","CreatedById":66193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T01:49:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E27 screenshots. mostly of mechs...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr. Rogue Ace","CreatedById":68632,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T01:52:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rodion_herrera\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rodion_herrera\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETwo words.
