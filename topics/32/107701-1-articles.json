I don\u0027t know how to make them smaller)\n\nI didn\u0027t really play much of KSP 0.90, so cargo bays are pretty much new to me, so maybe I\u0027m overreacting. But the new service bays are by far my favorite part, mostly for aesthetic reasons. Where before I would have this monstrosity:\n\n![zMZKPw.png](https://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/806x688q50/r/661/zMZKPw.png)\n\nI can now tuck it all away inside a service bay!\n\n![QaX1tM.png](https://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/898x878q50/r/537/QaX1tM.png)\n\n(I went a bit overkill with the science because I like to recover it rather than transmit it.)\n\nCheck out this awesome science/control module on my research station!\n\n![jOWTAJ.png](https://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/895x501q90/r/540/jOWTAJ.png)\n\nNeed to rescue a Kerbal from orbit, but only have one-Kerbal pods? No problemo, just stick a probe core inside a service bay!\n\n![mInT9f.png](https://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/700x894q50/r/537/mInT9f.png)\n\nOne of my little annoyances with KSP has been all of the tiny parts you have to just kind of slap onto the outside of the rocket. But now you can tuck all of that away into a service bay! I love it!\n\nWhat kind of stuff do you use service bays for?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T19:04:36Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 07:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by itstimaifool**\n  \nBegging for help with the images"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T18:42:22Z","Content":"I use them to hide kerbals inside.
