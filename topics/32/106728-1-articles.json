Right now I am trying to unlock the Stayputnik probe core so I can send an unmanned lander to the Mun so I don\u0027t have to temporarily strand one of my pilots there. After that, I\u0027m focusing on trying to get to the resources and electricity stuff. I think. It\u0027s all subject to change, of course!"},{"CreatedByName":"fireworks_display","CreatedById":68923,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T01:24:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I havent been able to make it to the mun yet.\n\n1st Stage: 1x BACC with 2 Fleas radially that drop off after the first few seconds\n\n2nd Stage: Hammer\n\n3rd Stage: LV909 and a couple of FT400s\n\nThat will get you to Mun no problem - and without any upgraded buildings at all! \u003C18t \u003C20m - I just got upto 9.6Mm and time warped until I got a flyby.\n\nDecouplers, LV909 and upgraded launchpad were my priorities for landing on Mun and Minmus.\n\nI pretty much ignored the SPH parts just because I felt more confident in parachuting down a rocket than landing planes ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"ghpstage","CreatedById":129622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T01:30:27Z","Content":"By been to the Mun are you talking about a landing or bypass/orbit?\n\nI did build a bare bones lander for the techs you have, but it barely made it home and that was before they bumped up the drag.\n\nI suggest getting the next rocket tech as it gives access to the S1 SRB, which gave my last rocket far more than it needed."},{"CreatedByName":"Ulzgoroth","CreatedById":142295,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T01:31:14Z","Content":"You\u0027ve got all the tech that I do and a bit more, and my Mun orbit mission has already made its return transfer and is ready for reentry when I get home today.\n\nPersonally, I\u0027d go for Electrics in a hurry, because I don\u0027t like having to run things on battery power. And do like probe cores. After that, probably the necessary stuff to start using larger rockets.\n\nEDIT: Actually, going after Advanced Flight Control might want to be a priority. RCS is very helpful for landers. And while the Mun can be a bit stressful Minmus is pretty easy to land on.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T05:31:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 05:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ulzgoroth**"},{"CreatedByName":"TothAval","CreatedById":142030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T13:00:44Z","Content":"i just unlocked all the 90 science nodes and one 160science node, i don\u0027t follow a specific strategy. i want to unlock docking ports next, to be able to set up bigger missions, and extendable solar panels, beside that, no clue."},{"CreatedByName":"falconek","CreatedById":28606,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T13:16:27Z","Content":"This is mine. I was focusing on control to get SAS and be able to build bigger rockets, then on electricity for unmanned, and small engines for landers. I\u0027ve been able to land few unmanned probes on Mun. With sending Kerbals I\u0027m waiting till I\u0027ll be able to build something more reliable, that can send three kerbals for the mission. Which means bigger command pod, bigger engines, and bigger fuel tanks. \n\n![60DN1UJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/60DN1UJ.png)"}]}
