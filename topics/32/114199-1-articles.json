This way you can move a station or upgrade a station to complete the contract which makes a lot more sense to me personally. I currently have 4 abandoned stations above kerbin 2 over the Mun 2 empty Mun bases. I have had a couple of those launch abandoned controlled by a probe core just because I know I will never use them. The last Minimus Base I just used as an opportunity to take 8 new recruits to get the Minimus flag and it immediately flew back."},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T03:28:24Z","Content":"No one cares about your current art installation, make a new one."},{"CreatedByName":"moronwrocket","CreatedById":134908,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T03:57:41Z","Content":"Contract Configurator \u002B Contract Pack: Kerbin Space Station has one contract to send stations to LKO, LMunO, LMinmusO, and then crew rotation, evacuation, repair, expansion, etc. contracts."},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T04:29:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Contract Configurator \u002B Contract Pack: Kerbin Space Station has one contract to send stations to LKO, LMunO, LMinmusO, and then crew rotation, evacuation, repair, expansion, etc. contracts.\n\nThis.
