I think the biggest reason is because iv\u0027e always modded games; i was like 8-9 when i first started modding C\u0026amp;C Generals, Zero Hour and moved on to Spore, Civ III and SWEAW. And if i reflect on the reasons i decided to mod those games it\u0027s pretty simple; there\u0027s always something lacking. In Generals for instance there were hidden factions that could be restored with a few lines of code, vehicle niches that were not filled in specific factions; Spore i decided to mod because i was playing heavily around the time the Kepler Space Telescope went up and started discovering large amounts of potentially habitable worlds around red dwarfs. Which spore heavily weighted toward not hosting worlds, let alone habitable ones. So i got a mod and tweaked it to represent what the data was saying (Worlds, mostly barren because dwarfs are flaring\u00A0stars but the occasional habitable one.).

I find a lot of satisfaction in exploring a world someone else created, discovering how it works, being surprised by new and interesting challenges and puzzles that they built for me, and overcoming those challenges. Modding takes away from that experience for me personally, because I feel like I\u0027m building my own world with my own rules, so the challenges were obstacles I put there to begin with, and the surprises are ruined because I put them there.

Honestly, I\u0027m not sure I\u0027d have nearly as much fun if I confined myself to a single game instance. Like many people in KSP, I cut my teeth on Orbiter (way back in 2002 or so) - and in Orbiter, playing without mods is significantly less interesting. The game almost requires them. I started playing KSP in 2012 in version 0.17, before docking was even available. I already had a decade of experience with Orbiter, and modding the crap out of that game, so for me doing the same in KSP, and starting to get into \u0022light modding\u0022 (i.e. frankensteining things and writing config files for Module Manager) was a natural progression. Honestly, if I had more time, I\u0027d be trying to write a .dll of my own, start working on IVAs, and an alternative to Kerbinside (i.e. several bases / airports) for other \u0022Kerbins\u0022, like in GPP or JNSQ.
