The more robust attitude controls are more useful for space, but for planes and controlled descent, precision controls tend to be a must.\n\nI\\\u0027ll admit this is just a suggestion; I myself won\\\u0027t be messing with planes till after .15 comes out. But if you feel as though the movement is too sharp (which is *never* what you want when dealing with planes), I suggest the best thing to try is precision mode."},{"CreatedByName":"Ancient Attero","CreatedById":7144,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-04T13:28:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well, seeing as the pitch/roll/yaw controls tend to be quite responsive in KSP, I suggest you try turning on precision controls (CAPS-LOCK) and see if that allows you to fly gracefully.
