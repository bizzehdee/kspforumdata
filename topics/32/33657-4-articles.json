But as I said on the previous design, you\u0027ve got way too much engine and too little fuel, especially on the upper stages. One orange tank per Mainsail just isn\u0027t enough fuel. Those engines are heavy, and go through fuel quickly; as long as you have enough TWR, use less engines and/or more fuel tanks. Also, it looks like you\u0027ve upgraded to the full version, which means LV-N engines are usable. They\u0027re ideal for upper stages (anything outside an atmosphere); low thrust and high weight, but extremely high fuel efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo illustrate the point, here\u0027s one of my old designs from when I was first starting the game, the Pink Koala 3:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mjAD2sv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mjAD2sv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s purely stock, other than the Flight Engineer that I added to take the screenshot (and which I really wish I\u0027d had back then). As you can see from its engineer readout, I didn\u0027t have enough TWR on the lower stages; 1.87 on the bottom stage is a bit weak, but the 1.37 for the one above that is really problematic. The delta-V total shows that I required three stages to get to orbit when two probably would have worked with a little more thrust (4000m/s is about what you need to get to orbit). But once I was in orbit, the high specific impulse of the LV-Ns gave me plenty of delta-V to get to my destinations. What you can see is that the Mainsail was being fed by two orange tanks, stacked vertically. The white tanks next to it are asparagus-linked, with LV-T30s on the bottom of those stacks as well (which don\u0027t START firing until the SRBs separate). Once those white tanks are depleted, separators eject them. It\u0027s a lot of fuel feeding a small number of engines; a little too small, as I mentioned from the TWR, but the basic concept is sound.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis design was capable of going to Duna and returning safely, albeit with no fuel left and I had to land with RCS jets. It was also enough for me to land on Minmus and then land at Mun on the way back, while ditching quite a bit of my fuel in the LV-N stage. I\u0027ve since designed it to be much better on the bottom stages, although I now use a lot more mod parts.

You see, one metric ton is 1000 kg, and one Newton (N) equals one kg m/s^2, with a kiloNewton (kN) being a thousand times that. On Earth (or Kerbin), one kilogram of mass has 9.8 Newtons of weight; on other planets, the ratio\u0027s different. Contrary to how most people use it, a kilogram is NOT a unit of weight (force), it\u0027s a unit of mass, while thrust values are always expressed as a force, and if you want to make a unitless number like TWR you need to cancel out the remaining units.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s easiest, therefore, to convert everything to Newtons, although those values will only be good for the particular planet you\u0027re on. For simplicity, we keep everything in Kerbin units, and just adjust our required value as necessary. So the equation is\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETWR = (Thrust in kiloNewtons) / (Mass in tons * 9.8)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you\u0027re doing it in your head, you can just round that 9.8 off to an even 10.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T02:49:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Whackjob\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Whackjob\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHere\u0027s one of the figures spatz put up in an earlier post:\u003Cp\u003E6: mass 285T, thrust 4515kN.
