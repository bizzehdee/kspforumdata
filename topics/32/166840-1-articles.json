For example, in my stock career game, my fifth mission is\u00A0a manned landing on the Mun with a single Kerbal in a ship that should be able to land and then launch from the Mun to return to Kerbin. Last time I did this mission, I spotted an arch on my way down to the Mun surface and decided to change my landing site to land near it. This cost me enough delta-v that i barely had enough left to get back into Mun orbit and do my escape burn. I ended up with a periapsis above Kerbin at about 100k and needed to get out and push to lower that 50k or so into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere to capture and reenter.
