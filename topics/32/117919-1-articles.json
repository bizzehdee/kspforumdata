He\u0027d love to, but it would be \u0022super irresponsible\u0022 until a lot of people have tested it.

However, Max explains, it doesn\u0027t matter because he hasn\u0027t upgraded the Astronaut Complex so she can\u0027t go EVA anyway.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EHowever, with no EVA there is no repacking chutes, so even if the ship COULD get back to Kerbin, it\u0027d never be able to land there.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EHe throttles up. I have no idea why. It may have just been a mistake, but he was talking about how he\u0027d missed the goo reading from space around Duna, so maybe he thought... I don\u0027t know.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe ship goes sideways (possibly becuase of landigng gear stuck in the ground) and he panics like we\u0027ve all done, hits the gas, hits the ground, and everything explodes.

(I think this means, \u0022assuming the 64 bit version gets them\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA: Sure, but if it can\u0027t, then it would \u0022not be wise\u0022 to be held back by it. (I read this as, if 32 bit can\u0027t have them, then 64 bit will get them anyway).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EBack to the space center, all the contracts are 1 star becasue the rep is so bad.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EHe upgrades the Astronaut Complex.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EHe wonders if she can EVA now.

I don\u0027t use RSS but never the less, it is absolutely beautiful. Personally I would prefer Squad provide the infrastructure and some artwork of their own as well. Then make sure that, like EVE, artists can substitute their own easily. While they are at it, they can add a native ability to add other artwork like Texture Replacer. These mods are fine, but it would certainly be better if the game could auto-detect new textures the same way it does new parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
