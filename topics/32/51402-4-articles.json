I also agree that some hints and more involved tutorials are a good idea in the finished game. That said, none of us know for sure (other than the devs) what the final game will contain on that subject. The power problem in particular is a playing style error rather than a game/design issue. It\u0027s a challenge, to find the correct way to play through that particular part of the game.

Its a WIP and roughly balanced, unfortunately the fine tuned play balance which comes from many hours play testing is not in evidence.

And to make progress in that way you are kind of forced to build certain rockets (like covering a ship with batteries, attaching 99 rockets, etc because the parts for doing these kind of missions any differently are buried deep down the tech tree). I know there is a challenge aspect to that, but it is limiting and not in a good way. I\u0027ve now \u0022cheated\u0022 my career mode because I just want to enjoy the game with the science. In sandbox I was doing things steadily and was very pleased with my progress to the Mun.

At the same time, making parts the reward on such a large tree is restricting players from just building their own rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you look at other games with tech trees, they never just unlock parts or units. They unlock new gameplay, and usually at fairly logical points. I know it is early, but I am rather concerned that there isn\u0027t too much else planned for the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo keep it constructive... I\u0027d do a smaller tech tree that focuses on technology and functionality rather than just parts. Group the parts together to allow more freedom (give more of the small rocket parts to start with and a single probe core, put the big parts together, etc), then make the majority of the tech tree focused on advancing the functional parts such as science collection, better batteries and solar panels, improved transmitters, more scientific instruments, rover parts, better parachutes, etc. In addition to this, make some of the nodes on the tech tree unrelated to parts, so for example, better fuel efficiency, ability to \u0022see\u0022 the planets (maybe after a space telescope is in orbit?), unlock the astronaut complex for hiring additional astronauts, bonuses to money and science collection, etc. And to add another level, make some of the tech tree conditional on logically relevant gameplay events (like the telescope one I mentioned above). Given how central the tech tree is going to be, it needs to be much more than just a list of parts to unlock, IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-02T13:24:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis game just requires intellect.

Maybe it\u0027s because I found out about KSP on the Orbiter forums (and I had been playing with Orbiter for a while), but Kerbal Space Program feels like a \u0022gamified\u0022 version of a realistic space simulator. Many aspects of it feel dumbed down in the most positive manner, as that is precisely what it\u0027s supposed to be doing, add gameplay value to the concept sacrificing realism when necessary. That is good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a little late to this party, but perhaps the problem the OP is having is not so much related to \u0022hardcore\u0022 mechanics, but to him/her approaching career mode wrong. Before you unlock solar panels and batteries, staying in space with your engines off is just unpractical. It\u0027s a gameplay design thing that has nothing to do with realism (in fact, as the OP says, it\u0027s less than realistic). You are not meant to stay parked in orbit doing science without a solar panel or even a battery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m no pro. Although I have been playing this game for a long time, I usually botch interplanetary missions because even the simplified as they are, some aspects of delta-v managing and mission design give me a hard time. I consider myself a clumsy player, and yet, I felt career mode was extremely easy. Perhaps that is because I know how the game plays, what I can and cannot do easily with what the game is giving me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry to approach the game in a different way that is more in harmony with its inherent rules and it will become a hundred times easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry this turned into a wall of text.
