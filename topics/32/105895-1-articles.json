For me only really useable way to do this was always via pipeline from KAS mod or QFL mod, but how it can be done in stock is beyond me.\n\nSo any pro tips for this?"},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T05:22:54Z","Content":"Mine on the ground, refine in orbit. Land bases are still missing some needed part support in stock, I think. Carefully building rover-wheeled bases to dock together can work, but it\u0027s a huge design challenge."},{"CreatedByName":"Enorats","CreatedById":141841,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T05:40:05Z","Content":"Yeah, basically gotta use docking ports until KAS is updated. Really missing using winches to \u0022dock\u0022 and transfer resources. The bigger question is why bother at all though. Ground bases seem rather pointless in many cases. I suppose you could use one on an easy to land on moon to resupply an orbital fuel station, but even then I find it\u0027s easier to just use a large lander that\u0027s little more than a mining rig to deliver ore to the station for processing. There just doesn\u0027t seem to be much reason for a permanent presence on a planetary body."},{"CreatedByName":"Maizel","CreatedById":138286,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T06:03:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yeah, basically gotta use docking ports until KAS is updated.
