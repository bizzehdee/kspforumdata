Due to the 500 data limit it will take a while to process all the experiments and I\u0027d like to bring those which are already processed back to Kerbin. Is there perhaps a mod that would allow me to transfer individual experiments into the return pod instead of grabbing everything that is in the lab?"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T13:18:23Z","Content":"Not that J know of. Better to try bringing copies of every experiment. Here modding might help by making more parts able to hold them."},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T13:40:11Z","Content":"Ship Manifest."},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T14:50:46Z","Content":"Can it move single specific experiments out of several others from a pod?"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T15:27:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Can it move single specific experiments out of several others from a pod?\n\nWait, no, it can\u0027t. ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif)"}]}
