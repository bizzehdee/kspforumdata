I decided to do an EVA, so I extended the ladder and let my Kerbal in the toxic atmosphere of Eve. But as soon as my Kerbal put a foot on the purple ground, the screen turned black (the UI was still here, though), and my altitude was locked to 666 666m. I was so deeping scared that I didn\u0027t took the time to take a screen but when I restarted the game, everything was normal except that my lander (just the lander part, not the fuel tanks or any legs) and my flag (yes, the flag which have been planted before on Eve) were flying together in space, on an escape orbit around the Sun.
