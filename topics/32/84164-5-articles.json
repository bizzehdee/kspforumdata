I support realism but only when it bends a knee to the altar of meaningful gameplay decisions. Quite honestly some of the realism advocates do seem to maybe have lost some perspective on where the line is between stupid arcade and going grognard. On flipside many people seem to oppose the changes just for the sake of opposing the changes. But here\u0027s my take on things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I started playing, I googled it and read about it. I learned something like this (still no idea how far off the mark I am): atmosphere affects thrust if fuel flow is constant, KSP makes thrust constant but alters the fuel flow. In realistic model you\u0027d need to hit the throttle a bit more to get the same thrust and you end up burning more fuel, in KSP mode it just burns more fuel. So in the end the gameplay effect is pretty much the same, either way you need to choose an engine that has enough thrust. This is the gameplay decision here: Which engine do you choose for this rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me it\u0027s just comparing peanuts to peanuts. However I\u0027d argue that many people don\u0027t even care about the effect of atmosphere on the engine at all. They have enough thrust to lift off, enough dV to do what they want and that\u0027s it. Only substantial thing the realistic ISP would do is add a level of complication. I don\u0027t mind either way but I can see why they want to simplify it a bit. The educational value is that atmosphere affects engine performance. That\u0027s not wrong. The details are, but so is the Bohr model and still they use it to explain the structure of an atom. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI honestly do not understand how this has become such a major issue for people. But then again, the arguments against it aren\u0027t really all that strong either so might as well change it. Maybe then even I would learn how it really works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPros:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealism crowd isn\u0027t complaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe low-complexity crowd isn\u0027t complaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELife support\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith every life support mod you do pretty much one thing. Estimate how long the mission will last and how many kerbals are going. Add tonnage to compensate. Forget unless you estimated wrong. It\u0027s fun for some people and I understand it, but enjoying the mechanic pretty much requires the premise that you want to have a life support system. The mechanic itself is simply a timer that you need to satisfy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless there\u0027s something substantial gameplay wise added to life support, I\u0027m adamantly against it. If someone implements kerbal comfort and happiness levels, a reason to actually take kerbals somewhere other than the arbitrary science experiments they can do, meaningful decision on how the life support is done, then I\u0027m definitely for it! I\u0027d love to have my miner kerbals produce more funds if they have access to comfy living quarters with huge snack supplies to wolf down, I want my science kerbals to get more lightbulbs over their heads if they have ample supply of extra electricity to play video games and get intellectually stimulated and Jeb to get frustrated if he doesn\u0027t get to do a 5 G turn at least once during the mission. Anything meaningful. But not \u0022Add 2 tons of life support to last a year. 4 tons for 2 years. 6 if you think you need 3 years.\u0022 Also I don\u0027t want kerbals to die but that\u0027s just personal preference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPros:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould be interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould be arbitrary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerodynamics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one\u0027s s great example.
