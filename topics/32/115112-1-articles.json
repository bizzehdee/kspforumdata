If I start doing it, the rocket will usually flip over. Way too often my ascent trajectory consists of 30km straight up, then turning 90 degrees once predicted apoapsis passes 70km and burning parallel to the ground the rest of the way.\n\nAlso, since my launch stage is recoverable but definitely SUBorbital, my initial orbits tend to be quite sloppy, as I need to bring the payload/transfer stage above the 70km limit and into an orbit with periapsis over 55km ASAP, without waiting for neat conditions for optimal burn, as I need to switch back to the launch stage to bring it safely down.\n\nOTOH, that really doesn\u0027t hinder me. I\u0027ve gotten really good with maneuver nodes. From Minmus surface to orbital rendezvous in single node and within 100m of the target? Orbital insertion, plane matching and rendezvous in one node? What about this: perform a bi-elliptic transfer (not enough dV for a Hohmann!) in a craft that [cannot turn around at all](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127745-No-RCS-no-reaction-wheel-no-gimball-not-enough-dV-no-good-encounter-Eve-landing)? So taking off from a sloppy orbit means just a bit more of fiddling with the node. I don\u0027t bother circularizing before the transfer because all it serves is making the transfer node easier to make.\n\nOh, and I tend to overengineer the stuff that leaves Kerbin. It\u0027s not infrequent to burn some 2000dV in orbit instead of performing aerobraking, simply to reduce the landing weight.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E Yeah, I once tried to create a VTOL a while ago, but I greatly underestimated how difficult it would be to build and thought I could just stick an engine below the center of mass, but apparently not \u003E.\u003E\n\nWhy, they are quite easy!

I lack creative vision alongside how to get it up there.

I intend it to be a cross between a fuelling station and a science station, hence the plan to move it to one of the nearby moons. \n\nI am now stuck on the best way to get the tanks up there with good RCS manoeuvrability for docking as well as the thrust required to reach orbit. \n\nStage 3 will probably include more solar panels and power storage to supplement the basic ones on the initial stage. Then of course I have to figure out how to get the thing to where ever I decide to send it."}]}
