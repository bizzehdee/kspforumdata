When en engine is told to vector to compensate for drift for example it moves to much sens the ASAS checks its relative position to it self and when the crafts body flexes the engines just moves to much with out the ASAS module fallowing with it and the tension built up in the structure is later transfered over to the ASAS module when the structure straiten it self out again and it moves the ASAS module to much but with some delay.
