I have to ask - has anyone managed to get an ore container to survive landing on Kerbin? They seem to have horrifyingly weak joints (even with the joint reinforcement mod) and anything I attach them to (or to them) just breaks the second it hits land, destroying the tank. If it lands on water, the tank is instantly destroyed (even if the tank is inside a bay and never contacts the water). I even built a ship I could launch from Minmus that was basically two adapter fuel tanks with a Mk 3 cargo bay in between, radial engines on the rear with some air breaks, and a heat shield in front. With several KAS winches it\u0027s perfect for returning wrecks to the surface.. but trying to attach an ore container inside the Mk 3 bay (directly to the wall, or even with other pieces and struts in between) leads to a total failure. The drop pod has enough parachutes to slow even a fully filled bay to ~8 m/s, so I doubt the speed of the impact is the problem. I\u0027ve tried landing it on it\u0027s end (which destroys the heat shield.. they\u0027re also horrifyingly weak) and I\u0027ve tried landing it flat by pumping fuel from the front tank to the rear and balancing the center of mass. Neither way makes a difference."},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T21:45:09Z","Content":"Huh, I\u0027ve only done one ore retrieval contract so far, but I don\u0027t recall having that problem. I would say 8 m/s is still landing a little hard, thats about 18 mph. If I\u0027ve got anything coming down at more than 6m/s I expect something to break. Getting the landing speed down to 4m/s is worth a shot."},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T21:53:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The drop pod has enough parachutes to slow even a fully filled bay to ~8 m/s, so I doubt the speed of the impact is the problem.\n\nThe crash tolerance of the ore containers is 7 m/s, so the speed of the impact can\u0027t be ruled out. If the ore containers are the first part to hit, it\u0027s almost definitely the problem, in fact.\n\nI haven\u0027t tried this yet, but I just got a contract to do so, so I\u0027ll know more later."},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor9","CreatedById":67915,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T22:01:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I would say 8 m/s is still landing a little hard, thats about 18 mph.

Getting the landing speed down to 4m/s is worth a shot.\n\n\u002B1 I had a similar issue when I was trying to make a 7 Kerbal pod for LKO ferry flights. It was a Mk1-2 pod with a Hitchhiker at the bottom, and a small tank and \u0027Poodle\u0027 below that. During testing if I didn\u0027t get the parachute-assisted impact to around 4m/s in water, the only part to survive was the Mk1-2 and anything surface attached to it. The rest of the ship broke apart and disappeared. If I used a set of thrusters or the main engine to ease into the water, everything was fine."},{"CreatedByName":"Enorats","CreatedById":141841,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T22:14:45Z","Content":"The ore container isn\u0027t hitting at all, it\u0027s contained inside of a Mk 3 bay to protect it from reentry heat and held in place by struts. Tbh, I\u0027ve almost never had any problems with a speed under 10 m/s. The science jr\u0027s are about the only thing I\u0027ve encountered that can\u0027t take that much."},{"CreatedByName":"ThreePounds","CreatedById":116058,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T09:05:50Z","Content":"Maybe you should actually try less struts. Speed doesn\u0027t break stuff, actually. It\u0027s acceleration. Try a more flexible connection between your ore containers and the cargo bay - docking ports for instance. It doesn\u0027t really matter what hits the ground first if your craft is rigid thanks to struts: chains always break at their weakest link."},{"CreatedByName":"T.A.P.O.R.","CreatedById":137748,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T09:13:56Z","Content":"I\u0027ve done one from Mun, but had to revert and try to find a dry place to land as my containers are apparently hydrophobic."},{"CreatedByName":"X-SR71","CreatedById":108775,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T12:14:04Z","Content":"Does it perhaps help if you add a girder at the bottom?
