Again even if you we were afloat above the clouds of Venus during a solar flare you would be exposed to no radiation, the atmosphere is enough protection.

If the scale height is 4km, then the mass shielding from the atmosphere is around 4,000 kg/m^2. That\u0027s equivalent to a few meters of water between life on the surface and the radiation, which would be a very effective shield, even against cosmic rays. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, life could exist under the oceans on Laythe for even more shielding. The tidal heating would likely result in volcanic activity and probably hydrothermal vents, which we know are good habitats for life on Earth and would be completely shielded from radiation. If more shielding were required than the atmosphere, then a submarine base for visiting Kerbals would only have to be something like 10 feet below the waves to provide very effective radiation shielding. The challenge would be in getting to and from Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the atmosphere being sputtered away by the radiation: That process occurs over hundreds of thousands of years. Healthy volcanic activity could renew gases lost to space just like it does here on Earth, and it might not even be necessary if Laythe\u0027s composition is like Europa, which has something like twice as much water as the Earth, despite having less than 1% of its mass. The atmosphere could be in a nearly steady-state as Laythe slowly loses light atoms to radiation which are replenished from the effectively inexhaustible supply at and below its surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot all of the processes that would be necessary for Laythe to be \u0022possible\u0022 are modeled in the game.
