She was asking stuff about Roosevelt to the other group and one guy had the book hidden under the desk in his lap and was looking at the answers. I got pissed and yelled: \u0022Hey! They are cheating over there!\u0022\n\nExcept my english was really bad back then and english doesn\u0027t go well with portuguese phonetics and anyway, it came out \u0022Hey! They\u0027re s.h.i.t.t.i.n.g. over there!\u0022\n\nNeedless to say the whole class started laughing. Even the teacher was trying to hold her laughter.
