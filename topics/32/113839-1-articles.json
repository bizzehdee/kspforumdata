What is your ascent profile like?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been having trouble getting a previously sound (turbojet) spaceplane to orbit and I can\u0027t decide if I need to change the plane\u0027s design or change how I\u0027m flying it (or possibly both).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreviously I had a very simple ascent profile; climb to 10km at 45 degrees, pitch down to 20 degrees, carry on till speed started dropping then fire up the rocket engines (jets would flame out and be shutdown a little later) ....space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith my previously reliable 1.0.2 spaceplane using that profile I can barely make orbit, and if I do make orbit I\u0027m too low on liquid fuel to deorbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what changes to your ascent profile have you made in 1.0.3 and is there anything significantly different about your designs. I\u0027m particularly interested in TurboJet based spaceplane approaches. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gzshkdYl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gzshkdYl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/katateochi/TurboJet-CrewSSTO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalx.com/katateochi/TurboJet-CrewSSTO\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has 6 TurboJets and two LV-T45s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RidingTheFlow","CreatedById":111197,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T13:19:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIts not down do ascent profile...
