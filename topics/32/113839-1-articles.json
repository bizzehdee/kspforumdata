What is your ascent profile like?\n\nI\u0027ve been having trouble getting a previously sound (turbojet) spaceplane to orbit and I can\u0027t decide if I need to change the plane\u0027s design or change how I\u0027m flying it (or possibly both).\n\nPreviously I had a very simple ascent profile; climb to 10km at 45 degrees, pitch down to 20 degrees, carry on till speed started dropping then fire up the rocket engines (jets would flame out and be shutdown a little later) ....space. \n\nWith my previously reliable 1.0.2 spaceplane using that profile I can barely make orbit, and if I do make orbit I\u0027m too low on liquid fuel to deorbit.\n\nSo what changes to your ascent profile have you made in 1.0.3 and is there anything significantly different about your designs. I\u0027m particularly interested in TurboJet based spaceplane approaches. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![gzshkdYl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/gzshkdYl.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://kerbalx.com/katateochi/TurboJet-CrewSSTO](http://kerbalx.com/katateochi/TurboJet-CrewSSTO)\n\u003E \n\u003E It has 6 TurboJets and two LV-T45s\n\u003E \n\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"RidingTheFlow","CreatedById":111197,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T13:19:16Z","Content":"Its not down do ascent profile... With 1.0.3 you need different TWR/deltaV distribution between airbreathing/rocket thrust (note that now ISP for jet engine is worse too, so need more fuel for same dV)."},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T13:52:01Z","Content":"Jet fuel consumption has doubled, but heating is much less threatening. Pull the nose down further and keep it in the high jet thrust altitudes until you\u0027re on the edge of cooking; maximise your speed before lighting the rockets."}]}
