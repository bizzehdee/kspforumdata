The result was a lot of awkward silence and \u0022uh, I\u0027m just going to screw around in KSP\u0022 from Damion since there wasn\u0027t anything else planned sometimes. Of course screwing around in KSP isn\u0027t bad by itself, but people expect a bit more from an official stream. The two streams, one or development one for community model was a bit of a failure IMO, because bringing in devs every week wasn\u0027t possible. Also some people kept confusing the one of the other. Merging those two streams and having the devs come over sometimes, when they have stuff to show and discuss, and focusing on the community interviews etc. at other times is best. Just seemed redundant and sometimes less is better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally, some development news are best served in the short section of the KSP weekly. If something big is coming a dev can post a dev blog entry or go talk with maxmaps on the stream.
