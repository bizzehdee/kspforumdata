It seemed Ok, and the challenge is in getting there\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEve - its too purple, even Nova Silisko (spelling?) regrets this. Also the gravity is too high IMO... but maybe thats because I want it to be more analagous to venus. I\u0027d change it to have a thicker atmosphere, less gravity, and less purple. From orbit Scatterer (or is it scatterer\u002B \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E) makes it better as the purple color is more \u0022washed out\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbin... could use some evidence of plate tectonics... and other evidence of habitation. perhaps more river features, some mesas, large canyons... some areas with really dense ground scatter to look like forrests, and not the same old grasslands dotted with some trees.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMun - those giant craters often look really bad from orbit. the procedural ones are fine in the highlands... but the giant craters, especially with their nearly uniform size and somewhat even spacing... just looks wrong to me. Also I\u0027d cut down on the procedurals within the giant craters so their basins are smoother like real lunar mare\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMinmus - this thing just shouldn\u0027t exist... how did it form, what is it made of (the in game reports don\u0027t really answer that), what are those giant flats?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuna: needs to look more like there actually used to be water there... a few valleys vaguely connected to low areas that could have been seas aren\u0027t enough. Those ancient sea beds should be flatter too, IMO. Where are the deltas? the tributaries? sedimentary layers and eroded sandstone, etc. Also... a planet of that size, with atmosphere and evidence of past water... was there no volcanic outgassing involved in that? there\u0027s not a signle identifiable volcanic structure on it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, from orbit, it really does seem toy sized because of the lack of a detailed surface. One can look down at it, and now that no more hidden detail will show up when you get closer... just a bit of heightmap noise\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIke: Where... are... the... CRATERS???\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDres: I don\u0027t know... its not like ceres has super interesting terrain features either. Now I guess we can put some white spots in the bottoms of craters... and um, yea... I previously thought that some pallas/vesta/hygeia analogues to keep it company and make it seem more like something in an asteroid belt would be fun... but its only fun from the map view, and ads 3-4 even more boring worlds\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJool: Too green, needs more variation in color from cloud bands... the scatterer whitewashing effect makes it better though\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTylo: Its a gimmick having a moon nearly kerbin sized with atmosphere, but like moho, its an interesting challenge. As I go there for the challenge, I mostly just land whereever and go back to orbit in short order... its nice and flat which makes it easy... but if I were to actually want to make a base there, I\u0027ll bet it gets pretty boring. Add some fissures like what Eeloo has, and sparse procedural craters... maybe a cyrovolcano or two (at least a dome/shield/couldera for one)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaythe: Another gimmick, O2 and water far from kerbin - its a fun gimmick. The world is mostly featureless water and the land is mostly featureless sandbars. I think its none transparent water surface looks pretty bad and its water should look more like kerbin\u0027s... but scatterer effects fix this. With scatterer installed, no issues\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal: Meh, I think as an ice world, Eeloo\u0027s fractured surface looks better than Vals...
