It has 6 of the lengthed roundified fuel tanks from the KSPX pack and a turbojet engine. Underneath it, about where the inlet on the X-51 is, there is a radial airScoop. What you can\u0027t see from the pics is there are 3 circular intakes and another airScoop inside it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen like the X-51 it has an SRB which starts it off once it is dropped from the plane. Here is it sitting on its trailer waiting for the plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/tkEsrXz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tkEsrXzl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tkEsrXzl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight, the plane, hmmmm, well yes, this actually proved much much harder than the actual ScramJet. I had a small test plane to take it up during testing, but I really wanted to drop it from something that was kinda like the B-52 that the real one is take up on. And that was kinda tricky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter many many crashes this was the result; a kinda B-52(ish) plane (type thing). I say \u0027type thing\u0027 cos if it was actually a plane it would fly like one.
