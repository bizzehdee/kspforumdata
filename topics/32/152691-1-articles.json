I purchased and installed it immediately after reading the description and a few reviews. Relatively speaking I am brand new to this game, and never experienced a world before the 1.1 or 1.2 patch. Over the past year I have to admit I have fallen completely in love with this \u0022game\u0022 or simulator or life experience. Honestly at this point I\u0027m not sure what to call it. No matter what you call it this program has to be one of the best experiences I have ever had in front of a computer monitor. After watching several of Scott Manley\u0027s tutorials I started to get better at KSP (I killed way fewer kerbals) and after a few weeks I was able to land on several muns and a few planets. Looking back on the past 10-12 months playing KSP and reading a lot of the forums I developed an interesting question for those veteran players. What is something you think a player from 1.1\u002B should know about the early years of KSP?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-28T07:49:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222866829\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022152691\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221480316290\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022170442\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SavageAngel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n53 minutes ago, SavageAngel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is something you think a player from 1.1\u002B should know about the early years of KSP?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe big one:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack in the days, the atmosphere model used to be much simpler. Each part had a \u0022drag\u0022 value, and well, that was it. Didn\u0027t matter if it was behind some other part. It just gave your vessel that much drag. With the result that a thin, pointy rocket stack had exactly the same drag behavior as a broad pancake built out of the same parts. And nosecones made rockets perform worse, not better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDrag was very high overall, too. Planes flew slower at all altitudes (but could reach higher altitudes). Rockets had to be manually throttled to roughly around a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 2.0 across the first half of the ascent, or they would exceed terminal velocity and lose huge amounts of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to drag.

staging was used to build large, efficient rockets without massive parts. \u00A0The key thing to learn about this is that you need not always stage vertically, and that drop tanks still come in handy (our fuel tanks are considerably heavier when empty than in real life). \u00A0One reason asparagus staging was so popular was that due to a trick of the atmosphere, you wanted to keep your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E=2.0 pretty much through your entire ascent. \u00A0Having equal sized asparagus staging made this work. \u00A0For multiple asparagus staging (i.e. more than two tanks\u002Bengines) it is almost certainly more efficient to at least double the number of fuel tanks on the stages dropped earlier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- One useful trick in the early game that comes from this idea is to put a fuel tank (roughly twice the size of your \u0022last stage\u0022 tank)\u00A0on top of the capsule (via staging couplers). \u00A0As you burn the \u0022last fuel\u0022 tank keep pumping fuel from the top tank [if you are in career mode you will need to have at least the science building upgraded, I\u0027m less sure about the requirements each revision]. \u00A0This basically gives you a \u0022free staging\u0022 without the need to buy or carry an extra engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSolid rocket boosters [SRBs] still work. \u00A0In the current game, they seem to exist for the first two-three career mode launches, and are only seen again for efficient designs with the kickback boosters. \u00A0Nevertheless, they not only have cheap delta-v, they have even cheaper thrust when you need it. \u00A0In general, you will still fire all your SRBs on the pad (although missions that simply specify \u0022escape Kerbin\u0022 might be ideal for a second [one size smaller] \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E stage). \u00A0In earlier editions it was possible to get to the Mun via multiple \u0022layer cakes\u0022 of RT-10 \u0022hammers\u0022 (the then smallest booster possible), but I doubt that it is possible to stabilize such a system now (although you wouldn\u0027t need nearly the struts).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore career mode there were these suggestions for exploring KSP:\u00A0\u003Ca

frustrated by career mode and feel it was a bad move. \u00A0Being aware of the old campaigns gives you more options.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that since the whole point is to skip the bits in career you don\u0027t like, don\u0027t bother with docking if you really want to go to the Mun (although I strongly recommend going to Minmus first, once you adjust your angular inclination it is much easier to get to*, land [the purple bits are all flat: this is important], get off, and get home).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* technically it takes about\u00A0100m/s more\u00A0delta-v to get to Minmus, but you save that in landing/relaunching issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne \u0022lost art\u0022 is the munshot. \u00A0My guess is that it predates maneuver nodes, but I wasn\u0027t around for that. \u00A0Simply wait until the Mun appears on the horizon, and then keep burning towards it (like going to orbit and keep burning until you get an intercept). \u00A0Expect to stop and create a maneuver node correction once you get to space (you should be well on your way). \u00A0This is *slightly* more efficient than a parking orbit, but typically only used to get to the Mun since you can\u0027t create a maneuver node on the pad (a significant bug, but apparently baked deep in the code). \u00A0Don\u0027t sweat too much over it as you don\u0027t gain all that much by not using a parking orbit (NASA typically used it for probes, but I think stopped with New Horizons. \u00A0I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if NASA probes to Mars (and closer) still use parking orbits).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd of course, signs you are watching an obsolete tutorial:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nPlayer flies straight up for at least 5000m to get

is when you put a solid rocket booster (almost always a RT-10 hammer, but presumably nowadays you would use an RT-5 flea) under another rocket without a decoupler, and light the above engine in such a way that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E exploded to remove its own mass (and anything connected to it). \u00A0The two motivations to this concept was that you don\u0027t get decouplers when you start the game (and \u0022career mode\u0022 then was what we now call \u0022science mode\u0022. \u00A0No limitations on parts or mass (which might exist in science mode for all I know)), the other was that a RT-10 hammer was pretty useful, but costs 400 funds (may have been cheaper) while the decoupler also\u00A0costs 400 funds, often instantly obsoleting the RT-10. \u00A0On the other hand, if build a final liquid stage, a RT-10 under that, and three RT-10s under that (all with no decouplers), you could go into orbit with the first mission, merely by exploding each stage as needed [that design is from very poor memory, and I\u0027m not even sure where the old rockets are saved. \u00A0But I launched plenty of those rockets into orbit, both to refine the design and to determine which kerbals had the \u0022bada55\u0022 tag (Jeb loves the flight, Bill and Bob not so much).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was taken to extreme lengths, most famously\u00A0Scott Manley\u0027s videos on unlocking the entire science tree with two missions (the first landed on the Mun with beefed up rocket like above. \u00A0Of course it did involve things like landing a rocket with 4 fuel tanks, an LV-T30 engine, and no landing legs. \u00A0I suspect that Abysall Lurker did it first, although everybody remembers seeing the Scott Manley

\u00A0But most of the reasons for it are gone, and \u00A0I\u0027d look more toward all the many things you can do with kickbacks for your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E needs. \u00A0Don\u0027t expect much from the fleas, but that\u0027s all you have for mission

layers of 1,1,1,1,5,5,9. \u00A0The key to survival was flying with the capsule upside down (so it would be stable coming down right side up, and survive), and attaching to parachutes via modular girders to the sides. \u00A0Unfortunately this is not terribly aerodynamic going up and requires so many boosters, as well as far too many simple fins so that you can\u0027t do it with a first mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGave up trying to get to orbit. \u00A0The catch is that you have to burn a significant amount of delta-v above 70,000m. \u00A0Lowering the thrust from boosters only helps so much. \u00A0My old trick of turning the last booster upside down (so it can be fired after waiting for AP) appears to cause too much drag (I *did* manage [please ignore the cheating launch towers holding it to an angle: if that worked, I\u0027m sure I could finagle the means to emulate it legally]\u00A0to escape the atmosphere with an inverted flea, but it doesn\u0027t have the delta-v it needs. \u00A0Two might work, but that\u0027s a lot of fleas to add to the lower stages (curse you, tyrannical rocket equation).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset
