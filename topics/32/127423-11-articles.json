It made orbit successfully, and was in the process of deorbiting to land. However, the area chosen was horrible for landing. While descending, it was discovered we\u0027d be landing in the Dunian highlands, which were around 8Km High. The drogue shoots fired successfully, but before the lander could open the primary chutes, it hit the ground at around 50 m/s, because I was firing the nukes at full force. The nukes all broke, and the core hab/constructrion module rolled away, along with about 5 rocket parts pods that I brought to allow base construction. I was immobile... but I did notice I had \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E control still. I went to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and devised a claw arm to attach myself to one of the rocket part pods. (Note I was using EPL). I rushed back to Ares I, and discovered I had no workshops, so no productivity... so nothing would be built on this day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0As a response to Ares I, the Ares II was sent up at the next launch window, with the capability of being able to build more of itself. It had everything neccessary; a drill, smelter, and workshop. Or so I thought. It turns out the Extraplanetary Surface Structures\u0027 central Hub Module\u0027s workshop productivity factor... doesn\u0027t make it a workshop. So stuck with only about 40 parts, and broken solar panels, I made a new solar panel and drove along for a while, because the base was mobile. However, during an EVA mission, I did four-times warp. This caused the base to freak out and flip; the Smelter and Drill were destroyed, and all that remained was the central hub with the 4 terrified kerbals inside it. Another mission to Duna would not be devised for 3 years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Ares III was finally sent up. It created an entire city, with an air force to boot. However, please note that nobody died during the previous missions. It was during the Ares III mission. The central infastructure module landed a mere 3 Km from Ares II, so when I finally made a hab module for the base, I sent it off over there to pick the old crew up. (Remember, all my bases had wheels to be mobile if need be) So on the way there, I went up some steep terrain. This\u0027ll be important later. So about 3 days later, I arrived at the Ares II Final Site, and picked up the two pilots, one engineer, and one scientist that remained. This was gonna be a great day! Then on my way back, we were going down that steep terrain. Suddenly, the control Cupola exploded. I guess we hit a violent terrain change. The hab modules were now hurtling downhill at 40\u002B m/s. In a hurry, I EVA\u0027d the two pilots, and made them jump off the speeding hab. While controling one of the EVA\u0027d kerbals, I watched his friend hit the ground, and speghettify due to a kraken attack. Shortly thereafter, I saw the hab modules exploding while impacting a cliff. I then watched, in terror, as my own kerbal impacted the ground. He rolled for a few seconds, then when he got to around 10 m/s... he speghettified. That caused the deaths of 4 kerbals. The sole survivor of Ares II, who was left outside for the two years between the missions in his EVA mission, then walked back to the sole survivor of the Ares III mission. The entire base was only populated by a pilot, and an engineer for 3 years, until they finally rescued all 8 crew of the Ares I.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SiriusRocketry","CreatedById":178125,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-15T02:09:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn early incredibly over engineered Duna rocket never even lifted a kilometer of the pad.

The plane was based on a previous line of sub-orbital planes that were quite unstable but mostly flyable. What could possibly go wrong? I flew straight into orbit and performed the rendezvous and it was smooth the whole way. de-orbit was uneventful. The glide path looked ok. Somewhere about mach 3.5 and still over 20 km in the air the airframe decided it liked yawing left better than flying straight. The flat spin was recoverable after losing 5 km altitude and it still had the speed to make the runway. At 2km up and still a touch over mach 1 it decided upside down was better. An engine burn and some frantic inputs put me over the ocean at about 200m and still mach 1. Thats when it suddenly rolled left and yawed into the water. The left wing exploded and the plane rolled right and pitched hard into the waves. 1 landing gear and the cargo bay with all my science is all that survived. So, it was a success after all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Inverurie Jones","CreatedById":154679,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-15T19:45:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn unfortunate glitch resulted in the simultaneous de-orbiting of \u003Cem\u003ESpacelab 1 \u003C/em\u003Eand the KSS \u003Cem\u003EDiscovery. \u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI sent all the crew to the REKT escape pods and ejected them in the upper atmosphere.
