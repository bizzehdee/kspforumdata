Question: There are a couple really awesome splash screens that show during program launch. Any idea where I can download those in high res for wallpapers? If not available, I\u0027d really like to see the published make those available.\n\nIn particular, the ones that I just love is the 3 kerbals in a capsule with semi-transparent reflections of different color light. I really would like that for my wallpaper.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nJaz\n\n![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T02:30:25Z","Content":"Also, is there a way to add screenshots to the loading screen?

Make this a thing, with your mighty .dll files of mightyness!\n\nTo answer OP\u0027s question, I don\u0027t believe that you can download the splash screens. However, there are several amazing threads on the forum with really cool wallpapers."},{"CreatedByName":"Brofessional","CreatedById":2080,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T06:28:39Z","Content":"[![IYctRREl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/IYctRREl.jpg)](http://i.imgur.com/IYctRRE.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T06:42:29Z","Content":"I stand corrected.

Also, it would be nice if there was higher resolution available as that is blurry when filling my background. So, did you extract that from the game files or is there a link here somewhere? Great start though!!!!\n\nJaz"},{"CreatedByName":"Nemrav","CreatedById":91029,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T21:11:35Z","Content":"That picture was actually fan made..
