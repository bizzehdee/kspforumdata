I was determined to land on and return from Eve without any outside help (wiki) before visiting any other planets. After missing the planet based on my calculated phase angle 4 times I finally got all 3 ships involved in the operation orbiting around Eve. After a successfully landing on the planet and having waited quite a while for a return phase angle I was finally ready to head back into orbit, so I ignited my engines and... nothing.
