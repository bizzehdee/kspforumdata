What do I mean by this is that you can\u0027t really keep your design smooth and nice when you need to use small Material Bay and Mystery Goo to get science. This, especially before you get to better science equipment, forces you to build really ugly things like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tgeQnja.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tgeQnja.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that now technically we have lab module but it doesn\u0027t \u0022produce\u0022 science, only refines it. I would like my spacecraft to look good and when you can stuck the Mystery Goo into the 6S Service Compartment Tubes there\u0027s nothing you can do with Material Bay. Spacecraft with science parts look especially ugly during the landing on Kerbin - you have your pod (and heatshield if you use Deadly Reentry) and on top of it just a pile of science stuff.
