I had never experienced this issue before, so I force quit ksp while at the squad monkey loading screen. I tried reopening it, but it kept closing, leading me to believe that my copy is corrupted. How is this possible? Can I prevent it from happening again? I\u0027m sorry if this is a little informal of a bug report, but the issue has been resolved, I just want to know if you people out there have had anything similar to this, or if it is preventable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leopardenthusiast","CreatedById":26084,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T21:52:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI did this once.
