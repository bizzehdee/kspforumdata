I realized that I like it this way. It has let me write some great stories in fan fiction, as well as turn my attention to many other parts of the forums. I think it also took a lot of stress and anger at others off my back, and I don\\\u0027t get too angry about things now. I will be playing Radion\\\u0027s RP, but I understand there will be better rules too. I can\\\u0027t believe I\\\u0027m saying this, but thanks, guys for deleting the RP forums.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
