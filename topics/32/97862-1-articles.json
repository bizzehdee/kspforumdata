Some mods put each part in its own folders, and others will put several to a folder (for sharing textures and the like). The main thing you need to do is deleted the \u0022.cfg\u0022 files for the parts in question, and those parts won\u0027t load. The models and textures will still take up memory as well, unless you delete those too, so this is generally easier when the mod doesn\u0027t put more than one part in the same folder.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Delrey","CreatedById":131343,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T17:15:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone know a safe way to disable MKS systems?
