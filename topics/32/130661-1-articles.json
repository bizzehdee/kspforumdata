environment.\u00A0 Myself, I\u0027m used to working on six-nines-of-reliability software that has to live for years in punishing environments, and get worked on by a wide variety of teams.\u00A0 So every line of code needs to be rock-solid, thoroughly unit- and integration-tested, and independently reviewed before check-in.\u00A0 And yes, it\u0027s very reusable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eslow\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 If the teams I\u0027m on had written KSP, it would be much more solid, much more \u0022elegantly\u0022 coded, far better documented, lower bug count.\u00A0 But it would have taken twice the time and five times the manpower that Squad had to put on this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey\u0027re working on a shoestring, with very few developers and a tight schedule.\u00A0 If it comes down to \u0022just bang out something quick and get this feature out the door\u0022 versus \u0022there\u0027s no feature\u0022, there are hard choices to be made.\u00A0 You can\u0027t compromise on player experience... but programmability is negotiable.\u00A0 Different environment, different tradeoffs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd what I\u0027m saying is, given their constraints, I think Squad\u0027s done an admirable job
