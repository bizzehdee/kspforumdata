Problem: Jeb was up there in a ship I was constructing in orbit (which was out of date by this point because of it sitting there during science missions) attached to the tanker, and he had no parachute for whatever reason so I had to send Kurt up to get him. Hilarity ensued. I built a jet lifter to get me up to ~15km and then dropped it and fired off a Skipper, everything was going fine. I drop that stage and I\u0027ve got a nuke engine and I run up and dock with the station with plenty of fuel to spare, not that it mattered, and EVA Jeb over to his taxi ride. I go to deorbit and, well I was trying out the larger parachute on my 3-Kerbal command module and turns out that thing snaps right off if it\u0027s the only chute attached (or maybe it\u0027s because I put a battery between that and the module).

So I brought that down to a ~90km orbit while I wait for someone to come get Bob because I didn\u0027t actually plan ahead for when that one would have to come down.
