My full mod ones I have the Powertech and dynasat mods. Also the Kw and nova parts packs. The satellite mod for the powertech system and the Zoxgene mod of course. To land that close together actually is quite a challenge since decellerations and maintaining speed are never the same, lots of manual course corrections means it is alot of balancing and tweaking as I land.

With a vertical lander, can use the gymbal to eliminate most of your horizontal velocity. My best tip I found is since a small lander is so controllable, jettison your ASAS and only use an SAS. The SAS only will stop any inertial movement. You can still give control orders, but the motion will stop after giving the command without the ASAS. So turn on your SAS, and hit the caps locks button so the commands are small, and it makes it easy to give the small adjustments needed to ensure a smooth glide path.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jolee1868","CreatedById":28633,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-23T00:05:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eman i started trying to play with the mods you mentioned and im having a horrible time getting them all working together.
