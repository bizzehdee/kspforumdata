Will the update come with some sort of guide? For instance, I would have never guessed that the LV-N will now use only LF and no oxidizer if I hadn\u0027t stumbled across that bit here in the forums. Likewise, I will have no idea what launch profile to use (i.e. when to do gravity turn) with he new aero. I guess part of the fun will be in experimenting with these things, but will there be any help?"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T16:15:04Z","Content":"I am looking forward to seeing the new 1.0 tutorials."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T17:14:26Z","Content":"See the full feature list and changelog in the [1.0 Grand Discussion thread.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116772-The-KSP-1-0-Grand-Discussion-Thread-Conquering-Space-Was-Never-This-Easy%21)"}]}
