Something in \u0022quotes\u0022 means it was directly said, though I frequently don\u0027t bother with that. I removed all formatting. Until the forum allows me to directly enter tags I\u0027m not going to bother with it. If you want to watch the episode yourself, you can find it at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.twitch.tv/ksptv/profile/past_broadcasts\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.twitch.tv/ksptv/profile/past_broadcasts\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSquadcast was just under an hour.\u003Cbr\u003E\n0:00\u003Cbr\u003E\nSquadcast starts with a screen that says \u0022MAXMAPS\u0022 on it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe\u0027s doing Sandbox, to build an all-stock turkey.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDr_Turkey adds himself to the title screen at about 9:20 (Nothing much happens before this)\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe starts playing at about 12:00\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe goes to the VAB.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe discusses music on Twitch. Decides not to due to DMCA notices.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe plan is to take the Turkey to Mun.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe asks TriggerAU about what he\u0027s working on\u003Cbr\u003E\nTriggerAU: Working on 3 things\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) Helping Ted and the QA team, escalating things tothe right people\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) Doing actual testing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n15:00\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) KSPedia. He had to learn a lot, and even what he knew he had to figure out how to explain it so anybody can understand it. Explaining the Oberth Effect can be hard.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe turkey rocket is coming along, but so far looks nothing like an actual turkey.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe\u0027s doing \u0022onion or asparagus layering.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe adds extra turkey feet, which the chat realizes means more turkey legs for Thanksgiving.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe rocket has 4 mainsails for 5 orange tanks.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd it looks nothing like a turkey. Not even a soy turkey.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso his strutting is going to encourage rotation.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe video cut to mid-launch. His ship was spinning out of control. I\u0027m not surprised but I din\u0027t see what happened exactly.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe reverts, and launches again.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHis 3 outer mainsails are going, but not the central one. He activates it manually.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe ship is surprisingly stable.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe launches straight up to 10km, then... continues going straight up.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe drops the side tanks when they run out, at about 25km going 900m/s straight up.\u003Cbr\u003E\nActually he doesn\u0027t drop them so much as explode his whole ship. I think there may have been clipping.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Now it looks like a turkey.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nNote: The ship looks nothing like a turkey.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe decides to try putting the whole thing in a fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n30:00\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe adds a fairing, but not the decoupler between it and the engine.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe also adds 2 jumbo wings. I am terrified.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe wants to add more power. For some reason.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe adds 6 SRBs.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey\u0027re giving away copies of the game.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe launches. Acceleration is high.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe rocket flips over, then flips again. He\u0027s essentially hovering 1km up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022It was going so well.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nDr. Turkey you have an odd definition of \u0022Well.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Kerbals live somehow.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe reverts to launch for some reason.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe launches again, and flips over at about 2km. Then everything explodes.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBack to the VAB.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe opts to start using SAS parts. Because the problem was that he wasn\u0027t going fast enough. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe remembers the decoupler between the rocket and fairing this time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n45:00\u003Cbr\u003E\nLaunch!\u003Cbr\u003E\nTWR is like 2.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSRBs die, he throttles up.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe drops the side tanks, they slide down and somehow don\u0027t kill the center stack.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe cranks over only after reaching space.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey give away another code.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe reaches orbit somehow. A better launch would probably get this ship to Jool. I think he\u0027ll make it to Mun.\u003Cbr\u003E\nExcept he burns way too much, and puts his Ap way too high.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe\u0027s trying to quickly catch up to Mun. He knows it\u0027s going to come back around, right?\u003Cbr\u003E\nThese noises he\u0027s making are kinda crazy.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe time warps too much and collides with Kerbin at high warp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Huh.
