Its the big one, the one I\u0027ve been waiting for since V0.22. KSP is finally complete and stable enough, and my computer sufficient to support the modload I need to create a KSP build that I perceive as 100% feature-complete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI switch vessels, game locks up, computer crashed.

The advantages are;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003E-\u00A0it\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0keeps track of the order of things, you don\u0027t have to name saves with a version or whatever to keep track of their order.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- KSP just ignores the git folder, so as far as KSP is concerned there is one save file to worry about/parse/load into memory (given KSP\u0027s general approach of loading everything into RAM I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if it just\u00A0loads every .sfs file, even if it doesn\u0027t need it...and given \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s experience that might be what was causing things to stop working).\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Space. ok not much of a problem in these days of terabyte HDs, but my current career save is 14mb,\u00A0\u00A0so keeping a bunch of copies of that starts to mount up. My git folder is ~70mb right now and that contains every \u0022backup\u0022 of both quicksave and persistent files (600\u002B versions) going right back to the start of the career AND every version of every craft.....way more space efficient.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n- git (and I\u0027m sure other VC tools) is designed to be pushed and pulled, so porting a save to another location/machine is easy (ok copy paste is easy too, but this is easier), and fast (only changed content is moved).\u003Cbr\u003E\nDisadvantage: you need to know git (or whatever VC tool you choose), which can be a bit odd initially, but using git for KSP purposes only needs the most basic level of git understanding. (I could do a post on how to setup and use git for KSP if\u00A0folk are interested).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-25T15:01:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223421473\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022176997\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221532457453\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002235181\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022katateochi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 hours ago, katateochi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat bloat do you get in your save folder?
