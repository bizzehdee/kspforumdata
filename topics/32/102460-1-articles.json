Really, I take information from the game and use that new knowledge to further infer other events in the game. Want to travel from one side of a distant solar system to the other, and then over there land on a tiny planet\u0027s moon? Here I will use everything I know about the spaceflight physics to infer the best path and method of travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP already does this marvellously. With many parts being unique, you learn how each one of them acts and behaves with physics and gameplay. Much like the previous example, I will what I have learned to build the most steady, flyable, effective, and practical rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love learning how games work and using that to my advantage because it is such a more rich experience, especially in a game such as KSP where the knowledge you gain is actually useful in real life. Of course, real life spaceflight is more complex than what is possible in KSP. So a more complex KSP (given the complexity would be in the direction of realism, which is what I would like) would provide all the more to learn about real life spaceflight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid this essay make sense, guys?

At this point, for me, it has become a matter of trying to do things in a more modular fashion, trying to do things in a more efficient way, and throwing in as many mods as I can (remotetech, life support etc.) to increase the number of things I need to take care of for a successful mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would want more reasons to revisit a body. I feel science could be expanded in a way that mirrors real life - ie one discovery begats more questions, that need further experiments, which in turn bring further questions which need answers. The current science instruments, while good for what they do, are not really set up for that.

Science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe gathering and processing of science should, I think, require a bit more effort than simply clicking buttons in X location. For instance, something along the lines of the geology mod that was in development for a bit, where you actually had to search for surface samples and they\u0027d have certain levels of quality (Which could be further enhanced by having the level of your scientist kerbals play into it). And then it could be further indepth by requiring a certain number of samples of varying quality in a given biome to retrieve the full science value. Samples could also take time to actually process back on Kerbin depending on their quality, which would also be good for giving the Mobile Lab more of a point all around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in order to really justify it along those lines, there\u0027d also have to be a reward for overcoming that kind of a hurdle, particularly if X experiment requires a lot of input. What could be done is to have it split where you can do more work for a bigger payoff in the long term (IE, look for higher quality samples to bring back rather than a mix from high to low) or get a smaller short term payoff that will require less work for a more immediate return (IE, a lot of lower quality samples that will be processed more quickly). Both options could be enhanced by the MSL (which would, I think, be a bit higher up on the tech tree), where you\u0027d get more science from the quicker option, and more immediate science from the slower option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis idea extended to all of the experiment options (also, stockify Dmagic already!) wouldn\u0027t be overly complex, and would extend activities like landing on the Mun by a bit without it being arbitrary.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daze","CreatedById":57997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T17:01:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Azimech\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Azimech\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt doesn\u0027t have to be about \u0022need\u0022.\u003Cp\u003EBut i\u0027d like a game where you start with a very basic, low thrust/low reliability/high mass/high fuel consumption jet engine, that the user can develop by spending time and effort in search of the right geometry, clearances, materials etc. Or just spend A LOT OF money to buy an uprated version.

Currently it\u0027s not *quite* detailed enough; jet engines are a reasonable example, you can just stuff an engine on what would actually be the tailpipe of the entire jet, drop some intakes randomly and off you go. Smaller planes are generally designed around the engine and large ones have to give some thought to how the engines are mounted, it\u0027d be nice if there was at least a little reflection of that. I have some vague design of a modular system that involves seperate intake/core/output devices which between them can make a jet engine - that sort of thing would fit the tech tree quite well, in fact, you can approximate all sorts of jet engines with surprisingly few different components. Doing the same for rocket engines wouldn\u0027t be a big step either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience is the same - planting flags \u0026amp; putting a finger in the ground to take a sample is not really entertaining, especially when you\u0027ve made the effort to get to somewhere. Having experiments that actually *need* a base because they\u0027re complicated/multistage and time consuming would drive so much gameplay it\u0027d be another game on top, almost; you\u0027d need ISRU or at least a good logistics chain, ground structures and connections, the works. If you had to pay more attention to the make-up of the planet involved and change your solution to match - perhaps including having to send robot scout probes - rather than just plopping the same science base down everywhere that\u0027d be even better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t want it to be Orbiter though - if I wanted something like that then I\u0027d just play Orbiter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingPete","CreatedById":127384,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T22:04:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jarmund\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jarmund\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI want the engineers to perform sub-par if not provided with coffee.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat could be a good option for a simple life-support mechanic.

Same with rocket engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP can be so much more an educational tool than it is now, especially in the engineering department. More and more people are less interested in stacking a rocket engine to a tank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow about designing turbopumps, valves, bell shapes ... test them and see what kind of ISP/TWR you get out of it. Change a few parameters, test again. If all those kids start with these engineering challenges early, you\u0027ll see what kind of wonderful new engines the future will have!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, look at my stock turboshaft engines. From the first model, i\u0027ve increased thrust per blower from 7kN to 27kN, and max rpm from 10rad/s to 33rad/s, in 6 weeks time!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonaly I think thats a bit beyond the scope of what KSP is intended to be at this time. However that would be exelent fodder for an expansion pack. I think KSP is fine as is for what its trying to be, a fun but educational game thats able to teach a fair bit about orbital mechanics. Alot of the construction of the rockets is abstracted because you really dont need to know everything about how a rocket works to slap togeather stock parts and putter around a digital solar system. I could easily see squad makeing a second game that focuses more on the engineering aspects that can mesh seamlessly with KSP however. IF you like designing the rocket moters themselves you can tinker in the new game/expansion and then import your design into KSP and try to fly it. IF someone does not want to futz with all that and just fly starships around and build stations they just stick with the base game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonaly I wouldnt mind paying for a game/expansion like that. It would add alot to KSP but I already feel bad about how much I\u0027ve goten out of the game for such a low pricetag as it is. IT would be far more worthy a concept for a paied expansion/DLC than some of the crap the big studios push on their customers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T22:15:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I agreed the game could stand some more fuels.
