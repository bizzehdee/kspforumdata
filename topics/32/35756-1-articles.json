I think Eve is more fun because it looks interesting with its radioactive ground and toxic atmosphere.

You can find tons of Laythe-related challenges, artworks, and mission reports around here. Duna? Ehh... not that much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have asked why before (thread got lost in the April Derp) and they gave me tons of reasons (primarily because of its Kerbin-like vibe, and jet engines).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiron","CreatedById":51836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T18:08:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause it\u0027s easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool, Dres, Eeloo, and Moho are all hard to get to, either because of the delta-V requirements (Moho, Jool, Eeloo), or because of irregular orbits (Dres, Eeloo), or both. Vall, Tylo, Bop, Pol, Eeloo, Dres, Ike, Gilly and Moho all lack atmospheres, which makes them much harder to land on. Some of them also have severe surface irregularities which makes it even harder. Gilly has the lowest gravity of anything, which makes it hard to land on at all. This leaves Eve and Duna as the easiest planets to reach and land on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve has the third highest gravity (after Kerbol and Jool) and second thickest atmosphere (after Jool) of any body in the Kerbol system, making it extremely easy to land on, but extremely hard to take back off from. You\u0027d have to land something with substantially more delta-V than is required to escape kerbin, and you can\u0027t use jets because there\u0027s no oxygen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis leaves Duna. It has around twice the gravity of the Mun, but also has a (very thin) atmosphere. With good use of aerobraking, it can actually be easier to reach and land on Duna than to land on the Mun. And because of the low gravity and thin atmosphere, it\u0027s relatively easy to get off of: Duna\u0027s atmosphere at Datum is about as thick as Kerbin\u0027s at 8000 meters...and Duna\u0027s covered in highlands that are several KM above Datum, so you\u0027re fairly likely to end up with a surface pressure MUCH lower than that. Duna\u0027s downside? The thin atmosphere makes parachutes hardly work, so successful touchdown is a bit harder (in terms of both difficulty and frequently, in actual impact, which is why there\u0027s been so many weird landing methods for Mars probes) than on Laythe, Kerbin, or Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: As for Laythe, it has a fairly thick, oxygenated (!) atmosphere, but a surface almost entirely covered in oceans. This makes finding a landing spot harder...but as there\u0027s oxygen in the air, you can actually use jet engines there. It\u0027s fairly hard to get there, and once you get there, it\u0027s a PILOTING challenge to actually get to a landing spot and land there. And a lot more fun of a challenge than trying to vacuum land on irregular terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-03T18:15:22Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2013 06:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
