The atmosphere is so thin that the craft is still accelerating at this point while heading towards the periapsis, all while experiencing this excessive heating. If my craft survives, the heating doesn\u0027t really let up until the craft hits the lower atmosphere where it\u0027s thick enough to really start slowing down. This is with default heat settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else experienced this issue? I\u0027ve seen it both in stock and with FAR\u002BDRE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Apparently it\u0027s related to DRE, I just deleted FAR and DRE and it\u0027s much more sane now.
