In my opinion this is exactly the reason why it would be easy to program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the game always has a single gravity well active for an object at a time, why couldn\u0027t you program a gravity well without a planet texture that would have a fixed gravity radius and a gravitic force of zero. It would be like a zero mass singularity.

The game can simulate lagrange points easily, you just add up all the gravitational forces each frame, but solving for the position of the spacecraft at any given point in the future would require numeric integration, there are no shortcuts like there are for two bodies. This would mean that the orbit map view wouldn\u0027t be able to predict your trajectory accurately. If you can solve the n-body problem without numeric integration I\u0027m sure the dev\u0027s would be happy to add lagrange points, and you\u0027ll get a nobel prize to boot!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-15T16:54:48Z\u0022 title=\u002209/15/2012 04:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 15, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Zool\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Szkeptik","CreatedById":40456,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-15T16:58:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zool\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Zool\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s not at all how lagrange points work, they do not act as gravity wells. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI said gravity wells with zero force.
