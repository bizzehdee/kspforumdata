The way I would see it working is this - If you want to fly yourself you do. If you want to \u0027hand off\u0027 to IVA or ground-control you do. While controlled by vehicle or ground crew (for unmanned probes) \u0027autopilot\u0027 is working - with a randomised \u0027reaction time\u0027 and error in the navigation node placement, burn start/end times and steering based on their experience. Presumably, you\u0027d train \u0027ground crew\u0027 pilots in much the same way as \u0027astronauts\u0027 so there shouldn\u0027t be any additional complexity there. You could extend this to \u0027intelligent\u0027 deployment of solar-panels, disabling/enabling electricity-consuming equipment, pumping of fuel between tanks/docked craft, etc. but that\u0027s probably too much trouble for both the developers and the players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. This adds experience and autopilot to the game for those that want it in what I think is a logical and seamless manner. It would even be possible to link autopilot functions to the tech-tree, still affected by experience such that, for instance, ground crews may initially plot manoeuvre nodes (something that should be worked out by ground control before or during the mission anyway) but not execute them, because the radio/telemetry isn\u0027t sufficient for remote guidance. Conversely flight crews could initially execute nodes (because they\u0027re in the vehicle) but not plot them because they don\u0027t have the computing power, astronavigation information and team of physicists/mathematicians to work it all out. In both cases \u0027reaction time\u0027, or initiative, would dictate how quickly they could react during \u0027critical\u0027 manoeuvres such as docking and landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETA: Oh yeah - and messing about with funds, science and reputation is all fine since they don\u0027t change physics.

I\u0027ve always thought that the kerbal experience system ought to work a little like XCOM\u0027s in how kerbals level up. However, that game is not quite KSP, as many have noted it is the player who flies the ship. There is no place in the game where it tells you that \u0027Bobfrey has a 60% chance of making this burn correctly, do you want to fire the engine?\u0027. And I don\u0027t think there ever should be, or anything similar to that. I \u003Cem\u003Elike\u003C/em\u003E being the one to determine whether my ship will land properly on the Mun or not, it gives me more of a sense of accomplishment. I\u0027m also very against buffing the performance of the engines, as I want my ship to perform just as well regardless of which save I fly it in, and which kerbal is piloting it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the arguments for the increased thrust/isp is that they\u0027ll be so small as to not affect gameplay much. My response to that is, why even include the buff in the first place? I want kerbal xp to really matter, and give me a well-defined reason to put more experienced kerbals on my vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, I think that different kerbals ought to have different jobs. You can\u0027t expect Jebediah to fly, collect science, \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E maintain the ship. This also gives a reason to use multiple kerbals on a mission. At the moment, you could send one kerbal all the way out to Eeloo and get just as much science as if you\u0027d sent a large expedition, only at much less expense and weight. Instead, if you can choose to have Jeb fly the ship, Bill handle the repairs, and Bob collect science, this would greatly improve experience, in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGregroxMun had an excellent list of things which the kerbal \u0027jobs\u0027 could look like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97769-Opinions-on-Kerbal-Experience?p=1495214\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1495214\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97769-Opinions-on-Kerbal-Experience?p=1495214\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1495214\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther good ideas I\u0027ve seen tossed around include adding a KAS-like functionality for your experienced engineers, a good pilot could give you extra flight data like Kerbal Engineer does, or even the game limits maneuver nodes until you have a properly-trained navigator onboard. Something I wouldn\u0027t mind may be that a \u0027test-pilot\u0027 kerbal would be able to have his ship survive higher-speed crashes than a newbie. Now this is starting to edge back into \u0027magic\u0027 territory, but crash tolerences aren\u0027t as hard-and-fast physically as isp or thrust are. You often see this sort of thing in stories (oh, x managed to land this ship safely, when no one else could) and it would add more to the narrative in my opinion. (plus it would give a good reason to use different kerbals to test your ships than fly them, motivating a larger kerbonaut roster)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo \u003Cstrong\u003Etl;dr\u003C/strong\u003E, I\u0027m strongly against messing with engine parameters or any physically well-defined values, and would like to see different kerbals specialize in different things, making each kerbal matter more in your space program, rather than just sticking Jebediah on every ship because he gives them a boost.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T16:54:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Franklin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Franklin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe thing is, I looked for discussion on the proposed experience system on the bug tracker and it\u0027s nowhere to be found.

But maybe for slightly different reasons than stated here before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs most of todays playerbases the ksp community is in large parts obsessed with comparing itself to other players. Of course with the (unspoken) intention to feel good (aka better) of themselves in comparison to other people. Granted, in ksp this is a lighter touch of the gaming experience, but one only has to look at all the players that feel entitled or simply \u0022better\u0022 just because they are playing stock, dont touch mechjeb, playing \u0022hardmode\u0022 etc etc. And of course have to inform the public about this all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad knew that all the time imho, and this is one of the main drives to let everything stay \u0022comparable\u0022.

The parts of the playerbase that are mostly interested in \u0022playing\u0022 a fun and in parts realistic game do this with some mods, their own rules (some roleplaying, or these \u0022rocket builders\u0022 with their drama).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis way every player can get into his own career as a ksp player. First steps, looking at other (prominent) players, copying their styles and tabus (inkl. creating his own \u0022i do not mechjeb\u0022 thread), showing around everything build to get cred and maybe ideas, building maybe their own forum persona to get even more cred and so on. Doing challenges, lifting big stuff into lko, dreaming of multiplayer where comparing and bragging with others gets even simpler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis all comes within the systems of ksp. Implementing something like a experience bonus to things like DV diverts strongly from the old ways of comparing the own \u0022achievements\u0022 with others. Even worse, a very experienced kerbal, hero of countless missions and DV \u002B20% asset isnt something to brag with like a \u002B200 mana sword.
