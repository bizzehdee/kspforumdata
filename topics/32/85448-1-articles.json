So I decided to have a look at what is possible in terms of planes on other planets. More specifically, planets without oxygen in the atmosphere (So Duna and Eve).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have some experience with flying planes around on Duna, and the new spaceplane parts will help a lot there. However, I now also have my sights set on Eve. Hence my question: do any of you have experience flying planes around in Eve\u0027s atmospere? What are the main difficulties? Is it possible to maybe get orbit with one (note that it would NOT be an SSTO plane. I\u0027m trying to think up designs that drop just about all tanks as they run out and ditch the wings on high altitude as well.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven how stock aero works, I think that the super thick atmo should give me ridiculous amounts of lift as well (and ridiculous amounts of drag too)? I\u0027d have to run it through kerbal engineer, but I think I might get away with a TWR quite a bit below 1 ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, all of this is pure conjecture and theorycrafting since I have absolutely zero experience with flying winged stuff on Eve. What are your experiences flying winged stuff around in the purple tartarus?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-26T15:12:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFlying on Eve will I think be harder than on Kerbin because of the greater gravity. It\u0027s easy to see that at the same pressure you need more lift.

This cuts your flight time down considerably, but fourtunately with the super thick atmosphere, a plane with large wing surface will be very flighty and will require very little thrust to fly. Because of this, Ion planes are actually quite useful on Eve, especially so that solar panels are more efficient. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t expect to get any Eve plane back into orbit though, Ion planes are hard enough to get into orbit in Kerbin, so even harder on Eve, and the amount of fuel need for a LFO plane would be insane, so that\u0027s unlikely too!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-26T15:22:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is where I wish that electric propellers (ex. from Firespitter or others) were available in stock.

This will end in the plane becoming uncontrollable if you don\u0027t turn off SAS. I, for instance, had an Ion-powered plane ( pic: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://puu.sh/bOFpp/007c4b0d00.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://puu.sh/bOFpp/007c4b0d00.jpg\u003C/a\u003E ) that literally only needed the ion engine to start rolling, after that the infiniglige glitch did fine in keeping me going forwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the thick athmosphere might lead to aerodynamic failures, even in stock.
