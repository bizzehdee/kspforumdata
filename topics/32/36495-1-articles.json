I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s kept updated, but the Muon-detector mod is one that helped find them without giving their location away completely. It let you track them down with hot/cold indications once you were in range of one. ISAmapsat gives you the option to show them on a map when its scanner passes over them. Although, Mapsat seems to be hit or miss for people since the 0.20 update.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpsterMan","CreatedById":32671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-10T01:04:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI did the Munoliths looking at pictures online that people post and trying to guess where they might be.
