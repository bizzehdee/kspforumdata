Its most efficient to take all lateral movement off at a high altitude by lateral thrust parallel to the horizon, this give you lots of time to get it right (see map view) and wastes no fuel as lateral velocity will not increase due to gravity. If you get lateral drift to near zero and allow the ship to fall as fast as possible to the surface and burn at the last moment you spend as little time as possible hovering and wasting fuel fighting gravity and you get straight into the fine adjustments for landing ASAP. It may seem counterintuitive but the faster you approach the less time you are accelerating so the less fuel you use. The later you leave the vertical component of deceleration the more fuel efficient the landing. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DonLorenzo","CreatedById":13642,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-23T13:28:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you sure about that?

When you\u0027ve gotten your landing spot lined up, and you are roughly over the top of it (within a couple km), you should do another retrograde burn to bring your horizontal velocity nearly to zero, or at least low enough to where you will no be moving primarily downward. You should then switch to a vertical attitude and descend without power until you reach 5000 meters above the surface. At this point you should do another burn to bring your vertical velocity down to 30 m/s or so. Descend at this rate, using short periodic burns to keep your velocity down, also using RCS (you should bring plenty) to make final adjustments on your landing spot and to bring your horizontal velocity to zero (move the the retrograde bug to center on the 90 degree dot). At around 500-1000 m AGL, you should slow your descent to around 15 m/s, slowing continuously until you are within a few meters of the surface and moving at no more than about 3 m/s or so. You should be just fine.

I do believe I was wrong. Mea culpa. Here is my explanation. There is a more efficient way to land which involves angled descent, but it is quite tricky to fly unless your craft has good manoevurability. For large craft with low turning speed it is not going to be easy to do and for these the long drop is easier to fly and is only slightly less efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs khyron42 said, when I said a long drop was most efficient I was thinking about efficiency of a long drop over a two stage drop (which is what most of my angled descents turn into). As a basic piloting principle helpful for the hard of landing this remains true, see top spoiler. But the expert angled descent does seem to be more efficient than the long drop.... see below and bottom spoiler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMETHOD : I delivered a lander vehicle with full tanks into various orbits using a previous stage which was discarded at the beginning of each experiment, then a quicksave using F5 was made and both landings were run from the same start orbit shown in the screeny by using F9 to reload it. Then I compared remaining fuel on landing graphically. It is not entirely empirical because it depends on my landing skills but if I am biased I still managed to prove myself wrong so its a pretty ineffectual kind of bias! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn both cases I had \u003Cstrong\u003E5 pixels \u003C/strong\u003E more fuel left after dropping from AP than from PE.

Second advantage is that you can begin your burn at a lower altitude for a given speed because the angle means you have smaller vertical component, this requires exacting piloting but it is possible to realise the benefits of these advantages with real fuel savings see bottom spoiler. You have one disadvantage which is you are dropping for longer but the advantages seem to win.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t know the math but I ran some experiments today. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this experiment I compared a straight drop from approximately AP to an angled drop as shown.

If I did my second two stage drop (top spoiler) properly it shows dropping from a PE of 14km was not as efficient as dropping from AP. So the angled drop has a very narrow window of optimum efficiency. Would be good to be able to predict what this window is from theory \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"khyron42","CreatedById":8551,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-28T15:57:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause we don\\\u0027t precalculate it, I usually end up having to fly every new design twice (or more.)
