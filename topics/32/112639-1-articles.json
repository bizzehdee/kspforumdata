Since this was my first mission gathering data at such a low altitude from Kerbin\u0027s sun I decided to search for information to help me plan the mission.

Remove the ablative from the heatshield before launch to save a lot of weight, it won\u0027t help for long near the sun...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EuyeDy9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EuyeDy9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
