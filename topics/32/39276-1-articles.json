I will have a rocket that gets to space just fine over half a dozen times. And then all of the sudden random structural failures start plaguing my launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last rocket I built, I launched it into orbit 5-6 times and even took it to Duna with no problems. Between each flight, I did not change a single thing, I just kept reverting back to the launch pad to try and see what planets it could go to. And after numerous launches with zero problems, I am no longer able to get more than 2-3km off of Kerban without the entire thing crumbling and parts falling off. I am applying the exact same launch technique each time, with my thrust set to the same level as when I had no problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have had this happen with multiple builds where I get a good amount of clean launches, and then it\u0027s done. I have to go back and rebuild the exact same rocket from scratch to get it to work again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes even rebuilding won\u0027t fix it and I have to close out and reopen the game entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else had a problem with structural failure after launching a shuttle multiple times?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
