I had the exact apoapsis and periapsis but the contract wouldn\u0027t complete. I\u0027m not sure what else I can do. I think it was a 2-star difficulty.

I\u0027m not really sure how to adjust that though. I noticed that no matter what direction I went the inclination didn\u0027t change.\u00A0I have kerbal \u00A0engineer and after checking the screenshot I\u0027m off on that too. It\u0027s supposed to be 180. This shot was taken just before I adjusted the apo. and per. So you probably just answered all my issues.

For example, relative to the equator, your ascending node is the point on your orbit where you cross the equator and go above it. The descending node is where you cross the equator and go below it. Your inclination is the angle between your orbit and the reference plane, which is usually the equator. Of course, you may want to change your inclination relative to some other plane, such as the orbit of something you want to intercept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo change your inclination, you must burn perpendicular to your reference plane at some point on your orbit. The best place to do this is at an ascending or descending node. To find your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E relative to some plane, you must set a target. Conveniently, the Mun has 0 inclination relative to the equator of Kerbin. By setting the Mun as your target, you can effectively see your inclination relative to the equator. Set a maneuver node at, for example, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, and add velocity in the normal or anti-normal direction. Watch the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E (you can right click on it to make it not go away) and stop when it shows the angle you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
