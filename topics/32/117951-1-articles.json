There\u0027s a variable called \u0022minDistanceToReengage\u0022, set to 1f, which I think means that once the ports have docked they have to be moved 1 meter apart before magnetism applies again, so that you\u0027re ships don\u0027t redock themselves on undock. I\u0027m currently working on another way to restart drives, so I\u0027ll see how that goes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The variable \u0022acquireForce\u0022, which I assume determines the amount of magnetism, is set to 2f by default. I think this means all the docking ports have the same magnetism strength, so a Jr port based drive should be as powerful as a Sr based one. I am by no means sure about this though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The variable \u0022acquireRange\u0022 is set to 0.5f by default, so half a metre should be the max distance between docking ports for the drive to work. I guess this could be used for a sort of clutch or neutral gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-There is also an \u0022acquireTorque\u0022 variable, set to 2f, which I assume refers to the torque that lines up docking ports. I don\u0027t know what this could be used for, but I\u0027m sure there\u0027s some way to exploit it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst ever warp drive equipped pickup truck:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BK583yV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022BK583yV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
