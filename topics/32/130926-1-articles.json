I\u0027ve noticed a few issues with my save game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirstly, it seems the experience of Bill, Bob, and Jeb has been completely reset and they are now level 0.\u00A0None of the other kerbonauts seem to be affected by this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly, and more annoyingly, my reputation meter seems to be frozen. After the accumulation of hundreds of reputation points from contracts, my reputation is still stuck\u00A0on 74%. No matter how many contracts I complete this doesn\u0027t budge. I\u0027ve cancelled any strategies that eat up reputation points but this doesn\u0027t make any difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone else had these issues?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aloriel","CreatedById":97201,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T18:53:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill, Bob, and Jeb may have been reset because they \u0022died\u0022. If you had any craft from before that were suddenly invalid (missing parts, or what have you), and the dynamic trio were aboard, they would have died. Upon such deaths, the trio (quad if you count Val) will reset to 0 XP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than that, I have no idea. :/\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
