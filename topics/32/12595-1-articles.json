So, I eject the cockpit, open my parachute, and watch the rest of the plane drift downwards, stabilize, and\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6 start flying again? Yep. I drift downwards, and the thing is actually circling around at ~50 meters above sea level. It then pulls up, and starts circling in the other direction in some wide figure-8 pattern, slowly losing altitude. It then finally crashes into the sea and explodes. I did get some screenies once I realized that something was weird, though. I\\\u0027m not sure if this is reproducible, or wether some bug is responsible, but I\\\u0027m fine with that, if only for the sheer strangeness that I saw.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nibula","CreatedById":12289,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-13T00:15:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen the plane was going down it gathered speed and pulled up cause of the speed and then stalled \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fifflethecat","CreatedById":26981,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-13T01:05:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think I saw a post of MechJeb automatically trying to land vehicles after a failed test launch even if they aren\\\u0027t connected. i\\\u0027ll see if I can link the original video to the first \u0027Auto land.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=13927.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=13927.0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis person is the one that had the \u0027Ghost flyer\u0027 thing. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phoenix Aerospace","CreatedById":26120,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-13T02:44:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh! \u003Cstrong\u003ENow\u003C/strong\u003E it makes sense!
