I wanted to see my progression against a calender which matches our progression since 1950 or so. Currently I am seeing if I can get a manned moon landing before 1969.

Planting a flag is a really simple way of commemorating a flight. You can list a good amount of information on the plaque too, like who was involved in the mission, challenges faced during the flight, unexpected finds and problems. Space derbis is another cool mark your missions can leave on the solar system. I never delete it. Kerbin and the Mun are surrounded by random stuff and I like seeing relatively close flybys of old spent stages when launching a new mission. Recently while checking the tracking station I even noticed that a stage from a Mun rocket was slingshot out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI and is now bouncing around between Kerbin and Eve. It\u0027s the second random capture/ejection event I\u0027ve seen, the other being an Asteroid captured into Kerbin polar orbit by itself somehow. Lastly, I save all my ships so I can look at my design history at any time. Sometimes I even go back to old ships and edit things into their descriptions if they contributed significantly to my game in some way. Milestones like my first working SSTO or reentry vehicle typically involve learning something new about the game which I can make use of from then on.

Yeah, I don\u0027t have that with sandbox, it would feel pointless to me, and it is certainly lacking in stock career as well (you can do \u003Cem\u003Eeverything\u003C/em\u003E in less time that it might have taken to develop a single RL rocket).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo why do career mode players either feel\u00A0they need such tools or feel as if sandbox players are \u0022cheating themselves\u0022? \u00A0Do they look down on sandbox players (literally the \u0022earliest\u00A0adopters\u0022 of KSP) or do they look down on themselves? \u00A0Do they not care either way, just preferring the more \u0022gamey\u0022 approach of artificial limits? \u00A0Are they lightly trolling (lord knows I\u0027ve engaged in the practice... \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E )\u00A0\u00A0We\u0027ve had some good, civil answers so far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t presume to tell other people how to play, I just tend to advocate for the kind of career mode I\u0027d like to play/see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t look down on sandbox in the least, it\u0027s not worse or better play, it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Edifferent\u003C/em\u003E play.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think what all modes lack in terms of replay value are (in no particular order):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EA real sense of exploration\u003C/strong\u003E. My first play-throughs of KSP felt like exploration because I made a point of not even looking at the target worlds before I sent something there. The only possible solution to this problem is an optional, randomized Kerbol system, though it need not be entirely random, it can have a library of well-constructed planets and moons, picking a number of each, then doing slight rescales of both world size and distances. \u0022Difficulty\u0022 could then set the range of rescale numbers---Easy would be maybe 1-2 X max rescales, with Kerbin locked at 1:1; Normal might allow 1-3 rescales of all bodies, and Hard would allow 1-6 rescales (Kerbin itself might get limited to ~4X max since it\u0027d be only stock parts).\u00A0Combined with a \u0022fog of war\u0022 that masks values that need probes to determine, we get science that is not a grindy point thing, but science that gives us data to plan missions. Send a probe to the venus analog (Eve, or whatever similar world might be selected) so you have some idea of what kind of craft to make for a lander. That sort of thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ENovel problems to solve\u003C/strong\u003E. All \u0022accidents\u0022 are the fault if the player, which has sometimes resulted in fun, but as you get better, they are more rare. Rescues in career would perhaps be novel, except the way they are done is terrible, has no sense of urgency, and has \u003Cem\u003Eno context\u003C/em\u003E. Some craft problems (Eve return vehicles, etc) are certainly novel---the first time you do them.

It needs something akin to KCT, and/or LS to make time meaningful. A simple mechanism that could even be a sandbox option (along with costs) would be strictly\u00A0annual funding, perhaps doled out incrementally\u00A0every 50 days (a Minmus month) or so, with a \u0022warp to next fiscal month\u0022 button to make things easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-05T18:00:28Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2016 06:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArmchairGravy","CreatedById":78526,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-05T18:21:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been playing since .23, so I\u0027ve gone from Sandbox to Science to Career, and have played the heck out of each mode. \u00A0I like them all for various and contradictory reasons. \u00A0What I\u0027m doing now is doing Custom careers with Funds and Science rewards at 200%. \u00A0This means while I have some restrictions, they\u0027re not stifling. \u00A0I can faff about doing things that don\u0027t get me any reward whatsoever which is the fun of Sandbox.\u00A0\u00A0I can get the reward\u00A0mechanism of Science without scrounging for every last bit of it. \u00A0I can get a bit of challenge from running my program in a responsible manner from Career. \u00A0Do other people play this way? \u003Cstrong\u003E\u00A0I don\u0027t care.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe beautiful thing about KSP is it\u0027s customization. \u00A0Choose a mode, customize the settings for game play, add a mod or twenty. \u00A0Do what makes you happy and don\u0027t worry about what other people think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dfthu","CreatedById":80296,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-05T19:21:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo all these people saying there is too many new parts in sandbox for new people.
