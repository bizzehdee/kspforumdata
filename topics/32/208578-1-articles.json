Part of it is aesthetic for Bop, it being nearly indistinguishable from Gilly other than its larger size. But also I think they should have given it a retrograde orbit for variety\u0027s sake, I don\u0027t think there are any bodies in KSP that do have a retrograde orbit. Then it could be an analog of one of Jupiter\u0027s many irregular moons with strange orbits. Either that or give it a much larger inclination and eccentricity than the 15 degrees and 0.235 it already has respectively. Also I find it annoying that it is much more massive than Pol and yet it\u0027s not rounded under its own gravity like Pol seems to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for Pol, it annoys me that it has the perfect look to be an Io analog but isn\u0027t one. That\u0027s unfortunate since Jool really could use an Io analog. Io is a very underrated moon in the real solar system. Also, Pol has the same boring orbit problem that Bop has, but in this case its even worse. The three large moons of Jool fill that low inclination, roughly circular orbit, and moderately distant semi-major axis niche well enough by themselves. It\u0027d be more interesting to me if Pol were given a close in orbit far within that of Laythe\u0027s. Maybe just outside of its Roche limit. Then we\u0027d have the amazing view when landed on it, Jool absolutely dominating its sky. And it\u0027d give us some lore about Pol being a doomed world in a decaying orbit like Phobos is in the real solar system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso there is a lack in rotational period novelties. Eve and Moho have relatively short rotational periods compared to Venus and Mercury. It\u0027d have been nice if at least one of them had an extremely long rotational period. And I think it\u0027d be great to give at least one of the planets in KSP a retrograde rotation like Venus has. Again, for variety\u0027s sake. I recently found out that\u0027s possible without Principia. Weird since it\u0027s effectively an axial tilt of 180 degrees and axial tilts aren\u0027t possible in stock. I guess the part of the code incompatible with axial tilt doesn\u0027t apply to a completely upside down body.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rest of my complaints about the planets in KSP are aesthetic based. Eve and Duna are way, way, way too monochrome. If you\u0027ve been anywhere on those worlds, then you\u0027ve been everywhere on those worlds. Eve has nearly the same shade of purple regolith everywhere except for the oceans. Duna has the same problem with almost all the regolith on its surface being the same shade of orangeish-red. At least it has those huge, icey poles to spice things up, but within them you get the same problem, just the same boring off-white ice everywhere the eye can see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot only that, but its all rolling hills all the time. I know KSP is capable of having interesting terrain, it\u0027s really fun flying through canyons, and up and down the sides of mountains, and following along the long, winding rivers on Kerbin. But that level of detail never made it to the other planets. Especially Ike. It has like four or five shades of grey regolith and the same very gentle rolling hills everywhere, it\u0027s probably the most boring object in the game, even worse than Dres. The only saving grace for Ike is its uniquely large size relative to its host planet Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-06-17T00:17:18Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2022 12:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by cosekantphi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MythicalHeFF","CreatedById":176690,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-22T19:19:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dislike Duna and Dres for the same reason: they have incredibly boring terrain with few exceptions (those being the canyons, but even those are kind of meh after you\u2019ve seen them a few times).
