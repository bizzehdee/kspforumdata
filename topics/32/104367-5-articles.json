In other words, the fairing could be being separated in a deliberately overly complicated way to show off the fact that you can build and separate the fairing that way if you want to!\n\nIf this is the case, then making a picture of a \u0022potato chips\u0022 separation would be a cool way to show off the new fairing parts! ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nIt seems improbable to me that Squad haven\u0027t taken the time to do some basic research into how IRL fairings look and how they separate. ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif) Therefore, if Squad have implemented unrealistic fairings, it would most likely be because there\u0027s a technical (and probably Unity related and therefore difficult to fix) reason why they can\u0027t make fairings work the way they\u0027d prefer. If this was the case, then we would have heard from Squad about this by now. Technical problems of this kind are mentioned at length in the weekly devnotes, and fairings have been in the works for a while now.\n\nIt also seems improbable that the numerous testers that Squad are relying on to get 1.0 through experimentals would make such a basic mistake. Someone should have said \u0022Hey! Fairings on real rockets don\u0027t separate that way!\u0022 ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)\n\nThere are still a lot of things we don\u0027t know about 1.0.
