I\u0027ve got an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E ship powered by a combination of solar, stock fuel cells, and an Umbra/MKS nuke reactor. Right now the hierarchy of load is Solar \u0026gt; Fuel Cells \u0026gt; Reactor, and I\u0027d like to drop the output cap on the fuel cells a bit (75-80% or so) so that the reactor is loaded first, and the fuel cell array just picks up the load when the reactor can\u0027t keep up. Alternately, I guess, is there a way to adjust the cap on the reactor so it fires up earlier?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Maj Solo","CreatedById":179519,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-29T17:53:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif you LEAVE the ship KSP is going to treat it as it had unlimited juice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
