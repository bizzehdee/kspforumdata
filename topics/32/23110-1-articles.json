He was initially built to be something that could be used to film launches from different angles, but I got rather carried away and he became something else entirely. He can take on the guise of a low slung rover, but is then able to sit upright with an evil grin on his face, brandishing two lazers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/aTTtSj3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aTTtSj3m.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022aTTtSj3m.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/V82S3PM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/V82S3PMm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022V82S3PMm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/XQhqWjl\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XQhqWjlm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XQhqWjlm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Z3SCaR1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Z3SCaR1m.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Z3SCaR1m.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis first vid shows the first incarnation of FRANK.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/K_5h8cXONBI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe was such a success that I had to make more of him. He\u0027s now been re-built to have fuel tanks (lots and lots of those oscar-B tanks and a couple 50l tanks) and can now fly. As a rover he has a booster engine and can hit speeds of 50ms without issue.

Usually making a base takes a while, trying to get everything just right, but with this one if I\u0027d forgotten something, or not set action groups up just right it didn\u0027t matter so that whole base only took an evening to build and fly out.
