Geneker took the Rafflesia rocket up and managed a good rendezvous despite being a bit late in launching. Addos hopped into his pod, main engine burn to bring the periapsis inside the atmosphere on course for KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next phase decouples the drive section to leave the two pods by themselves (point radial\u002B so the drive section re-enters faster and below us). Finally, turning normal and decouple separates both pods so that they enter side by side with some distance between them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELITTLE DID I FIGURE, you can only control one pod at the same time. Even with RealChutes armed and set properly... Needless to say, Geneker burned up on re-entry after saving his fellow kerbal. Not sure how I feel about it as technically the plan would have worked fine and was pretty solid for the tech level if it weren\u0027t for the weird limitations of the game. Regardless, makes for a much more interesting story \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second interesting occasion was when Addos (the one Gene saved) went up in the Azobe rocket to deliver three communication satellites for my Mun network as well as do some high and low orbital science. Hitting orbit though I realized he didn\u0027t have enough delta V for the Mun... But Minmus? Yep. So instead of scrapping the mission entirely (still lost out on the Mun contracts), we went out to visit the mint ice cream moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figured the comms network would be about 500km and circular, so I started with getting that orbit. Problem was, I only had about 130 dV at that point, and the satellites weren\u0027t self-propelled. So what do I do? Dump them all in the same place and hope I can get Addos back?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily I noticed another mistake I\u0027d made in building the rocket that turned out pretty useful; I had attached the satellites with decouplers and hadn\u0027t powered them down, so in decoupling I\u0027d be shooting them pretty far in the directing I was facing with the rocket (actually the reverse because they were hanging on behind the rocket, so if I faced prograde they\u0027d accelerate retrograde). I figured I could get a good spread if I fired them all into elliptical orbits with a low periapse at three set points in my existing orbit, so that\u0027s what I did. I wound up with kind of concentric ellipses around Minmus, with pretty decent coverage from the omnis and dishes facing Kerbin, Mun and the active vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to get back to Kerbin! Addos ran out of fuel mid burn and would have sailed past Kerbin with a 200\u002Bkm periapsis. Whaaat... Alright, emergency measures! Same trick decoupling the drive section and giving us a bit of a forward boost. Still not enough though. Crap. Alright... I seem to remember this old trick my dad taught me... Get out and push?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELocking the pod prograde at Minmus and retrograde in the Kerbal SOI was really helpful making sure we were lined up, and after a fun little space walk, Addos got the periapse down to just under 30km. The return was surprisingly close to KSC, just behind the mountains on the west, despite the complete lack of planning beyond, \u0022oh god don\u0027t make me send up the stupid Rafflesia again...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo thems were the learnings.

It should be a routine \u0022explore Dres\u0022 -contract to get money for expensive Jool exploration. I had a three man mothership, separate lander and separate science lab and fuel tank unit. Ascent from Kerbin and trans Dres injection went flawlessly. Problems arose when I noticed that ship was near Dres and there had not been planned trajectory correction maneuver. I had forgot to add an alarm to Kerbal Alarm Clock or had accidentally deleted it. I had near optimal amount fuel and too late course correction consumed about 100 m/s too much and dangered a return trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately I had enough supplies (I use TAC life support) to wait rescue ship from Kerbin. I made a simple unmanned ship with reserve fuel and living supplies for delayed return and launched it during next window. Kerbals made landing and collected science but instead of returning in planned window they waited additional resources. It went nominally and kerbals could make an additional landing and had enough snacks for return trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed a problem number two soon after trans Kerbin injection. It was very severe one. Mothership was a slightly modified crew transport vehicle for Jool exploring. I had two models of them. Older one had a command pod with parachute, heat shield (Deadly re-entry) and decoupler. A newer one, an advanced economy model, did not have, it make an orbit insertion burn and rendezvous to the Kerbin Station. Unfortunately, I took newer one in assembly phase but thought that it was older model. So, kerbals did not have possibility to aerobrake and reentry and not enough fuel to Kerbin orbit insertion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShort investigation of possible rescue mission orbits told that I can rendezvous with an unlucky ship if I make a 2100 m/s burn from 24 degrees inclined 300 km Kerbin orbit and a huge 8800 m/s at rendezvous time. It was possible but took an expensive 600 t launch. It is extremely difficult to set accurate orbits in KSP, even with MechJeb, because the game does not give needed information, but with couple of tricks I got the correct orbit and burns went as expected. When 8800 m/s rendezvous burn was completed, distance to target was 200 km. The rescue mission was easy to finish. I noticed also, that SQUAD had fixed numerical problems which made Sun orbit rendezvouses difficult about the time of 0.20 (thanks Squad). Kerbals have now re-entry possibility and they are on optimal trajectory about 50 days from Kerbin SOI. Everything seems good and probably kerbal losses can be avoided. However, guys in financial department are not happy for some reason. I think that I have to make couple of business launches (Fine Print) and explore Moho.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KevinW42","CreatedById":66949,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-24T07:54:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI made an SAS powered \u0022helicopter\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qOfI0XB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qOfI0XB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/f3BJlID.png\u0022 alt=\u0022f3BJlID.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, it really does fly by itself, and yes, it is pretty much impossible to control.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jovus","CreatedById":117163,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-24T08:02:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaiden flight of the Anthropopheron I, a light crew transport spaceplane, to finally man my orbital station:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AUOydY2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AUOydY2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my first fully successful spaceplane.
