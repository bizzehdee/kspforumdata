I did some testing, and came up with the following electricity outputs for solar panels at each planet (all stats in electricity/second):\n\nOX-STAT\n\n Moho: ~1.5\n\n Eve: 0.64\n\n Kerbin: 0.33\n\n Duna: 0.15\n\n Dres: 0.03\n\n Jool: 0.02\n\n Eeloo: 0.01\n\nOX-4L/W\n\n Moho: ~7.5\n\n Eve: 2.99\n\n Kerbin: 1.54\n\n Duna: 0.70\n\n Dres: 0.15\n\n Jool: 0.08\n\n Eeloo: 0.03\n\nGigantor\n\n Moho: ~110\n\n Eve: 44.37\n\n Kerbin: 22.90\n\n Duna: 10.40\n\n Dres: 2.30\n\n Jool: 1.18\n\n Eeloo: 0.41\n\nCombined with previous stats I calculated [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118445-Analysis-of-rebalanced-electricity-sources-1-0-2), one can calculate that **solar panels are a strictly worse power source than RTGs anywhere past Dres**, and they are about equal at Dres. As discussed in the other electricity stats thread, fuel cells are probably a better choice than RTGs most of the time, but that\u0027s a different question.\n\nEDIT: test conditions. I tested all the panels in a 500 km circular orbit around the planet. Sun exposure in all tests was between 0.97 and 1.00. For Moho, Dres, and Eeloo, I tested near the planet\u0027s apoapsis. At Moho, the numbers were changing pretty quickly (not sure why... heating maybe?), so I recorded a slightly conservative estimate.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T00:22:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 12:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by a2soup**\n  \nadded test conditions"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T23:42:16Z","Content":"Nice, thanks for doing the math."},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T23:53:32Z","Content":"Ooh, I like those numbers indeed.
