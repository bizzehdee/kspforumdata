As some people may have noticed, the story/progression contracts (\u0022Achieve Orbit!\u0022 and \u0022Flyby x\u0022 contracts) have the normal expiration periods, meaning that if you don\u0027t accept them in time they are lost forever. Is there any way to prevent this? Ultimately it is not that important but it does add an element of roleplay, and provides extra rewards. And it really is rather silly that they expire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, can anyone confirm that to fulfill the return requirement, it has to be the same vessel that landed there first?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-02-17T16:37:06Z\u0022 title=\u002202/17/2022 04:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 17, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by xXIndestructibleEVAXx\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mahnarch","CreatedById":114432,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-17T18:35:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been able to take Science\u2122 from one ...ahem.. \u003Cem\u003Eslightly bent\u003C/em\u003E lander and put in\u00A0 on another and got credit, I think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s been a while, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I have forgotten to get the contracts [Fly by X] and got contract credit any way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, it\u0027s been a while.
