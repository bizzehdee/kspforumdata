First off, my launcher was way, way too big. I was now making a loss on rescue missions with four pods, lol. Note to self: either put on more pods, or put some smaller rockets on it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo biggy, figured I would just use this version to minimize my loss, save four kerbals and call the project a day.
