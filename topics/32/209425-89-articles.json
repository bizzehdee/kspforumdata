A classic mistake is that people think that a GHz is a GHz, but in reality it is a useless metric. Differences in architecture will always mean a different outcome. The only chips that can be somewhat compared are chips of the same brand, with the same architecture, with the same features and preferably of the same revision and batch. This means that comparing chips of different generations based on clockspeed, or even chips from different brands, it a futile exercise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENowadays people often look at IPC, but this is not a golden metric either. It suffers pretty much from the same problems and limitations as clockspeed based comparisons do. Different chips will perform differently in different situations. I repeat it again and again and again: real life benchmarks are the only reliable way of comparing a chip\u0027s performance to that of another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease note that there are a lot of websites out there that compare CPUs or GPUs based on specifications or artificial benchmarks. Comparing specifications is useless, and artificial benchmarks (PassMark, Heaven et cetera) are less than ideal, so beware of the results that will be at the top of your Google search. More often than not you need to take those with a grain of salt and interpret them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, once more: pick a game or application that you want to use the chip for (or the closest thing you can find), find reviews that have actually measured performance between one chip and another and compare the results. That is the only proper way of comparing chips performance.
