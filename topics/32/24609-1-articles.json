Symmetry with wheels gets all whack in there. I tend to guess where to place my wheels, one by one (because if I use x2 symmetry, one wheel is facing up, the other the right way) by using points where the wheel slips/flips/changes direction on the part where I\u0027m placing it, and repeat for the other side, tends to work fine, but its a long process, or rather, could be shorter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do the rest of you make rovers?
