They\u0027ve proven that they have a capable and talented team... they\u0027ve got a fan base who\u0027s probably willing to test and fund whatever their next creation is... it\u0027s clear that KSP, their first-ever game, has been a huge hit (and probably generated a LOT of money for them)\n\nThe thing I\u0027m worried about is if KSP\u0027s success was, you know, a luck-based thing. Not completely luck, but maybe it was just a wild chance that people liked this concept of building rockets.\n\nIt\u0027ll probably be fine though. Hopefully they can figure out what it was that made KSP successful and then the next one will be even better!"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T04:00:54Z","Content":"Okay, here\u0027s another question for SQUAD.\n\nHave you guys decided to drop The Daily Kerbal?\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"lobe","CreatedById":78710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T06:59:06Z","Content":"I find Squad to have the same following and business model as Mojang.
