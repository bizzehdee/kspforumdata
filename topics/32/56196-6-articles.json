Squad has made a wonderful game. But it goes beyond, KSP has revived a genre from the brink of extinction. Before KSP, the space genre was basically dead, there were things, like obiter but they never really captured the vast majority of people who would rather be playing an FPS game then a game were you need to learn all these panels and stuff. When KSP came out, it revolutionised everything, because Squad has focused on the humour plus the fun factor of the game and not sorely on the realism. This game appeals to a wider audience. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd where has this got them, winner of many indie awards, a spotlight on NBC, a booth at PAX and the revelation that many at the JPL at playing this game in their down time . I don\u0027t think Squad should listen to the community, communicate sure but not listen word for word to it as it would only end them up in a deep dark hole. When 0.22 game out, there are arguments about \u0027hard-core gamers\u0027 being left behind, and I just sat there thinking, why would complain, isn\u0027t this what we wanted. A similar thing is happening right now and will most likely happen after the update.

KSP has never been about resources, its been about jeb, explosions, the steep learning curve, the satisfaction when you progress up that learning curve when you finally orbit or land on the moon. Its about exploration, management and the inexplicable beauty of the cosmos. If anything, I believe that resources are almost definitely not needed and will most likely break the game, making it too easy for missions, even making eve a piece of cake. coming from only a couple of days ago when we were celebrating all things Kerbal, I think a few new people may have joined this community who we just don\u0027t want and are going to turn the other community members against their beloved game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elook at the Halo community for example. I was part of that community. prior to the release of Halo 4, news was steadily streaming in on the game development and the features, and the community was happy with 343I and how they were implementing things, even providing advice and saying what should be done to help balance the game. however, the very week the game came out, even though it was beautifully balanced with all the features seeming to fit snugly in the games formula, the forums were flooded with new members who seemed to hate every bit of the game, even things that had been in since Halo:CE, saying that the game was \u0027unrecognisable\u0027 and \u0027Call of Halo\u0027. Please kerbal community, don\u0027t seemingly randomly start to hate this game and the features that are being implemented, the game is doing great and I don\u0027t want it spoiled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022OtherDalfite\u0022 data-cite=\u0022OtherDalfite\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is honestly the most toxic thing you can say to a developer.

I have never seen a development group pay as much attention to its user base as Squad does with KSP. I\u0027ve beta tested for major game companies and had less interaction with them than I get with KSP developers. Heck, we got Kerbalcon and I don\u0027t ever recall seeing something similar with any other game company. I have another paid space game called Artemis Bridge Simulator which is in constant development like KSP. Check out their community. It pretty much nothing with very little involvement by the development team. Heck they came other with a new version that broke the ability to use an iPad and are still working on it months later. People, like me can no longer use iPads for stations which pretty much limits me to the older version with far less features. I also had to by the game again because of the version change from 1 to 2 so I\u0027m out 40 bucks because I can\u0027t play the new game. You folks are whining about resources and multi-player but can at least play the newest versions. I paid 23 bucks for KSP and it was well worth it. I\u0027ve gotten far more entertainment for the money than pretty much any other money spent on entertainment. Take a look at Orbiter simulator which has been around a lot longer than KSP. It doesn\u0027t have nearly the capabilities nor the number of mod developers. The community isn\u0027t nearly as active and the developers limit their access to that community which isn\u0027t even run by the developers.
