I\u0027m sure it depends on personal build style, but I tend to put smaller landing struts on my creations, and in past versions I\u0027ve had to manually set the struts to max strength and damping. In 1.12.2, maxing them turns them into rigid beams of diamond. They also seem to have less ground grip and my landers slide down even slight inclines much more easily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
