Specifically, the RA-15 seems kind of useless to me, since I can cover Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E quite well with the RA-2s but the RA-15 can only go a frustratingly small fraction of the way around Kerbin\u0027s orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI successfully boosted the RA-15\u0027s performance so that I can just manage to bounce signals between 4 relays in Kerbin\u0027s orbit spaced at 90 degree angles and then on to Duna or Eve. But I\u0027m still dissatisfied as boosting the relays ability to communicate with each other by increasing their antenna ratings also greatly boosts their connection with the Tracking Station. I only tweaked the antenna rating from 15G to 20G, but now the relay at Duna has a fantastic connection straight to the Tracking Station with no need for a wider network, which kind of removes the challenge completely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027ve realized that what I really want is a weaker tracking station but to compensate with better mid-game relays. That seems the most fun for me personally. So my question to the forums is if there is a way to edit the config files to decrease the antenna rating of the Tracking Station and/or other ground stations on Kerbin. I\u0027ve looked through and I don\u0027t see a folder for \u0022Buildings\u0022 or anything like that. I\u0027m sure the numbers must be in there somewhere, but I\u0027ve missed them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-22T09:47:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI too would like to know this, I suspect in the same place would be where I could edit the ground stations...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, for your purposes... there is a slider for the DSN that you can set when you start the game, or edit your save file to change:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0CommNetParams\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0{\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0requireSignalForControl = False\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0plasmaBlackout = False\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0rangeModifier = 1\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0DSNModifier = 1\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0occlusionMultiplierVac = 0.9\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0occlusionMultiplierAtm = 0.75\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0enableGroundStations = True\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0}\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nchose a value lower than 1 to reduce the power of the kerbin ground stations.
