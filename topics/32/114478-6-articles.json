Just because AAA game developers have the resources to pour into huge marketing campaigns for their ....ty, unfinished products, doesn\u0027t mean that is the way the market should be run from now on.\n\u003E \n\u003E Apparently, in spite of asking us to pay for it, and announcing it\u0027s official release, SQUAD had no intention of delivering a finished product to their customers.\n\u003E \n\u003E Imagine buying a new car, and having it fall to pieces while you\u0027re driving it home.

There are unused and abandoned folders still sitting in the main game directory, that have never been removed. For some reason, they\u0027re still a part of the current game installation.\n\u003E \n\u003E A developer that doesn\u0027t even clean up even their basic file structure before announcing a release, is a developer who has no intention of releasing a finished product.\n\u003E \n\u003E - - - Updated - - -\n\u003E \n\u003E There is a difference between unfinished, and broken.\n\u003E \n\u003E Kerbal Space Program is *unfinished*.

The game WAS finished... it contained all they wanted it to contain, which was part of the goals included when the they started this project, and it was added to over time with the help of the community. For that reason, once all the goals had been met, the game was released. It still contains bugs, but what doesn\u0027t? And now, there is more goals to add to the game, and THAT is the on going side of things, had goals been added constantly, the game would NEVER have been released, btu the thing is, even with the new goals, the game is there, it functions.

In reality these should have been the last alpha updates/ first beta updates, not release updates. There could have then been a period spent solely to crushing bugs, without the added distraction of trying to add new features/port to U5, and then a release version would be ready. There is a reason that a significant proportion of people still think it should better be referred to as 0.28 rather than 1.0.4.\n\nThats not to say it isn\u0027t a great game, and that squad hasn\u0027t done something truly unique, but a lot of the anger is justified.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-29T23:21:37Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2015 11:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by technicalfool**\n  \nEdited quoted post"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T22:55:41Z","Content":"Maybe the mods should ban every one!

Changes that affect gameplay such as aerodynamic changes, heating changes, etc can essentially break your progress in such a way that you need to either restart or spend a significant amount of time getting things back on track. This is not fun, and generates resentment. Based on what I have seen in the dev notes, it sounds like 1.1 may cause such issues. Based on the forums, these issues happened with 1.0.2, 1.0.3 (after 1.0).\n\nSo I will say, some level of frustration is warranted. Saying it is hate is somewhat disingenuous.

I was using your metaphor in my own post, as a reference toward moderators (as you used it for Squad).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ...I told them to be fair but hard, not to allow one to get away with something another wasn\u0027t allowed to... \n\u003E ...but more importantly, I told them not to be over enthusiastic it interpreting the rules, to allow some leeway.\n\nAnd therein lies the balance.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Yep... I even tested the theory and stated in that thread that conspiracy theories were against the rules.... STILL NOTHING.\n\nThe best way to test your theory is to use the report button. We *will* see the reports. We will not necessarily see every post or thread on the forum.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I did post about Valentina being on the Mun and the Tech at KSP turned the radio off so they could enjoy the silence... and YET AGAIN... the thread was locked because it was ... sexist.... REALLY?\n\nWithout having any knowledge on the specifics of your thread, I can hypothesize that if it was posted at the height of sexist remarks being made on the forums, that\u0027s would increase the reason for it getting shut down. Again, I don\u0027t know the specific of your thread or the context.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Didn\u0027t Squad have a backlash for being sexist and not having females?\n\nYes they did, despite stating multiple times that they planned on releasing female kerbals (because they wasn\u0027t fast enough for some, and pointless to others). At the time of release, the forum was quite overflowing with comments, both appropriate and inappropriate. \u0022Female kerbals\u0022 were also added to the \u0022What Not To Suggest\u0022 thread. Not because we are heavy handed brigands, but because it was (yet again) another polarizing topic that seemed to encourage sexist remarks or personal attacks. Not to mention the fact that they were already a planned feature (so no need to suggest them again).\n\nI will conclude by saying that the moderators are generally (or should be) reactionary by nature. We don\u0027t go out of our way to find things that break the rules, and we also rely on the community itself to help in maintaining the right culture. If there\u0027s an isolated thread that seems to be running rampant, it\u0027s likely because the people who are happy to banter about it are the only ones there (and hence, we don\u0027t notice). If someone posts a remotely sexist remark in a high traffic area at the height of female kerbal release, then it\u0027s more likely to get flagged, noticed, or otherwise closed down.\n\nI will also conceded (as I did earlier) that I don\u0027t expect any of what I ramble about to change your mind. I do, however, feel saddened by the fact that you feel unable to post a new thread (because that\u0027s not what we want). I also appreciate you providing some specific feedback that can be addressed.\n\nThanks,\n\n~Claw\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T04:52:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 04:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T06:54:09Z","Content":"A whole bunch of posts that had nothing to do with the topic have been removed from this thread.

There is no point in making drama.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E -Making major announcements via PCGamer without any corroboration on their main sites.\n\nThat\u0027s again a valid complaint, while not much of a deal otherwise (actually seen these thing on Assetto Corsa too): Going for a big magazine to publish news is important to reach a bigger audience. We\u0027re just a minority here in the first place, which is better informed anyway. Otherwise we wouldn\u0027t know of PCGamer bringing the news \u0027exclusively\u0027 in the first place. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E -Doing no major bugfixing prior to a 1.0 release.\n\nAnother valid complaint, I could see the issues comming too. And also again something that only matters to new players, not old ones.\nYou see my point? At least to me, most of these complaints seem to be arguable things of principle, maybe slight mistakes of small developer, question of personal expectations how the development is supposed to go, or outright criticism on behalve at others. Often these posts even sound as if the critic feels personally betrayed, making it even more of a subjective things that only uses these criticism to vent personal feelings. They at least don\u0027t hold that much on their own.\n\nThat\u0027s not to say there are valid things to cirticise in the dev cycle, the heat gauge thing should have been fixed before release or by a hotfix, not this late. The patcher needs a better implementation. But even discussions of these very real issues tends to be blown up like the whole future and development of KSP would be an utter mess.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T06:59:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 06:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Temeter**"},{"CreatedByName":"Stargate525","CreatedById":53585,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T07:09:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You see my point?

These bugs have had no sign of being fixed, they continue to tinker with major aspects of the game, and are making rookie mistakes in development and community management with almost every update. Pointing out that this spells trouble seems eminently logical."},{"CreatedByName":"LordFjord","CreatedById":97341,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T08:04:24Z","Content":"Let Squad do their thing.

Those companies develop DLC that will add a few new options to the game while at the same time a whole lot of new features will be released for free with the regular patches that the DLC helps to fund. On the one hand this means that every time a new major patch comes around the game will become a bit unbalanced until the next minor balance patch and people will have to adopt to new options and opportunities. That is obviously not something everyone would enjoy but it keeps the games fresh for everyone and retains mod compatibility for everyone without forcing everyone to buy the DLC."}]}
