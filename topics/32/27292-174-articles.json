I\u0027ve hit three so far without issue, Munar landings are becoming routine for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Nuke engines unlocked from the last mission, I wanted to see if they\u0027d improve the efficiency of my lander. So, I pulled off the LV-909s and their attached accouterments. I played with the engine/fuel setup before deciding to just stick with what\u0027s worked. I re-assemble the engine nacelles and launch my fourth Munar X expedition. Everything goes to plan, until I start coming in for a landing. With orbital speed dropping to near 0, I press G to extend my legs. ...Wait, I don\u0027t see any- Oh crap. I forgot to add legs to the nacelles. I say, screw it, my last landing was under 2m/s, so we can do this. Unfortunately, my horizontal speed was a touch too high.

I make sure to add the legs, then I add a little more fuel to try and hit some of the more eccentric biomes. The extra weight took enough off my insertion delta-V that I had to circularize with my lander. That basically ate through the fuel I had planned for inclination change. I can still work with this, there are a couple biomes along the orbit I still haven\u0027t hit. I select one and come in for landing. This landing went fine (since I now have legs), and I perform the science. Bob re-boards and takes off for Kerbin. The flight back goes (mostly) to plan, save for overshooting KSC by a few hundred km, but I\u0027ve done enough water landings that I know the lander will float. Under 10k, I pop the drogue as per usual, and wait for the vertical velocity to drop. Around 1km up, the drogue disappeared. ...Wait, what? I immediately pop my other four chutes to see if I can recover... nope, they rip away, too. With all my fuel burned off, I have no choice but to watch helplessly as Bob and the lander plummets into the ocean, destroying that precious science. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoral of this story?

Why did I not try this before? The thing is unexpectedly powerful compared to anything else I currently have and gets to stable 100km orbit using only a sip of the fuel in the central tanks after dropping all boosters. Originally I had put more stuff on it but I was feeling unsure due to my weight increases (the design this is based off of which was good for lifting 15 tons to 150km orbital rendezvous using about 1/2 fuel in the central tanks, used SRBs in place of the outer ring and one fewer tank height-wise on the inner ring) so I dropped the science lab and decreased the nuke engines from 3 to 1 and did this as a test expecting to have to decouple everything behind the nuke once I was ready to leave Kerbin orbit. It\u0027s a little wobbly due to not enough torque wheels, but it\u0027s flyable and was only a prototype.
