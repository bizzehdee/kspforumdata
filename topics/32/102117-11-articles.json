After all, it\u0027s happened with nearly all previous releases, and some of these introduced only a small fraction of what 1.0 is going to.\n\u003E \n\u003E What SQUAD is trying to do is to not only fix *all* of the bugs introduced by the 0.90 update (I\u0027m still surprised that there was no 0.90.1 patch to take care of some of this), but it also must introduce an enormous number of new features. *All* of these features must be less buggy than usual, and *all* of these features must be extensively tested. As much as I respect the QA testers, I simply think that this is too much for any small group of people to test in any reasonable amount of time.\n\u003E \n\u003E So!\n\u003E \n\u003E While some of the new features are really good, I actually cringe when I see them, because I think that they will have some really nasty bugs. I would hate for SQUAD\u0027s triumphant release of 1.0, covered by so many websites and embraced by so many people, to have a patch a week after its release because thousands of people\u0027s games are breaking in some way or another. I know that this is \u0022just another update,\u0022 but unlike all of the other updates, it\u0027s much more important for SQUAD to get it right the first time. And I don\u0027t think that will happen.\n\u003E \n\u003E If you could release an \u00270.99\u0027 update, which would be *identical* to the 1.0 update but not be considered the actual release, then we could squish bugs by the dozens, and 1.0 could be better. There\u0027s no real reason not to.\n\u003E \n\u003E ...and I don\u0027t care in the slightest about Unity 5. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E -Upsilon\n\u003E \n\u003E [EDIT: ...and while I\u0027m posting here, I should mention that water needs a significant overhaul, both aesthetically and functionally. *It\u0027s difficult to believe that water has been less forgiving to land on than land in KSP since it was actually rendered as something that was not solid, back in 0.8 or 0.9*. This is badly needed, SQUAD. Can you please make it happen?]\n\n**After some people were talking about implementing Unity 5, I had this to say:**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I personally think that Unity 5 is something that SQUAD should pursue in its spare time. \n\u003E I actually think that updating the engine might not be the best thing to do at this point, because 1.0 will be buggy enough without having to change the code up a bit for Unity 5. Not only would this transfer likely introduce some bugs, but Unity 5 *itself* is buggy, and needs some time to have the kinks worked out.\n\u003E \n\u003E Also, it would be a terrible thing to do for modders: I think that a lot of people were quite happy with the relatively easy mod-ability of 1.0, and this would destroy any of that.\n\u003E \n\u003E **That being said, I still think that an 0.99 release should be absolutely essential.**\n\u003E \n\u003E Most people who don\u0027t want an 0.99 update seem to state, \u0022What\u0027s in a name, anyway? There\u0027s no problem with calling this update 1.0, because it\u0027s really no more different than any previous update.\u0022 I understand that. However, we inhabitants of the Kerbal Space Program forum know far more about KSP\u0027s development process than the average consumer, which is why these sorts of statements are being made (IMO).\n\u003E \n\u003E There will be a huge surge of publicity as KSP \u0022leaves beta,\u0022 and people unfamiliar to the game will start treating (and reviewing) the game like it\u0027s at a finished, stable state. It\u0027s currently not, and it almost certainly won\u0027t be for 1.0. There are already a number of bugs and glitches, ranging from the mildly annoying to the game-breaking, and this number will likely increase with the release of 1.0. If this happens, KSP might get some bad press - and might not profit as much as it could.\n\u003E \n\u003E So, it would be in everyone\u0027s best interest to get the game as stable and non-buggy as possible before the release of 1.0. The best way to do this is to create an 0.99 release. It would let thousands of people test out the new features, find out where they don\u0027t work, and send reams of data to SQUAD. There\u0027s simply no better way to do it.\n\u003E \n\u003E Just my $0.02USD.\n\u003E \n\u003E -Upsilon\n\n**[Yesterday, SQUAD said it wished to pursue 1.0, for whatever reason. Knowing this, I tried to recommend actions to take for 1.0:]**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Okay. Time for a really long rant. Sorry...\n\u003E I don\u0027t want 1.0 to be buggy. \n\u003E \n\u003E Like, it\u0027s possibly the most important thing that SQUAD has to improve, IMO.\n\u003E \n\u003E Every time an update to KSP comes out, in general, it\u0027s buggy. I don\u0027t mean any disrespect to SQUAD, and I\u0027m really fine with the fact that new updates aren\u0027t quite as stable initially, and may require patches and hotfixes.\n\u003E \n\u003E However, when 1.0 comes out, everyone will expect it to be stable. After all, this is the first really \u0022official\u0022 release to the game. If it\u0027s as buggy as *any* of the previous updates, then people just joining KSP may be irritated at the problems that crop up. It\u0027s *not only* going to need to eliminate many bugs that KSP currently has, *but it\u0027s also* going to have to add in a number of features that are nearly completely bug-free.\n\u003E \n\u003E **In the past, it seems as if squashing bugs hasn\u0027t been a tremendous priority for SQUAD:**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - The radial decoupling bug has been present and extremely damaging for the last several updates. While SQUAD thought they squashed it, it just appeared in a different form.\n\u003E - Kerbals falling off External Command Seats and being considered debris has been a thing ever since command seats were *introduced*, back in 0.20.\n\u003E - There have been significant problems with docking ports not docking or undocking that have persisted for several versions.\n\u003E - The Claw has introduced a number of game-breaking bugs that have yet to be fixed.\n\u003E - You often can\u0027t set up maneuver nodes whilst on hyperbolic paths, which has persisted since maneuver nodes were introduced.\n\u003E - Craft occasionally \u0022collide with buildings\u0022 several kilometers away from the KSC; this has been a rare but known issue for several versions, and it hasn\u0027t yet been fixed.\n\u003E - Occasionally, the VAB/SPH won\u0027t allow you to click on the buttons in the top right, so you can\u0027t launch or really do anything else.\n\u003E - Kerbals climbing ladders still generates a phantom force, as it has since ladders were introduced.\n\u003E - Many people have trouble even loading the game, for various reasons caused by bugs.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **...and there are many,** ***many*** **more significant issues with the game as it is now, that haven\u0027t ever been addressed.**\n\u003E \n\u003E So, what should be done about this?\n\u003E \n\u003E **I would say that if KSP 1.0** ***absolutely needs*****:**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Immense amounts of bug-squashing. As mentioned above.\n\u003E - Retexturing parts. The parts in KSP are of a variety of different quality levels, and they often don\u0027t \u0022work\u0022 together aesthetically. This should definitely be fixed before 1.0, and it adds no bugs.\n\u003E - Rebalancing parts. Some parts are ridiculously overpowered, while others quite underpowered. This does need to be fixed, and it shouldn\u0027t add any bugs either.\n\u003E - Renaming parts. The descriptions of the new wing bits, for example, are placeholders. This should probably be fixed before 1.0.\n\u003E - An aerodynamics overhaul. As worried as I am about this introducing new bugs, it most certainly needs to be done before the game can be considered finished.\n\u003E - A water overhaul. Water in KSP is currently really ugly and more dangerous to land on than terra firma. Changing the water might introduce new bugs, but it wouldn\u0027t be that difficult to handle (I think).\n\u003E - A sound overhaul. The sound in KSP isn\u0027t all that great, and it could easily be made better, from rocket noises to music to that really nasty bird-chirping noise while you\u0027re viewing the space center.\n\u003E - A visual overhaul. KSP isn\u0027t a bad-looking game, but it would look even better with improved rocket flames, clouds, different ground textures for different biomes, and the like. Just as long as it\u0027s not too hard on your CPU.\n\u003E - Keep the female Kerbals! It\u0027s good to make people of both genders feel empowered and welcome.\n\u003E - Update tutorials. It\u0027s not that difficult to do, and the current tutorials seem limited and often have grammatical errors.\n\u003E - Maybe other stuff. I wouldn\u0027t do it if I were you though. No ISRU, *please*. It\u0027s really not needed, it\u0027s buggy, and it distracts y\u0027all from more important stuff.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E You can add other stuff, but I personally wouldn\u0027t. There\u0027s no real reason to, in my opinion. It\u0027s better to have a strong foundation going into 1.0 than it is to build a bunch of fancy stuff onto a weak base. \n\u003E \n\u003E And that\u0027s my two cents.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **By the way, thank you for seeking our opinions on this matter! I really appreciate that you\u0027re trying to make a connection with us and seeing what we want.**\n\u003E \n\u003E -Upsilon\n\ntl;dr: I\u0027m still not sure why SQUAD isn\u0027t comfortable with releasing more beta versions. They could have a 1.0 that was not only \u0022feature complete\u0022 *but also bug-free*. Or, they could pursue their current path and sacrifice one or the other for no readily apparent reason. The community doesn\u0027t like this, new players and reviewers won\u0027t like this, and it puts arbitrary strain on SQUAD. The choice is crystal clear, for me at least.\n\nSQUAD should ensure that 1.0 isn\u0027t buggy. That\u0027s their biggest priority. In addition, they should probably overhaul all of the \u0022placeholders\u0022 that have been added to the game over the years. If they can do this, I feel as if KSP will be ready for an incomplete, but still playable, 1.0. If they try for the current feature list, the game probably won\u0027t work very well. And no one wants a nonfunctional \u0022first official release\u0022 version.\n\nSorry for the incredibly long post. I just want to re-iterate my opinions on this matter.\n\nIf you give this post and others like it some serious thought, SQUAD and Maxmaps, I will send a hand-written letter thanking you profusely. And I hate sending hand-written letters. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-18T14:17:43Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2015 02:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by UpsilonAerospace**"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T14:18:31Z","Content":"**Add me to the optimisation and bugfix crowd.**\n\nUntil recently memory crashes were not a thing for me, then lots of stock content was added and now having the memory footprint go up every scene change crashes my game regularly.\n\nYes it is because of mods but mods make the game for me.\n\nMy vote would be for **bug fixes so that if the game runs on boot, it continues to be stable even after many scene changes**.\n\nAlso, making stock **every one of Claws Stock Bug Fixes**.\n\n(Also **fix the NASA claw part**, it\u0027s a bit... unpredictable)\n\n**One big thing though is to replace all the placeholders with the things that are supposed to replace them, like the insta-chutes being replaced with chris\u0027s realchutes for example.

And the fact that Minecraft is the only early-access game I\u0027ve seen actually continue full development after release (while seeing countless others stall and eventually just stop) certainly makes me nervous.\n\nAlso\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I think every KSP player would much prefer that art/animation talent being focused on producing and polishing in-game content rather than 30second clips that we will watch once if that."},{"CreatedByName":"CptRichardson","CreatedById":269,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T16:21:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Quite. KSP is a million miles away from the traditional situation where the game came out and you read an actual print magazine to find out if it was bobbins; it\u0027s quite a long way away from a triple-A game today where it comes out and then you watch Youtube videos ditto. From an extensive survey of games review sites (er, one) - Rock, Paper, Shotgun first mentions KSP in July 2011, frequently thereafter, generally positively. Even if they do hate 1.0, it\u0027s hardly going to have the same impact on the readership as if that was the first mention of it.\n\u003E KSP seems to me much more akin to a game like Dwarf Fortress where people are already reasonably well aware of what\u0027s on the table, whether or not they\u0027ve ever tried it; there\u0027s a wealth of Let\u0027s Plays and the like to show what it\u0027s like; and any given version is never going to be taken as all that special, to be singled out as What This Game Is Like.\n\u003E \n\u003E That said I\u0027d quite like the memory leaks addressed, ahem, and I think it would be terrible if Valentina got pushed back.\n\nFrom the looks of things, Valentina is one of the done things according to the devblogs.

It\u0027s like they swerved the car off the road and now that it\u0027s plummeting into the ravine, they\u0027re turning around and asking us for opinions on how to make it better.\n\nPersonally, I thought this moment was coming ages ago when they began developing career, and revealed science to be designed as a point scoring mechanism, rather than something designed to bring the experience of exploring another planet to life.\n\nOne problem is, they\u0027ve made grinding the key way to achieve in a game about space exploration. \n\nPlus, where they could have made career\u0027s focus about managing and running a space program. Giving you tools for tracking your budget and planning trajectories, and challenges like making sure you don\u0027t let kerbalnauts starve, doing enough interesting things to keep the population interested and funding you, and keeping your ) they instead made it about unlocking things. Things you need to go space exploring. \n\nIt\u0027s not that running a space center type things aren\u0027t there, they just seem to play second fiddle to the goal of unlocking things. New buildings, or new parts in the list are big and obvious, whereas your achievements in science are buried away as a fairly non-descript list. \n\nPlus, it is rather backwards. The purpose of your space exploration is to unlock better tools for space exploration? And once your space center is fully operational, you\u0027ve finished the game?\n\nOff course, you could go land on all the planets, but there\u0027s not a lot to do, land, click on science, fly away not needing to return. \n\nI don\u0027t think they\u0027ve re-thought the plan a great deal since the game was just a rocket builder. Contracts do go some way to filling in the gaps, but only carrying out tasks that other companies have requested of you doesn\u0027t give you a great sense of ownership over your space activities."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T17:00:03Z","Content":"1.0 means you will be reviewed.\n\nThey will rip you a new one if some of the game-breaking bugs are still not addressed.

As a professional software developer, I would never be thinking about adding big features in the run up to \u0027live\u0027 day. Either features were there for the \u0027final\u0027 beta test, or they\u0027re happening after it goes live, or the deadline is pushed back and another beta round happens. The only thing that happens between the actual *last* beta and the first live release are *simple* bugfixes that can be internally verified.\n\u003E ...you should kinda know this, Squad.\n\u003E \n\u003E That said, it is clear that this community will gladly offer their time to test the begeebus out of what has been implemented thus far, and Squad, I really think you should consider taking them up on that offer. That is a remarkable show of loyalty and interest; with most games, people would just want the thing to launch so\u0027s they could start a new save, but this community wants it to launch *well,* even if that means launching later than they\u0027d like and continuing to play careers that they know will be deleted in the great purge of 1.0.\n\u003E \n\u003E Please make use of the massive testing resource this community is offering! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nBut as a software developer you must also know that this is not always possible. Even though we like to think of Squad as independent, they have a CEO and someone who may very well be setting deadlines for them, similar to how a publisher would be. As a result, we often get buggy software and games because it is a constant battle to implement the features of a game or software and keep it bug free. And moreso, you must know the cycle can be endless. Fixing bugs often creates new bugs. At some point you just have to put the features in, squash as many bugs as you can, and release it.\n\nI\u0027d like to see more beta patches, but it may not be in Harvester and other\u0027s control (which it sort of sounds like it based on what they have said)."},{"CreatedByName":"BrainiacBlue","CreatedById":118201,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T17:14:42Z","Content":"Whislt I beleive that the goal list should \\*cough\\* have been reviewed \\*cough\\* at some point in the last few years \\*cough\\* I think you should only do one additional feature: finish the Kerbol System to add those gas giants and asteroid belt that you said you would a few months ago back when we were still in Alpha.\n\nOther than that just add all of the polish.
