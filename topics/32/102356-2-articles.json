At the moment, it\u0027s more like a crew and storage area than a lab. The seat position is reasonable for travel, but not for working.\n\nThere doesn\u0027t seem to be any sort of workspace, which surely is the main thing the part should provide.\n\nHere are some examples from the ISS of science areas:\n\n![s122e008911.jpg](http://spaceflight1.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-122/hires/s122e008911.jpg)\n\n![i19_025588.jpg](http://cache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/blogs/bigpicture/iss_11_24/i19_025588.jpg)\n\n![sts120_fisheye02.jpg](http://collectspace.com/review/sts120_fisheye02.jpg)\n\n![Columbus_Illustration.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/83/Columbus_Illustration.gif)\n\nPlus, the fact that everything is vertically oriented could be a bit of a design flaw. In space, there is no up and down, and that part also lends itself to being landed horizontally. Designing this part prioritising vertical use seems like an odd choice, considering its mainly used for stations and bases. \n\nAt the moment, it doesn\u0027t look much like a science lab, just an extended version of the hitchhiker cabin with different cupboards. I can\u0027t really see it being a useful place to do science. Unfortunately, I doubt Squad cares enough to let there be changes.\n\nAlso, in the MK3 crew cabin, are those seats lined up so all the kerbals can see out the windows? It\u0027s hard to see from the picture.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-21T09:20:48Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2015 09:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tw1**"},{"CreatedByName":"Francois424","CreatedById":98138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T02:16:02Z","Content":"I\u0027m genuinely impressed.\n\nAmazing work."},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T02:20:47Z","Content":"Those look most excellent!
