In the past I have been to Mun, Minmus, Duna and Ike, Jool and Laythe and I guess technically to Kerbin and Kerbol. My resent expedition took me to Moho and then Eeloo, thinking if I was orbiting Moho I would not have to wait as long for a window to Eeloo. I am currently orbiting Eve and planing my visit to Gilly. I am thinking of approaching it more like a rendezvous with a space station than a Hohmann like transfer. Dres isn\u0027t the big mystery for me. I am still having problems figuring out how to reach the ? asteroids hovering around Kerbin. How can they stay so close to Kerbin, unless they are in orbits with the same period? Should I just tilt my inclination in relationship to Kerbol?"}]}
