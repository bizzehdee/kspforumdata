NTRs run *very hot*, much hotter than conventional chemical engines. Here\u0027s a [convenient source I found](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_thermal_rocket#Solid_core) which is generally trustworthy.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The simplest of nuclear thermal rockets, solid core reactors are limited by the melting point of the materials used in the reactor cores. The solid core design needs to be constructed of materials that remain strong at as high a temperature as possible. Nuclear reactions can create much higher temperatures than the temperatures the materials can withstand, meaning that much of the potential of the reactor for very high temperatures is sacrificed. Even more limiting is the cracking of fuel coatings due to the large temperature ranges (from 22 K up to 3000 K over the length of a 1.3 m fuel rod), and the necessity of matching coefficients of expansion in all the components."},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T21:03:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Incorrect.
