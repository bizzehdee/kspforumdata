Then use the AutoPruner file provided in the download, which gets rid of the unused parts in terms of RAM usage. Not only from Squad folders but also from eg TAC life support and other supported mods.\n\nThat is at least a partial replacement of the stock parts. I have not tested it, but using StockPartRevamp from Ven and the provided AutoPruner file probably gets you even closer to \u0022total replacement\u0022."}]}
