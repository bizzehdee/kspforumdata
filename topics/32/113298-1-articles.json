Mostly it was screwing around in sandbox, building cool space ships and finding new and exciting ways to not successfully land on the Mun or paint the run way with spaceplane parts. I left it for a while and got back into it once ver 1 hit and have been doing the career mode, where I am somewhere around day 45 and have several trips to the Mun, where I not only landed, but made it back with the same number of Kerbals I left with.\n\nNow I have several gaming systems (PS2-4, Xbox 360 and 1.) and a severe backlog of games I am trying to finish before all the new AAA games start dropping, so I\u0027ve been trying to shelve KSP for a while. But like heroine addicts or retired mob enforcers, I keep getting sucked back in, thanks to TV and movies. There was some space movie on Syfy that made me want to play again. I stopped for a few days, and then the new season of Defiance started back up featuring scenes of alien ships floating through debris fields, and I had to play again, and yesterday, damn Apollo 13 was on TV, and I had to start up planning my first landing on Minimus.\n\nEvery time I get away from this damn game, I see a show dealing with spaceships, and I have to fire it back up. Will my torment never end?"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Vlad","CreatedById":106306,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T05:14:34Z","Content":"No. No it won\u0027t."},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T05:25:01Z","Content":"As a three year veteran of KSP...
