That lander could have been one-quarter the size and still worked fine; Mun\u0027s surface gravity is only 1/6th of Kerbin\u0027s, and the escape velocity is far lower. More importantly, you could have done that design with far fewer struts, because there just aren\u0027t large stresses involved in that sort of mission; yes, I know strut masses are tiny, but it jacks up your part count, and as you\u0027ve seen before part count is the primary contributor to lag. You\u0027ve also got a lot of unneeded parts, like the large number of batteries and solar panels. Given that you\u0027ve got almost nothing requiring electricity, and rocket engines generate power simply by operating, it\u0027s just not necessary. Stick a single 100-unit stack battery below your ASAS, put four fixed-orientation solar panels on the outer tanks, and you\u0027re done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only time a Mun lander needs to be that big is if it\u0027s carrying along something like a rover, a kethane refinery, etc.; basically, the payload fraction for rockets are pretty much fixed, so if you\u0027re carrying a lot of payload then you need something large. But when your ship is just fuel, engine, and a tiny 1-man crew capsule, there\u0027s really no need for something that large. It\u0027s not that you can\u0027t ever do a bit of overkill, but A) You need to practice making small designs for those situations where the larger one just ISN\u0027T as good (like with spaceplanes or the upcoming resource system), and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E eventually there\u0027ll be a career mode, which may or may not add economic reasons to keep things small.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, if you\u0027re just going to Mun, using LV-Ns on every stage is not the best idea. Consider your final stage, a 2.25-ton engine on a 2.25-ton fuel tank. Functionally, in a vacuum this is only slightly better than a 4.5-ton fuel tank with a 0.5-ton LV-909 engine; the LV-N might be twice as efficient, but the weight is so much higher that you\u0027re not really saving anything. (An LV-N should really never use less than a 4.5-ton tank for this reason.) But that\u0027s in a vacuum, and as seen in your pictures, you were using it to brake during your return to Kerbin. (That\u0027s another issue, which I\u0027ll get to in a minute.) In-atmosphere, an LV-N\u0027s efficiency goes down quickly; at sea level its efficiency is worse than any other engine in the game, so there\u0027s very little benefit to using one for an in-atmosphere deceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that brings up another issue: you shouldn\u0027t have been using a rocket to decelerate at all. In Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, a couple small parachutes are all you need to make a safe landing with a return vessel of that size. Even without parachutes, simple atmospheric friction will kill almost all of your velocity (all but about 100m/s) before you reach ground level; that\u0027s basically the definition of terminal velocity, so you absolutely shouldn\u0027t be firing rockets above a couple thousand meters unless you\u0027re trying to aim for a specific landing spot. This is also why I previously suggested placing a stack separator just below the RCS tank, so that your final stage is simply the capsule, its parachute, the RCS tank, and four RCS jets. That small vessel would be capable of returning to Kerbin from Mun orbit by itself, and would have no need for any deceleration engines at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Note: if you try landing on Duna, its atmosphere is thin enough that you usually need to use rockets to decelerate to any safe speed. If you try on Eve, you can go in completely unpowered, except that you\u0027ll want to fire the rockets a bit once you get really low just to keep the higher gravity from breaking your landing gear on impact. Kerbin\u0027s pretty much perfectly in between these two extremes.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"korda","CreatedById":9114,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-02T10:48:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spatzimaus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spatzimaus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI know strut masses are tiny, but it jacks up your part count, and as you\u0027ve seen before part count is the primary contributor to lag.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I know game treats struts in very special way, for example they don\u0027t actually add to weight of crafts.
