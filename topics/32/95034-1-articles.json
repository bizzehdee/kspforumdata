Kasholo 1 was intended to be an Apollo-style mission using the ALCOR pod, the SDHI service module system, as well as some other mods. It started to go wrong when I timewarped through the Mun, making a \u0022Kasholo 1 Lander\u0022 craft appear. I later terminated it, and was able to use the remaining fuel in the transfer module to get into orbit before escaping from the mun. I ran into issues when i tried to decouple the transfer stage, and it was revealed that the payload fairing had been welded onto the lander\u0027s engine. Using the Kaboom! mod, I was able to \u0022remove\u0022 the fairing without damaging the crew module and lander. It went smoothly until the braking burn being done by Mechjeb. I checked the DeltaV to see if it met the requirements mechjeb said it needed to land. I was startled to discover the lander did not have the fuel it needed. The 4 RCS blocks were not powerful enough to slow down the lander, and at around 64 m/s the lander impacted the surface. The landing legs absorbed some of the impact, only breaking them to a point where they could be repaired. The LV-909 that powered the lander however, was destroyed, meaning even if I could get some fuel or something down to the lander, the lander could not get back to orbit. This is in sandbox mode, and I do not use a life support mod in the install i am using so Jeb and Bill will be safe, but they may be on the Mun for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T19:11:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E2 on the surface of Mun, 6 in orbit around Mun, and the rest are yucking it up poolside at the Administration building... rumor has it the pool water has been replaced with champagne.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Loerelau","CreatedById":34011,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T19:51:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot too fancy.
