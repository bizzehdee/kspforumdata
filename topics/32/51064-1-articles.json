The more expensive i7s or the consumer level Xeon chips won\u0027t make much difference for this game (though they shouldn\u0027t be any worse) so I would stick with the i5s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should certainly be able to handle a 500 part craft, but you could do that anyway. It\u0027s really a question of what level of performance is acceptable. You could make a 5000 part craft if you could accept running at 5 FPS. But with that CPU you should expect at least 25 FPS with around 500 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the other components, it\u0027s like everyone else said, 8GB RAM and a decent video card (HD7850 or GTX 660) should be able to handle anything KSP can throw at them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lazarus1024","CreatedById":65276,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T15:20:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah a mid grade video card is pretty much going to allow you to max out the graphics and have no graphically based limitations on your frame rates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour limitation will be on the CPU side.

The laptop is high enough spec to handle most of what I want to do in the game and lounging on the couch or the easy chair in my living room with my wife is more important to me than sitting in my basement office. That\u0027ll probably change some in a year or two once we\u0027ve finished renovating our basement (just finishing touches now) and we also have the spare change to get a nice new TV (until then, the 42\u0022 in the upstairs family/playroom and the 32\u0022 is in the basement). Then the basement will be the main entertaining room and I\u0027ll probably use my desktop a heck of a lot more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo all that said, my laptop can regularly run 200 part ships at over 30fps through most of game play. I do get a bit of launch lag and a bit of orbital horizon view and looking down on oceans lag on larger ships, but it probably still hits over 15fps most of the time and regular play is over 30fps (granted, 768p). The last few releases I haven\u0027t done much other than stuff right around Kerbin, Mun and Minmus with a couple of quick probe forays to Eve and Duna as I just haven\u0027t had much spare time the last few months (and a back injury over the summer). Earlier on, I did have a bit of a frustrating time with some really big ships in the 300\u002B part range for Moho and Jool missions, but I am a lot more efficient in design now, so I tend not to need them that big. I won\u0027t mind (hopefully) a couple of years from now getting a new laptop and fingers crossed, CPU performance will have gone up a moderate amount (at least 20-30%, preferable 25-35%) over what I have now.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-29T15:24:13Z\u0022 title=\u002210/29/2013 03:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by lazarus1024\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeathFromBelow","CreatedById":27284,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T19:21:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Intel i5 4670k is the best performance/value, KSP doesn\u0027t benefit from more cores. You might actually get slightly better performance out of the older socket 1155 3570k\u0027s since Ivy Bridge will overclock a bit further than the newer Haswell architecture, but I\u0027d still go with the 4670k for the power savings and improved chipset features on the socket 1150 boards. I don\u0027t have any GPU recommendations, I\u0027ve always played with a Radeon HD 7970 GPU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou really can\u0027t go wrong with any of the high-end chips. I\u0027ve run KSP on a heavily overclocked AMD FX 8320 (4.8 GHz) and my current i7 Extreme 4930k (4.5 GHz) setup. The FX did just fine at 1080p resolution. The i7 can definitely handle higher part counts, but the Kerbin horizon still causes slowdowns at 4k resolution (3840x2160).

Other than that, make sure you have 8 GB or RAM and a decent, mid range GPU like an HD 7850 or GTX 660/760 if you want something that will be amazing for someone on a budget. I have a GTX 660 Ti and it barely breaks a sweat at 1080p. It\u0027s more than what you need for KSP, but it can handle any other game, too. I had a 7850 but I had the 1 GB model so I pretty much \u0027had\u0027 to ditch it because I\u0027m running 2 monitors and play games on a 1080p monitor with a secondary 1600x900 that was my old monitor. I have noted that Battlefield 3 and other games do in fact use a fair bit more than 1 GB of vRAM, about 1.3 GB of usage from what I remember seeing in GPU-Z. I didn\u0027t want to have issues with something dumb like lack of vRAM. Plus, I got the 660 Ti for $165. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonal stories aside, if you\u0027re going to be building this sometime soon, you would do best with an Intel i5 (don\u0027t buy an i7 or 16 GB of RAM unless you do editing or find one or the other for the same price as the lower end component. it won\u0027t help KSP performance at all), a mid range GPU that should cost about $150 or less if you get a 7850, and 8 GB of RAM. Just make sure you get quality components elsewhere in your system. Notably, don\u0027t cheap out on the power supply. A Corsair CX 600 is a great entry level PSU that shouldn\u0027t explode on you (many cheap ones will). I used to recommend Antec, but I had one explode in my face and screw up my system in some very subtle ways. Notably, I lost onboard sound and had to get a cheapo sound card at Best Buy. Antec is supposed to be good, but after seeing sparks and light come out of that PSU I don\u0027t feel comfortable with them anymore. If you have more money, look at a Seasonic or higher-end Corsair PSU. Seasonic is about the best you can get.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
