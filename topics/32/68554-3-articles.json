The KR-2L has better vacuum isp than the KS-25 even though the RL RS-25 has slightly better isp than the J-2X. Both the KR-1 and S1 SRB boosters have massively less thrust than their RL analogs, though the KR-1 has substantially better vacuum isp than the mighty F-1. Interestingly the model used for the KR-1 is smaller than the one used for the KS-25 (though the RL F-1 easily dwarfs the RS-25s used on the Space Shuttle), and they have the same isp, but the KR-1 has slightly higher thrust (per engine).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022karolus10\u0022 data-cite=\u0022karolus10\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOne of serious problems of engines with better ISP in vacuum is that thrust is not influenced by atmospheric pressure (atmospheric curve in KSP) but fuel consumption - low atmosphere ISP for this engine should be significantly lower but this causing engine to suck fuel at ridiculous rate.\u003Cp\u003EIRL fuel flow is constant for the engine and max thrust is available only at certain pressure range (sea-level, vacuum or something in between for compromise) and thrust is lower in case of under/overexpansion of the exhaust... in short engine should consume same amount of fuel all the time it\u0027s turned on and it\u0027s thrust should change with altitude (so vacuum engines could be nearly useless on ground in extreme cases).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree completely.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-21T04:06:16Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2014 04:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by architeuthis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T17:02:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dogoncrook\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dogoncrook\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI made an assumption I suppose, but what was the point of your statement of fact?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point I was making is that I\u0027ve found the simplicity of build and reduced part-count using ARM parts becomes worth considering for payloads as low as 10t. With fewer, more powerful, parts I am also no longer using asparagus staging as a matter of course, which again makes builds simpler and reduces build-count. The new launch vehicles are also cheaper, in as much as cost has any relevance at the moment. Maintaining a launch TWR of 1.6 - 2 and deltaV of 4,600 - 4,800m/s the only downside is their reduced payload ratio; in this specific case down from 16.49% for a somewhat optimised asparagus build to 11.34%.

Every design would use either the one engine with the highest performance, or the one engine with the best cost/performance. The ion engine and the LV-N are great examples where gameplay tradeoffs were made against realism-- the ion is a zillion times more powerful than real life, simply because using it would require tedious, dull gameplay with hours-long burns. The LV-N is quite a bit *less* powerful than real life, because a realistic nuclear thermal rocket with high TWR and Isp would quickly replace every other engine in every design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, there will *always* be something that is \u0022imbalanced\u0022 to somebody because there is no solution that satisfies everyone\u0027s definition of balance.
