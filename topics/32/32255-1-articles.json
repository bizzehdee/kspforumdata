Taking into account the most efficient time to push your apoapsis out is at the periapsis, and you are only smack bang at your periapsis for one moment in time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo burn is ever going to be quite like this, especially long ones where you may start many degrees further round the planet from where your node is, and continue for many degrees after - this will change the overall efficiency of the burn. Doing a 10 minute burn with 5 on either side of the node is going to cost a bit of extra delta-v as your going to start and end the burn in very different points of the orbit and will thus need a bit of extra burn time compared to the calculation. You of course also expend fuel making yourself lighter as you go which will cause you to need less burn time, though with NERVAs the weight reduction is likely to loose you a lot less burn time than the need for long burns adds on. Larger engines may end up the opposite, not sure - lot of variables.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"foamyesque","CreatedById":2982,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T09:26:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022johnnyhandsome\u0022 data-cite=\u0022johnnyhandsome\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk, I\u0027ve managed to build a launcher system that can put a big orange tank with two or three nerva engines, along with 20 ton rover and landing system, in orbit.
