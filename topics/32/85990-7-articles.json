There are those that think that awards on contracts might adjust difficulty\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 they really don\u0027t. I\u0027m not even looking for difficulty, I want each campaign to be novel, and \u003Cem\u003Echance\u003C/em\u003E is very much part of that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA great example from another game, Silent Hunter 4. The campaign game (stock) was abysmal. Not \u0022meh,\u0022 abysmal, worthless, you get the idea. I made a new campaign that was supposed to be realistic within the engine limits, but not perfectly historical. Another modder (we collaborated on both mods, he helped a lot with mine, I helped add some units to his, etc) did a historical mod. If there was a japanese task force 200 nm NW of Guam on April 2d, 1943, you can go there in his campaign, and there they are. This is very cool, but it also means that if you do another campaign and happen to be in that area at the same date, it will be identical. My take was to have the right balance of units, and have them going from a sensible place to another sensible place, but it was random. Other than major naval engagements, I didn\u0027t script historical movements. Realistic \u003Cem\u003Efeel\u003C/em\u003E, but not perfectly historical. That\u0027s an ideal KSP campaign model for me.

We already get stranded kerbal missions, but where do they come from? This is where they come from. Add another spaceport someplace, and that is the competition\u0027s launch facility. Every so often (random) your game sill borrow craft files from other players, and add them to the competition\u0027s hanger of stuff. If there was a way to record a mission (like tracks in some games (Il-2, for example)), the track of a launch can be downloaded to your game. Some make it to orbit, some fail, some guys get stranded (maybe in their spacecraft, or even nearby one (EVA gone wrong)). You might find a station that you do not own up there. How/if you can interact with it might be part of the campaign (\u0022New international space treaty signed, contract to take astronauts to Kerbinov Station now available.\u0022). It provides as context for rescues. Then there is competition. Another player orbits the Mun. You might get a contract that pays out if you beat them to a landing, but less (or nothing) for a 2d place. This is obviously complex, but it is a way of populating people\u0027s games with stuff they didn\u0027t make, and a sense of competition that might make replay more interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-04T20:08:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sandworm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sandworm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA proper difficulty setting would effect game mechanics.

I combined a few testing missions (landed, then on orbit in for things I as gonna use anyway). Unlocked a ton. Very soon I had everything I really needed, but since I wanted to try probes, I pushed some more for solar, and science instruments (because even if useless from a gameplay standpoint, I want landers to carry as much instrumentation as possible).
