Still, congrats on your escape velocity. Keep modifying your design! Maybe try getting it so that you can escape kerbin and then circularize your orbit. If you can get a good design with that kind of capability then once you (hopefully) upgrade to the full game you can jump out of the gate with an interplanetary capable design and head for Duna or Eve! While your limited to the Demo you should just refine your rocket designs, maybe land on the Mun and return, practice achieving and adjusting orbits around Kerbin or the Mun. These are all basic skills that will help you in the full version. Good luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
