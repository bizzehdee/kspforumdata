I open it and read it. \u0022Wow!

Quite frankly mods do a lot of things better than stock ever will. For instance, Engineer will be better than any stock delta-V/informational feature because KSP has to stick to its design paradigm of starving the player of information while enforcing a repeated build-test-fly regime. I can\u0027t possibly see them adding a customizable multi-field display, even though nearly all of that information is literally available through the game. Imagine Squad doing a Real Fuels type implementation; it would suck compared to actual Real Fuels because they\u0027d have to stick to the simplicity of stock design.\nAnything else that comes along will either be completely useless to me, a bugfix, or additional gravy. I\u0027ll play stock for a time and I\u0027ll be very happy for all the things that were added, most especially because they will also help along the realism mods I enjoy and contribute to, but stock KSP is just too simpleminded to provide the detail for how I like playing. I don\u0027t think extra updates beyond bugfixing will be nearly as exciting as this update to me.\n\nOne thing I am looking forward to, however, is Unity 5. I seriously hope Squad considers upgrading because other games I follow have reported great improvements because of it.

In Space Engineer terms, it\u0027s taken us a year (actually getting towards two from 0.22) to advance about two to three weeks.\n\nMy own dev notes show more progress in two days on my own little projects (this ain\u0027t my day job kids) than KSP does (this EFFING well IS Harv\u0027s day job) in two years.\n\nSo I say, *glacial*.

Imma gonna be blunt here - RF, while cool, has a terrible UI. Squad could hardly do worse even if they *were* an actual squad of chimpanzees (like the logo implies).\n\n2. If they made an RF-usable framework, maybe it would actually work with TAC\\_LS then (or was that MFT that was getting all screwy?

Actually, they probably wouldn\u0027t ever do that anyways, fast updates or no. Nevermind.\n\n(I do like me some scaling, it\u0027s usually in the opposite direction that you like though heh. Smaller isn\u0027t necessarily less challenging - try landing on Gregox\u0027s \u0027Sprinkle\u0027 mini-minmus.

And again, that\u0027s sorta an early-access kinda issue - Squad\u0027s going to be less eager to roll out buggy updates post-1.0, and a U5 port will not be a simple and clean thing (based on Harv\u0027s post, and I noted that 7DTD is having some growing pains with U5 too). So what do they do? Run development on two branches, or simply clam up for a year and half while they work it out internally? They certainly can\u0027t roll it out with 1.1 and say, \u0022oh, we went to U5, there will be lots of bugs, we\u0027re early access so just deal with it for the next few updates while we sort it out\u0022 anymore.\n\nWhich is precisely the kind of thing I\u0027m talking about."},{"CreatedByName":"viktor19","CreatedById":111560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T18:14:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...so just deal with it for the next few updates while we sort it out..."},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T18:29:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E My own dev notes show more progress in two days on my own little projects (this ain\u0027t my day job kids) than KSP does (this EFFING well IS Harv\u0027s day job) in two years.\n\nThis is true.

Also I seem to recall some silly restrictions on what can go where re: energy storage and xenon and such -- but that miiiight be MFT again and isn\u0027t directly a UI thing.\n\nAnyhow, the rest of it had to do with how a tank is partitioned - I seem to recall it was rather clunky, especially if you want to change ratios up. I\u0027ll provide some feedback in the RF thread at a later date re: the UI in the post-1.0 era. I will visit it again -the UI might be evil, but the rest of it is fun to design with and I absolutely adore the \u0027engine progression\u0027 system (where they get better as engine nodes are unlocked..although the UI end of that could be overhauled a bit too)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s a shame, really, because U5 (actually just double-precision) is sorely needed for this game.

I can\u0027t even operate blender - to make models for my own game, I typed vertices into textfiles, and then later wrote a converter that rips the models out of the original homeworld to use as placeholders haha. The engine supports texturing, but I have no practical background in that, so really only special effects have any applied, plus one tiny ship that has an MS-paint access hatch on one side heh. Oh and D) using my naming conventions, that would be something like \u0022Space Explorer\u0022 or somesuch, adding to the glut of \u0022SE\u0022-named space games.\n\nOf course if I did do it, planets would be loaded from external, user-editable data files.. in double precision (so RSS would just be a different planets.cfg file). In fact, if I went down the GCC path (I normally despise GCC, but it\u0027s always been the lesser of three evils), I\u0027d have access to extended precision (long doubles).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You have a point.
