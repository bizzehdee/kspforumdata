The one I recall the most though is that the huge killer scrolling list of fuels is kinda klunky, and being able to hide \u0027em wouldn\u0027t be amiss (kinda like how ARP can be configured to hide resources. I generally don\u0027t use fuels other than kero-lox, hydro-lox, and NTO/hydrazine, for instance, so the other more obscure fuels are just filling up my kinda dated, low-res \u0022FullHD\u0022 screen).

I will visit it again -the UI might be evil, but the rest of it is fun to design with and I absolutely adore the \u0027engine progression\u0027 system (where they get better as engine nodes are unlocked..although the UI end of that could be overhauled a bit too)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s a shame, really, because U5 (actually just double-precision) is sorely needed for this game.

I can\u0027t even operate blender - to make models for my own game, I typed vertices into textfiles, and then later wrote a converter that rips the models out of the original homeworld to use as placeholders haha. The engine supports texturing, but I have no practical background in that, so really only special effects have any applied, plus one tiny ship that has an MS-paint access hatch on one side heh.
