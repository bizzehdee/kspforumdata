My former MMB (Mobile M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn Base consitend of several rovers) acted incorecctly: A chosen base-part docked to the main-core was \u0022deformed\u0022 (acting like a concertina when accelerated) and hold it\u0027s attitude \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Euntil \u0022end of flight\u0022; after undocking only foreward and backward movements were possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. With the implementation of Pod-parts this problem was to be solved. But what a pity for far-reaching planet-observetory crafts witch are to complete in orbit with unmanned probes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I was in a perfect orbit for M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn (0.0 inclanation); but after looking for several approach types (hohmann-trajectory and behind it) i was suddenly in an 26 degree inclanation! No chance for an Apollo-like \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Espacecraft to change it\u0027s plane! That is frustrating even more when long-term projects (Jool and Eve e.g.) are underway!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. When i landed on m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn after the first EVA there was only 35% EVA-fuel left when my Kerbal entered the lander. On the following EVA my Kerbal (maybe don\u0027t holding on the ladder) fell thought M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, and all: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Kerbal, the lander, M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and even Kerbin where not existing anymore!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anybody else is to experience this behaviours of KSP it\u0027s time to say the dev\u0027s: Don\u0027t implement untested physics, stay tuned to that from v 0.19.2! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd one message over all: If i\u0027m not a member of the forum that logged in, i can\u0027t exess the ability to post a answer to s.o. or a new Thread. So don\u0027t ask for an legitimation again after this is already \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebeen done! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
