I liked Bill, because he was the first Kerbal of \u00A0mine to set foot on the Mun. He is still there to this day, but that\u0027s besides the point. If it was a randomly generated Kerbal, or if you put yourself in there, reply below, the name, and why they are your favorite. I also like one of my RNG Kerbals, Adbro, and my custom Kerbal Deviin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"solarbearman","CreatedById":159439,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-10T09:00:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJeb.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s always Jeb.
