Not because I got a muon detector into polar orbit ... but because I got it into polar orbit with my space plane!\n\n![muon01.jpg](http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/8476/muon01.jpg)\n\nMy design goal was \u0027Throw No Engines Away\u0027 which meant using the same engines *all the way up*, and bringing them back again with the plane and *landing safely*.\n\nThis is what I came up with ...\n\n![muon02.jpg](http://img29.imageshack.us/img29/9079/muon02.jpg)\n\nDrop tanks, and a small drop-trailer. I couldn\\\u0027t stick the space plane at the bottom of the stack (discarded fuel tanks make plane go boom), and I couldn\\\u0027t stick the plane on the top (trying to tow all that fuel was too unstable) so it had to be drop tanks (kinda looks cool though).\n\nI had to mount the engines in the middle of the space plane just so it would fly home, rather than plummet to the ground backside first.\n\nThe video of the deed. Though it may *appear* expertly done, I screwed up *many* times before getting it right.
