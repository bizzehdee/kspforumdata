I did more tests this morning and the upper stages had enough dV to reach orbit from a height of 3km. This simplifies a lot of things. The deorbiter is smaller (82 tons), the landing legs aren\u0027t as stressed, all the parts are available by the early/mid tech tree instead of the very end. It\u0027s wonderful. With some extra boosters, it I\u0027m certain it be fully capable of reaching orbit from sea level.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kahlzun","CreatedById":39989,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-01T15:50:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThose first couple of km are the killer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re happy using mods, check out the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/0-22-hooligan-labs-airships/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAirship mod\u003C/a\u003E it will help a \u003Cem\u003Elot \u003C/em\u003Ewith Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-01T15:53:48Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2014 03:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by kahlzun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-01T19:00:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome players have found that rigid structures made out of struts work better than landing legs on Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-01T19:55:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I was still playing with 0.22, I found that hardpoints make better landing legs than landing legs.
