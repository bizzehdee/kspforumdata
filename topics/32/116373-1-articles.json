Whenever I end up feeling burned out in my Career Science save (I can\u0027t get the hang of funds just yet, so I\u0027ve gone to easy-career mode), I load up Sandbox and set a crazy challenge for myself. Sometimes it\u0027s making orbit with only SRB\u0027s, or flying to Kerbin\u0027s North Pole in an airplane. Other times, it\u0027s crazier, like flying to Kerbin\u0027s South Pole in an asymmetric aircraft (mind, I\u0027m a keyboard player, so just imagine the amount of rapid tapping of keys needed to fly that), or to get a Firespitter propeller plane to Laythe. Other times, it\u0027s to get an electric propeller plane to Eve and fly through the super-gravity and experience all of the purple.\n\nAs for Career mode, probe-rovers would be a good starting point.

Kerbal Engineer is the only mod I would say is a necessity. (RCS Build Aid is also dandy)\n\nYou say you spend alot of time researching mods. You could spend more time watching gameplay/tutorial videos. That helped me climb the learning wall.\n\nAs for mods, KER and RCS Build Aid are my greatest recommendations. There are tons mods that offer audio/visual improvements, HUD modifiers, additional parts, and much more. Just pick a few and play for a couple of days. See what you like and what is just extra junk."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T22:48:52Z","Content":"If you have only gone to Duna, why not try Eve? Getting there and landing on Gilly is fairly easy. Landing on Eve is fairly easy too (a little harder with heat because of it\u0027s atmosphere) just don\u0027t take any Kerbals unless you don\u0027t care if you leave them there because getting off of Eve is the hard part. Then there is Dres which is... Dres. Boring but fairly easy to get to and land on. Jool is the next step. Last but not least Moho which is quite the challenge to capture into."}]}
