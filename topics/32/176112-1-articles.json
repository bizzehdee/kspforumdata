only on episode 8 so far) a playthrough of 1.3.1 Realism Overhaul with RP-1 (the Dev branch of RP-0, with a much more, IMO, sensible tech tree).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m finding, however, that some things don\u0027t really work as I\u0027d expected (and yes, this does seem to be \u0022as intended\u0022 operation, in most cases).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you don\u0027t create a NoNonRP0 folder (and delete ModuleManager.ConfigCache, if it\u0027s not your first game start), your parts bin is flooded with \u0022Non RP-0\u0022 parts -- but if you do, you don\u0027t get some (IMO) critical starter parts and probably a few other important bits -- the premade Aerobee fins and tanks, for instance; pretty important since the WAC Corporal/Aerobee analogs are very important to the early career (and there\u0027s apparently no way to bypass those vessles, due to lack of selection for small solid rocket motors and not-yet-working procedural SRMs).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there\u0027s the issue of how long Kerbal Construction Time says it will take to build your rockets -- which seems to vary wildly with difficulty levels.\u00A0 I\u0027m currently playing at \u0022normal\u0022, and a Bumper equivalent (A-4 engine and suitable tanks, pushing a WAC Corporal or Aerobee upper stage) was taking only about 36 hours to build, from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E design to ready to roll out -- but in my first career attempt, this same rocket (give or take a tiny detail) was taking more than a year to complete; it took me from 1951-01-01 to May of 1958 (and the retirement of both Jeb and Val) to launch something like seven sounding rocket missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I know this is Dev Branch for RP-0, and some of the other stuff is dev level -- and I\u0027m not complaining; I\u0027ll find a KCT setting that seems reasonably realistic and that will solve the build time issue; over time, RP-0 will get straightened out, too.\u00A0 I\u0027m not willing to drop back to 1.2.2 -- that\u0027s the version I started with on KSP, and I\u0027ve quite gotten used to the newer game (I wish I could play the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism

I\u00A0had a quick look at this on my rp-1 install (which hasn\u0027t been updated for a few months, so certainly isn\u0027t uptodate).\u00A0 I started a new game and designed a new Aerobee \u002B

I\u0027ll typically buy a few points early on as well).\u00A0 Before I\u00A0tooled the tanks, KCT said the Wac Corporal would take about\u00A063\u00A0days.\u00A0 After tooling that dropped to 21 days.\u00A0 (Normal difficulty, with the RP-0 KCT preset.\u00A0 That matches my recollection of earlier games as well.\u00A0 Subsequent rockets should be faster to build as kct rewards using the same parts with faster build times).\u00A0 So my best guess is that either something was wrong in your original playthrough, or you weren\u0027t using the RP-0 KCT preset.\u00A0 For the second playthrough, 36 hrs seems a little fast for a Wac Corporal design at the start of career, but is probably\u00A0possible if you put enough points in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly

B9 \u0022Early\u0022 procedural wings for fins results in the fins burning off, which causes the craft to break up, after which you can\u0027t collect science (even though the telemetry ring and
