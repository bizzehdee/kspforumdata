Everyone (well mostly) is nice, supportive, respectful, and most of all, THERE ARE NO TROLLS. To me the KSP community is way better than any other game community I have seen. To me, it seems like there are a few factors that really contribute to this great community\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. The Dev Team,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe KSP Dev team listens to their community, and is supportive. They are not secretive and openly tell us about whats going on.\u00A0They also\u00A0support modding, another very big aspect of the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. The Mods,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI cannot hand it enough to the forum moderators, they are great. I have never seen a mod abuse his/her power, and they always choose just the right time to step in. The Mods are what keep the forums running and as good as they are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. The Players,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone I have seen on the forums has been very mature, and I while i do think of part of that being the fact that KSP is about ROCKET SCIENCE, I also feel that the community really does a good job keeping itself mature. When people are mean, they get called out, not just by the mods, but by\u00A0everyone else too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just wanted to say this thing, as the KSP community has been really great.\u00A0\u00A0I hope it\u00A0continues to grow, but never changes.\u00A0\u00A0It is also kind of a Christmas thank you to everyone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-23T10:18:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt cannot be stressed enough how awesome this community is.
