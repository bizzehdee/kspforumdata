What I immediately noticed was how challenging KSP is. Part of this is the game not having the best tutorials (I\u0027m grateful for all of the video tutorials out there), but part of it is the nature of the game. I got wondering what type of person finds this game compelling and interesting. I certainly do, despite being terrible at it. I\u0027m currently working on my PhD in Educational Psychology, and I wonder if my interest in (social) science is one of the reasons I like it so much.\n\nSo why do others find the game interesting? Do you think it has anything to do with the path of study/career you chose? Or is there some other reason you are spending time with KSP rather than some other game?"},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T00:20:06Z","Content":"I know that KSP attracts a lot of people with interests in rocketry, technology, engineering, flight (especially aerodynamics), astronomy, computing, astrophysics, pure maths, applied maths... OK, so most people are tech enthusiasts of one sort or another!\n\nMy interests are mechanics, engineering, science and technology, with a heavy interest in medicine as an offshoot of my chronic health problems. I like building things and understanding things, and found KSP to be a great outlet for both interests!"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T00:25:04Z","Content":"\u003Cimo\u003E I think that engineers and technical people are attracted to it because it is Space, and it is *kinda* technical (it gets much more technical with mods). Then there maybe people who like it simply for the challenge, the people who want something that crosses Dwarf Fortress with Orbiter. \u003C/imo\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T00:27:01Z","Content":"well, I grew up playing with lego...and then I became a programmer. I find KSP to be quite similar to both lego and programming, it has the creativity of lego (and coding, just without the stress of work) and a lot of the trial and error, experimentation and discovery of new techniques feels very akin to programming (but without the annoying customers/bosses!). I play it, no wait....I\u0027m addicted to it (have been for several years now) because it\u0027s a fun creative outlet that poses interesting challenges (that explode when they go wrong) and it\u0027s open nature allows you to scale the challenges up as you go. The level of satisfaction when you get something for the first time is incredible, never had that from a game before.\n\nI actually really *really* like the lack of any kind of built in tutorials. It makes the game more than just about discovering space, its about discovering how to discover space. Finding out little tricks about how to design or better approaches to piloting are more satisfying if you find them out for yourself (I think anyway). And as you say, there are excellent community tutorials if you really get stuck. \n\nAnd that\u0027s the other thing that make KSP great; this community. So welcome to it!"},{"CreatedByName":"pearldrumbum","CreatedById":133163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T00:48:53Z","Content":"I\u0027m an Aeronautics/Aerospace Engineering drop-out turned Electrical and Acoustics Engineer. I also am a musician and rebuild classic cars and vintage motorcycles. KSP is literally the only game since Starcraft (1!) that I\u0027ve invested more than a couple hundred hours into as I\u0027m really not much of a gamer in general.
