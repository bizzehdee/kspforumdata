Really big. Four HOME hab modules connected by four BACE inflatable hab tubes, connected to a the 6m B9 crew tank. And that\u0027s just the habitat section! Move further down the station and you\u0027ll find the Main Conversion Array. Four massive kethane tanks, each with its own converter unit. This, in turn, is connected to the biggest fuel tank we could find, as well as four of the biggest monoprop tanks in our store-room!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what\u0027s the point of storing all that fuel if you don\u0027t have places to fill \u0027er up? That\u0027s why we\u0027ve got five main docking platforms at the end of this monstrosity. When you add in the four hab docking ports, and the four kethane filling ports, that\u0027s a total of \u003Cem\u003Ethirteen\u003C/em\u003E docking ports! Overkill? Dang right! Here at Malachai Heavy Industries, we have a little saying: \u0022Think Big. No Matter the Consequences!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeedless to say, I didn\u0027t move this ugly duckling in one go. First went the hab assembly, then the kethane conversion array, then the main storage tank, and finally the RCS tanks plus the docking platforms. Next, I\u0027m going to be putting a small living quarters for the miners on the Mun, followed by the MDP, or Mobile Drilling Platform, then a tanker to go from the drilling platform to the storage facility, and THEN (!) I\u0027ll build a lifter, which will basically be a kethane tank with some thrusters. And maybe at some point I\u0027ll justify all those hab modules and install a full staff there. If I can figure out how to transfer crew without an EVA...And here\u0027s a few more purty pictures of this beast:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b296/Wraith0/screenshot51_zps11c362c4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot51_zps11c362c4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b296/Wraith0/screenshot46_zps682c1a6e.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot46_zps682c1a6e.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOH! And fun fact! Apparently the XL solar panels generate so much energy they warp space-time, generating the quantum state of two objects occupying the same point in space, as described by MacGuffin\u0027s third law of apocryphal physics, shown here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b296/Wraith0/screenshot48_zps5e6e60cc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot48_zps5e6e60cc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExpect to see great (big) things from Malachai Heavy Industries, where we Think Big.
