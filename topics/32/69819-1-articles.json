I totally appreciate that idea. It\u0027s just that the new 23.5 parts don\u0027t look like that. They all follow a nice, black and white 60\u0027s NASA kind of design, and they definitely don\u0027t look like junkyard parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey also may be trying to make it look like the external tanks on the space shuttle. Those were all orange because they were basically rusty. NASA painted the external tank for the first shuttle launch but then decided not to paint any of the rest of them because it added too much weight. I think that\u0027s actually what Squad was thinking when they designed this. But these tanks are, in my experience, almost never used as simply external tanks, but are always used inline in a booster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else feel like this? Most of the large parts (well, they were the largest before 23.5) are kind of plain white, except the orange tank.
