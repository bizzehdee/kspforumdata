try to discuss things in proper\u00A0sentences with punctuation, capital letters, and other such refinements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have noticed the following things:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E1. \u00A0Traction Control\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis should always be set to zero. \u00A0If you leave it at the default of 1.0, rovers can\u0027t climb hills more than about 10^. \u00A0OTOH, with it set to zero, you can climb hills like you could since the beginning of time. \u00A0I have yet to discover any downside to reducing this setting to zero and see no reason at all to increase it above default. \u00A0Perhaps it might be useful for a sportscar on a flat track but otherwise, it\u0027s bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2. \u00A0Suspension Lock\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis seems to help with, and occasionally cure, many ills, such as:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nTires popping when turning at low speed, such as orienting to drive off the side of the the runway as soon as the vehicle spawns.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTires popping from crossing minor terrain irregularities such as driving off the side of the runway.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOther tires popping from the whole rover twitching when you repair the 1st flat tire.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDocking base modules on slightly uneven ground with varying vehicle weights.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nOTOH, locking the suspension is more likely to blow tires when doing high-speed, reasonably high jumps. \u00A0It will also make negotiating very irregular ground much harder because fewer of your wheels will be on the ground providing push.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E3. \u00A0All-Wheel Drive\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn rough terrain, you need this. \u00A0On flat terrain, it depends on how fast you want to go and how much EC/sec you\u0027re willing to provide. \u00A0In 1.1, the EC/sec required for wheels increased by about 5x so limiting how many wheels suck\u00A0power might be important. \u00A0But \u00A0OTOH, the fewer the driving wheels, the lower the top speed. \u00A0But in any case, you pretty much need a large fuelcell array to move a rover of any useful size.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E4. \u00A0All-Wheel Steering\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou need this for maneuvering in tight spaces or docking base modules. \u00A0If you try turning at high speed, however, there\u0027s a good chance you\u0027ll flip. \u00A0Nothing\u0027s really changed there. \u00A0I personally prefer to have all-wheel steering and use torque for fine-tuning my course while driving at high speed, which seems to have zero chance of flipping the rover. \u00A0This requires assigning the rover keys to something other than the default WASD. \u00A0I use KP 8 and KP 4-6.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E5. \u00A0Wheels are Poison to Kerbals\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDo not, repeat DO NOT, let a Kerbal come in contact with a wheel. \u00A0The slightest touch makes the Kerbal go ragdoll. \u00A0If he falls where he\u0027s still touching a wheel, he\u0027ll stay ragdolled until he or the rover moves to separate them. \u00A0And if you have a couple of wheels close together, it\u0027s possible for a Kerbal to pachinko between them until he\u0027s eventually flung away at high speed. \u00A0This is often horizontally and no harm done, but it\u0027s possible for the Kerbal to go upwards over 100m and die when he hits the ground. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFortunately, Kerbals don\u0027t have to get anywhere close to wheels to fix flats, but be careful with hatch and ladder placement relative to wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E6. \u00A0Repairing 1 Wheel Flattens Another or Repaired Wheels Instantly Reflatten\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nRovers jump when you fix flats, which is no change (expect be sure to stand as far away as possible so it doesn\u0027t jump into your Kerbal). \u00A0Fortunately, you can repair wheels from several meters away, and you can now repair multiple wheels in very quick succession thanks to the draggable right-click menus. \u00A0Position the Kerbal so he\u0027s in repair range of all your flat tires, then bring up all their right-click menus. \u00A0Group these menus adjacent to each other and quickly hit all the \u0022Repair wheel\u0022 buttons as fast as you can. \u00A0Often, but not always, you can get several wheels repaired before physics wants to pop one of them, and thus repair wheels you sometimes can\u0027t

badly again. \u00A0Now in 1.1, the initial spasms are much reduced and the performance as rover wheels on level ground is flawless. \u00A0But they\u0027re rather less fond of being driven over bumpy
