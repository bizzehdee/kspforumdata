It\u0027s the SSI Shuttlecraft Type 1 Protoype 2.1. Has anyone else designed such craft before? Do you have a shuttlecraft-like sport spaceplane you\u0027ve developed that might look similar? If so, are you interested in helping out or submitting new ideas for this project? We\u0027d love your feedback, and any comments of those who might be able to lend a hand with testing, or providing support.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
