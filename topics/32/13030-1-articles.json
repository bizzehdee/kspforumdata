Having a bachelors in molecular biology i can nerd out pretty easily over the smallest things. My main hobby asside from biology and healthcare is astronomy. KSP filled every nitch of space nerdism i need especially with the great modding community out there im having a blast learning it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat i want to know for you out there that understand the math and physics of the KSP flight (and i know you are out there i read forums where math equations get brought out pretty rapidly), what are some good books/sites on the physics of spacecraft and setting up orbits ect. I think you guys know what i am talking about. I want to be able to calculate where i am going and whats going on other than just taking guesses all the time. This post may or may not make it but see what you guys give me. Thanks \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-21T20:30:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor traditional(ish) texbooks, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Astrodynamics-Dover-Aeronautical-Engineering/dp/0486600610/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1340310480\u0026amp;sr=8-1\u0026amp;keywords=fundamentals\u002Bof\u002Bastrodynamics\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFundamentals of Astrodynamics\u003C/a\u003E is pretty well recommended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are also some resources on orbital parameters \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.braeunig.us/space/orbmech.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fmTW6P91OVFj5Tuj0JzKcnfpcw79RqveQTAywrPIIrI/edit?pli=1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jolee1868","CreatedById":28633,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-21T21:26:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enice thank you exactly what i was wanting! ;D\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brians200","CreatedById":26572,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-21T22:31:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis also a common textbook\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Modern-Astrophysics-2nd-Edition/dp/0805304029\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Modern-Astrophysics-2nd-Edition/dp/0805304029\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELots of places call it BOB or the big orange book. isn\\\u0027t cheap though \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
