That fuel you \u0022use up\u0022 making orbit gets you going 2.2km/s (or so) and when you eject to your target planet, you get to use it.

All you had to do was throttle up and it would fly directly retrograde out of the Mun\u0027s SoI. No need to touch the steering controls.\n\n...except that it didn\u0027t have enough fuel to drop its periapsis into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere that way... not even anywhere close, in fact. But, if you first took the thing into a 10km Mun orbit and then performed a regular retrograde ejection burn, you easily got the periapsis all the way under Kerbin\u0027s surface.\n\nGoing into orbit really is cheaper. Always. Everytime. No exceptions.\n\nBonus: even New Horizons, the fastest manmade spacecraft ever that got shot towards Pluto in what\u0027s pretty much a straight line from Earth, went into low Earth orbit first and then burned for ejection.\n\n[Four days to Pluto flyby!](http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/pluto_charon_color_final.png) The hype is real! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-10T08:59:02Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2015 08:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheLoki","CreatedById":147552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T09:17:02Z","Content":"Bigger is better\n\nMore thrust gets you further\n\nFor higher DeltaV add more fueltanks and more engines\n\nMy ever first M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn lander had about 2 orange tanks, 6x2silver tanks, all equipped with mainsails in an asparagus staging (thanks to youtube).
