(Hence the crash when it tries to remove symmetric parts that aren\u0027t there to begin with)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nats","CreatedById":58316,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T20:35:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RawChicken\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RawChicken\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Being able to import saved planes on VAB and rockets on SPH. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Being able to load saved ships/planes while building another ship, this could allow building saving a rover beforehand and building a mothership where you dock a couple of those rovers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Not having the \u0022radial symmetry\u0022 option changed when you hover your mouse while dragging a part over a \u0022different radial symmetry\u0022 part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely these are needed .
