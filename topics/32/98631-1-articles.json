With that in mind, I\u0027d like to start a thread where we talk about the fun we have playing our games the way we enjoy them. I\u0027m a mostly-stock player myself, simply because I\u0027m not very patient with mods, but that certainly doesn\u0027t bar me from enjoying modded gameplay every now and then nor from \u0022comprehending\u0022 how others can play with or without mods whatsoever. I admire RSS players, and I also muchly appreciate that sometimes a person can want to just go somewhere and putter about space without any messing with various challenges or obstacles. Sightseeing is just fine, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this in mind, \u003Cstrong\u003Efeel free to share screenshots, stories, etc. what have you, and mod/packs or techniques you use if you use them; \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eas well as why you enjoy that playstyle if you would like to talk about that as well.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E I\u0027ll start off with some examples from my own library. I rarely play myself these days, but here\u0027s a vessel I made in FAR once, long ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/YnB9Y\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve always liked the sleek-and-also-squat look of Phil Bono\u0027s SSTO lifters with their plug-nozzle engines and their shell of drop-tanks, and the hills-and-valleys look of the blisters on the Soviet N1, so I wanted to make a lifter using those principles and aesthetics that could do some medium-heavy lifting in KSP. Used FAR and a number of other mods, including Dani-Sang\u0027s fairings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough you, the reader, are \u003Cem\u003Eby no means pressured to talk about why you enjoy certain gameplay styles\u003C/em\u003E, I\u0027ll also put my own thoughts in as an example. I enjoy FAR largely because I like puttering around space at times without having to worry so much about building a suitable launcher; I can light off and be bound for the stars on one stage without as much trouble. There is some engineering involved, to be sure, but it\u0027s a fine experience focusing on building stuff for operations in space, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not expecting miracles, but perhaps having \u003Cem\u003Eour reasons for playing the way we do\u003C/em\u003E, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Efor ourselves\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, out in the open, we can begin to defuse at least some of the vast powder keg that people debating about whether or not someone\u0027s gameplay style is or isn\u0027t \u0022good\u0022 because it\u0027s more or less \u0022casual\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: whoops, critical album failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 2: There we go!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EOh hi, anonymous mod.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003ESince I don\u0027t seem to have been clear enough, this isn\u0027t just a place for people to put up their screenshots; it\u0027s meant to be somewhere out in the open where people can safely talk about the gameplay styles they enjoy using. Just because I didn\u0027t want people to feel pressured into talking about it doesn\u0027t mean this thread ought to be moved to the proverbial graveyard, as it were. Obviously I can\u0027t change your decision, but I would very much implore you to reconsider, as I think this thread is very much relevant to KSP discussion.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EI\u0027d also like to note that the \u0022What did you do in KSP today?\u0022 and \u0022This Will Not End Well\u0022 threads seem to be doing just fine in KSP General Discussion.
