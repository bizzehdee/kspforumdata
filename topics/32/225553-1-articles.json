I stopped playing seriously when KSP2 was announced since I figured that would supersede everything, plus my computer at the time couldn\u0027t really support the mods I wanted to use. Anyway, I\u0027ve got that itch again but it\u0027s been 4/5 years since I\u0027ve played and it doesn\u0027t look like KSP2 is going to sweep it all away after all. So the question is, which version of the game should I play and which mods should I install that are compatible with it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the past I\u0027ve used Tweakscale, joints, Cryo engines, B9, all of the various future tech stuff, that kind of things. Are these mods still supported/compatible for 1.8.X game versions or is there a newer game version that makes 1.8.X irrelevant? Which of these versions is proving to be the most stable? I\u0027m aware that similar questions have been asked before so apologies for duplication but those threads haven\u0027t answered my question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlex\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ultimate Steve","CreatedById":161505,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-26T15:06:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi Alex, unless you are doing something incredibly specific that requires old mods, 1.12.5 (the latest version) should be what you use. There haven\u0027t been any updates in a year and a half and there hasn\u0027t been anything beyond bugfixes and minor tweaks in three years. Modding is centered around 1.12.5 and will be unless something really weird happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMods are a matter of taste, but I believe the ones you have listed are still compatible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jacob34343","CreatedById":234062,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-27T05:50:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose are still compatible.
