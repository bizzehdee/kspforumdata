I\u0027m sounding like I want a completely realistic sim with all the monotony that goes with it but I really don\u0027t. I want KSP just with using the solar system and correct physics etc with it. Not trying to imply I want a new game that is infinitely more complicated and obscene with checklist and missions that take real actual days to accomplish. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as far as cracking the books.....I have cracked many books on the subjects of astronomy, rocketry, and space related.

My issue with Orbited is simple: It\u0027s hugely outdated and lacks the kind of easily accessible modding that KSP has. Sure, KSP is unrealistic but that can actually be fixed somewhat easily if you know how to (or are willing to learn) how to mod orbits and planetary bodies. I\u0027m working passively, in my spare time, on a realistic mod that\u0027ll hopefully give the game a little more realism but the game will hit Unity 5 before I\u0027m done I think so I\u0027m leaving it as a little pet project.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
