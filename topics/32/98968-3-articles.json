Samples could include contract samples offered at KSC or surface samples collected by the player.

So anyone not comfortable with build times should just learn to multitask several ships at once?

The entire game is basically do something, time warp, do something time warp, etc.; adding one more thing to time warp to does not make much of a difference. And as for a narrow view of how the game should be played, all I am doing is suggesting that mechanics that are more realistic that would help to increase the challenge of the game be rolled into the harder difficulties. If someone does not want deadly reentry, life support, build times, etc., then they should play on easy or have the option to disable these individually in the custom difficulties. And I\u0027m not suggesting that every difficulty mod out there should be rolled into stock for the higher difficulties, but some basic ones should; I won\u0027t be disappointed if KSP does not have stock KCT, as long as they find other methods to make the game more enjoyable and challenging in the long run at higher difficulties. It\u0027s just really irritating when Squad immediately shoots down a good idea because it would be too challenging or not fun for new players, without considering adding it in as a difficulty option for veteran players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also find your statement about in-game tutorials to be contradictory to your previous statement. If these new players that do not take the time to read forum posts or watch videos on how to play, and do not have proper tutorials built into the game, how are they supposed to learn? Just getting into orbit without added difficulty options is difficult on its own for new players that may think that they can just go straight up to get into orbit. I\u0027m not saying that these tutorials have to be long and teach them every aspect of the game. There should be several tutorials available for specific tasks that show the player exactly what to do: how to build a rocket and launch it, how to get into orbit, how to rendezvous and dock, how to go to the Mun, how to go to Duna, etc. The new player picks which tutorial that they want and when they want it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy ultimate point is that the game needs to be able to stand on its own without reliance on mods. The masses that are going to be introduced to this game on release, for the most part, are not going to be interested in installing a ton of mods like many of us do after they get past that initial fun factor that you point out. I have spent probably 1000\u002B hours playing the game, but maybe only 5 of which pure stock, which I think is quite sad that I have had to rely on mods so much to continue enjoying the game.

For instance, they could hard-code something (like the weight limits on the pad, who the hell thought \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E was a good idea...) or introduce something into the system whereby circumvention introduced a ton of lag because two systems were running at once.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joonatan1998","CreatedById":97636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-07T20:50:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think time based game mechanics would make the game more fun, but right implementation is very important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment there are very few time based things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Contract time limits\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-transfer windows\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-time it takes to get anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime based things that could be added:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-constant costs (or maybe income based on reputation?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-construction times\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-life support\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-maybe some random events (rockomax parts are now 4% cheaper!!!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-contract generation (at the moment they generate almost instantly, so you can just pick the easy exploitable ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile adding only 1 of those would lead to \u0022just time warp over it\u0022 I think adding several would really improve the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELow difficulty setting should have some of the features disabled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConstruction time:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you press launch button, it would give you a choise between \u0022timewarp to launch\u0022 and \u0022tell me when it is ready\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you choose to timewarp, but some of your ships would run out of life support, it could give you a warning \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jool Ship 5 would run out of life support if during the warp, are you sure you want to warp?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELife support:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it really should only be a problem on interplanetary missions, pods should have enough of it for mun/mimus flights.
