Decided to play the first mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m a bit of a completionist when I play video games. So I took their various challenges to heart - land my first sounding rocket at the island airfield, fly through the 3 aerial waypoints with my 2nd rocket... Mind you, these took several attempts with \u0027revert to launchpad\u0027 in between, but no shame in that. So all said and done, 2 hours or so later I\u0027m beginning the 3rd segment of this first mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI launch and only then notice a staging error - launch clamps before main engine start, whoops!\u00A0 But suddenly, before I can revert to launch, a dialogue box pops up informing me that I\u0027ve failed the mission.\u00A0 And I have no recourse.. no ability to revert to launch or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or anything.\u00A0Even the somewhat hidden/obscure quickload feature didn\u0027t work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd like that, three hours of gameplay down the drain in an instant.\u00A0Needless to say this was extremely disheartening.
