Many gamers will routinely not only whine about a game they\u0027ve gotten hundreds of hours of fun out of, but downright demand some sort of compensation for the fact that the game is not a perfect match with the idealized version the gamer has in his or her head. Perfectly playable games with a small number of cosmetic bugs will be called out as \u0022utterly unplayable\u0022 and \u0022completely broken\u0022 by the same people who spend hour after hour playing the game, having fun most of the time. Any release less than 100% free from flaws will be labeled \u0022alpha\u0022. Lack of\u00A0betas will be cause of great vitrol, but when they do happen the same people will enter the betas and treat them as a \u0022play for free\u0022 experiment, filling the testing forums with post about their broken saves, demanding financial compensation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs someone who actually worked on a game where people regularly make Facebook comments on its page to the effect of\u00A0\u0022I\u0027ve been playing this game for hundreds of hours ever since launch, bought all the expansions,\u00A0and it is completely **** and should never have been released!\u0022\u00A0this post is resonant to me. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-20T00:37:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t noticed a whole lot of hate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure, some criticism at how Squad runs things, but in my two or three years, never hate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwi1960","CreatedById":81697,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-20T00:38:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222464784\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022114478\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221458434252\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002258517\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022spink00\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nJust now, spink00 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t noticed a whole lot of hate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure, some criticism at how Squad runs things, but in my two or three years, never hate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne man\u0027s hate is another\u0027s compliment. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-20T01:21:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222464787\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022114478\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221458434304\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002281697\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kiwi1960\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 minutes ago, kiwi1960 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne man\u0027s hate is another\u0027s compliment. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrue that. ^^^\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan someone (the community?)\u00A0define \u0022hate\u0022 in the context of KSP forum discussions?
