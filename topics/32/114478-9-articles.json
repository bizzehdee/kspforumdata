They try, they fail, they learn, they go again and they succeed. And this is reflected in this forum by a large degree... take a look at the Star Citizens or Elite Dangerous forums... Players rant against players... Players rant against the product... Players rant against the Devs, the website, the updates... rant rant rant... \n\nThis forum here has one, if not the nicest fanbase i have ever encountered - and it is like this for many years now. All are helping out, giving hints and tips, all playing in a somewhat large team, including the Devs, Players become Devs, help developing Mods and and...
