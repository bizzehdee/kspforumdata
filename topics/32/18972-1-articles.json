It\u0027s the first time something odd like this has happened to me in KSP and I\u0027m sure the first time somebody has encountered something that may not be \u0022of this Kerbin\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I had decided on doing a simple Munar flyby for the heck of it and watching *most* of it in real time. I began my voyage and took many pictures on the route. As I approached the far side of the Mun, I fell into sunset, watching the darkened plaster-of-paris surface skim by at several hundred meters per second. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot long after, my ship zinged around the far side of the Mun at an alarming clip and into sunrise. Climbing away quickly, more and more of the front side of the Mun became visible as the clock ticked away for several minutes. But finally, I moved the camera to a certain position relative to my ship and pitched up in attitude a little bit (having held retrograde throughout the Munar pass) when I noticed something. A shimmering. It was a small light -- seemingly completely white and several hundred kilometers -- maybe thousands -- into space. I carefully watched as it flickered on and off when it donned on me that it was probably just Minmus. NOPE. Minmus was actually on the other side of the Mun. So I began thinking... I had cleared my persistence file before this flight and realized that it could not have been a previous stage because I launched a tiny little command/service spacecraft with cheats just because I could. There was nothing to jettison on the entire flight. So it was clearly not something dropped from a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe light was now rising on the horizon, crossing from 5 to about 10 degrees above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI relayed this information to Kosmo-Not, who asked to see my persistence file. I also sent a screen shot of the UFO that I captured so he could use the stars as a reference of where to look in the \u0022sky\u0022. But puzzling as the entire event was, Kosmo-Not was completely unable to find the UFO on the file I sent him. Things now began to get even stranger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas I looking at a possible \u0022alien\u0022 spacecraft? Probably not, considering the game simply does not have that coded. I thought of the UFO encounter on Apollo 11, that turned out to simply be a SLA panel from the Transposition and Docking Sequence, but was still confused, for I HAD NO transposition and docking sequence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the events folded out in real time, I opened up Microsoft paint, circled the dot and zoomed in to find that it appeared as a single pixel of a light blue color. I simply could not get anymore information from this program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpening the map view, I was only about 20 minutes from Munar escape and Kerbin SOI, and I realized I had a Mid-Course Correction to prepare. When I closed the map view and looked back to the spot where the UFO had been, it was gone. It did not reappear for my voyage back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bigger question remains... Why did I write this story like it was a book? Well, anyway...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone ever had any odd encounters with the unknown in this game that are similar to this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a picture from those events of the UFO:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Vz7R3.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/Vz7R3.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Punk","CreatedById":45205,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-10T08:18:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo one has ever been to space, much less the Mun.
