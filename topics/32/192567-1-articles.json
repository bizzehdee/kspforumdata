First, I time warp a while for bon voyage to drive the craft there, but when I load up the Rover, it appears UNDERGROUND, and it exploded. So I decided to try again, (by set position the Rover in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E to the poles). But even weirder stuff happens. First, I set altitude to 10 and latitude 90 (directly on the north pole) but a giant spike appear with land hitboxes, the cheat should make my craft above the spike, but it didn\u0027t, instead I find land inside land. So another try, I set position directly on a waypoint from a commission (also at the polar region), but when I set altitude 5, it\u0027s UNDER GROUND AGAIN! Luckily I have enough time to set a higher altitude, and I completed the first way point of the commission, but when I want to drive the craft, it barely move despite the craft is extremely successful in other places. So I use bon voyage again, but when I make the destination the activated way point (again in the polar regions), it says there\u0027s no route to the way point despite being extremely close. So I set the destination some where a bit south of the waypoint, and enter tracking station to time warp, but, a message from world first milestone appears, said that I SPLASHED DOWN on DUNA OCEAN?! And then loaded my craft again under ground. If anyone experienced this same thing please share how you dealt it. And please help, I want to build a colony at the poles but this I assume will stop me from doing so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-22T14:20:34Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2020 02:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Sirius K\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-23T07:36:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAltitude is height?
