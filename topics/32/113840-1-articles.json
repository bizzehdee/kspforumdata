They were mounted under a mk1-2 pod with batteries and little rcs tanks attached. On the other side a large reaction wheel, then a fairing base. The cubic peices and attached bits were inside the interstage fairing. They exploded due to heat, but where from, had a single mainsail under an orange and a half and two radial SRB\u0027s. Saw in a thread in the Spacecraft Exchange someone else complain about stuff attached to a large reaction wheel explode on ascent. Cannot do anymore testing right now just a heads up."},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T00:26:52Z","Content":"Yes, I have this problem with my Orion, a cubic strut I clipped inside the fairing explodes when I launch."},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T01:59:01Z","Content":"Someone reported on one of my mod threads that the mod\u0027s reaction wheels were appearing to spontaneously overheat.

It normally only shows up when the game starts to take shortcuts with the physics calculations, such as physics warp, or very large vessels, or when approaching space station etc\n\nAlso affects Octagonal Struts.
