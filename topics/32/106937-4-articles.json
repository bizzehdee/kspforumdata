It\u0027s not just the speeds (orbital speeds are higher for higher altitudes, so a 2X kerbin will have higher orbital speeds), though that clearly matters. It is also the time in the atmosphere for those effects to manifest themselves. You\u0027d still need \u0022gameplay\u0022 tweaks to make reentry matter in a 2X kerbin, but the magnitude of the tweaks would be lower, and it might be possible to achieve better balance. Currently, reentry needs to be set such that at lower velocities, it is meaningful with far shorter times of interaction. This will clearly have a negative impact on high speed flight within the atmosphere for planes.\n\nIt;s another example of where arbitrarily changing things (counter to realism) opens cans of worms. In a 1:1 scale, then we know what works, physics works. Kerbin would also work if it was properly scaled via reality (smaller Kerbin, but with lower gravity and less atmosphere). There might be some middle ground where Kerbin is slightly larger, and slightly less massive, I don\u0027t know.\n\nEDIT: I\u0027m in agreement with jouni\u0027s post above, BTW."},{"CreatedByName":"Gaugeforever","CreatedById":110684,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T17:33:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You are looking for a logical reason. There is no logical reason except that people don\u0027t want to learn the new system. This is a symptom of Squad taking so long to fix aerodynamics. Not that I\u0027m blaming Squad for anything mind you, just that if they done this when there were less players it would have blown over rather quickly.\n\nI have 200 hours in ferram. The people \u0022complaining\u0022 have experience with more realistic aero models. No one expects a copy of ferram, but rockets that resemble real life rockets shouldn\u0027t flip end over end for no apparent reason. Arguably second stage is worse than first stage for flipping.\n\nCompletely unrealistic, godlike, reaction wheels, gimbal, and fins are mandatory now. Good luck getting a probe into orbit without these things. I feel sorry for the RO guys until Ferram gets fixed. Without godmode reaction wheels... I don\u0027t know. In this model the space shuttle would never have gotten to orbit. Just saying. That large fuel tank would cause them to flip no matter what they did, no matter how perfect it was. I also feel bad for new players, because this is NOT ksp. KSP is supposed to be realism until the fun stops. With the new aero model they abandoned fun altogether and went for only half realism.\n\nMyself, I\u0027m waiting for ferram so all my rockets work again. In the end, it\u0027s about what makes sense to me. The new aero model does not make sense to me, Ferram did. I had some learning to do with ferram, but at least ferram was intuitive. I can make rockets that \u0022look right\u0022 and they have a reasonable chance of success at doing something other than flipping."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T17:46:13Z","Content":"I use FAR all the time except for new releases (partially waiting for an update, partially to test and give feedback here that might help squad out), and I don\u0027t have any flipping problems at all."},{"CreatedByName":"falconek","CreatedById":28606,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T17:51:39Z","Content":"Generally I like this update.

And aerodynamic flights are a minor part of my gameplay anyway... I spend most of my time in space.\n\nBTW guys, your \u0022realistic\u0022 rockets are flipping, because in KSP generally payloads are light, and engines and fuel are heavy. So the rockets are bottom heavy. You need to think about your rockets, like they were model rockets (engine on bottom, empty paper tube and parachute on top). Model rockets are bottom heavy, that\u0027s why they need fins, and KSP perfectly shows it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T17:54:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 05:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by falconek**"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T17:53:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t have any flipping problems at all.\n\nI know what you mean, but the implied self-censoring of this sentence made me smile."},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T18:02:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I have 200 hours in ferram.
