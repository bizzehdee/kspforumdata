Something different and in space I don\u0027t have to think about aerodynamic design. I always try to attach some control point on the top of the craft. Either another core or a docking port (where you can attach a space tug). For my last rover, which also uses this engine config, I used a mechjeb module. You just have to orient it right and you can have any angle of orientation. But you\u0027re right, you should be prepared to change the part from where the craft is controlled or you will not go to space...\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nOh, one thing: Please don\u0027t use font size and font color excessively.
