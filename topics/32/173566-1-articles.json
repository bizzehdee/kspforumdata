So far I\u0027ve used the Wolfhound for both my 2nd, and 3rd stage engines, with no issues, but would the Skiff work better? I\u0027m bad at numbers so I was hoping someone on here could tell me when to use the skiff, as opposed to using the wolfhound for all my vac. space flight.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MR L A","CreatedById":150940,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-06T20:17:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell I have a craft that is capable of taking 3 Kerbals to the space station at 200KM (and a bit beyond) that uses a Skiff as a first stage engine... its pretty efficient and fun tbh, does require two srbs though... but still fun.
