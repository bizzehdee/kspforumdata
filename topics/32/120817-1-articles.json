I quick saved a straight shot to the stranded ship and the klaw will not connect even with a perfect alignment. It just bounces right off going 1 ms. Can the klaw grab a nose cone? I am beyond frustrated haha.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T19:01:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Novagloe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI play alot with the Klaw, looks like not all parts can be grabbed, fueltanks are somewhat granted grabable. Smaller parts refuse to connect. Releasing the Klaw in vicinity of lots of small parts can reject the Klaw-wearing vessel if it has little mass, aka RCS tug... Somewhat to try out before launching.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T23:36:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd don\u0027t mess with the Klaw- it will destroy evreything\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xyphos","CreatedById":139010,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-14T00:58:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyeah, the klaw dont grab small parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe shielded docking port has no stack node either, so you cant start with it open or docked.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
