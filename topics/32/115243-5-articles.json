Most of the time you can\u0027t or the first node you can set is hours or days from your current position. If the game doesn\u0027t add a \u0027clickable\u0027 point to that segment of the trajectory curve you can\u0027t set a node there. The game usually forgets to add clickable points to highly excentric or hyperbolic trajectory curves. Especially in the vicinity of \u0022poles\u0022 of the hyperbolic trajectory. Known since I don\u0027t know when\n\nTry to add a maneuver node on a trajectory curve when other \u0027clickable\u0027 objects like vessels, asteroids, node markers or other trajectory curves are in the vicinity. You can\u0027t because the UI gives privilege to the other clickable nodes over your trajectory. especially annoying when you are on an inerplanetary trajectory and want to make adjustments and \u0027unknown\u0027 markers are displayed on the map.\n\nTry to add a maneuver node to a trajectory curve when the patched conic approximation keeps changing its mind due to rounding errors and/or the initial conditions making it hard to settle on a solution. The flickering will make it impossible for you to click on it.\n\nTry to design an encounter over interplanetary distances when your ship is still in orbit around Kerbin and you want to optimize your aproach to for example Duna or Jool. Now try it with \u0027focus view\u0027 on Duna or Jool. Now try it with \u0027focus view\u0027 on Duna or Jool and other vessels in Orbit around Kerbin, Minmus or Mun.\n\nI could go on and on."},{"CreatedByName":"jkool702","CreatedById":146465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T14:44:42Z","Content":"Mechjeb, though I fervently believe in doing everything without mechjeb initially until its second nature.

No one cares how you play and enjoy the game (outside of Challenges, where you should adhere to the challenge rules). There are players that I greatly respect that use MechJeb; there are others that would never use it. The game is different things to different people, it is up to the individual whether MJ fits into their playstyle.\n\nPersonally, I\u0027ve had an on again/off again relationship with MechJeb. When I started it wasn\u0027t even a thing (only part mods were possible), so I learned how to do many things in KSP through trial and error plus research. When I first tried MechJeb I found it made the game too easy for me as I was letting it do everything, eventually I stopped using many of its autopilot functions because I enjoy performing certain maneuvers and the chance of failure that manual piloting brings. As MJ\u0027s functionality grew, I made sure to watch how it performed maneuvers that I had already found ways to perform manually, seeing if it knew anything I didn\u0027t (sometimes it did and I learned better techniques, sometimes it didn\u0027t). I then moved on to having MJ handle repetitive stuff for me; there wasn\u0027t a lot of enjoyment to be had from piloting a tanker rocket to orbit for the 10th time. My current playstyle is less about running a huge space program and more about single missions and testing, so I haven\u0027t been using MechJeb lately."},{"CreatedByName":"TimePeriod","CreatedById":74336,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T15:23:11Z","Content":"If you choose to play without it, its fine.\n\nIf you choose to play with it, its fine too.\n\n*Under one condition*\n\nYou have to learn how to play without it first.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause NOBODY should be allowed to drive a car without a license."},{"CreatedByName":"JetJaguar","CreatedById":146965,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T15:25:17Z","Content":"KER for me, I\u0027ve never used MechJeb. I don\u0027t look down on anyone who does use it and in fact, an argument could be made that MechJeb is *more* realistic than flying on your own because almost everything in a real space flight is automated. Rockets use automated guidance systems to follow the optimal planned trajectory right from launch. Dockings with the ISS are typically done on autopilot. Space probes are too far away to directly control remotely, the delay is too long - the round trip for a signal to the New Horizons probe, for example, is 9 hours.\n\nSo, the most realistic way to play would be to design a mission profile and program it into a guidance system, then step back while it does the rest."},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T15:46:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Because NOBODY should be allowed to drive a car without a license.\n\nIf you ask Google, it\u0027s soon going to be \u0022Nobody should be allowed to drive a car.\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T15:47:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If you choose to play without it, its fine.\n\u003E If you choose to play with it, its fine too.\n\u003E \n\u003E *Under one condition*\n\u003E \n\u003E You have to learn how to play without it first.\n\u003E \n\u003E Why?\n\u003E \n\u003E Because NOBODY should be allowed to drive a car without a license.\n\nHardly the same thing, there\u0027s no public safety risk for a person playing KSP without knowing how to pilot.\n\nIf someone wants to play KSP purely as a spacecraft designer and mission controller and doesn\u0027t want to pilot, why shouldn\u0027t they?"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T15:54:41Z","Content":"Whoa, this thread is still here.
