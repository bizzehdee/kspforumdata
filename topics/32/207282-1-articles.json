And right before g-LOC, a-LOC strong enough to get, say, halfway up the meter, causes controls to become weak and sluggish to respond. potentially even cutting control authority by like 80% or something and getting worse the longer you are there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReviewing videos of real aircraft entering g-LOC, most of the time they simply lose 100% of their control authority and enter steep dives. The unconscious pilot does not continue to pull back on the stick or enter some wild maneuver with a flick of their arm. This seems to happen for both boosted and manual control authority. What they definitely don\u0027t do is just maintain whatever barrel roll or hard turn they were doing and pull a 10 G loop at high speed until they slow down / crash / run out of fuel / climb too high to turn / rip their wings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime
