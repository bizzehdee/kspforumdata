First I build truly enormous 150\u002B tons ship with maybe somewhat enough dv to ascend from the EVE however is was so unstable so I lost one of the booster stage engines during orbital maneuvers! That was the moment when I understood that even if I would not saved after the failure; going to Eve surface with this ship is unreasonable. So I read this topic and saw how people do very light vessels and launch them from the high elevations. I build much better and lighter design with around ~9000 dv that was probably capable to ascend from 7000-8000 meter height. But I overestimated the precision capabilities of MechJeb and was not able to land at the proper altitude. Also the deorbit stage docking port got jammed by the bug and I had to use some dv for deorbiting. I probably could still redo this design and add wheels to drive to higher mountains as Scott Manly, did but I was not sure that I will be able to operate this thing on the slopes in high gravity of Eve. So I did my final design with ~12000 dv that was enough to ascend from sea level of Eve and I could choose any flat area on the planet to land. And it worked; I landed at around 3000 meter elevation so after reaching the orbit I even had some fuel for orbital adjustment and rendezvous.

At this moment the whole ship is only powered by tiny battery on the final stage and you have only few hours before it runs out. Launch immediately, when liftoff is achived press 0 to decouple landing gear. Untill 30 km keep the ship straight up, during first few stages it is very stiff to control. I started gravity turn at 30 km heading for 102 km orbit. When you reach and stabilize your orbit you may or may not have fuel left. If not than bring your return ship to pick up the crew, but if you have some, do plane adjustment and rendezvous maneuvers as soon as possible, since the limiting factor now is the battery life, as soon it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s runs out the ship will went dark and any remaining fuel become useless. You can try to change the battery to small solar panel but this requitre pereodical sun orientation and making launch possible only during the daytime (putting small battery and small solar panel together on the last stage drasticly reduce dv) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to improve this design or look at it in VAB for inspiration of your own ships, or just let me know what do you think.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-01T03:04:21Z\u0022 title=\u002211/01/2013 03:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Ghost13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T13:19:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERIP Kendred kerman, first Kerbal who landed on Eve, He and Seeny went to an relaxing trip to Gilly, he is MIA after an meeting the Hel Kraken doing the second eva to get more samples.
