While some posts (from both sides) have not been as civil as they should have been, that doesn\u0027t mean one can outright dismiss the arguments they present.\n\nSquad made some major mistakes with this release (and the events leading up to it). Much of the community is understandably upset, and with how passionate many of us are about this game there will inevitably be some posts with words that might have better been left unsaid (not to mention what I pointed out in my earlier [post](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117712-About-recent-community-criticism-in-the-direction-of-the-QA-exp-testers?p=1907673\u0026viewfull=1#post1907673)).

Much of the community desperately wanted a final beta release to test features before a 1.0 release. Squad reminded us over and over again that the new features did not need to be tested by the community before the 1.0 release because of the expertise in the QA and Experimental teams. \u0022Trust us\u0022.\n\u003E \n\u003E So now you can see why the community was lead to have very high expectations of QA and Experimental\u0027s. But again, either way it\u0027s going to work out, and we all need to show our appreciation to everyone involved, because KSP is awesome!!\n\nBut the QA and Experimental team IS good. They caught so many bugs before release and are extremely quick at swatting the bugs even now. It\u0027s not like the team has released the game and left us stranded in orbit. They released a great finished product and have every intention of polishing it up even more and adding new content to boot.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that some of the reasons things are breaking at the moment could be contributed to PEBKAC. I mean, I don\u0027t know about you guys, but I don\u0027t have a degree in rocket science... I\u0027m just an armchair astronaut excited that I get to live the space race, considering that I missed it the first time around... you know... not being born yet or something silly like that. I\u0027m just not qualified to tell Squad how the physics should be working in their game. If I can get a rocket to the Mun and back in my new career, then it must be working fine!\n\nPS. The quote from above is only included to show the love/hate that most people are feeling right now when ranting. Show Squad and the QA/Experimental Team more love... they really deserve it because this is one of the most exciting game launches that I can remember. Mainly because I get to do my own launches now, and who isn\u0027t excited about going to space and/or blowing things up?!\n\n*Delta***B**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bekiekutmoar","CreatedById":23500,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T17:25:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...\n\u003E \n\u003E To be honest it\u0027s disgusting.\n\u003E \n\u003E ...\n\nIt\u0027s not disgusting, it\u0027s simple logic.

I think the point that that quote is trying to make is that Squad blew off community concerns that they were majorly rushing the release and not taking advantage of the early access community, and basically put almost godlike expectations on the testing teams. I don\u0027t think any testing team (not matter how experienced) could have lived up to those expectations given the circumstances.\n\nI see you\u0027re new to the forums (welcome!) and might not be aware of how this game has developed, but suffice to say compared to previous versions it still feels like it\u0027s in early access rather than the actual release Squad hyped it up to be, which is another major source of frustration. The game is still lacking polish in a lot of area and some of the systems (career mode) need some additional work IMHO. Still, despite everything, yes this game is awesome (that first Mun mission is always a major milestone).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T18:04:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 06:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius**"},{"CreatedByName":"DeltaB","CreatedById":139551,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T18:29:35Z","Content":"@Lord Aurelius\n\nThanks for the welcome. I\u0027m normally not one to post -- I\u0027m more of a lurker, but the KSP community has been very welcoming which is awesome.\n\nI probably shouldn\u0027t have used that quote as it\u0027s not fair put words in another person\u0027s mouth or take them out of context. I found out about KSP around a month ago, and I bought the early access because, well, SCIENCE! Playing in .90 weeks before the launch, the bugs that existed could be game breaking, but I\u0027ve played so many games that are WELL out of launch that have worse bugs than even .90 did. In 1.0 I sent a rocket to an encounter with the Mun and Minimus in a single flight and was able to aerobreak and land back on Kerbin without taking much heat damage at all (no parachutes were needed until after the re-entry too). Nothing to brag about, just listing my experiences thus far.\n\nWhile we can argue about whether or not they should have made a .99 version or \u0022Beta than Beta\u0022 or whatever we would like to call it, they made the tough decision to release KSP. I say tough because no matter how much it\u0027s polished, there will still be bugs, there will always be bugs, nothing is perfect. Squad gave it their best, and their \u0022buggy\u0022 product still has me feeling like a little kid on Christmas Day.\n\n*Delta***B**"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T19:26:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...their \u0022buggy\u0022 product still has me feeling like a little kid on Christmas Day.*Delta***B**\n\nAnd that is exactly why so many of us love this game. I still remember when I played the 0.18 demo for the first time and got my rocket on an escape trajectory out of the solar system (which was just Kerbin and the Mun in the demo). I bought it on Steam very soon after that and have greatly enjoyed my purchase (Steam says 289 hours, no idea how many hours I\u0027ve actually put into it, most of the time I launch it using a link directly to the exe).\n\nIf you haven\u0027t already, take a look at the addon releases subforum, many of those mods open up entirely new options and make this feel like a completely different game.\n\nThat\u0027s likely part of why I\u0027ve been so disappointed by 1.0, I had an epic collection of mods that were rebalanced to work nicely together (the SETI link in my signature) and going back to stock (since 1.0 broke most of those mods and many still haven\u0027t been updated yet) feels like a big step backwards (despite all the improvements in 1.0). Almost all of the new features of 1.0 had been addressed by mods already so I\u0027m not quite as impressed by the new feature set as someone who exclusively plays stock.\n\nAnyways, enough of my rambling. I hope Squad can glean some good ideas from all these threads once they get back from partying so they can further improve KSP in future updates.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T19:29:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 07:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wooks","CreatedById":101499,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T21:04:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Not all bugs get fixed.

From what I found, I will say conceptually, the complaining is justified, however the magnitude with which some people chose to express it knocks me back down to my usual \u0022zero faith in humanity\u0022 stance.\n\nI wasn\u0027t here for the immediate 1.0 release but I did play 1.0.0 and am actively playing 1.0.2, so I will speak a bit more objectively.\n\nThis is a 1.0 release. That label is big and powerful. It says \u0022hey, this is a finished product.\u0022 That significantly lowers the tolerance for bugs. When there are bugs there is then backlash and that targets anyone involved in the process. Usually this is the devs but in this case people have deemed it appropriate to target the exp testers. That\u0027s an unfair assessment as, while they were the first line of defense against bugs, they are not the only step of the process and there is no hard evidence to state that it was their oversight alone that was responsible.\n\nLet\u0027s take the aircraft overheating issue. 1.0.0, your aircraft started to see pink effects and you were in a lotta trouble. You\u0027d blow off your cockpit REAL easy. This is a bad example because this WAS found by experimentals and put on the list, however Squad could not fix it in time for 1.0.0 because it risked breaking the entire reentry heating code. That one is on Squad (and I thank them for getting a handle on it within a few days; excellent response time guys). Any blame for that can\u0027t go on exp testers since they did technically find and report it. The difficulty is that without visiting the bug tracker (I have over 1000 hours logged and a 4 digit post count here and don\u0027t check it hardly ever), there\u0027s no way of knowing that. Blame cannot be fairly assessed because there\u0027s no way to know who actually is responsible.\n\nLastly its highly inappropriate to criticize people about bugs that were fixed within a week of launch. For the size of that changelog, that\u0027s impressive. This game isn\u0027t a bog standard first person shooter, it\u0027s new and unique and there\u0027s nothing else really like it out there. There\u0027s no precedents Squad can turn to for examples of what they want to do. These guys are incredible for doing what they did and while everyone here has probably criticized them at least once, I know I do only because I care.\n\nLong story short, a vocal minority does not state the community opinion. I\u0027m obviously gonna be annoyed by bugs, but with two hotfixes right after launch, Squad handled it as well as anyone could.\n\nTL;DR: I think its unfair of people to jump to conclusions without doing a bit of digging first, I think they overreacted when delivering criticism, and I think we need not forget that Squad was on top of it as much as they could be and for that, the entire team including exp guys, should be commended."},{"CreatedByName":"Gerandar","CreatedById":136705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T22:04:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Sorta like growing into your *\u0022hey we are 1.0 now\u0022* big-boy pants.\n\nThe beta should have been the growing into the 1.0 big-boy pants. 1.0 should have been far more polished all new features should have been added in alpha/beta respectfully."},{"CreatedByName":"Moon Goddess","CreatedById":57446,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T23:52:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Let\u0027s take the aircraft overheating issue. 1.0.0, your aircraft started to see pink effects and you were in a lotta trouble.
