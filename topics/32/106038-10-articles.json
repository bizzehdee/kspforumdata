Much of the community desperately wanted a final beta release to test features before a 1.0 release.

They caught so many bugs before release and are extremely quick at swatting the bugs even now. It\u0027s not like the team has released the game and left us stranded in orbit. They released a great finished product and have every intention of polishing it up even more and adding new content to boot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, keep in mind that some of the reasons things are breaking at the moment could be contributed to PEBKAC. I mean, I don\u0027t know about you guys, but I don\u0027t have a degree in rocket science... I\u0027m just an armchair astronaut excited that I get to live the space race, considering that I missed it the first time around... you know... not being born yet or something silly like that.

The quote from above is only included to show the love/hate that most people are feeling right now when ranting.

I think the point that that quote is trying to make is that Squad blew off community concerns that they were majorly rushing the release and not taking advantage of the early access community, and basically put almost godlike expectations on the testing teams.

The game is still lacking polish in a lot of area and some of the systems (career mode) need some additional work IMHO.

I found out about KSP around a month ago, and I bought the early access because, well, SCIENCE! Playing in .90 weeks before the launch, the bugs that existed could be game breaking, but I\u0027ve played so many games that are WELL out of launch that have worse bugs than even .90 did. In 1.0 I sent a rocket to an encounter with the Mun and Minimus in a single flight and was able to aerobreak and land back on Kerbin without taking much heat damage at all (no parachutes were needed until after the re-entry too). Nothing to brag about, just listing my experiences thus far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile we can argue about whether or not they should have made a .99 version or \u0022Beta than Beta\u0022 or whatever we would like to call it, they made the tough decision to release KSP.

I still remember when I played the 0.18 demo for the first time and got my rocket on an escape trajectory out of the solar system (which was just Kerbin and the Mun in the demo). I bought it on Steam very soon after that and have greatly enjoyed my purchase (Steam says 289 hours, no idea how many hours I\u0027ve actually put into it, most of the time I launch it using a link directly to the exe).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you haven\u0027t already, take a look at the addon releases subforum, many of those mods open up entirely new options and make this feel like a completely different game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s likely part of why I\u0027ve been so disappointed by 1.0, I had an epic collection of mods that were rebalanced to work nicely together (the SETI link in my signature) and going back to stock (since 1.0 broke most of those mods and many still haven\u0027t been updated yet) feels like a big step backwards (despite all the improvements in 1.0). Almost all of the new features of 1.0 had been addressed by mods already so I\u0027m not quite as impressed by the new feature set as someone who exclusively plays stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, enough of my rambling.
