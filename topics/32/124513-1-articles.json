Tylosian gravity of 0.8 g\u0027s. Kerbin, of course, has a\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egravity of 1 g. While Laythe also has 0.8 g\u0027s and Duna has just 0.3 g\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, as noted above, Laythe and Tylo both have the same gravity, so why go to Tylo instead of lush, comfortable Laythe? Good question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou see, the problem with Laythe is how little land there actually is, leaving little space for large-scale Laythean kolonization, so\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elarge farms, any huge resource-harvesting facilities or big cities, so maybe we\u0027re better off having Laythe as a place to collect\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewater and oxygen to supplement our Tylosian surface kolonies? Exactly what I think, unless you can make boat cities, but that could end\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebadly, because if something small like a match or a knife was dropped, that could burn a hole or pierce a hole in the balloon that is the\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emost likely method of buoyancy and sink the whole kolony, killing most of not all of it\u0027s inhabitants, so floating Laythe cities are unsafe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContrary to Laythe, Tylo is a huge world with no oceans, allowing for huge structures and cities, massive resource harvesting facilities and\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Every importantly, large mines, as the lack of land on Laythe means that mining would quickly drain those scarce archipelago\u0027s of their \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emoney, or in other words, minerals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we bring Duna back into the competition, Duna has one thing that not Laythe nor Tylo exhibit; solar power. Yes, Duna is a lot closer to \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbol than Tylo and Laythe, which or course, orbit Jool, a cold gas giant and one of the furthest planets in the Kerbol system, out around\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool solar power is miniscule, so it would be required to use fuel cells to transform those fuels made from the ore extracted into \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eelectricity to power the life support systems, or a more high risk high reward method; a nuclear reactor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver on Duna we don\u0027t have to worry about our fuel cells failing, our mines having problems (e.g. landslides) or our nuclear power plants \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecausing a nuclear fallout, not at all, we an rely rather well on good ol\u0027 solar power, a simple, reliable and effective way of power\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egeneration, so we don\u0027t have to worry about our massive metropolis with millions of inhabitants turning into an atomic wasteland and killing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eeveryone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn conclusion, the best and most efficient celestial body to Kolonize would probably be Tylo, supplemented by a small oxygen and water\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eharvesting operation on Laythe. Duna might be another option for closer promiximity to Kerbin and solar power but generally undesirable\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebecause of harsh conditions, dust storms, low gravity (requiring huge, expensive and hard to get centrifuges) but a cheaper and safer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoption. But all in all, I think the Tylo \u002B Laythe resource harvesting duo is the most effective, and out there, you can set up a military\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebase on the moon known as [REDACTED] to make sure the Kraken stays asleep!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-05T19:47:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Einteresting thoughts,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eeven for small minig colony (for starters) tylo might be interesting \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. if we implement mechanics of muscles/bones degradation from low-g then tylo wins.

It is probably an icy object, a bigger, dusty version of Vall (explaining the relatively low density and the fact that it formed out near Jool, where there probably isn\u0027t much rock for moon formation), and is close enough to Jool that it probably has a global subsurface ocean like Vall. This gives you the opportunity to build a large surface base, with the opportunity to study a potential habitat without leaving the ground, but without a significant risk of damaging that environment. Also, it gives you the opportunity to have operations going on on Vall without irradiating yourself, and to have stuff going on on Laythe too, without any large risk of contaminating the environment there. It has high gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some things about Tylo, however, that aren\u0027t preferable to Laythe or Duna. Tylo doesn\u0027t have a magnetic field, this is evidenced by the fact that it has practically no atmosphere despite being a tiny bit larger than Kerbin and cold. Laythe has a magnetic field, this is because it rotates faster, fast enough for a dynamo in the mantle. This is why Laythe still has its atmosphere. The radiation environment on Tylo is probably comparable to that on Ike. Duna has a lower rad level because it has an atmosphere. I still would choose Tylo because Laythe and Duna are environments which should be protected from anything not sterilized very thoroughly. Laythe and Duna can have life on them, actually many high-altitude or polar plants could survive in both those environments. Yet they seem dead, which means we should keep them dead so we can learn all about them before anything destructive happens. If life should be found on Laythe or Duna, the life-bearing areas would be evacuated and preserved to the best of our ability. You don\u0027t have to worry about that on Tylo or Vall. Tylo is better than Vall because the former has less radiation and more gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingPete","CreatedById":127384,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-05T22:48:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGiven the presence of oxygen and liquid water on Laythe, I think it should be placed under quarantine and studied from nearby Vall or Tylo for potential life.

Due to high gravity of Tylo I could sustain 50-60m/s average speed with 2 or 3x time warp. So 60m/s x 3 x 3 = around 540km/h. This means that I could traverse 1 degree of latitude at almost the same pace as on Minimus although Tylo is 10x bigger. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course in minimus case long-range driving have little sense beacuse of the combination of very low gravity and small moon\u0027s diameter (not much dV needed to move cargo over the surface).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T09:57:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy short answer:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna: Medium Gravity, rather close, easy to set up a base, thin atmosphere without Oxygen (hard to breathe), ice on the poles\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETylo: High/Normal Gravity, far away, even less atmosphere, no signs of water/ice on the surface\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELayhe: High/Normal Gravity, far away and deep down Jool Gravity-well, breathable atmosphere, lots of water, very interest to set up a base/underwater Habitats (Water above would also work as a great shielding for Jool\u0027s Radiation).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T14:47:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELaythe\u0027s atmosphere is thick enough to shield from radiation...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETylo\u0027s surface on the other hand is very very lethal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBased on the game data, laythe\u0027s atmosphere is mostly nitrogen, some oxygen... its pretty much the only place aside from Kerbin that a Kerbal can take off its helmet, take some breaths, and not die (based on in game EVA reports)... even if its not exactly hospitable (I\u0027m guessing too cold and too much CO2... maybe there\u0027s some ammonia vapor in it as well... maybe some sulfur as it seems to have numerous island rings that look like volcanic caldera.... who knows why its supposedly very unpleasant for a Kerbal to try breathing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lowest elevations on Duna should have a pressure and temperature that are enough for a kerbal to remove their helmet without dying as well... but no O2... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eat least you have time to do something if you ave a hull breach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing you can do with tylo is build underground... and if you are going to do that.. you might as well build underwater on laythe as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus the volcanism of laythe should help concentrate ores and recycle various minerals and such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe and duna deserve their place as the most desireable places to build a colony.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nsgallup","CreatedById":136892,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T17:35:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wonder how the radiation is on Tylo.. does it have it\u0027s own magnetic field?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T17:51:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nsgallup\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nsgallup\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI wonder how the radiation is on Tylo.. does it have it\u0027s own magnetic field?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot easy to tell, in real solar system some planets have cores that induce magnetic field, some don\u0027t have them.

Tectonic activity (large enough and has volcanoes/ islands which hold this eveident) and an atmosphere meaning that Joolean radiation would be blocked as well as stellar radiation. For land area you could easily use heavily expandable foam and thin metal sheets for a base structure on water that way land can be used sparingly. For resources, Tylo lends itself to mass drivers. Perhaps putting large amounts of them tuned to launch payloads with heavy ablative shielding on direct paths to Laythe for collection; this means that no landers are needed (on surface materials make all the things) and so it can be highly efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"More Boosters","CreatedById":147303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-08T11:37:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDuna doesn\u0027t have an ominous, giant green planet over its sky though.
