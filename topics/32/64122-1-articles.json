I only just had enough space to launch between the launch supports and as I launched I heard the familiar \u0060something has been hit and come off your ship\u0060 noise. I awaited the upcoming destruction but nothing happened. I got curious so I looked to see what had come off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was one of the solid rocket boosters.
