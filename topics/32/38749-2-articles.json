I had to tick three boxes in the end and went with resources first, mostly because it\u0027s a necessary feature to truly build a fully functional space program. Second was weather effects on planets, it\u0027s something that for me would really add to the immersion which is a big factor in gaming for me. Finally interactive IVA, generally for the same purpose, though it would be particularly interesting if interactive IVA\u0027s also had a purpose. Maybe doing some Science in there somehow or something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI almost wanted to tick extra celestial bodies too since I will never turn down more to explore. However I haven\u0027t really managed to get beyond Duna yet so it\u0027s not something that bothers me either. Some food for though. If we see more Planetary bodies surface in the future it would be good to see some more variation in the moons composition, kind of like Saturn\u0027s moon Titan. If any extra large planetary bodies are introduced in the future to see a moon with some form of atmosphere would fit in pretty well.
