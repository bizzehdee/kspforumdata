How did you come to the idea to make something like this?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea was simple. When i read some of the threads before the .21 release i realised that a lot of people lack imagination of where to put updates into the big picture. Sometimes i had the impression that people think that if you go from .2x to .2y you can have full multiplayer, a resource system and maybe 490 new parts which are of course all balanced. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i decided to go through all sources that are known to me (Wiki and Changelogs) to see what changed in which version and create a graph that shows where each of the updates takes its place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy aim is to keep this graph updated and to change it according to new developments. For example i see a branch \u0022career\u0022 coming up soon that will combine Crew Managment, R\u0026amp;D and Resources.. but it would NOW be too early to put it that way. So in the end it will move from the current categories more in the direction of having big features (career, flight, resources..) and their branches.. but this will develop - as will the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"luchelibre","CreatedById":61140,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T19:03:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you attempting to combat ignorance and entitlement with facts and reason?!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck, buddy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn topic: I came in sometime around .16 or .17 and I\u0027m amazed at seeing what players had to work with in previous versions.

Please not that not all steps are strictly chronological! Something might have been implemented in 0.11 that was then part of a later change and revised in .19 again.. that would make a chronological order, in contrast to a topic focused order, more complex and problematic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"7499275","CreatedById":70640,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T21:00:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, great graph you have I was actually thinking of looking for one of these later on just to see what earlier players used.
