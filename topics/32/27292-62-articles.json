First I undocked my three-seat nuke-powered exploration craft/tug that I had used to move the station into its proper orbit (long story; tldr version: retrograde orbits are BAD when everything else you\u0027re flying are in prograde orbits). After undocking James and Seeson did a small separation burn with the RCS and prepared to depart for Minmus. I then switched focus back to the station and prepped to decouple my kethane driller rig for landing back on a new deposit below. I topped off the lander fuel and oxidizer from the station supply, made sure all the kethane had been transferred to the station\u0027s refinery module, then undocked and separated gently with RCS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter this, I shifted focus back to my nuke exploration craft; James and Seeson executed their transfer burn perfectly! Soon they will be mapping kethane deposits around Minmus rather than pushing spacestations into wildly different orbits. So far the evening was going swimmingly. I shifted focus back to my now orbiting kethan drill rig. Just as soon as the physics kicked in, I was attacked by the infamous Kraken for the first time ever ... I watched, dumbfounded, amused and amazed as my otherwise-perfeclty intact driller lander shed all four of its landing legs - they each separated as if pushed away by Kerbal magic, tumbling end over end and drifing away, like petals from a flower, or seeds from a dandelion. So my fully-fueled rig, now sans landing legs and empty of kethane, was sitting in a low M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar orbit with 3,700\u002B m/s of delta-V available. Only one thing to do ...
