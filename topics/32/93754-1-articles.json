Now in .90 I am doing that again and it is even more interesting than in 0.25 since I have know idea what the next rescued Kerbal\u0027s role is going to be. So far I haven\u0027t had to pink slip any Kerbonauts because I had too many rescue ones, I hit 5 just before I was ready to upgrade the Astronaut complex, so as long as I don\u0027t get more than 9 rescue Kerbals before I am ready for the next upgrade all is good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am curious how many other players have any self imposed recruitment rules for Kerbals?
