Computer games go for around that price. Even old computer games(StarCraft for example) still go for about 20$. There is only so long you can play these games before they repeat the same thing over and over. KSP on the other hand has so many permutations, between the number of parts and where and how you place them, the number of different ways you can go from A to B, that its virtually endless. That is also not counting the number of mods that affect gameplay or add parts or information, or even the fact that you will get any and all updates to the game for free. Sure some games might release a patch or two, or even add a dlc for some parts and/or gameplay (usually at cost), but they don\u0027t even come close to what you get after your initial \u0027buy in\u0027 of ksp. \n\nI\u0027m not saying that KSP is the greatest game ever, or that we get the highest quality game, but KSP is pretty high up there and there are devs working on this game that probably will not see another dime from people who have already bought this game. I am also super picky about what games I play and for how long(I\u0027ll try a game but they usually will not stay with me for a few day, a month at most) and this has been THE ONLY game I have played since December. That in of itself should be justification for at least 50 hours of game play at minimum( at 30 bucks for the game it is 60 cents an hour)"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-11T00:23:33Z","Content":"In terms of pure number of hours of playtime this game offers, this game is a great deal, especially when compared to most FPS \u0022AAA\u0022 titles that cost $60 and are relatively short with minimal replay value.\n\nIn terms of value vs certain other games (especially other indie titles and older great AAA games), it does start to look a little overpriced. KSP is a great sandbox that allows the player\u0027s imagination to run wild, but there isn\u0027t much actual authored content (mods notwithstanding), and the game is pretty unpolished/unfinished and really should still be labeled as an early access title at this point.\n\nFor example, a game like Skyrim is $20 retail now (and can frequently be had for $5 on sale) and has a tremendous amount of authored content in addition to more mods than you know what to do with. I realize that it\u0027s a little apples vs oranges comparing KSP to Skyrim, but in terms of content and polish Skyrim handily beats KSP (and most of the bugs in Skyrim have been worked out now). Even compared to other indie sandbox/building games, KSP is kind of expensive since most of those are in the $20 range and can offer just as many hours of enjoyment.\n\nPart of the reason it\u0027s likely priced like it is has to do with lack of competition, other than the simplistic mobile rocket building games there aren\u0027t really any other games that have the unique combination of building sandbox and spaceflight. I think another good rocket building sim would do KSP a world of good (and given their success thus far it\u0027s likely only a matter of time)."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-11T00:46:31Z","Content":"Skyrim has been released for almost four years now, it was more than $20 when it first came out."},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-11T00:48:24Z","Content":"At the current price, maybe.

Looking in the top sellers in what Steam call \u0022indie\u0022, few other games are as expensive or more so than KSP there.\n\nBut maybe it doesn\u0027t matter much. I expect most people who want to get KSP right away will pay \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A330. Meanwhile those who plan on \u0022waiting for a sale\u0022 would probably still wait for a sale if the regular price was \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A320 or \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A325.

I didn\u0027t actually see your original comment until just now and I agree with that one too. I was more addressing RIC (no offense intended) that it\u0027s silly to say look skyrim was $60 at release, that justifies KSP being at whatever cost it may be at.
