With this, you don\u0027t need to try and get a ridiculously heavy lander all the way back from Eve to get a good science payout, and you can do an actual Apollo-style moon mission (as in, carry the surface samples home in the command module.)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup. Between that and the change in the material sciences bay and goo container, I\u0027ve started placing those parts on transfer stages, and then moving the results to the capsule before I drop the transfer stage. I\u0027m also placing them on the drop tanks of my high-delta-v munar (and now minmus) landers. The only thing that comes all the way back is a capsule and a parachute, and the only thing I transmit are crew reports. Hmmm... I wonder if I can do an eva report, pull it from the capsule, do an eva report in another biome, and then put the first one back. Too late to test tonight, but I\u0027ll definitely test it tomorrow. Though since EVA reports transmit at 100%, that wouldn\u0027t gain much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedCowboy","CreatedById":92106,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T08:33:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIMO this game just went from \u0022K car\u0022 to \u0022Kadilac\u0022!
