It wasn\u0027t so bad on the flat, but up in the mountains...there\u0027s huge facets that do that and you end up crawling to get off them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, my problem is not editing it to go stock, I could do that easily, because both the carrier aircraft and the rover only have a few mod parts, all of which are easily removed. The problem is that it\u0027s using most of them to attach the rover to the carrier aircraft in a way that allows it to get off the ground and doesn\u0027t screw up center of drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to attach it to a carrier without the mods, I\u0027d either have to build a plane onto the rover piece by piece, build the rover onto a plane piece by piece, use subassembly loader(which I don\u0027t have) to do the same thing only all at once, or hack the craft file to get it into the VAB so I can attach it to a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a carrier aircraft, given the size of it, it could only be attached either on top (major center of drag issues, it might be bad enough with this thing that top carriage isn\u0027t actually possible. It barely was with the DEMV mk5 and it only weighs 1.25 tons. This is 2.19.) Rear carriage would be easier, but I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027d fit well enough for the plane to be able to get off the runway without dragging the sides of the wheels, which would probably wreck the plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it wouldn\u0027t take so much time to get it to the mountains to test it, I wouldn\u0027t have a problem going stock to do it.
