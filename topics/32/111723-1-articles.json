I had just launched a capsule and returned it and had splashed down, when i noticed some \u003Cstrong\u003Eodd lights\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormally the lights I see are PlanetShine flares, and the Skybox, but this was slightly odder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lights were \u003Cem\u003Erotating\u003C/em\u003E like people dancing around a campfire. It was in a triangular formation and was rotating about \u003Cem\u003E20rpm\u003C/em\u003E. It was odd as i never noticed it that way. Usually planets dont line up that way. The first thought that came into my mind was ; I had time acceleration on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI checked and the \u003Cem\u003Etime acceleration was 1x\u003C/em\u003E. I even checked if there were any planets that i might have been seeing. To my disbelief, \u003Cem\u003Ethere were no planets, except Eeloo\u003C/em\u003E, in my way. (I had flares for eeloo turned down all the way so it was really hard to spot it.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went into IVA to zoom in, and \u003Cstrong\u003Ei found a dark triangle rotating. Yes, a dark triangle.\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not even slightly joking with you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed that it was somewhere in the sky, about 20km high up, so I used the camera angles to try and get as close as possible.I zoomed out as much as possible and eventually got \u0022close\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto this object. My computer usually handles KSP very well, but it got so laggy when viewing the object from the angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy computer crashed when i tried to zoom in even further. I had not encountered it since yesterday.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI did not have a crash log as my computer went blue screen.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHere is the image album.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/yI4OC\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Most of our chips use silicon transitors to store and calculate data. Our batteries have transformers which uses magnetic fields to generate ac current. The ac current can be easily changed to a certain voltage. With the correct precision change, each individual electron can be directed to the transistors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome species such as the greys have been known to manupilate stored data using their craft, without direct contact. I know it is ironic that greys are manupilating a game with talking green men, but it is a slight possibility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone encountered what i have encountered? I hope the devs made this an easter egg, because i don\u0027t want to play KSP with a possibility of an alien invasion.(which may be unlikely).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain the fact that i have played KSP for 4 years and only encountered this yesterday scares me. \u003Cstrong\u003EIf anyone knows what the problem is, please help me out.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Akinesis","CreatedById":71042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T11:19:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*Grabs tinfoil hat and sits in a closet*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, though.
