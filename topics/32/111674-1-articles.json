Though I play in normal mode, with saves etc. The first major bug I ran into was yesterday, at some point during a launch the ship bugged and said it was landed, even though it was in orbit. Though I attribute this to possible part clipping, as I had 2 tanks/engines side by side on the dual adapter and their RCS ports were clipped inside each other (clipping not turned on in the editor). Though I did rotate them so they didn\u0027t clip and I think the launcher still said it was landed after a certain point. Haven\u0027t run into the problem since, so I\u0027d have to test that specific launcher again I guess.\n\nOf course it could have also been some random combination of mod code at the right/wrong time that caused it.\n\nOh, just remembered I did have some small issues when parts were over-heating, usually the game freezes after staging (when sepratrons points too close to a tank), but after a few seconds it starts going again. After having this problem early on I learned to use F10 to turn off the over heat gauges and don\u0027t have any major problems. I usually don\u0027t remember to turn them off until after it freezes for a second. I just wonder how many of peoples problems are due to this, and would be fixed by just turning them off.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T13:15:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 01:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sma**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tankman101","CreatedById":144359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T21:28:36Z","Content":"\\*insert annoyingly snarky comment about how KSP is actually in alpha\\*"},{"CreatedByName":"dsonbill","CreatedById":115997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T22:28:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I know when i have major issues and someone comes and saya something like what i\u0027m about to write i feel kind if miffed, still.
