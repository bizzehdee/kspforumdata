Excluding Contract-Science and recovery Science.\u003Cp\u003Eguestimating it should lay between 70000 and 100000 Science Points, but i\u0027m not quite shure how much Science you can get inside of Kerbins SOI ? Anybody know that or know the total number? (not exactly, but \u002B - 5000 accurancy)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter mhoram pointed me to the chart made by Timbo, i looked where the mistakes were, because the number was way too low. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found out half of the multipliers were wrong, and the Experiments had to be set to \u0027maximum value\u0027 instead of \u0027base value\u0027 (all numbers from the wiki). Also i calculated the \u0027splashed down\u0027 values (they have different multipliers) for Kerbin, Eve and Laythe and added them to the total value. And with that changes the table stated 25080 for Jools SOI which was exactly the same number i calculated per hand in my Jool 5 Preparation and which is close to my practical achieved number during actual \u0027doing\u0027 of my Jool 5 Mission. After that i believed the modified chart.
