Putting something like that together requires a greater coordination between everyone involved than a headline such as the one Max tweeted earlier. For now all I can ask is that we wait for that to come through. We do care about our community here and such extensive pieces are often exclusive to the forum. As people said before it\u0027s hard to make a single sentence announcement on a forum, but we love to share in-depth information here - and that\u0027s exactly what you\u0027ll get.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlad to hear it. Why doesn\u0027t the official KSP twitter ever post the little hints and teasers though? It\u0027s almost always just retweets of things Max posts on his personal account.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EladDv","CreatedById":118368,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T21:42:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Robotengineer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Robotengineer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf Max stopped his rambling it might make the CM (or KasperVld\u0027s) job a little easier.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eagain it\u0027s his personal account as long as he didnt break NDA or mislead anyone i dont see how he is not entitled to ramble on as much as he likes on his personal twitter account- i know Kasper rambles a bit too and i am sure badie and anyone else does- his account is not the official account for KSP or Squad please stop treating it like it is\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI didn\u0027t do anything on anybody, you\u0027re confusing sarcasm with actual insults.\u003Cp\u003EHe\u0027s the producer at Squad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy are they using their \u003Cstrong\u003EPERSONAL\u003C/strong\u003E Twitter accounts to release game-related information?
