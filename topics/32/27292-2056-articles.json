A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E motors to something more reasonable, which makes it fly acceptably on Kerbin also. I\u0027m\u00A0working on a variant of it which is intended to be the ultimate Duna science exploration machine -- full science plus heavy scanning arm, command pod with room for one scientist but with advanced avionics so he can fly the thing. Refining it. With the lower mass it\u00A0works supremely well there.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn case any others are interested in making electric Duna flyers, here\u0027s a tip: there really is only one good propulsion solution for it. It\u0027s the 2.5 metre ducted fan, with two stacked light-duty rotors with eight blades each in them, both powered and contra-rotating. The limiting factor on Duna isn\u0027t power, it\u0027s the prop fill factor, and you need to get as many blades in there spinning as fast as possible to produce the thrust/lift you need.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe good news is that this solution works pretty nicely at least for relatively light craft. You\u0027d need massive numbers of them to get a heavy plane working but I think even that\u00A0ought to be doable.

The plane transfers to and from polar orbit were much more expensive than I thought -- probably should\u0027ve bounced off Tylo -- so I ended up having to do a refueling mission to Vall afterwards. But got it done. I still don\u0027t have my launch profile from Vall sorted, I went low again and had to take some manoeuvring losses.

spent fine tuning encounters.\u00A0 Used Tylo to reverse gravity assist into Jool orbit, and was able to do science and crew reports at a few of the moons, resulting in a lot of experience and science for a cheap price (1000 science and 44 xp for the crew without landing, mainly from the Jool system, with 70,000 cost of launch vehicle).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe more difficult part was getting back to Kerbin.\u00A0 I had a highly eccentric orbit of Jool and wanted to use Tylo for the large boost back to Kerbin .\u00A0 My first attempt was a failure, going into an extremely eccentric Kerbol orbit and attempting gravity assists off eve to return to Kerbin, but couldn\u0027t manage to get it to work.\u00A0 Tylo can give pretty extreme gravity assists from a highly eccentric Jool orbit, probably enough to get to the sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat worked a lot better is shown below, where I time-warped to a standard transfer window from Jool to Kerbin (kerbin about 45 degrees behind Jool, which I just estimated visually), dodging the moons in the mean time, and finally setting up a Tylo assist to get the Kerbin encounter.\u00A0 The Jool escape burns used only about 100 m/s delta v total, much better than the 2800 m/s needed without assistance from the moons.\u00A0 I returned to Kerbin going 4500 m/s and aerobraked beginning at 52000 meters with NO heat

couldn\u0027t find any guides to show how to set up all these gravity assists.\u00A0 However, one thing I realized is the Kerbin-Eve-Kerbin-Kerbin assist route is pretty consistent because once at the Kerbin-Eve transfer window, the future position of Kerbin after the Eve assist will be consistent so one can set up a the first Kerbin assist to get a 3 year orbit for a second a Kerbin encounter (again I cite bradley whistance who called this the K-E-K-K-J route in his Odyssey by\u00A0Bill series), which will make the final Kerbin assist out to Jool possible with a large margin to get a Tylo reverse gravity assist into Jool orbit.\u00A0 Also I assume the initial Kerbin-Eve transfer window needs to roughly lined up with some Jool transfer window for the final Kerbin assist to get to Jool, but I think when starting a new game it is pretty close.\u00A0 My guess is there is there\u0027s a window for all to happen about every 3-4 years but I\u0027d like to know if someone knows.\u00A0 It depends on the angular resolution or granularity of the Kerbin-Eve transfer windows, which I believe is about every 1.6 years or 144 degrees, but inclination is a big factor too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this math seems\u00A0intimidating, I feel the same way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeiss

Not turing complete, but you can probably do some things with it (setting the score to specific value and have those value being the start points of some specific scenes). I miss the possibility to give a player a choice of actions, but I can probably get around that using some narration technique (having a specific kerbal entering a specific part of a station or spaceship could be one way to do that. It would require some specific writing, but nothing undoable). I also miss the possibility of creating custom assets (I\u0027m not sure I can have a GameData folder specific to a mission) or setting variables. But the computer nerd in me is kind of enjoying trying to get around those constraints.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo maybe, I\u0027ll do some mission writing. Need to check others mission too, to understand how you people do things there, but should be fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I\u0027m trying to figure out if it\u0027s cheaper to go to Duna while doing an Eve fly-by, or if I should do it with two craft. I like the idea of the first option, but it seems like planning a window for it would be math crazy while I can probably just bruteforce it all the way down, using moar nukes. I also need to drop a lab on my solar outpost, and adding a return vehicle would be nice I guess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tinker with Mission Builder from time-to-time...\u00A0 Maybe best to post a question or two in the Mission Builder forum.\u00A0 Although, I acknowledge not many seem to follow or post in that forum on a regular basis.\u00A0 If I could just figure out some way to have a catch-all node fire, complete it\u0027s little string, then return to the main storyline thread, I think I\u0027d be pretty happy with Mission Builder.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
