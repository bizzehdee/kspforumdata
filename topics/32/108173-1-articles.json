I perpetually thought i\u0027d run out of fuel and had to wing it, decoupling extra fuel tanks, and then figuring out the most efficient way back to Kerbin was a gravity assist from Laythe. That, unfortunately, sent me on a pretty steep encounter with Kerbin, and i slammed into the atmosphere at 8 km/s with 28 km Pe. \n\nI pulled over 17g\u0027s on the descent, and my heat shield even exploded due to overheating...\n\nI say, if your heat shield doesnt explode due to overheating, then you arent playing KSP right ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\n![ufyaES9.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ufyaES9.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Levelord","CreatedById":57711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T07:12:13Z","Content":"Valentina looks like she\u0027s enjoying herself ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Bilfr3d","CreatedById":75448,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T08:02:38Z","Content":"The most XP I\u0027ve had from a mission is only 7... :\u0027( I have yet to spend enough time playing career to get the higher paying contracts XD"},{"CreatedByName":"Falkenherz","CreatedById":141969,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T08:10:28Z","Content":"That\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s just awesome.
