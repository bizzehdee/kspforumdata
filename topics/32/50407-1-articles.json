Go to an anomaly, do a surface sample/EVA report, and get between 500 and 700 science for each, perhaps even more (kinda want to balance it around experts who know the location of every anomaly). Maybe prorate the science reward depending on anomaly difficulty/distance from KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"borisvolodnikov","CreatedById":78010,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T19:03:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis please!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbocracy","CreatedById":89641,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T20:43:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the anomalies should be randomly placed (with constraints so they look good) at each career start.

Why? Simple--it seems that rovers have less value now, considering that it\u0027s more practical to \u0022hop\u0022 your lander around say, the Mun, to go to another distant biome, than driving for several hours to get to a new biome just to get soil samples from the new location. So, to replicate Apollo missions, aside from surface triggers, there has to be object triggers (i.e. Tracy\u0027s Rock, House Rock, etc.) that would return science.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galileo Kerbonaut","CreatedById":65299,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T00:43:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerbocracy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kerbocracy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think the anomalies should be randomly placed (with constraints so they look good) at each career start.
