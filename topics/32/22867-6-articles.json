I should say I tried out a Kethane colony on Minmus and I have some advice, 1-unless you\u0027re habitation modules are just sitting there and aren\u0027t coupled with the mining systems and unless you can confidently design for it ,docking on the ground with any ship large enough to bother with could be extremely difficult, after what seemed like an hour fruitlessly bumping the fuel transport ship near the Sr docking port on the mining module I found this out the hard way. 2- although it would be cheaper per unit eventually, it might take considerably longer to extract and export the Kethane compared to just sending regular fuel from Kerbin to orbit, I think it was a 2:1 mun:kerbin time ratio for my design, but if you design the ships to be large enough and your good enough at docking the time investment may payoff if you\u0027re doing \u003Cem\u003Ea lot\u003C/em\u003E of interplanetary launching. good luck! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elazarus1024: I never considered the properties of the Lunar regolith or the fact that oxygen could just be extracted from the martian air, under that system the oxygen could be taken from the outside air and CO2 from the inhabitants could just be extracted and sent back out into the air, in theory you wouldn\u0027t even need an air recycling system! And yes one advantage mars has is that it has soil which is probably the closest to terrestrial soil in the solar system, if a GM plant could survive under these conditions food and fuel could be obtained in easily, that doesn\u0027t work Nuclear would work fine. With regards to the regolith again, yes extraction of oxygen from the regolith of which 40% is oxygen would be difficult, I was thinking more of splitting the H2O in an underground lunar ice deposit for oxygen and then using/dumping the excess hydrogen, although even the water could be laced with contaminants and if they cant be purified without a gigantic quantity of infrastructure and are unsafe, then extremely expensive water and oxygen would have to be brought from earth, come to think of it unpure fuel would also be far less useful depending on the contamination. with regards to the dust, i\u0027m thinking (possibly naively) that with enough infrastructure regolith could be cleaned away from a person\u0027s suit, but the damage to rovers/mining vehicles, dunno, if its traveling very slowly it may avoid most damage, until they start mining, mining could create a lot of problems dust wise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith regard to the resources of Mars, the utilization of (land/soil in a nuclear powered greenhouse) could lead to exponential growth, whereas a lunar colony would be limited by the current demand for fuel in earth orbit, maybe additionally the mining of He3 or surface deposits of valuable metals gold/platinum providing there even there in the minutest quantity,or the potential as a space tourism location. even if with cheap fuel, interplanetary travel grows at an exponential rate, the rate of say colonists on mars to the required number of people on the moon to mine the fuel for them to get there could be within 1/100 or 1/1000.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn total there are a lot of variables but taking the martian CO2 and the lunar regolith\u0027s various dangers and into account, Mars even with the extra delta-V might be easier, but unless Elon Musk\u0027s dream of an 80,000 martian population in 2-3 decades becomes a reality it would take a very long time for the mars civilization to become as helpful to the space economy as a lunar fuel port that would slash Earth to X-planet fuel costs to mere percentage of there current sum, maybe in the scheme of things a space agency/corporation will create a mining outpost on the moon helping the (already/about to start/starts afterwards) colonization of mars, as well as the rest of the solar system for that matter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DJEN","CreatedById":61378,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T02:35:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022fenderzilla\u0022 data-cite=\u0022fenderzilla\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESome people say laythe is the best place for a new colony, but there are some things to consider:\u003Cp\u003Elaythe\u0027s oceans, although liquid water, must be very, very salty to prevent it from freezing, as its temperature is far below zero celsius\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s halfway across the solar system, so getting there and back would be net to impossible\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit\u0027s unlikely that there is an abundance of anything that could be used for energy or rocket fuel - even solar power would be sparse as it is so far away from the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emost importantly - it\u0027s too close to Jool. at certain points in its orbit, it would pass close enough to the gravitational field of Jool to be bathed in trillions of ionically charged particles - i think it\u0027s something like that on io - essentially irradiating the entire planet\u0027s surface. you could work out some sort of way to draw power from this, but your bases would have to have heavy radiation shielding.
