I decided to edit it, and I found that the fuels are WAY too dense. However, I also found that the specific heats are EXACTLY correct! For example, the hsp for LiquidFuel is exactly equal to that of Kerosene! It is thousands of times denser, though...\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, so I got the densities under control with a bit of research. The problem is, I\u0027m trying to make the costs more realistic. How should I do this, and does anyone have more info?
