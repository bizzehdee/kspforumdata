I fired up the squash a kerbal thingie from the debug menu and fired a few spheres off in jest at some ground crew..Not sure this is new but a few of the spheres rolled out of the SPH and..... Hit.. Buildings causing them to explode..I always thought the SPH was in its own reality instance seperate from the realworld.. And that the sky is a painting.. But.. It seems its not true anymore? The buildings were indeed destroyed once I launched the train and went to have a lookIs this new or did I just miss it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T02:11:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis has happened to me too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T02:16:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI didnt know they damage physics, but they are in fact in the normal kerbal world. If you get the HangerExtender mod, you can scroll outside of the VAB/SPH. Having done this, you can see every building in the KSC... EXCEPT the Admin Building. I assume it just hasn\u0027t been included into the inclusion set yet. Also, scrolling outside the VAB allows you to see that it is in fact a giant gray series of stripes from the outside.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
