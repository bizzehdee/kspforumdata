Depending on the program the performance can go down by a lot.\n\nKSP has one thread per subsystem. A subsystem can be physics, audio, graphics, etc. The big ressource hog is the physics thread.\n\nUnity 5 introduces multi-threaded physics. That means KSP 1.1 will probably run a bit faster that than pre-1.1."},{"CreatedByName":"jkool702","CreatedById":146465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T14:32:23Z","Content":"Thanks for the reply. I kind of expected that hyperthreading made little to no difference, but figured someone out there had actually tested it out.\n\nAnd yes I\u0027m very hopeful that 1.1 will bring nice performance gains. My i7 seems severely under-utilized right now :/"},{"CreatedByName":"godefroi","CreatedById":101728,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T14:34:53Z","Content":"Some Intel (and other) cores have extra hardware that doesn\u0027t (always) get used by a single thread. These cores can expose this extra hardware as a \u0022virtual\u0022 core, but that core shares resources with the \u0022real\u0022 core, meaning that depending on what is going on, the \u0022virtual\u0022 core may or may not be able to be utilized fully. That\u0027s why your mathlab code didn\u0027t run any faster, because it either wasn\u0027t multithreaded, or if it was, the threads were competing for the shared resource (which is, I believe, generally an FPU, or Floating Point Unit, which does floating point math, and which KSP would use heavily...)."},{"CreatedByName":"WeirdCulture","CreatedById":76591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T15:09:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Unity 5 introduces multi-threaded physics.
