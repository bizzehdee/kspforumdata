So far, one of two things keep happening:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The rocket loses and spins out of control and I don\u0027t have any control over the current rockets being fired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The current rockets being fired detaches from my ship and everything explodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you guys need pictures, I\u0027ll try to get them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no clue what is going on. At first I thought it was my fault, that somehow I created a faulty rocket but I no longer buy that. I recreated one of the youtube user\u0027s, Kurtjmac\u0027s, successful rocket designs and it too suffers from the problem above. I\u0027ve only ever got to the Mun once during this update and all of my other attempts failed to leave Kerbin atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there something I am not getting at? I know this game requires some trial and error, but I feel like the game is glitching out on me. I am sorry if this is coming off as a butt-hurt complaint, I don\u0027t mean to.

You usually need two sets of struts, a single radial brace per radial stack as far as possible along the stack from the decoupler and one circumferential brace per stack around the outside between stacks to prevent wobble. Point of attachment further out is more stable for these ie around the outside of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting these struts absolutely symmetrical and for circumferential struts horizontal, prevents rocket spin and can be achieved using the snap to system by placing a reference strut on the snap-to line at the destination point before you place the actual reinforcing strut starting at the snap-to line at the origin point. Then remove the reference strut. If you use the textures to measure vertical displacement you can achieve near perfect symmetry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you try to edit the struts\u0027 XYZ (angle) values in the craft file you can sometimes win out, since the struts seem to be drawn from a starting location at an angle and raytraced to the destination where they attach themselves. But this only works for very small adjustments eg making them absolutely horizontal, more often than not adjusting angles breaks the craft file. Though adjusting decoupler and tank heights works pretty reliably which can help with multi-radial designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest its a bit too fussy the way it is but it looks like the Squad crew are working on it so I hope these tips will help in the meantime. IMHO snap-to option on the destination placement would help a lot, oh and a vertical snap-to would help too. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd kerbals do die on contact with the big tanks, the only way round that I know of is to give them ladders.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-07T11:14:50Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2012 11:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by boolybooly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Khrissetti","CreatedById":29557,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-07T10:00:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe new radial decouplers are a world of fun.
