If you could clearly distinguish an LV-909 in the image, or if it featured a squat trapezoid-head enthusiastically trying to sell me something, it might be more of an interesting find, but I don\u0027t think we have a case, here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlternNocturn","CreatedById":17872,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T15:24:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, totally off-topic, and the OP was probably joking so I won\u0027t be targeting him, but why do people (besides OP) think that just because a company creates something that is a derivative work (i.e. it\u0027s a different product but has a similar look to it) of another company\u0027s thing that the second company has a right to a lawsuit?
