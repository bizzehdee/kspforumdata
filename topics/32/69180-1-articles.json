Before the patch, I built a launcher made of tons of mainsails and big orange, but it just kept falling apart on the pad (no matter how many struts). After the patch, my launcher was actually stable through launch and ascension, but unfortunately it lacked the delta-v required for orbit. Instead of redesigning it, I constructed a new launcher with the new parts, and was finally able to get my lander to Eve. I know its a big lander, but when I built it, I didn\u0027t want to use aerospikes, just traditional bell rockets. I also wanted it to be capable of taking off at sea level and getting a mark 1 capsule to orbit. That being said, I\u0027m happy I can cross this one off the list and move on to some new planets (I\u0027ve only been to the mun!).

As far as visiting planets, after I landed on the mun, figured I could just skip minmus and try an interplanetary mission. I picked Eve cause it was hard to take off from (I really like building launch vehicles!), but I didn\u0027t realize how difficult getting a 300 ton lander to Eve would be. Like I said, I couldn\u0027t do it before 23.5. Before then, all I had done was land a one-way rover Eve suicide mission. After the patch, its actually quite easy to launch huge payloads to LKO. For example, the rocket above gets 1200\u002B tons into orbit. Stuff is just SO much stabler now, plus the new engines are pretty... strong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022manskal\u0022 data-cite=\u0022manskal\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWow, for a person who has only done a flyby of Eve (and that in two versions ago) that really looks spectacular.

My trip to Eve and back was horribly inefficient, I bet the pros on this board could do it with half the fuel. Designing the Eve lander was kinda tough, cause it needs so much delta-v, TWR, and stability in that thick atmosphere. Pretty much had to use a multi-asparagus design. Building a launcher capable of doing a single launch Eve mission used to be the hardest (nearly impossible) part, but with the improved stability its actually pretty easy. Just look at how many struts you see on the launcher (designed post 23.5) vs. my payload (designed pre 23.5). Its an order of magnitude difference. The patch was so nice for stopping things from falling apart on the pad, I think it might even be a bit overboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still curious if anyone knows the reason for that missing oxidizer?

Dying in a gigantic explosion is an honorable way to perish, and will surely earn them a high standing in the afterlife. There were 18 Kerbals aboard this ship when this happened. The first 5 attempts also ended in disaster, but they were SO sure it\u0027d be okay this time. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VwvqI0T.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VwvqI0T.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maccollo","CreatedById":72759,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-13T15:11:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a different idea....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s take of from Eve...

Downside of FAR = command chairs aren\u0027t any good anymore.
