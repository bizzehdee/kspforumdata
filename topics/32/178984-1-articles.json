I wanted to look at getting a 2nd hand laptop while I am there and slimming it to a ubuntu OS so that I can use it for school work and to potentially play KSP on as well. I had a few questions about this.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am running a current install with a lot of mods on it and I am not sure how to try to port it over. I can always try \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E or something, but I was wondering if anyone knew if there are any quick ways or limitations I should know about on ubuntu. I think I have about 70 installed but I also don\u0027t think all of them work and I could probably go through the process of weeding a lot of broken/unnecessary ones out.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWill this lead to significantly better performance than running it on windows? From what I understand w10 is terrible for using a lot of RAM while ubuntu is not, so I should get proportionally better performance on that.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, what should I spec my laptop to? I usually only use laptops for school and work type stuff so other than potentially only this 6 week stint, I might not use it very much for this or anything similar soon. Does anyone have a recommended lower end but good performance for specs that I might need?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kernel Kraken","CreatedById":181383,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-15T17:30:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m pretty sure that OS dosent affect mods.

I get my installers from the KSP Store... so the following may/may not work with a Steam install:\u003Cbr\u003E\nI was actually able to ust copy \u0026amp; paste my modded /GameData folder back and forth from my Win install (/KSP_Win), directly to my Linux install (/KSP_linux), and vice-versa... I did it many times, as I added or changed mods... Its *THAT* easy... as stated above, there are a few mods that are OS dependent, but they usually require interfacing with or using external apps. They usually state pretty clearly in the release thread if they are OS specific.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI ran a pretty heavily modded install... aboot 100 small plugin-type mods, and maybe a dozen small parts mods, and maybe one or two larger part mods.\u003Cbr\u003E\nCOmputer runs very hot with KSP... Make sure anything you buy, the fan is running, running quietly, and is pretty clean... you can peek thru the vents with a flashlight.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI take apart my laptop every couple years, and clean the internals, especially the fan, of course. I can tell when it needs it, because the fan runs louder and more often...\u003Cbr\u003E\nDefinately get a cooler pad... I got a Thermaltake 23GT, or something... was the biggest they had at the time... I have 17.3\u0022 laptop, so I needed a LARGE cooler...\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt makes all the diff in the world...\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve had the computer shutdown due to tripping the thermal sensor many times... sometimes even with the cooler going...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou dont need to worry about 32bit KSP... get 64bit for Linux... so DEFINATELY, get at LEAST 6GB of RAM... dont settle for less.\u003Cbr\u003E\nKSP 1.5 doesnt even support 32bit now.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI had this all on a triple-boot setup: Win7, Win8.1, Lubuntu, and a seperate partition for KSP install and everything else that wasnt system related. Also, this was all on a single 500GB HDD (465GB usable).\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou can always run Linux right off a USB stick, if you dont want to bother with actually installing it on the comp. This is a good option if you will only be using Linu for a short time...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIts debatable whether an SSD makes a performance difference over an HDD. I\u0027m of the camp, that the only difference is in shorter game loading times with an SSD...\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith the circumstances that you\u0027ve described for what you want in this computer, I wouldnt bother with spending extra $$ on an SSD. If you get a laptop that meets all the other criteria FIRST, and has an SSD for a good price, go for it... but dont make having an SSD a requirement or deal-breaker.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs to wifi, you dont specifically NEED wifi to run KSP itself... IIRC, I didnt have too much trouble with wifi drivers in Lubuntu... I have an Atheros wifi booard...
