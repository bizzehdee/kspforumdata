A little more about Munbert\u0027s situation: He\u0027s at the South(?) Pole of the Mun. The lander is stuck on its side in a gully between two hills, nose downward. The RCS blocks are at the bottom of the lander, near the Cg, so they don\u0027t have enough torque to right the lander. Besides which, the lander is out of mono (apparently the RCS and SAS were left on while it was sliding downhill). Retracting the solar panels lets the nose sink down, while retracting the gear brings it up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t played at all since posting this morning, so the next thing Munbert will try is pushing the lander around to face uphill, as the reaction wheels can\u0027t manage it (I\u0027ve done it before with other ships but the gully is keeping the lander wedged in place). If I can get it facing uphill it\u0027ll be no prob getting it off the regolith; Jeb has done that sort of thing many times already. I have tried (and been able) to power it off the ground, but I haven\u0027t been able to get it upright fast enough before it hits the \u0027lith again. I\u0027m sure if I quickload enough times I\u0027ll get him back into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s all beside the point. I sent him there to plant flags and was not planning to bring him home anytime soon. He may wait for a science lab rover to come get him, if I ever create such a beast. But getting him to do some science hopping would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, when the EVA report says \u0022just above the Mun\u0027s Poles,\u0022 he really is \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E above the poles\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i9agINI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022i9agINI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"biohazard15","CreatedById":91655,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T22:59:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice landing you have here \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you wouldn\u0027t want to bring him back so fast.
