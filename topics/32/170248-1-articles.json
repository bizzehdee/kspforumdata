Warning!\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis text was translated by Google Translate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDoes anyone know of you - who are more attentive to the game than I am - whether the promised German localization is still to come? ,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been playing the game for several years, but unfortunately I can not play it properly because my English skills are even worse than my shooter skill :-D. And I would love to play it more. Slowly I get a little annoyed, I know from my own experience (I was in the team of Wing Commander Saga German patch) how much work such a translation makes, and in a fan project, I would not complain, but with a development team that with Making money from his work (and rightly so, as I think, because the game is superlative), should live up to its promises, especially if it is a crowdfunding or early access project. I remember exactly that I inquired before buying whether a German localization is planned, and because it was then said that not just a restaurant. was planned, but they already work on it, I bought it myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter then nothing happened I learned from a team working on a German mod (www.kerbalspaceprogram.de) ;-), and that was, although not everything translated was already great, and has helped a bit (from this period I mean mine Game lessons from Kerbal SP :-), finally I could start.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnfortunately, it did not work anymore after a patch of the game, because the developers changed something on the engine, which stopped the patch. The guys then stopped working on the german mod because the developers (once again) claimed that the german release \u0027soon\u0027 would be expected ... that\u0027s over a year now\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a shame that I find the work of the developer team really great, and I have a lot of respect for the performance of Squad. And let\u0027s just say, now that Valve is the owner, it makes it even worse that still no German localization has been released (though it should come several times) :-P.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I\u0027ll just wait, though I\u0027d much rather work on my next mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wish all Kerbalnauten fun in space and never your rope rips at an EVA ;-).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreeting Kalumet\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-30T05:03:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe latest KSP Weekly included an announcement that a German translation would be in the 1.4 release.
