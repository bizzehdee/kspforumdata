Due to the tenuous atmosphere and reduced gravity, propeller-driven vehicles are very effective. I\u0027ve found that while a vessel of this sort has, for example, a TWR of 1.0 on Kerbin, it will have a TWR of 2.0\u002B on Duna. This means heavier vehicles can be built with smaller props, easing the burden of huge electric charge draw (though it can still be quite substantial for large vessels). It also means I can build tiny vessels that still serve a purpose, or can carry payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAltitude is still very achievable, even with small vessels.

However, Eve is a special case; there are high-altitude environments on its surface which have a KSI of 0.94, barely less than that of the surface of Laythe. It\u0027d be more than Laythe\u0027s ranking if there wasn\u0027t oxygen on Laythe. I think there must be trace amounts of oxygen (at least) on Eve (although not nearly enough for a jet engine to operate), seeing as oxygen seems common in the universe and we have no proof otherwise. Given this information, I\u0027d quarantine the surfaces of both Laythe and Eve to anything manned, because the environments\u0027 contamination can be prevented in the case of probes/landers/rovers, but a manned mission to the surface would guarantee something to be dropped off and survive. That being said, Duna, with its presumably CO2 atmosphere at 20 kpa and temperatures up to -2 or higher, should be quarantined as well, but considering that I\u0027m about to send a manned mission there, oh well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-07T21:54:25Z\u0022 title=\u002210/07/2015 09:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Findthepin1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Findthepin1","CreatedById":139989,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T15:38:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I had to colonize something for the purposes of having a backup Kerbin, it\u0027d be Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T16:16:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would be highly suspect of the potential success of any colony built on a planet whose oceans are made of \u0022explodium\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tweeker","CreatedById":101796,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T20:36:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI notice no one has chimed in with anything definite on the subject of liquid water on Eve so I\u0027ll wade in,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E From my youth when we would can a lot of food in the fall I remember my mother\u0027s pressure cooker, it was set for the standard pressure, 15 psi, this is psi absolute, so 29.7 psi or basically the 2 atm at the 6 km high mountain on Eve\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I recall the pressure cooker would not boil until 250F this translates to 121C, so the mountain - top colony would be right at the boiling point of water, essentially the water would boil in the day and condense at night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E That\u0027s about the limit of my \u0022top of the head\u0022 knowledge, but a little digging turns up this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/boiling-point-water-d_926.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/boiling-point-water-d_926.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt sea level, the pressure is 5atm or 5.065 bar \u0026amp; 150C.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Checking the chart, at 5 bar water boils at ~ 153C \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So once again just under the boiling point, but at the risk of sounding like a broken record the water would boil off in the noonday sun, and you would get a hot hard rain or dew in the darktime. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInteresting weather for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-09T20:38:29Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2015 08:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tweeker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xiej","CreatedById":152168,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T00:33:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUmmm......

But to know for sure you would need to know what conditions are best for Kerbals to live without space suits, since in game, they wear their suits even outside on Kerbin. Most people assume they\u0027re similar to humans so here goes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAtmosphere: At Duna\u0027s equator and at low altitude a human could survive with arctic clothing and an oxygen mask, no pressure suit required (this is not possible on Mars because of its much lower atmospheric pressure). On Eve even at the mountain tops, a human would die without a climate controlled space suit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPower: Solar is better on Eve. Nuclear power doesn\u0027t care where it is, but cooling a reactor might be a problem on Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResources: Duna has large polar caps that could realistically provide water (and therefore oxygen and rocket fuel). Eve\u0027s oceans and lots of its atmosphere are probably made of hydrocarbons (explodium sea). Oxygen and water are an issue there but might be able to be chemically extracted from the ground or filtered from the atmosphere. In game, there is ore on both planets so that\u0027s not a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransportation: It\u0027s easy to make a hopper-lander on Duna. You don\u0027t need any disposable stages to get to orbit and back. Planes will fly in both atmospheres, but will go farther on Duna because of lower drag, though they\u0027re more maneuverable on Eve. Rovers work better in the high gravity of Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadiation: A problem for humans, but it\u0027s pretty clear that Kerbals aren\u0027t adversely affected by it. Humans would need to build bases underground on Duna to hide from the radiation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall: Duna is clearly easier in-game, and probably better in a more realistic colonization attempt, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: It would be cool if there was a mod for an Eve jet that runs on onboard oxidizer and intakes atmospheric fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-11T16:23:59Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2015 04:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sdj64\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T16:36:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Findthepin1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Findthepin1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat being said, Duna, with its presumably CO2 atmosphere at 20 kpa...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe don\u0027t know what Duna\u0027s atmosphere consists of, but it\u0027s definitely not carbon dioxide.
