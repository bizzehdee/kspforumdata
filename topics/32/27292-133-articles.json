Decided to try the career out and started with a couple manned sub-orbitals and Mun fly-bys, and it was late, so I didn\u0027t get far. Started out today with some meager earnings from last night, wondering what would net me the most research with my current tech. Figured I\u0027d land an unmanned pod on Minmus, just in case it didn\u0027t make it back. It did. Still underwhelmed by my earnings I though, why the hell not? Let\u0027s see if I can hit the sun with my current tech. Nope (probably could have if I used gravity assists and the like, but this was just a \u0027fire from the hip\u0027 shot as I was about to quit)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelp, I got out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI and found out that the research points were massive. So after spamming transmissions of deep space research I figured that it had turned out to be a fairly successful mission after all. I still had a tank of fuel c/w an LV-909(?) left, so when I reached my AP I fired it retro to see how close I could actually get. When out of the blue I saw a flicker on my map. Somehow on a random firing, I ended up with an Eve intercept. With the tiny amount of fuel I had left I adjusted my orbit, but I had forgotten two crucial things: 1. I was coming from behind the sun carrying a helluva lot of dV and 2. I didn\u0027t have DRE installed, so I could aero-brake as much as I wanted. With these two omissions from the flight plan I came screaming through Eve\u0027s upper atmosphere at roughly 7-8km/s (still spamming my transmissions), barely moving my trajectory. Oh well. As soon as I was out of the atmosphere, I went back to the space centre to see my earnings. Total research gained from that random flight: ~1175 rp, far more than my total research up to that point. Not bad considering I was planning on spending about five minutes with it.
