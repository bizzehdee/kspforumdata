This means that the right chemical rocket will almost always yield a lighter overall stage.\n\n The exception is where the thrust and DV requirement is super low. In this case, you can\u0027t find a chemical rocket and tank combo small enough to do the job efficiently.\n\n An example from .90:\n\n![TyloLander1_zpse6f985f2.jpg](http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g13/GoSlash27/TyloLander1_zpse6f985f2.jpg)\n\n Chemical Tylo descent stage vs. monoprop. \n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy\n\n\\*edit\\* remember that missions are not planned around which engine can give you the most DV, but rather which engine gives you the needed DV in the smallest and cheapest total package.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T19:49:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 07:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27**"}]}
