First time it happened, I immediately continued my burn directly to Munar Transfer, and saw my Periapsis grow to around 78km doing so.\n\nMy question is, when this happens, do you do the same? Is there any drawback to going for it immediately (moment of opportunity), or would it be better to do an orbit before that burn (ie, fuel efficiency).\n\nIn one instance, I took stock of my fuel levels during direct transfer, and then repeated it after a single orbit. In the direct transfer, I noticed just slightly better fuel performance; the problem is that direct transfer was done without the mishap on staging when I did the circularize orbit (stupid thumb staged when I didn\\\u0027t want it to).\n\n\\*edited due to stupidity ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"sss","CreatedById":24050,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-08T04:06:34Z","Content":"personally, i just orbit the kearth before headinng to mun.\n\nthat way im ready and prepared."},{"CreatedByName":"khyron42","CreatedById":8551,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-08T05:24:27Z","Content":"Delta-v for a Perfect TMI after one orbit (with perfect circularization burn) would be the same as delta-v for a perfect TMI right when you should have begun the circularization burn.

Fuel consumption between the two *should* be nearly zero, regardless. But after nearly 10 successful transfers (and 9 successful returns), I\\\u0027m finding I\\\u0027m dropping stages a lot quicker than I usually do, and sometimes with MUCH more remaining fuel (could be a bug, though I doubt it ... may just be more confident on the direct approach than waiting one orbit ... timing is critical on the latter, and I do tend to \u0027Kerbal\u0027 it up more often than now). I\\\u0027m currently playing around with a design from the Exchange (can\\\u0027t remember the rocket name off-hand, but it\\\u0027s a very elegant design, and VERY easy to fly ... I wanted to thank the author of it, but I\\\u0027d be necro\\\u0027ing it ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)). I\\\u0027m starting to wonder if I should time my launches now, depending on the craft, until the Mun will end up rising about the time a \u0027lonely little island\u0027 (my terminology) pops up in the great ocean. Every time I see that island, I know I have about 10 seconds before the Mun rises (depending on the launch schedule), and can time the burn almost down to the second.\n\n\\*Edit\\* Ahh, it\\\u0027s this one: [http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=10638.msg161771#msg161771](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=10638.msg161771#msg161771) To the author, if you read this, this is a very cool rocket!"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-08T17:23:38Z","Content":"In the 0.13.3 demo version, every launch starts at the same time of the same day. So we could launch directly to TMI and skip the Kerbin orbit. The Mun is a little bit high in the sky at that moment, so my personal method was to interrupt the gravity turn at 45\u00C2\u00B0 and hold it there until AP is at the Mun\\\u0027s orbit. It seems like this should be inefficient, but the fuel penalty was only slight.\n\nThere was one video tutorial where I watched the guy waste fuel fiddling to make his orbit perfectly circular while the TMI window opened and closed. Arg! ;P \n\nI think it helps to do a burn closer to Kerbin, but I forget the name of that effect. Anyone? Anyone?"},{"CreatedByName":"Rickenbacker","CreatedById":2349,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-08T17:36:18Z","Content":"Do you mean a gravitational slingshot?

If it seems counter intuitive to you too, read the proof in the Wikipedia article.\n\nSo, if I understand correctly, my inefficient 45\u00C2\u00B0 burn that got the right trajectory was compensated for by low altitude and high escape velocity. While we were using the 0.13.3 demo, this was a nice way to do a quick Mun shot.\n\nNowadays, it\\\u0027s better and easier to time warp on the ground until Mun is in the right spot, then do a proper launch to TMI, burning prograde the whole way."}]}
