So that\u0027s probably going to happen after the bottom (career mode) gets fleshed out. Also we could use new high-tech endgame propulsion before anything beyond Jool/Eeloo gets added, or at least stock mining/refueling. It takes over 3 orange tanks to get 3 kerbals to Laythe and back, with gratuitous use of aerobraking and of course LV-Ns. Then again having really borderline impossible targets that the average player can at best get a flyby of would be kind of cool due to the realism factor. I mean honestly, only one spacecraft has ever gotten close to Uranus and Neptune and no human spacecraft has ever orbited those planets (would be cool if we saw an orbiter probe sent to one of those in our lifetime though).

Why will it be pointless? Well you will have a gas giant sized planet, with a gas giant sized gravity and extremely thick atmosphere, most likely much more so than Eve. Many long time players already know the challenge of getting around and off of Eve. Now imagine Eve infinitely worse though, a trap where nothing you land there will be able to get only a few meters off the ground at best, G\u0027s would be so extreme that it would kill Kerbals if you did manage to make a craft that could potentially escape (when G effects are added anyways). Then there would be the gravity issues, your craft will break extremely easily due to the extreme gravity, if a Kerbal fell over would they even be able to stand back up for that matter? Also it\u0027s distance would make it that much less favorable for some players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds like a cold Venus.
