I\u0027ve recently installed it with news of 1.0.5 coming and have been thoroughly enjoying myself again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve started a new career and so far have got to orbit, orbited the Mun and have done some contracts to send satellites into certain orbits for practice. Although I use MechJeb (mainly just for DeltaV calculations) I haven\u0027t unlocked the later stages where it does all the hard work for you, so I\u0027m still on manual flying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI must say the progression is now a bit better in career. I feel a bit happier doing things in an iterative process, step by step. This feels rather natural at the moment, and hopefully in 1.0.5 the contextual contracts will improve on this even more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t think I\u0027d come back to KSP for a long time, so good work to Squad for keeping it up with the updates!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-21T13:43:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome back \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xendelaar","CreatedById":139535,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-22T07:26:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know how you feel. After a couple of 100 hours (perhaps 1000 h) playing ksp, I lost interest too. I started playing somithing else and didn\u0027t think i could get sucked in again. After a couple of months of playing other games i got bored and fired up ksp for the hell of it.

I\u0027m fairly rookie at it. I\u0027ve played for a goodly number of hours but haven\u0027t managed to make it beyond Kerbin and it\u0027s moons, not even with probes. Even in Sandbox before Science mode, my focus actually never went beyond; after the un-Kerbal-ed missions and then landings I set about a station to refuel in LKO. At that point I didn\u0027t get the hang of docking, or even rendesvous. Then other games I suppose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Science and now Career mode it\u0027s more \u0022interesting\u0022, there\u0027s obviously that level of progression, at least in the parts which affect what you can do to a degree.
