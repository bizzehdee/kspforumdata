This graph was circular like a slide rule, but had lines drawn out from the center, with regular tick marks for values on them. The version the youtuber I\u0027m trying to find was using was intended to be written on, and was used to easily estimate the delta v necessary for things like inclination changes. I\u0027m also fairly sure the graph tool thingy was named after someone, and not just a generic name like circular slide rule.\n\n I wish I could remember it better, but then again if I could, I probably wouldn\u0027t be hunting for the video ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nEDIT:\n\nI FOUND IT!!!\n\nIt\u0027s called a Maneuvering Board, and the Youtuber is PurpleTargets.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZswG3PUGAOU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-05T09:08:04Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2015 09:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JDCollie**"}]}
