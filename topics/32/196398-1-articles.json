I hope your having a nice day but I\u0027m wondering if you guys and gals can deactivate my account please so I can start a new one. There is nothing wrong with this account and it\u0027s just because this account is rather old. Since you can not change usernames more than twice sort of leaves my username looking rather goofy. If the mods of these forums can contact me by mail and or here would be appreciated. Thanks for the help if any.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Entropian","CreatedById":205453,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-19T14:09:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot a mod, but account deletion was discussed here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed1811362410\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/192131-where-is-the-delete-account-function/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:170px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-19T21:26:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe moderators do not have the access required to delete accounts.
