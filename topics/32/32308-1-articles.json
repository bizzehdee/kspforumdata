It\u0027s often impossible to time warp because the vehicle is apparently in motion. When in flight often this oscillation sometimes becomes uncontrollable and results in self disintegration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDamping - two issues. Firstly related to above in the sense that the physics seems to get \u0027over excited\u0027 with larger vehicles. Secondly, the (A).S.A.S system seems to lack a dead zone, or needs more delicate control when close to target. If RCS is enabled practically any vehicle no matter big or small will turn to the designated target and then spam the RCS system left/right up/down continually, draining all of the propellant. I use MechJeb these days but it\u0027s the same problem with that addon too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny suggestions to solve these issues? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"joppiesaus","CreatedById":57698,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T15:40:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t this thread made for the \u0022How to\u0022 section?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jokurr","CreatedById":57496,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T15:46:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdd more struts.
