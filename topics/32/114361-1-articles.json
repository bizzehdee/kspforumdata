Both of these didn\u0027t used to be a problem, but since 0.90.0 they have become a major limiting factor in what I can do in KSP. I like complex designs, not necessarily big things, but things with lots of detail and now I can\u0027t build craft that are over 300 parts without the game becoming a slide show (in the past I regularly built things of 400-500 parts and still had reasonable FPS). The stutter issues means I can\u0027t have a complex space program, I\u0027ve had to abandon my current career (40\u002B in flight craft \u0026 40\u002B debris) because with that many in-flight craft the stuttering makes it unplayable. \n\nI have other frustrations and things I wished the game had, but largely they are minor (certainly not worthy of hate). [see my recent blog post for details](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/3530-Kat-s-Notes-on-1-0-x).\n\nI really don\u0027t mind things like OP describes, that\u0027s just part of pre-flight checks.

Then after the fairing separates, the decoupler goes off, releasing the craft away from the fairing. Putting the decoupler under the base just separates the fairing from what\u0027s under it, and not your payload.
