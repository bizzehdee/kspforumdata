With that in mind I spent last night designing a self-landing rover (Using \u0022Quantum Struts\u0022 as \u0022laser alignment\u0022 for placing the parts in VAB...nifty!!! haha). It is probe driven, but I\u0027d like to build a \u0022modular\u0022 version that is able to seat a couple a couple of Kerbals. What do you guys/girls use for \u0022seats\u0022 in rovers? Is there any \u0022go to\u0022 \u0027pod\u0027 solution being used for rovers?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ROFLCopter64bit","CreatedById":58314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T08:49:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELander can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd those \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehuge\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E rover wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alephzorg","CreatedById":2383,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T08:53:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBobcat\u0027s DEMV EX3 (the motorcycle) has a great seat you can use for rovers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T10:07:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m testing out an class of new probe rover now, basically its an small fuel tank with wheels.
