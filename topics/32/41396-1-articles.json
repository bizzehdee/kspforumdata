I am really looking for words here, but it appears I cant really stand the sound of the engines anymore. That surprised me myself a little - but it was an interesting thougt: Does it actually matter -how- the engines sound when firing? Would that really impact that much on our experience with the game?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, looking at myself now - apparently so. Now Im curious what you people think. Has anyone else had these thougts? Or is it even the other way around and you actually enjoy the white noise the engines produce when firing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking back I remember a similar case. Ive always been enjoying space-games and so I, of course, enjoyed a good bit of Freelancer online, too. During the countlyess Tradingruns I mostly relied on Liberty- and Bretonian Vehicles but at one point the circumstances forced my to fly a Kusari-vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow - for everyone not familiar with Freelancer (Which should not be too many, here, really \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ) - Every one of the five Houses has its own type of Engine with its own set of visual effects and sounds. The Rheinlanders used some kind of plasma, Liberty had their fancy magnet-something-technology and Kusari relied on some kind of atomic drive which sounded somewhat like two metal-surfaces brushing softly on each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there I was, crossing a vast and empty space in some far-off system, when it suddenly jumped on me that I enjoyed the sound of my Thrusters. They had something meditational on them and made the whole, tedious trip less tedious. I ended up flying that brick longer than I had to, knowingly sacrificing some cargospace compared to similar bretonian Vessels, before finally switching back to my Trader-guilds line of ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, last but not least, I presume the sounds are probably anyways still subject to change sometime in the future, but what do you think about sound in general.

However, I think we shouldn\u0027t need a plugin!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith KSP 0.20\u002B, the GameData system lets you just tell the game to use the same model over again, instead of loading it twice. This ends up saving a lot of loading time and RAM whenever textures and/or models are shared. My question is this: Why can\u0027t you just call out a custom sound on a part the same way you can call out a model and/or texture for a part?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an example of calling out a model using the 0.20\u002B GameData system:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay you want to use the model of the Rockomax Jumbo-64 fuel tank, but you don\u0027t want to have the game load the same model and texture twice. Here\u0027s how you would do that in the part.cfg of your custom part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EMODEL\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E    model = Squad/Parts/FuelTank/fuelTank3-2/model\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, it doesn\u0027t make a bit of difference if the part.cfg is not in the same folder as far as the game is concerned. As long as that part.cfg is located somewhere in \u0022KSP_win/GameData\u0022 the game will find the right files and your custom part will end up looking like a Rockomax Jumbo-64 fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if it\u0027s possible to do that with the 3d models and textures, doing something similar should be easy without using a plugin, right? Apparently not. I have a feeling it was \u0022meant\u0022 to work that way, but the fact of the matter is that it does NOT work that way, like many of the other features of the GameData system (config nodes, stuff like that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line? It wasn\u0027t hard to get custom sounds working before. Unless there\u0027s data that I\u0027m unaware of, it shouldn\u0027t be IMPOSSIBLE to get custom sounds working now, even if the way the game loads assets changed significantly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not trying to make it seem like I think SQUAD screwed up the update or anything like that. (0.20.2 plays much smoother than previous versions did, so they did SOMETHING right)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, seeing how easy it was to mod KSP before, and how much support the devs are give to the mod makers, it seems like this issue should at least get considered, instead of getting unintentionally \u0022swept under the rug\u0022 so to speak.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DChurchill","CreatedById":60282,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T19:32:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t mind the sounds per se but I do have a couple of nits to pick.
