This is why we have so many treadmill threads created by people who want to create some form of consensus with others who share similar opinions in order to validate that bias. People will always disagree with each other over something, and it will always be distorted and polarized to the point of absurdity (from a deconstructionist\u0027s point of view anyways).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of KSP, players sometimes set their expectations a little too high and forget that the devs have a \u0022flavour to taste\u0022 attitude towards their own game. I mean it\u0027s not like Squad is made up of scientists... they\u0027re programmers who superficially educate themselves on a subject so that when you play the game it behaves in a (hopefully) analogous and consistent (if unrealistic) fashion. They also have to make hard decisions that prioritize game performance and player accessibility, while keeping the framework open so people can add more realism in the areas that they feel need to be more realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut for some players it simply isn\u0027t enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider aerodynamics: it is a high priority for some players because they spend a large portion of the playtime in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, or focus primarily on lofting payloads. For those who spend most of their time messing around on Duna or the Mun, aerodynamics isn\u0027t relevant because it only affects the first 5 minutes of their game experience, which results in these players typically wanting the devs to spend less time messing around with Kerbin-oriented stuff and focus on off-world stuff. And then there are those who are afraid that changes to fundamental aspects of the game will ruin everything in some fashion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach position has valid points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately these \u0022discussions\u0022 usually devolve into conflicts as the participants eventually overinvest in the argument and convince themselves that they are influencing the devs to prioritize whatever particular bias is being pushed (one way or the other) when the reality is that the devs mostly insulate themselves from these discussions and make their decisions based on a combination of their own judgement - which has been honed through trial and error - and budget restrictions (not just monetary).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we do influence things... but only a little, and with great effort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, that\u0027s just my insight into the issue.

Once you start to lose control of the rocket, there is no saving it. I would compare it to frustrations with perma-death in other games (Revert flight is not the same as having a chance to salvage the flight.) Extreme punishments are rarely considered fun in games by all but a small percentage. You see reentry as an issue, I see it as not punishing new players by destroying their craft the first time they finally make orbit. I\u0027ve played with DE. After almost 500 hours of it, I stopped using it because it became tedious and easily overcome. Once the initial \u0022thrill\u0022 wore off, it lost all fun. That being said, I do think some form should be in stock that at least forces me to point my craft the right way. Aerobraking works now (if you know how to do it.) I don\u0027t see these as major issues from an overall gameplay perspective. Yes the current aerodynamics model is a placeholder and will be getting some needed love to fix the drag model. But at the end of the day, changing these things will not make an astronomical difference in what this game is about, unless they go overboard with the realism and turn it into a realism simulator. Then they will alienate a huge portion of gamers that just love the lighthearted game for what it is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Levelord","CreatedById":57711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-19T01:57:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scoundrel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Scoundrel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E-snip-\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExactly my sentiment.

It\u0027s been repeated over and over again, but the realism crowd unrealistically (how ironic) expect the unity engine to work miracles. Either way, the ion engine was balanced in such a way that at the end of the burn you would have the \u003Cem\u003Eexact same delta V as the original\u003C/em\u003E, just that the burn times have been reduced to simulate a time warp.
