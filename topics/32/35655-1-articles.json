I just spent the past 3 days designing, launching, landing, and connecting 3 separate modules meant to establish a base on the Mun, using Extraplanetary Launchpads and Kethane. By the time I got the 3rd module in range of the 2 that were already on the Mun waiting, my framerate dropped so hard, I could barely navigate the terrain with the rover. After finally getting it to its destination, I connected all 3 modules together, and VOILA! I finally have a fully functioning fully self-sustaining Shipyard on the Mun. This is a huge moment of triumph for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now, EVERY single time I try to load this base up from the tracking center, the game lags so hard and the framerates are so low, that it can\u0027t properly render the base with the terrain, and after waiting for 20 seconds for the game to finish loading everything, the entire base just randomly explodes and flies everywhere. I\u0027ve tried everything, cranking every single setting down and up, nothing helps. My base is just gone now, because that quicksave can\u0027t be loaded. The same sharp drop in framerate occurs with my Space Station as well, but for now, it has yet to start randomly exploding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is so freaking irritating because I have a very solid computer that should be entirely capable of running this game on max settings with 60\u002B framerates.
