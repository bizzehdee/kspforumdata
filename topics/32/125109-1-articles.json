I have been watching many KSP streamers and have learned so much. It is very refreshing to know that those that play/stream the game are willing to help and share so much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the resent update and the silent patch. Can someone tell me, what files I need to copy from a vanilla installation [via steam] to a modded scenario?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ask this, as about 4 weeks ago, I decided to do something that I know has been done before, but it would be a milestone for me. My task, was to setup an outpost/base/town on Duna that would become self sustaining. This \u0027task\u0027 has been done with some mods and I have been monitoring the forums for the mods that I used to be updated. [thank you all for the quick updates and responses]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only task now, is to do some regression type testing to see how the updated modes and the 1.0.5 [silent] update play together, but since I am unclear with the files involved, I don\u0027t know where to start, after the silent update. Is it just the .exe or are there a couple of files/folders that should be copied over to the modded career?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethank you all,\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T19:01:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first thing is that you don\u0027t do anything until \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E the mods that you use have been updated to be compatible with 1.0.5. Assume all KSP updates will break mods, just for the purposes of safety (previously this wasn\u0027t the case, and we could assume that something like 1.0.4 -\u0026gt; 1.0.5 wouldn\u0027t break mods, but they\u0027ve been reluctant to increase the 2nd version number for awhile). So leave all your mods behind for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECopy over your save file by copying the save folder from your modded install into the new vanilla install.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, go and download new versions of the mods that you had, if \u003Cem\u003Eand only if\u003C/em\u003E they are marked as compatible with 1.0.5. Any that aren\u0027t may not work, and you\u0027re better off waiting than diving in and hoping things don\u0027t break and corrupt your save.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gamerscircle","CreatedById":151261,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T19:34:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes! Exactly what I did and with the exception of just a couple of mods [non-part mods] I was almost there, then the silent update came across and this is why I was curious which files were impacted, as it would be so much easier if I could copy over a just the squad impacted file. [thinking is was just the .exe perhaps?] and that way. I can remove the mods [again the non-part mods that haven\u0027t gotten the updates yet] and do some testing to see the state of my Duna career. However, I suppose I can just wait for the next update to file through and copy over the vanilla again.. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
