Except for aerobrake from **upper** parts of the atmosphere. \n\nYou should gradually lower your speed while coming too fast. Let\u0027s say you come to eve from kerbin with periapsis speed of 4km/s. You should do an aerobrake in the upper parts of the atmosphere to kill you speed as much as possible without going too low and blowing up. But you will (probably) still need engine powered retrograde burn to capture to highly elliptical orbit (because you can\u0027t dip low enough to atmosphere to lose enough speed without blowing up) with ap at the edge of eves SOI and pe in the upper atmosphere of eve. After that you can gradually aerobrake from upper atmosphere each orbit to lower your apoapsis until you are at low eve orbit and then you are ready to do your final re-entry at reasonable speed ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T10:08:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You have a method.
