I need a \u0022new\u0022 vessel. The thing is, I just spent like four days building a giant ship in orbit piece by piece. It was designed to be able to take me just about anywhere I want to go and return to be refueled and used again. Needed it to be fairly large because I\u0027m playing with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS and have a modded solar system that\u0027s a good deal larger than stock.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy question is this: Can I dock a simple pod or w/e to my transfer vehicle and take that to the places I need to go to complete the contract, or will the process of docking it make it no longer count as a \u0022new\u0022 vehicle? I don\u0027t particularly want to make an entirely new ship to take to all these places, particularly as I was planning a shakedown cruise to the moons anyway and my first long voyage is planned for the third destination in the contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-22T07:38:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDocking combines two vehicles into one, and that means that one set of everything that\u0027s duplicate data - such as for example the mission elapsed timer - gets thrown out. That means that anything you dock to your old vessel will inherit that old vessel\u0027s data instead of keeping its own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could potentially still use your large mothership by editing the savefile and manually setting it to be younger than the date you accepted the contract on.
