If there is no atmosphere, than planes are out anyway.\n\nIf you\u0027re going to a small moon, you might be able to push/pull/carry more cargo due to lower gravity. If it\u0027s a high gravity moon, you may need to pack more fuel and less cargo per trip to maintain adequate TWR.\n\nSome people might want to launch an interplanetary resupply ship in one launch, others may need to dock several pieces together.\n\nUltimately, I keep a list of all strategies and design techniques and brainstorm which one(s) are appropriate based on my mission and destination."},{"CreatedByName":"Avetho","CreatedById":144683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T22:19:42Z","Content":"I would\u0027ve suggested the same principle as Raptor9.
