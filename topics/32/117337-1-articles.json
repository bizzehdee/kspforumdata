Get the Field Experience mod, which lets Kerbals level up without returning to KSC. That way, a rookie sent to straight to Laythe will have 4 stars upon arrival (once he plants a flag there)."},{"CreatedByName":"-RanZ-","CreatedById":51892,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T20:13:51Z","Content":"are they all 5 star right away?
