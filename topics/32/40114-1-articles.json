I\u0027ve been using the Fustek expansion parts for my other bases but these are rather heavy and have a tendency to fall into a million pieces when they see a rock and since most of the islands are rather hilly the skycrane will probably drop the base in a incline which will probably lead to a rather interesting rescue mission. This is my current design that likes to fall apart (even with heavy struts from... kosmo maybe?), funny thing is though that when i dropped that on duna with some sturdy imobile legs everything held, even when i accidentaly forgot to release the stackseparator when the skycrane flew away, it hit the ground at 5-6 m/s (although then i had fuselage sections between each segment, but when i tried that with those big standard wheels they flew apart as well). I want to build something that still looks like a base not just another rover if you catch my drift, it should be able to move but not win any races or turn on a dime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Um0szWz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Um0szWz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kromey","CreatedById":57375,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T20:02:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck out the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24775-0-19-1-MOLAB-Heavy-Manned-Munar-Rover\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMOLAB\u003C/a\u003E. It\u0027s not a base per se, but it\u0027s certainly big enough that it could be one, or could inspire a version that is. I think my favorite feature is the little \u0022mosquito\u0022 mini-rovers it sports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me, a \u0022base\u0022 has to be quite stable, and while it might work in KSP wheels don\u0027t, in my mind, satisfy that. If-- No no, \u003Cem\u003Ewhen\u003C/em\u003E I build a mobile base of my own, a key feature -- nay, a \u003Cem\u003Erequirement\u003C/em\u003E to earn that moniker -- will be landing legs that can extend to take the weight off of the wheels, and then retract to allow the wheels to re-engage and move to another location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also design it with the idea that the base would be more-or-less parked for extended periods, while exploration continues using smaller rovers and such; that\u0027s why I really like MOLAB\u0027s \u0022mosquitoes\u0022, but really anything that can be carried by the base while it travels, but then deploy for independent short- and medium-range exploration while the base is in \u0022base mode\u0022, is good for that. Really, anything big enough to be a \u0022base\u0022 is going to almost certainly be slow, and be unable to handle rough terrain, but exploration shouldn\u0027t be limited to only the smooth routes the base can handle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as your design goes, I might scrap the perpendicular hab modules (I\u0027m assuming that\u0027s what those are?) and instead make it a \u0022double-wide\u0022, i.e. put two (or three) hab modules end-to-end, then a duplicate of that structure alongside it. Strut that sucker up, affix wheels to the outside surfaces, and voila! (Think of a pair of soda cans glued side-by-side to each other, with wheels attached so that the whole thing rolls along with the cans parallel to the surface and pointed in the direction of travel.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, try something like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/37774-Build-as-big-a-MOBILE-planetary-base-as-possible?p=480358\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post480358\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kidneythump","CreatedById":62038,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T20:20:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the reply! Yea I really like the idea of fold out landing legs that deploy for longer stays at a location and landing, those modules that stick out perpendicular arent actually the problem at the moment since EVERYTHING looses cohesion at the first small sharp bump it encounters. What i really need is a new framework to hang my wheels of that has similar functionality as the Fustek expansions. Double cans might be an idea, but i need to do that in the VAB right? for some reason the fustek parts cant radially attach anything when building in the VAB.. Oh and another requirement is a part count preferably under 80 so it doesn\u0027t stutter to much when i turn on all the light\u0027s but that\u0027s a soft target at the moment\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boffinbox","CreatedById":64687,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T20:27:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei\u0027ll leave this here\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5yl0tgd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225yl0tgd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efirst screenshot i did\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kidneythump","CreatedById":62038,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T20:28:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI did some more testing, I put the big wheels on the fuselage section instead (the ones i removed from the original design, they connect the base modules together) worked like a charm until i hit a bump, then the back module fell of, all wheels where fine so what i need is new habsections that have a higher impact tolerance than 10 that still look like you could live in it for quite some time\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kidneythump","CreatedById":62038,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T20:29:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewow that\u0027s a nice design Boffin, haha how the heck does that stay together on uneven terrain? it\u0027s all docking rings right?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kromey","CreatedById":57375,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T20:30:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know of any reason why you couldn\u0027t build the double-can structure in the SPH.
