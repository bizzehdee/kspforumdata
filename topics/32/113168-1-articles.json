I expect Sony is paying them to do this.\n\n*Maxmaps* \n\nThey aren\u0027t! I\u0027ve tweeted about bad practices in console gaming but we would never jump into something like this if we didn\u0027t believe in the platform. Sony have cleared any doubts or worries we may have had about it, and have treated us well. Plus, it works really, really well on the DualShock 4.\n\n*brunothemad* \n\n This has potential to greatly expand the audience, which I think is awesome.
