The next thing i know, I\u0027m on a trajectory that takes me into a Kerbol orbit relatively close to Eve\u0027s. So I mess around with I for awhile, wait about an hour for Eve to catch up (there really needs to be another notch on the time warp), make an insertion burn, and eventually drop the capsule on the surface. Protip: if you\u0027re just putting a capsule and a chute on Eve, don\u0027t trigger the chute until you\u0027re under 1000 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAttached: Original craft, munar lander stage in Eve orbit, and capsule on Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luxmaster-CZ","CreatedById":21176,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-22T12:14:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehow do you make such a big ship to orbit without wobling it out?
