They don\u0027t want too much realism neither, I mean, even Orbiter doesn\u0027t simulate those. Maybe as a mod if you really want to but not as stock. Although yeah, those would be really small due to the mass of the planets being lower.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Olvirm","CreatedById":67444,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T05:28:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EElements of randomness when it comes to malfunctions is terrible.
