The problem, it appears, is timing. I simply cannot sit through a 10-15 minute burn where nothing else is going on, particularly when Kerbal seconds don\u0027t correspond to Earth seconds due to performance, leading to me not being able to go and do something else for however long it takes.\n\nSimple question: How do I get to Jool without any burn lasting longer than five minutes? It\u0027s sandbox, so no money/mass/whatever restrictions apply. I don\u0027t even mind about not getting back to Kerbin as I usually send unkerballed probes."},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T20:53:28Z","Content":"Unless I\u0027m using LVNs or ions, none of my burns are longer than about 2 minutes, even for Jool transfers. I would recommend using Poodles or Rhinos for the interplanetary stage, with a TWR of around 0.5.

If you don\u0027t already have something like it, mods like Kerbal Engineer and MechJeb will show you some inportant info, like delta V (basically how much you can propel your ship) and TWR (basically how quickly you can move said ship). The higher your TWR, the shorter your burns.\n\nAnother option (which I don\u0027t recommend unless your ship is 100% structurally sound) is to make use of physics warp, up to 4x. This will make your ship more likely to flex and bend while accelerating, but if your ship is stable enough, you can withstand these forces, and consequently have 1/4 as long of a burn time. Definitely quicksave and test it carefully before doing anything you can\u0027t undo.\n\nGood luck!"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T20:55:49Z","Content":"More thrust.

To do this, use KER/MechJeb, and don\u0027t be afraid to build big.\n\nStart with your payload, and put it in a 3.75m fairing. Put a large fuel tank (a single large 3.75m tank is appropriate if you\u0027re going to use it for a transfer) and a Rhino.\n\nPlace a decoupler and 3 of the large 3.75 tanks with a mammoth on the bottom. Add boosters (the 2.5m LF boosters \u002B fuel tanks work well) so that the 1st stage can get off the ground (TWR of around 1.2 at sea level) and the core has a TWR of about 1 once the boosters run out (0.9 is fine as well).

If you are not willing to burn for say 10 mins minimum to do a jool ejection, i reccomend you use the LFO powered KR-2L or the Poodle or the LV-909. Those 3 are efficvient as you can get for a LFO engine, and can provide great TWR when powering a ship designed for them. Myself i like teh KR-2L best though, as its so bloody powerful, a single one can push a 500t fuel barge to jool without going itno unbeareable long burn times.
