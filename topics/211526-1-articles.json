I downloaded some mods from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E and they all worked perfectly, just recently when I tried to download some Near Future mods, the joint reinforcement mod and a couple others(can\u0027t remember). Tried to start KSP again and it would crash at \u0022Module Manager: Running post patch callbacks\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI deleted the mods I downloaded and still same problem when I tried to open up KSP. I saved my GameData folder and my user saves, did a clean reinstall, but now it crashes right when I open it up and it gives me this crash report attached below.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope someone can help me, really trying to play KSP again \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/h95r4g0lh7hh7od/KSP-2023-01-15-180653.ips.zip?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/h95r4g0lh7hh7od/KSP-2023-01-15-180653.ips.zip?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
