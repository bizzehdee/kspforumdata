You can configure every aspect for each game executable. It defaults at recommended settings, but you can go through the list yourself. The other thing the program does is it keeps your memory clean.

As you can see, on those \u0022100 programs\u0022, 28 of them are windows services that 8 counts in. No programs yet and I busted your 14 because windows 8 none sense. Then there\u0027s the task manager running. Most of them are update programs or necessary services i.e. apple Bonjour. Could I prevent them from booting? Totally, but I prefer it that way. My computer can handle it without any problem as far as I\u0027m concerned. By the way, it did close 13 programs, but I just needed them and I rebooted them.
