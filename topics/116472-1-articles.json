But there is one thing that i haven\u0027t quite figured out yet; how do i achieve an orbit with a min PE of 50km at launch? I can burn it up to 70 km afterwards, its fine. But most of my missions goes with spending 2 of my 3 stages just for getting into a circular/eliptical orbit around kerbin. \n\nMy latest mission was ike landing and returning. But i have done it pretty luckily i suppose, because on my way back, when i manuevered for kerbin and made my PE around 20km, i had only 6 litres of fuel left. Even tho i have used 10000x time acceleration for 1.5 years to have lowest deltaV during kerbin escape(using mechjeb). So i wouldn\u0027t call it an efficient run.\n\nMy most efficient rocket contains 3 main stages with the following build up;\n\n-Stage 3: 3x LFB KR twin boar.\n\n-Stage 2: 4x LV-45. 720lt tank for middle engine, 3x360lt for symmetry engines with pipes going from side tanks to middle tank.\n\n-Stage 1: Rockomax 720lt tank with terrier engine.\n\n![0DC25B3775B649F31DEB4F9EFD965E43819F89CA](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/633104757440137130/0DC25B3775B649F31DEB4F9EFD965E43819F89CA/)\n\nThis is what my rocket looks like.\n\nThe following things happen according to my launch types,\n\n1. If i tilt my rocket too much to get circular orbit earlier, it mostly ends up not being able to lift the vehicle.\n\n2. If i tilt it medium, i will have an AP of 100km when the 3rd stage runs out of fuel, then i burn around %90 of my second stage tanks to make my orbit circular. Then i will have a little boost with 3 side Lv-45\u0027s for my escape, then after dumping side engines, i will have 1 middle Lv-45 with a full tank thanks to fuel pipes. \n\n3. If i dont bother tilting it and let it accelerate, i will have an AP of 140-150km, but will have to spend all my second stage fuel to make it circular.\n\nSo option 2 was the best choice for me. But it still doesn\u0027t feel so efficient. Because one single Lv-45 burns for atleast 3 minutes for a proper escape. Which is pretty much the capacity of the tank.\n\nI\u0027m sorry if i wrote it complicated. Will make it much more clear when i upload pictures. I would appreciate any help i can get. I don\u0027t know how Scott Manley can manage things with such small rockets. Maybe it is a matter of practice.

In pre v1.0 versions it was better to not use nose cones. The V1.0 update greatly changed the aerodynamics so that bosters now perform better with nosecones (in most cases).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 2.

Drag is the reason why your apoapsis gets lower. You would have to test which altitude suits you best.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 3. \u0022you could try, if a poodle instead of the LV-T45 in the centerstack behaves better.\u0022 other than this, is my build and selection of engines good?\n\nYou went to Ike and back ... can\u0027t be too bad ;-)\n\nI have the impression that the twin boars are too overpowered for the launch: a TWR \u003E 2 is more than needed.\n\nAlso have a look at the LV-N for the upper stages. It has the best vacuum fuel efficiency (but low thrust and high heat generation).\n\nFor making statements about the engine selection, I highly recommend to have a look at the [Optimal Engine Charts](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127691) thread."},{"CreatedByName":"Termonikov","CreatedById":148437,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T19:35:21Z","Content":"Thanks alot my friend\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T13:15:12Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 01:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Termonikov**"}]}
