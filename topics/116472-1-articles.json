But there is one thing that i haven\u0027t quite figured out yet; how do i achieve an orbit with a min PE of 50km at launch? I can burn it up to 70 km afterwards, its fine. But most of my missions goes with spending 2 of my 3 stages just for getting into a circular/eliptical orbit around kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy latest mission was ike landing and returning. But i have done it pretty luckily i suppose, because on my way back, when i manuevered for kerbin and made my PE around 20km, i had only 6 litres of fuel left. Even tho i have used 10000x time acceleration for 1.5 years to have lowest deltaV during kerbin escape(using mechjeb). So i wouldn\u0027t call it an efficient run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy most efficient rocket contains 3 main stages with the following build up;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Stage 3: 3x LFB KR twin boar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Stage 2: 4x LV-45. 720lt tank for middle engine, 3x360lt for symmetry engines with pipes going from side tanks to middle tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Stage 1: Rockomax 720lt tank with terrier engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/633104757440137130/0DC25B3775B649F31DEB4F9EFD965E43819F89CA/\u0022 alt=\u00220DC25B3775B649F31DEB4F9EFD965E43819F89CA\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what my rocket looks like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe following things happen according to my launch types,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. If i tilt my rocket too much to get circular orbit earlier, it mostly ends up not being able to lift the vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If i tilt it medium, i will have an AP of 100km when the 3rd stage runs out of fuel, then i burn around %90 of my second stage tanks to make my orbit circular. Then i will have a little boost with 3 side Lv-45\u0027s for my escape, then after dumping side engines, i will have 1 middle Lv-45 with a full tank thanks to fuel pipes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. If i dont bother tilting it and let it accelerate, i will have an AP of 140-150km, but will have to spend all my second stage fuel to make it circular.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo option 2 was the best choice for me. But it still doesn\u0027t feel so efficient. Because one single Lv-45 burns for atleast 3 minutes for a proper escape. Which is pretty much the capacity of the tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry if i wrote it complicated. Will make it much more clear when i upload pictures. I would appreciate any help i can get. I don\u0027t know how Scott Manley can manage things with such small rockets. Maybe it is a matter of practice.
