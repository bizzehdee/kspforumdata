But I\u0027ve noticed recently that whenever I try to open Steam, the computer mulls\u00A0the command\u00A0for a while, and promptly forgets about\u00A0opening\u00A0Steam. So one evening, I had some time on my hands and decided to try and troubleshoot this odd issue - and it has me downright stumped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI first monitored\u00A0Steam through the task manager, which confirmed my previous assumptions - the Steam.exe application gets running, idles for around 10-20 seconds, and vanishes from the processes tab. I try to open it\u00A0as an administrator, no\u00A0luck. I check on Avast t\u00A0o see if it is blocking it in some way, set up some exclusions, and nothing. Try to restart the computer to see if that helps - nope.\u00A0So at this point, I decide to reinstall it, which is where my journey goes very sour. I uninstall it - even though half of the files are still there, including the Steam.exe! - and try to reinstall. The installation wizard thinks for a second and says \u0027Close Steam to continue installation\u0027. Weird \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E. so I look in the task manager, processes tab says nothing, but in the details tab a little ways over, lo and behold, there is the Steam.exe and some SteamWebHelper program happily chugging along. So I try to end the process - \u0022Access is denied\u0022 - WHAT! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E. Now I am truly confused because there is no discernible way to shut down Steam, because it isn\u0027t open at a glance, but \u003Cstrong\u003Eit is \u003C/strong\u003Eticking over under the hood. So I\u0027m left with a half cobbled Steam, with no way to shut it down or repair it, and I can\u0027t use it or any games on it\u00A0at all (Thank GOD I don\u0027t use KSP on Steam, could you imagine!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving scratched my\u00A0head for a little while, I decided to\u00A0call for help from some of the smartest people I know - you guys.
