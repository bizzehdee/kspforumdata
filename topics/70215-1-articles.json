For example for assemble of first stage you should connect: round oxidiser tank (1), round fuel tank (2), additional small tanks (3,4), internal support structure (5), internal fuel pipes (6), internal oxidiser pipes (7), shroud (8,9), external pipes (9), engines attachment ring (10), ring support structure (11), bottom shield (12), external big aero shrouds (13), bottom skirt (14), aero rudder lattice (15), additional small deco devices (16), interstage (17).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we have 17 items only for first stage. some of it requires symmetry. So, real amount of items will be more (get about 30-40 parts). And do not forget about 30 engines. Final result - about 75 parts only for first stage.

You might want to combine \u003Cem\u003Esome \u003C/em\u003Eparts, but in general, it\u0027s good to have modularity. For example, internal stuff is hardly going to be seen in flight, so you can leave some polies out of it and combine it into a single part. On the other hand, external fuel line covers should be separate, since they\u0027re different on each N1. Fuel/oxidizer main tanks should probably be combined, and the small decorations might be better off integrated in the parts they\u0027re attached to. On the other hand, the heat shield needs to be separate, since the first N1 didn\u0027t include it, and it\u0027s a valid design to go without it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-23T09:17:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EModularity really only makes sense if there is a purpose to assembling the parts in another way.

Got half a mind to try one of those random failure mods to go along with it. That.. plus more parts makes for a funner explosion.

Stuff such as fuel lines should be a part of the 1st stage structure, but their covers could be removed to allow different variants to be installed. In general, each separate part should have a clean purpose. Structural tidbits don\u0027t have this, neither do the fuel lines.

I think you could probably lower it to about 40 parts, assuming you want all of the engines separate, if you could deal with a few separate ones and a large clustered engine piece then that would lower the partcount even more, possibly to ~20, depending on how many parts you want to compress into one.
