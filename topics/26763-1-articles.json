At one point my nearest approach to Duna was about 625 km and to fix this I used mechjeb (Hohmann transfer command) and that created an encounter but it only required 4.4 dV and pinpoint accuracy. With so little room for error how does anyone manage to go to other planets manually when you need to be super precise?

Yeah. But it\u0027s not overly difficult. What I do is get out of kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence then you can just create a maneuver node and fiddle with it until you get it close. It can be really fiddly because a fraction of a meter per second can be the difference between a close pass and totally missing. Then after you\u0027ve finished thrusting for that one do another manuever node about halfway there to tweak your course. Usually should be enough to get right where you want to go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joe_Bender","CreatedById":60838,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T01:10:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find that playing while drinking too much beer tends to lessen the chances of a successful trans-orbital flight by a factor of ten.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stealth2668","CreatedById":57377,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T01:41:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tried setting up a manual node without using mechjeb but I just couldn\u0027t get an encounter.

The trick is once you think the planet is in the right place, set up your burn initially where you align your escape trajectory with kerbin\u0027s orbit and burn until you hit the target planet\u0027s orbit. Once you see the closest approach you can either wait until the intercept aligns, if you are early, which will save delta v. If you are late you will have to expend more delta v burning past the optimal path to shift your apoapsis or periapsis to an intercept. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for corrections the earlier you are the less delta V you need to make corrections, however, this also means it is difficult to make an optimal trajectory and fine tune the results. You can either use RCS or wait until later in the orbit where it is less sensitive to fine tune your approach. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso another trick if you don\u0027t want to memorize and eyeball the phase angels at all is to burn until you are slightly outside or inside the target plant\u0027s orbit(Whichever uses less delta V) and circularize it. From there you wait until your spacecraft is at the same angle relative to kerbol as the planet is. Once there just burn either prograde or retrograde(Depending on whether you are inside or outside the orbit respectively) until you get an intercept with the planet. This method is a surefire way to get you to another planet regardless of your planetary alignment however it does use more delta v and it also usually takes a LONG time. This is the method I used to get to eve before we had maneuver nodes, since I couldn\u0027t get an intercept even with protractor.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Exal","CreatedById":57986,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T02:40:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not to hard if u just think about what a certain type of thrust does firmest make sure ur planes are the same then go prograde to reach the targets orbit then fiddle with moving the while node and prograde and retro grade till I get an encounter then use the blue use to fine tune ( don\u0027t know the name for them) that should get u at least a decent encounter\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T03:35:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd remember: you can drag open node circle along the trajectory by holding left mouse button.
