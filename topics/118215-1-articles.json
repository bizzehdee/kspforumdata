You can click that to cycle through what your velocity is relative toward. In the case of rendezvous and docking, once you have navigated a good intercept point (less than two kilometers is best) you can click that velocity indicator until it says \u0022Target\u0022, which is your velocity relative to the target you are trying to rendezvous with. This also changes your prograde and retrograde vectors to be relative to the target as well. Once you are at or near the point of closest approach, you can burn toward your retrograde vector until the relative velocity is nearly zero. Then you should be drifting fairly close to your target, without need of major adjustments. Point your nose directly at the target, give it a little acceleration, and watch it approach. **Take it slow** here, there is no incentive to rush and every incentive not to; overshooting is bad, collision is worse. Point retrograde and kill the velocity when you feel you are close enough, usually about fifty meters.\n\nOnce floating next to your rendezvous target, right-click the docking port on your ship, select \u0022Control from Here\u0022. That will make the the navball consider that the \u0022front\u0022 of your ship. Right-click on the docking port you wish to connect with on the other object, and select \u0022Set as Target\u0022. That will set that specific object on the other ship as your rendezvous target. Now your navball should be ready for an accurate docking. Activate your RCS, and use the translation keys while in normal staging mode to line yourself up (I prefer to avoid docking mode entirely but your experience may vary.) The translation keys are I, K, J, L for up, down, left, and right respectively, and H and N for forward and backward respectively. You want to get it so the target vector is right in the center of your navball, and your prograde vector is right in the center of the target vector. If the other ship supports this, switch to it instead, and have it rotate to face its docking port toward your ship, that will make this simpler. If not, you will have to translate your ship around the other to line your ports up. In either case, once the ports are pointing at one another and the velocity is zero, use the forward translation on your RCS to nudge yourself toward the target, then use the lateral translation keys to trim the prograde vector until it lines up with the target vector. \n\nAfter that, the ships should coast together. You will know you did it right when the docking ports start pulling the ships together with magnetic forces. At the moment this starts, disable your SAS. The SAS will want to \u0022correct\u0022 for the unexpected force, and that might overpower the magnets. You need to disable it to let them do their job. Once the ships \u0022combine\u0022 and get treated as one ship instead of two, docking is complete. Congratulations.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-15T20:33:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2015 08:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fearless Son**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T19:11:50Z","Content":"One more tip.

Indeed - now when I dock, I\u0027m mostly doing it from inide the cockpit using the prop MFD displays from RasterProp Monitor - this isn\u0027t to make it more difficult, but because a) there\u0027s a very useful docking camera in it, and ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) it\u0027s a -lot- less distracting not being able to see what\u0027s going on. \n\nWhen you\u0027re docking, what you -really- need to know is a) are you pointing in the right direction ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) how fast are you going compared to the target c) what\u0027s changing and how fast is it changing.\n\n If your instruments can answer these questions, then you\u0027re better off watcing them than looking out of the window.\n\nWemb"},{"CreatedByName":"Auriga_Nexus","CreatedById":149320,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T22:36:22Z","Content":"Couple of things I\u0027ve done to help with docking. Firstly, if you have a control stick/joystick, you can set it up to be able to rotate and translate simultaneously without switching modes or using the IJKL keys. I have my Logitech 3D Pro set up so that stick movement controls my rotation axis and moving the hat switch controls my X (L/R) and Y (U/D) translation thrust. For forward/backward RCS thrust I have two buttons on either side of the hat switch that handle that.\n\nSecondly, you can dock even without looking at the outside of your ship, if you know how to use the MFD\u0027s in the cockpit. Basically if you click on the buttons above and below the MFD screens in IVA view you can get different displays that will tell you about your ship, orbit, etc. First you want to be on the target select screen which is top row third from the left. You can use this to select your target docking port as well as your reference port. Then you click the button on the far right of the top row to pull up the docking indicator. There\u0027s an orange circle that indicates your rotational alignment, put that dead center and you should be facing the direction of the docking port. (If you see an orange arrow rotate in the arrow\u0027s direction until you see the circle). Once you\u0027ve done that, use your X and Y translation to line yourself up. There are two green lines, a crosshair, and a prograde/retrograde indicator. The P/R indicator shows your translative velocity, the crosshair is your docking port, and the green lines are the target docking port. You want to move up/down and left/right until both the green lines and the P/R indicator are dead center. (If your P/R indicator is off center the lines will move in the opposite direction. The further your indicator is from center, the faster the lines will move. Use this to help guide your movements.)\n\nOnce you have the orange circle, the prograde/retrograde indicator, and the green lines all centered on the crosshair, you are lined up and ready to dock. At this point just move forward or back until you touch. The crosshair display also shows the distance and relative velocity between the two docking ports. Just before you make contact you want your relative velocity to be 0.1 or less, this will ensure you dock properly and you don\u0027t bounce off the other port. \n\nIf you learn how to use the cockpit MFD\u0027s you can line up and dock without even seeing what you are docking to. Whenever I add modules to the KISS (Kerbin International Space Station), I typically use a 2.5 m docking port on the back of my vehicle, and a command pod with ILX thrusters on the other side of the module to be added. Once I dock the module I use a stack separator to disconnect the command module (which leaves a second docking port open for the next module) and head back planetside. Thus, when I am docking I am typically facing away from my target and backing in, which makes the MFD\u0027s in the cockpit very useful."},{"CreatedByName":"Wemb","CreatedById":121979,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T23:01:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Secondly, you can dock even without looking at the outside of your ship, if you know how to use the MFD\u0027s in the cockpit.
