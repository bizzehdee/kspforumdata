I just just can\u0027t manage the thrust/mass in a right way. Don\u0027t get me wrong, symetric lander cans from the VAB are not the problem. I am talking about such ships like from the old sci-fi series \u0022Moonbase Alpha\u0022. I know there are crafts out there to use but i want to creatoe my own ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there something in the stock game that helps with that?

Otherwise the craft does not have the capability to counteract the torque reaction from the thrust being so far off the CoM. As per capi3101\u0027s suggestion, RCS Build Aid is a very helpful tool. It will tell you how much torque will be applied, and in which direction. From that you can see how many reaction wheels you\u0027ll need just to fight that torque...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DavidBowman","CreatedById":111419,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T21:38:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor mods, you should definitely try \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107802-Throttle-Controlled-Avionics-2-2-0-0-90-Continued\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThrottle Controlled Avionics\u003C/a\u003E.
