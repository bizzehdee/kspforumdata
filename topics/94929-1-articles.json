Even if I manually try to activate them at that altitude they wont actually deploy until the craft goes lower (I\u0027m assuming this has something to do with atmospheric pressure). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then how is it possible to complete the contract if the chute simply wont open before that altitude?

If you are required to perform a test with both altitude and speed ranges (and the altitude allows it), I recommend obtaining the parts and fuel to build a jet plane. I find it easier to to reach midpoints in the required ranges with greater control from the use of a jet plane. This works with survey missions too. I also include science parts, which are justified by science gains. Landing the plane at the KSC afterwards allows for a decent recovery compensation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those who are better at taking off than they are at landing, planes can be fitted with chutes and brought down safely, so that funds recovery to some degree is still an option.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Perttijarla","CreatedById":190184,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-03T10:18:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 Greetings from a beginner, this is my first post.
