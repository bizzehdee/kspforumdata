I really wanted a VTOL but after much frustration, I settled on STOL instead, which is MUCH simpler, safer, and almost the same thing when taken to extremes like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Y3R8Hz9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Y3R8Hz9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 1st prototype passing a mountain that looks surprisingly like Mt.

Add drop tanks and external seats and it needs 30m/s and about 1.5 of its own length. But it has the power to go straight up immediately after leaving the ground to whatever height desired. So not technically VTOL but damn close \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. It also lands at 20m/s and, because I put the brakes on an action group and set them before landing, it comes to a full stop in about its own length. The hard part is making it stop flying, which is why it\u0027s got lots of airbrakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith it\u0027s extremely low stall speed, wide-track landing gear, and tailwheels under the wingtips and tail, it can get in and out of just about any place you can imagine. Uneven terrain is no problem.

I like to cruise on 1/3 throttle, which gives me about 300-350m/s between 10km-12km altitude. Put on 2x or 3x time warp and you can really cover ground this way with very good fuel economy. However, at full power I have gotten it up to 850m/s at about 15km, which is about all it\u0027s got air intakes for. But this doesn\u0027t get anywhere near the fuel range I get at my cruising altitude and speed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve taken this plane to the North Pole and back to KSC on just internal fuel and still had 1/4 tank when I got home, so the drop tanks aren\u0027t really necessary. Still, they work nice as bombs so I keep them on there \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManeuverability is OK, not great, but this wasn\u0027t designed to be a fighterplane. Flight is very stable although it tends to fly slightly nose-up and with the nose a hair left of center, so to keep it going in a straight line you also need just a hair of right bank on it. The reason for the nose being a bit left is because the plane is a bit asymmetric. The canards are in the way of the cockpit ladder so I had to make a curved ladder to go around. This created so much drag that the plane pulled to the right, so I slapped a radial air scoop on the left side as balance. This worked almost perfectly, except for the slight angle to the left now, which is entirely tolerable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gc7BVeU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gc7BVeU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe external seats were an afterthought. After I\u0027d gotten the plane itself squared away and had flown it over most of Kerbin, a long-distance rover wrecked in the mountains west of KSC. Rather than just Recover or Revert the mess, I decided to see if I could rescue the Kerbals with my plane. So I slapped 4 seats on the belly and got them out of the deep canyon they\u0027d wrecked in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/r1nOgAM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022r1nOgAM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s how the plane got to be named KERdog.
