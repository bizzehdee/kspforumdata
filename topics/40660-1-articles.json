So you had better like them! (just Kidding) We are a hopefully talented mod group consisting of only 2 KSP Players, Speedy Blue 98 (the one that does all the meshes and modelling etc) and DAL1189 the one who does most of the back end work(checking the configs etc) and beta tests these pieces of fine machinery. We are relatively new to the moding scene and are hoping to make an impact with our first open beta release of fuel tanks. More things are in the works so keep an eye on this post!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Open beta pack includes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 Fueltank for the MK1-2 pod and one for the MK-1 Pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for checking out our pack.
