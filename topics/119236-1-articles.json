I\u0027m 33 years old, into motorcycles, Lego, movies, and I\u0027m addicted to KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShort-time lurker, first-time poster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been playing KSP for a few months, so I do know how to get into orbit and dock and encounter planets and stuff. And as of this month, finally got out of sandbox and started a career mode save file. I can\u0027t begin to tell you how much more involving the game now feels when you put some sort of reason behind your insane rocketry deathtraps! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I\u0027ve started to like doing is getting the mission complete with as little resource use and space junk as possible. Last week I did a contract that asked for a simple robotic satellite to get into a specific orbit around Kerbin. I used every ounce of rocket fuel in my little launch vehicle to get it *just* sub orbital, then used RCS thrusters to push the teeny-tiny spacecraft out to its target altitude. So much fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the best thing about this game is the blank canvas that KSP gives us to perform our own journeys of self discovery. It holds your hand only a little bit, the rest is up to you to research. And I don\u0027t mean game guides here, I mean real rocket science. And watching Scott Manley videos. Squad has done a great thing here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee you in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T04:07:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you the white ape from Barsoom? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T04:27:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello Rare White Ape, and welcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are obviously well on your way!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBarsoom - now there\u0027s a good reference.
