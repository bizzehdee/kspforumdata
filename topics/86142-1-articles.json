Trying to do these by hand has proven to be a complete disaster, and when I looked to MechJeb, specifically Smart A.S.S., I realized there\u0027s no way that I can see of accomplishing aligning the two. It doesn\u0027t seem to have any context that considers both your own orbital velocity as well as the target\u0027s position (yes there\u0027s RVEL, but RVEL\u002B aligns you with your \u003Cem\u003Ecurrent\u003C/em\u003E relative velocity and does not attempt to maximize it by aligning prograde with the target).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also tried a counter rotating orbit (same orbital params but going around the other way), but the rounding errors make this nearly impossible with the sort of precision I need. I\u0027d prefer some way to do this while under constant thrust--from lift off to eventual impact, or stopping just a second or so before impact. I also looked at some of the \u0022warfare\u0022 mods (namely BDArmory), but my concern here is I \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E most of the missiles in that also contain some sort of \u0022explosive\u0022 payload (like a fuel tank blowing up), and I want a pure kinetic impact. I know what you\u0027re saying, \u0022But if you crash your own rocket into it under thrust, you\u0027d have some fuel left in your tank too!\u0022 While this is true, I was hoping I could dump the fuel just before impact with TAC Fuel Balancer and avoid that problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what\u0027s the best way to go about something like this? Is there a mod I should be looking at, or is there some way to accomplish this with MechJeb that I\u0027ve overlooked?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-05T22:35:42Z\u0022 title=\u002210/05/2014 10:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Orum\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-05T15:45:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb does have a Target\u002B option which will align you towards the target, regardless of your actual velocity vector.

I usually find it easiest to get up to speed and roughly aligned on the main engines, then point the nose at the target and use RCS translation for fine tuning. It\u0027s just high-speed docking, and the techniques are the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe closer you get to the target, the bigger the angles involved, so unless you are 100% perfectly on target it will look like the target prograde marker is moving away from the target marker. The target isn\u0027t moving and your course is straight (ish, orbiting); the navball effect is just trigonometry. Translate or burn to push the markers back together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe later you apply corrective control inputs, the more vigorous they\u0027ll need to be.
