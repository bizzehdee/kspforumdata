For example I was just building an F-14 and realized once I got to the rotors that the rotor can only be set to rotate on a regular group. The only actions I can set to throttle (what I want it set to; to rotate on throttle up and return on throttle down) are RPM limit and torque limit. It seems like an amazingly simple task to\u00A0enable all or even just most of the part actions on both types of action groups. Can this be done, why hasn\u0027t it been done, or why can\u0027t it be done in the first place?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaveJohnson376","CreatedById":180382,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-28T12:55:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, this is already in game, both RPM and torque\u00A0controls what\u00A0motor will do in-flight. Torque limit will change maximum torque motor will apply to reach RPM limit, just assign them in axis groups and see how it all works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-28T15:13:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[...]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just noticed that the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

If you also want to \u0022flip a switch\u0022 when \u0022slider \u0026gt; 0\u0022 then you can do that with the new KAL-1000.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
