I once let it sit for a few hours while it was on that screen just\u00A0to be sure that it wasn\u0027t just loading slowly. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game several times, as well as using the steam service to \u0022validate integrity of game cache\u0022 a few times. I am unsure of what else I can try to do to fix this issue.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
