I\u0027m using MechJeb 2.5.7 and the MJ pork chop for a Eloo to Kerbin interplanetary transfer is showing zero intercept opportunity\u0027s, it\u0027s completely red and does not display a delta v amount for any point on the graph. First I thought it was because the planet needed to get to a better position, but idk that seems unlikely since every other planet had a working porkchop plot, and after a few years it still did not change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInterestingly, it will display a viable porkchop plot for every other planet. Kerbin is the only one showing a completely red \u0022--/-- Dv\u0022 plot\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m posting here because the operator for the MJ forum thread closed it because some people were posting the same question over again.
