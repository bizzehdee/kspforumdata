But how did I get here you may ask. Well it was a flight to eeloo we Tried to pass Jool to pick up some speed and save fuel and such but then out of two were the kraken appeared floating like a majestic squid it is anything but that it wrapped its tentacles around the ship and started squeezing the ship in till every thing was flying everywhere I will admit a screamed like a little kerbal. after the rest of the ship was ripped apart the kraken swallowed the mk 1 inline cockpit with me still inside. Let me tell you the inside of the kraken is actually not that if you can get past the gut lining and all the dead kerbals inside there crashed ships all lighted by the green radioactive fuel leaking from nuclear engines. so being a good Kerman I got out of my ship and floated (still in space) when the to the center of the kraken and planted a flag there. I can tell you first hand that the kraken does not like being stabbed by a flag in its stomach. it roared and flew really fast causing all the junk in it to flyers into the side of the kraken i was nearly crushed but I got into a mk 3 shuttle just before it hit the wall. Inside the shuttle were 3 dead kerbals. The kraken flew faster and faster. Suddenly in a jarring crash we stopped.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EI got out of the shuttle and noticed that there was very little gravity pulling me down. Since the kraken wasn\u0027t moving I assumed that is was dead so I carefully crawled out of its mouth beak thing and when I looked at the kraken I saw that it hit the ground that one day of its eyes fell out fell out of its socket. And that is how I found out the kraken is real I\u0027m sending this to the space program with the last of my electricity my coordinates are 68 25 48 N 116 24 E \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EPlease try to rescue me\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wabbit","CreatedById":110502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-03T20:46:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOoooooohhhhhhhhhhhh, so that\u0027s how it got there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
