Kerbin has been storming, with winds and gusts coming from all directions, sending rockets and aircraft whole miles off course with their power. Kerbals had never anticipated to see this kind of climate - cold, wet and stormy. Answers were demanded for why Kerbin has gone nuts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey, Wern, so what exactly do you plan to do? Kerbin\u0027s gone completely nuts on weather, and tons of designs are failing. We never anticipated this.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I don\u0027t know, Gene.\u0022 Wernher Von Kerman, the lead Research and Development rocketry scientist, was gazing out the window. The skies were gray and dark, raging with ever-strengthening howls of wind. Climate Change? Probably not. A new Kerbin season? ..Maybe. Kerbals were accustomed to gusts randomly blowing, but not at this rate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey, Barden. Call the R\u0026amp;D labs. We\u0027ll have a meeting.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWernher, with a stern look on his face and, with all seriousness, started to speak. \u0022All right, listen up! Kerbin seems to be storming, and we don\u0027t know why. It could be Climate Change or anything. Now, what I\u0027m thinking, is that we report this to the Weather Bureau. Maybe we can work something out.. send a probe to research this or something similar.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImmediately, a message was sent to the Kerbin Weather Bureau, and sent a handful of their smartest scientists and geologists to the Space Center to work on this joint experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Now, the storm has been deteriorating for days now, and is at an unusual scale. Now, maybe we can send a satellite or a plane to find what is happening at the center.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022At this rate, it seems to be a Tropical Cyclone. High wind speeds, extreme devastation. Happens rarely in Kerbin\u0027s oceans, but is still a threat.\u0022, muttered Seefrey, another experienced weather geologist looking at the statistics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole team looked at him in shock. This kind of storm? It\u0027s going to be chaos!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We don\u0027t know when the highest points will strike, but it\u0027s going to be most likely in a week. I recommend sending a site observation plane - it\u0027s the most effective way.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Alright, R\u0026amp;D, let\u0027s set to work! Contact passing stations and satellites, and gather all the data you can.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWernher stormed into Mission Control, where Gene and his crew were managing a Space Observatory in orbit. He went to Gene, and stated sternly; We\u0027re going to be hit in a week by a full-on Tropical Cyclone.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What do you plan on doing, then?!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I want you to send a plane into the eye of the storm. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Are you kidding? Conventional planes would rip apart at that rate!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Send some sort of bomber, then! I\u0027m not some sort of pessimistical creep!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~~~~~~~\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay three since storm\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA strong, rugged jetliner was sitting on the runway, with its four turbofans running.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Typhone 35, requesting takeoff clearance from Kilo Sierra Charlie, Runway Nine-r.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Typhone 35, Cleared for takeoff Runway nine. Maintain heading 135, fly to flight level 90.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn minutes, the big jet\u0027s four engines roared, growling in aggression as Jebediah, the most veteran pilot in the Space Center, opens the throttle. It speeds down the runway, and lifts off and away, fading into the dark clouds as it went by.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Typhone 35, visual contact with Storm eye, spinning at estimated 10 m/s tops.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Confirmed, Kilo Sierra. Take caution.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Final Storm Approach checklist: \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Autothrottle? Disabled. \u0022 \u0022Flaps? Set to two. \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aircraft was ready to approach the swirling storm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Spoilers! Armed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then, the aircraft was govered in grey clouds. It started to vibrate violently due to the extreme forces from the raging wind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bob, watch the descent rate. We\u0027re going in!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aggressive storms were howling, fiercely raging in anger. It seemed to have no mercy on the aircraft, which was laughably puny compared to the sheer size of the swirling cyclone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bill, you assist with the throttle. Don\u0027t let the aircraft go below 250 knots.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Kilo Sierra Charlie, aircraft is shaking. Please confirm when we start tracking storm.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Typhone 35, confirmed. Start tracking the storm\u0027s statistics.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Affirmative! Starting tracking process.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Radio Antenna?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Currently being deployed.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Autopilot?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Disengaged.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Alright, let\u0027s go fight this storm.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe storm tracking was what enabled them to know the information of the coming storm, such as signal number, and average speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack at KSC, Scientists and mathematicians were diagnosing the signals coming from the aircraft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Wait.. it says here that the wind was at least 10-20 knots! It practically means the storm\u0027s going to reach in three days at most!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Any words on signal?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Signal number.. five? What?! That\u0027s too extreme!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would\u0027ve meant certain devastation for anything in it\u0027s path, especially a small plane fighting it\u0027s way through.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey needed to get it back immediately, or it would be on the verge of tearing apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bill, slow down! We\u0027re exceeding speed limitations!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aircraft seemed to be as vigorous as ever, shaking with so much force.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Typhone 35! Turn around heading 270, Maintain speed 200 knots. Return to base.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Confirmed, Kilo Sierra Charlie. Flight level 120.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the aircraft was turning around still in the storm, a sudden bang seemed to hit the aircraft. At the same moment, Jeb noticed that an engine was losing power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Flameout in engine three!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Kilo Sierra, unable to maintain flight level 120. Requesting lower altitude. Single engine failure.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Confirmed, Typhone 35. Turn heading 180, divert to Insular Airfield.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Typhone 35.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jeb, what do you plan to do? We just lost an engine!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m going to fight this storm. If we die, we die as hardworking Kerbals who paved the way for the good of the Kerbal race.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Confirmed visual with airfield! Final Approach commencing.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Typhone 35, cleared to land at airfield runway. Contact 118.7. Good luck.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the distressed aircraft eased in towards the runway, a sudden Ground Proximity Warning sounded, indicating that the aircraft\u0027s descending too low, too fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Pull up, Jeb!!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aircraft bounced hard on the runway. Jeb was nearly injured.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Come on, come on!! Brakes!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aircraft was careening down the runway at aggressive speed. Bill was holding the throttle and keeping the brakes engaged. Bill was holding down the brakes, and Bob was watching speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Thirty knots.. twenty.. ten.. Full stop!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe three went silent for a short while after the extreme, merciless journey. Then, a sigh of relief cast across as they cheered in their success.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~~~~~~~~~~EPILOGUE, DAY 6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEveryone was ready. They had gone to a shelter to prepare for the worst. All of a sudden, the winds started to heighten frighteningly, swirling at extreme speeds. It was terrifyingly chaotic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHours passed and the winds started dying down. It was becoming brighter by the minute, until the Sun was visible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe worst was past. Everyone relievingly clapped and celebrated as they survived the worst.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is dedicated to the victims of storms and typhoons, especially in the Philippines, where many have lost their lives in tragedy. May they rest in peace.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
