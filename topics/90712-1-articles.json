I spent most of my class not listening to the teacher and instead learning how to program in the TI-BASIC language. I created three programs for it: Quadratic Formula, Linear Equations (Just for fun, didn\u0027t actually need it), and Delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my programming knowledge is not exactly... real. But I definitely want to make it real! But I\u0027ve spent 10 minutes trying to find a good tutorial for getting started with KSP modding, and I haven\u0027t found anything. Obviously part modding is easy, editing part.cfgs is not exactly programming. I desparately want to learn how to write plugins! After all, if I can write plugins for KSP, I might eventually even be able to move on to the next step: making a game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T15:47:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have recently made a foray into plugin writing, and have found it to be much harder than learning modeling/texturing.
