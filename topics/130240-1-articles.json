Added some stock Rockomax tanks as needed. \u00A0Main chutes are 2.5m Mk16 XLs plus 8 radial drogue ones. \u00A0The big radial decouplers with built-in sepratons are also from Space Y (those things are so cool and useful!). \u00A0And the heat shield is a Tweakscaled 5m one from Space Y (not sure if it mattered) up to 20m size--no problems with heat there!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMiddle stage as noted is a Mainsail on a Rockomax -32 tank\u00A0with 8 radial FL-T400 tanks. \u00A0Upper stage is a FL-T400 with 4 -200s and 4 1.25m Poodles (used Tweakscale), they have a mass of .377 and 45 kN of thrust. \u00A0Thought about using aerospikes but wanted something with thrust vectoring and lower mass. The upper stage has an RCS fuel tank from FTP and 4 quad thrusters. \u00A0And of course I put MechJeb on it, though I only used it to hold pro/retrograde, not to land or launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe landing struts are LT-2s upsized 300% mounted on 200% pocket I-beams. \u00A0Several 2.5m reaction wheels are in the ship, with main power from 4 200% size RTGs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure what was going on with the landing struts on the landing (broken? glitch?)\u00A0but the ship was stable and took off fine. \u00A0Went into a polar orbit since that was how it came in--wanted to land on, well, land and not in the sea. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStarted at relatively low altitude too, 654m ASL (heh,\u00A0the previous test\u00A0landed in the Highlands \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ). \u00A0Ended up with over 1150 m/s DV left\u00A0after the circularization burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first version of the lander included a top-docked rover, my latest \u0022mega mini\u0022 type, the plan being to transfer the scientist Kerbal from the ship to the rover after then pop off the rover before landing and have it drive back to the ship, visiting several biomes on the way\u00A0 That proved to be successful, so I stopped bothering to include it on later versions. \u00A0I might even change the plan to land the rover separately, or even several rovers...but that would require a 2 or 3-Kerbal\u00A0version of the ship...guess what will be next? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-19T07:51:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell done!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few\u00A0suggestions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUse a mk1 capsule rather than a lander can, it weighs a little more but has much less drag and that is more important.

Those parachutes and legs will weight (and drag!) you down on ascent, and you could use radial decouplers to put them in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-You can use a \u0022cruise stage\u0022 on the bottom to put the docking port, then ditch it just as you meet Eve\u0027s atmosphere. That way you can dock it to a transfer vehicle without taking any RCS down to the surface (or back up), and you can use a Sr. Docking port without screwing with the aerodynamics of your ascent vehicle. \u0022But no docking on ascent\u0022, I hear you say? Well, you are going to make orbit with a tiny expendable capsule, just park it close to the return vehicle and EVA the kerbal and the scientific data over. Or Klaw it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing all those tips, I have an engineering prototype to use when the time comes, but I am afraid it is completely untested.

Once things are merely supersonic, the plan is to pop the fairing, extend the airbrakes to go subsonic, pop chutes, and proceed to landing. When the time comes to go back home, you eject the chutes and ladder, use the heatshield and landing gear as a launchpad, and lift up on a very aerodynamic ultra-asparagus tiny ascent vehicle with almost 8km/s in the tanks and a more than respectable 1.78 TWR at liftoff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRune.

Given the thickness of the atmosphere, the trick to Eve ascent is a narrow, streamlined profile. Fairings are key. I did some tests and adding the\u00A0fairing shown below to the middle and upper stages increased first stage performance by over 30%. Also, wide and short vehicles easily become unstable and start tumbling in a thick atmosphere. I had to add a reaction wheel thingy to the middle stage of my vehicle\u00A0or it would easily tumble while staging (no gimbal on the Aerospike.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInterstage fairings are important if you have gaps. Basically anything that gets rid of gaps and sharp transitions along the stack will be worth the extra weight. Even using the slanted nose cones instead of the centered ones on the side boosters helps. On the mid stage, I used Oscar-B tanks for the side boosters in order to keep the cross-section narrow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote on fairings: The do add drag to the front, which makes your vehicle want to back flip.

My rudimentary testing shows that somewhere around 80-100k seems to be the max Q sweet spot for Eve launches. If you set max Q lower, you won\u0027t accelerate enough through the lower atmosphere and your second stage will be left without enough oomph to carry on.\u00A0You need to get your lower stage well up, at least to around 15-18km altitude, and don\u0027t turn before 15-18km, and keep the turn very gradual.
