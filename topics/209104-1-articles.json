Using it you can in-game destroy a single part. If you do that to one of the 2 docking ports, that will effectively decouple your probe from the ship. Of course, you\u0027ll lose the port on the ship or the probe (depending on which you destroy) so it may take some creative mission restructuring to get around it.
