Straight dive right into the ground from orbit and I just bounced on impact. \n\nThough I think its going to be cut anyway, the split up cockpit\u0027s RPM is non-functional.\n\nSome parts need some kind of indicator to show which way they need to be oriented to work properly. The body flap and the solid booster parachutes come to mind. (NOTE: as of writing this I may have just noticed there were indicators on the Booster parachutes)\n\nThe deployed state on the Left control surface is inverted compared to the right. Fixable in-game, though the default should deploy correctly with the other CS.\n\nThe tail CS also has an issue with how it maps to the Brakes action group by default. They\u0027ll both deploy, but once you release the breaks, one of the flaps won\u0027t collapse. This is because the group defaults to Toggle and Extend, rather than Toggle and Toggle. Again, fixable in-game but it\u0027ll be cleaner to have it default correctly.\n\nI\u0027m not sure if it was a mod conflict or not (I probably should do another install for testing), but I did have issues going on EVA using the cockpit door. One, it wouldn\u0027t switch me to the Kerbal. Two, once I boarded, the game almost seemed like it was stuck in Kerbal mode, which meant I had no access to my navball. Also didn\u0027t show any kerbal pictures. Had to go to the tracking center and back to revert it to normal.\n\nAnd finally just a noted on the aerodynamics, it flies really well and I really like its speed characteristics. Its become very easy to make either a smooth, slow landing or a fast and loose, balls to the wall landing. Only thing I really noticed that was off about it is that it seems like the orbiter doesn\u0027t seem to act as it should when you try heavy turns at high altitudes. It doesn\u0027t lose any control whatsoever when it reasonably should when my AoA extends all the way to retrograde. I think this might be due to the torque, that\u0027s likely pretty powerful. Not sure how you could deal with that without making the whole thing harder to use.\n\n-------\n\nNon bug related, but I also noticed some things that might help newer players fly it more easily right out of the box if they were made defaults. (IE, things I did to make the shuttle easy to control from launchpad to landing)\n\nThe biggest problem I had during launch was maintaining a steady ascent profile. The problem was because the control surfaces of the shuttle were active, they would make the entire stack hard to turn without it going way off prograde. So what I did was turn off all of the CS\u0027s controls so that they were non-functional during launch. What this did was make it so that only the rocket engines could control the stack, which made the entire ascent much more stable and easier to do. Went from having to fight it to keep on prograde to being as easy as any regular old rocket to control.\n\nWhile not necessary to make them defaults, I found the shuttle easiest to control if I limited the wing CS\u0027 to pitch only, and used the Tail CS for roll and yaw.\n\nIt would definitely be useful if possible to somehow enable these controls via action groups. (Should be noted that I don\u0027t know if the real shuttle ever actually used the control surfaces during ascent, so if its realistic to have them active, then idk)\n\nAnother thing I did was to set the SSME gimball speed to 40 each and the OMS\u0027 to 100. This made flight smoother throughout.\n\nI also want to say that its freaking AWESOME to have different pain jobs for the ET. Having that actually makes me want recreate all the shuttle missions now.\n\nAnother thing, what would it take to get some Shuttle clamps? Its so odd that no one\u0027s done them as of yet.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T22:59:19Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 10:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by G\u0027th**"},{"CreatedByName":"Drj3199","CreatedById":143663,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T23:13:23Z","Content":"realistic shuttle clamps would be awesome, but they might cause a problem because of the launch clamp bug."},{"CreatedByName":"Dnaha","CreatedById":137983,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T23:22:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E realistic shuttle clamps would be awesome, but they might cause a problem because of the launch clamp bug.\n\nThe launch clamp bug has only really messed up my launches once or twice, and that wasn\u0027t even with the shuttle.
