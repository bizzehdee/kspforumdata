The body flap and the solid booster parachutes come to mind. (NOTE: as of writing this I may have just noticed there were indicators on the Booster parachutes)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe deployed state on the Left control surface is inverted compared to the right. Fixable in-game, though the default should deploy correctly with the other CS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tail CS also has an issue with how it maps to the Brakes action group by default. They\u0027ll both deploy, but once you release the breaks, one of the flaps won\u0027t collapse. This is because the group defaults to Toggle and Extend, rather than Toggle and Toggle. Again, fixable in-game but it\u0027ll be cleaner to have it default correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if it was a mod conflict or not (I probably should do another install for testing), but I did have issues going on EVA using the cockpit door. One, it wouldn\u0027t switch me to the Kerbal. Two, once I boarded, the game almost seemed like it was stuck in Kerbal mode, which meant I had no access to my navball. Also didn\u0027t show any kerbal pictures. Had to go to the tracking center and back to revert it to normal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally just a noted on the aerodynamics, it flies really well and I really like its speed characteristics. Its become very easy to make either a smooth, slow landing or a fast and loose, balls to the wall landing. Only thing I really noticed that was off about it is that it seems like the orbiter doesn\u0027t seem to act as it should when you try heavy turns at high altitudes. It doesn\u0027t lose any control whatsoever when it reasonably should when my AoA extends all the way to retrograde. I think this might be due to the torque, that\u0027s likely pretty powerful. Not sure how you could deal with that without making the whole thing harder to use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENon bug related, but I also noticed some things that might help newer players fly it more easily right out of the box if they were made defaults. (IE, things I did to make the shuttle easy to control from launchpad to landing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest problem I had during launch was maintaining a steady ascent profile. The problem was because the control surfaces of the shuttle were active, they would make the entire stack hard to turn without it going way off prograde. So what I did was turn off all of the CS\u0027s controls so that they were non-functional during launch. What this did was make it so that only the rocket engines could control the stack, which made the entire ascent much more stable and easier to do. Went from having to fight it to keep on prograde to being as easy as any regular old rocket to control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile not necessary to make them defaults, I found the shuttle easiest to control if I limited the wing CS\u0027 to pitch only, and used the Tail CS for roll and yaw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would definitely be useful if possible to somehow enable these controls via action groups. (Should be noted that I don\u0027t know if the real shuttle ever actually used the control surfaces during ascent, so if its realistic to have them active, then idk)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I did was to set the SSME gimball speed to 40 each and the OMS\u0027 to 100. This made flight smoother throughout.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also want to say that its freaking AWESOME to have different pain jobs for the ET.
