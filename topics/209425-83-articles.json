Something like a 970 or even a 960 would be a major leap up from what you have, doubling or tripling framerates in games that aren\u0027t CPU-limited. For the processor there\u0027s less room for improvement - the latest i5\u0027s are faster but we\u0027re talking maybe 30% better kind of stuff, not a huge leap. So unless you know - by monitoring your system as you play - that your games are CPU-limited I don\u0027t think a regular Intel build now would be worthwhile.\u003Cp\u003EWaiting for Skylake in the autumn may be an option. There processors will be a bit faster and may look like a more worthwhile upgrade from the 2500k, but more to the point with DDR4 you can expect a maximum RAM of 64 rather than 32 gigabytes. If you\u0027re building for the next three or four years that may be a factor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA \u0022Haswell-E\u0022 build may be an option if you want a new system now. That would give you six cores which will really boost performance of things that can use them, but for things that can\u0027t (like KSP!) the single-threaded performance won\u0027t be much faster than what you have now. Again it uses DDR4 memory with a large RAM capacity. However Haswell-E stuff isn\u0027t cheap.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T00:02:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is some pretty sound in here already. Sadly, I have to agree with Cantab and the others - the 2500K is still a very capable chip and the newer Intels have only improved incrementally. That means spending a whole lot of money on just a small improvement, if any at all, because most games will run just as well. You might want to consider spending some money on a fast modern GPU and sitting the CPU upgrade out for a while. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you, for some reason really insist on upgrading \u003Cem\u003Eand you do not overclock\u003C/em\u003E, an i7 may, for once, make sense. Normally I would advice against an i7 for gaming purposes, since very few games have anything to gain from hyper-threading, but there is one difference now: the 4970K. That chip is quite a bit faster than even its non-overclocking brother. It is the pure speed difference that might make it an option. Again, this only makes sense if you do not overclock, otherwise going for an i7 generally is a waste of money better spent elsewhere. Unless you are really quite sure the CPU is the limiting factor at the moment, I would be reluctant to throw money at upgrading to a new one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CPU market has slowed down a lot since even 4 years ago, so your upgrade cycle makes less sense than it used to. The difference between a 1998 and 2002 computer was a world apart, while the difference between a 2011 computer and a modern one is a lot less profound.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hunting.Targ","CreatedById":141427,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T09:18:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, to replace a 7-year-old home office machine, I think I will just get an all-in-one and put some more memory into it.

Motherboards will most certainly be outdated after 5 years, to the point where upgrading within the capabilities of your old board generally costs more and is more trouble than just buying a new one. 10 years is most certainly a ridiculous amount of time to wait to upgrade pretty much any hardware. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince this is a mode of working I do not feel is advisable or efficient, I cannot give you any more advice, as I would have to recommend things I do not feel comfortable with and that I would not recommend to anyone else.
