The design principle is just somewhat different. Instead of slowly clawing your way out at more or less constant TWR you need to accelerate like a madman for a few second and gain a huge amount of speed, and then cruise at lower thrust. If you try to take of with a lower TWR you will waste an enormous amount of propellant fighting Eve\u0027s gravity with awful ISP. If you do it right you can go all the way from the bottom to the top with just 7.5 km/s of vacuum delta V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/PLkC3XhqT3c?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever if you think you can shave 3-4 km/s of delta V like you could before by roving a sleek little EAV up to the 7 km peak and take of from there you are .... out of luck. I even tried to design a roving rocket that was designed to be as aerodynamic as I could. It would drive on it\u0027s side and then erect itself once it reached the top, and had 5 km/s of vacuum delta V. However as the smaller parts have much more drag it didn\u0027t even manage to get out of the atmosphere :/\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T17:18:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 05:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by maccollo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowlord","CreatedById":141962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T18:26:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI hyperedited a RAPIER\u0026amp;nuke plane (by which I mean something like 12 rapiers and pre-coolers) above it in sandbox and dropped it through the atmosphere because I was feeling particularly silly one day.
