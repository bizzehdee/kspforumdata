Physically at least, maybe your PC burns up at a certain part count but apart from that its possible.\n\nGo Youtube and search for Venus RSS mission. Manned mission to Venus and Back (real size) with KW Rocketry parts and without RO-config-tweaking, just RSS.\n\nMaybe a ONE-LAUNCH mission might be difficult, but its certainly possible, especially with Orbit assembly.\n\nEDIT: If your aiming at the tweaked engine configs: Yes OLD craft who were able to do it wont do it anymore, but there are still very efficient Atmospheric Engines with high TWR . The 4-Cluster SLS springs to mind ( dont know the Nickname, only the Rhino). \n\nWith stock engines a Sea-Level Return might be difficult due to the high pressure on the engines, but a high level launch will be possible, I would bet on it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T16:36:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 04:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SkyRex94**"},{"CreatedByName":"maccollo","CreatedById":72759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T17:11:46Z","Content":"It\u0027s both easier and harder.\n\nEasier to return from the bottom because you can use larger parts with less drag and just burn through the atmosphere at ludicrous speed. The design principle is just somewhat different. Instead of slowly clawing your way out at more or less constant TWR you need to accelerate like a madman for a few second and gain a huge amount of speed, and then cruise at lower thrust. If you try to take of with a lower TWR you will waste an enormous amount of propellant fighting Eve\u0027s gravity with awful ISP. If you do it right you can go all the way from the bottom to the top with just 7.5 km/s of vacuum delta V.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/PLkC3XhqT3c?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nHowever if you think you can shave 3-4 km/s of delta V like you could before by roving a sleek little EAV up to the 7 km peak and take of from there you are .... out of luck. I even tried to design a roving rocket that was designed to be as aerodynamic as I could. It would drive on it\u0027s side and then erect itself once it reached the top, and had 5 km/s of vacuum delta V. However as the smaller parts have much more drag it didn\u0027t even manage to get out of the atmosphere :/\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T17:18:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 05:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by maccollo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowlord","CreatedById":141962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T18:26:04Z","Content":"I hyperedited a RAPIER\u0026nuke plane (by which I mean something like 12 rapiers and pre-coolers) above it in sandbox and dropped it through the atmosphere because I was feeling particularly silly one day.

It broke into individual pieces when it hit the ground, but they stayed where they were.
