Take it from somebody who\u0027ve spent a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of time trying to build a multi-engine model rocket. Getting it to fly straight was a task I eventually gave up on. There is just too much variation in thrust profile from one motor to the next, even in the same batch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny home-built solid motor won\u0027t do any better. You have to build a hybrid with very sophisticated control system to even have a chance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo lets see. You need to understand how a hybrid motor operates, including the relationships between pressure, oxidizer flow rate, fuel burn rate, and thrust. All of these things mutually influence each other, and all you really get the control over is oxy flow. You don\u0027t have to worry about complex nozzle, so you\u0027re off the hook on fluid dynamics, but you still need to understand combustion, thermodynamics, and non-ideal gas laws at rocket science levels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, if you manage to not mess up the engineering part of it, we\u0027re next moving into building the control system. Throttling a real rocket is nothing like throttling one in KSP. The delay between change in valve position and thrust output is significant.\u00A0Meanwhile, you have multiple sensors with very noisy input. So we get into control theory and filters here. There are fairly standard solutions that ought to work here, like PID and Kalman Filters. But at a minimum, you need to know how to implement them on your hardware of choice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would recommend starting much, much simpler. If you want to build a self-landing rocket, try building one in KSP first. All of the parts necessary to build a Falcon-like booster core in KSP are stock. On top of it, install kOS mod and write a script from scratch that lands the rocket safely at predetermined location. Make sure it can do so even if you vary the initial payload and ascent trajectory. Once you have that done, you\u0027ll know that you can at least handle the control portion in near-realistic scenarios. You still need to adjust for delays and noise in the real rocket, but that\u0027s definitely a doable task if you understand how to make automated landing in KSP. If you get that far, you can start looking at what it\u0027d take in terms of an engine build.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
