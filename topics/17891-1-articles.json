I was on a space station, and there was a large room that you could jump around in. So ever since then, I have been researching the cost, and any other way to get to the International Space Station. Right now, for about a month stay, it costs about $50 million dollars. I don\u0027t have that money. So I am asking the developers, and people of several different forums and places, to help me. I am not asking for the money, I am asking for support from you guys, and I will, wear a patch if I get into space of larger companies, and will make make mentions of people who help me out the most. I know I said I am not asking for money, but I do need it. So if you would like to donate you can. Right now I don\u0027t have any place for you to send in money though, so please do not ask were to send it. That will come up soon. But I will let you guys know when I have a place set up. I know this is a hole ton of money and a very hard thing to do, but that has not shaken me, it has given me hope, because it is possible to do, and I plan on doing it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-26T22:18:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI also would like $50 million.
