It either wants ANOTHER mod, not mentioned as dependency or won\u0027t work at all.\n\n2) You assume that players use MechJeb control box part to achieve MJ functionality. That\u0027s a rare case. Most people use MM patches like \u0022MechJeb4All\u0022 to add MJ functionality to pods and probe cores. You probably should use that MM patch as @PART[\\*]:HAS[@MODULE[MechJebCore]]:FINAL.\n\n3) MJ Ascent guidance is too deep in tree. First ballistic rocket - german V-2 already had a primitive gyroscope-based \u0022ascent guidance\u0022 BEFORE transistors were invented, not speaking of microchips.\n\n4) MJ Maneuver planner is too shallow in tree. Calculating complicated maneuvers needs LOTS of computing power, early onboard electronics couldn\u0027t handle it.\n\n... there are more MJ-related notes... maybe, I should just propose more realistic MJ tier separation? \n\n[table]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]**Tier**[/td]\n\n [td]**draft name**[/td]\n\n [td]**Technology Used**[/td]\n\n [td]**MJ Submodules**[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]1[/td]\n\n [td]Basic automation[/td]\n\n [td]gyroscope, primitive analogous PID, timer, timed command sequencer[/td]\n\n [td]Ascent Guidance, Warp Helper[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]2[/td]\n\n [td]Orientation systems[/td]\n\n [td]better gyroscope, better analogous PID, acceleration sensors[/td]\n\n [td]SASS, Translatron[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]3[/td]\n\n [td]Advanced orientation systems[/td]\n\n [td]radiocompass, radioaltimeter, early digital PID[/td]\n\n [td]Landing Guidance, AttitudeAdjustment (changing PID settings in flight), Spaceplane Guidance^\\*^[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]4[/td]\n\n [td]Onboard Computers[/td]\n\n [td]self-explaining[/td]\n\n [td]Maneuver Planner^\\*\\*^, Rendezvous Planner, Rover Autopilot^\\*\\*\\*^[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]5[/td]\n\n [td]Precise Maneuvers[/td]\n\n [td]precise sensors and better computers[/td]\n\n [td]Rendezvous Autopilot, Docking Autopilot, RCSBalancer[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[/table]\n\n^\\*^: Spaceplane Guidance should be tier 5 because of complexity of task, but it works so bad (crashes when trying to auto-land and is used mostly as radiocompass for manual landing) that it is barely tier 3.\n\n^\\*\\*^: MechJeb doesn\u0027t allow to separate different maneuvers by submodules in current MJ version, so we assume that ANY onboard computer will be able to calculate them.
