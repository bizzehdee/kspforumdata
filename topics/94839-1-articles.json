The cockpit got stuck inside the cargo bay, and must have then touched the active claw inside, because Kerbin disappeared and the ship fell away from the camera. That is an unrelated known bug. KER started spamming a random number in the debug log, then the game crashed. On an unconnected note, I immediately opened google chrome to log on to the forums to post this, then it crashed (which it seems to do a lot when first being opened), then my computer did a blue screen crash for only about the second time since I upgraded to Windows 8.1\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-08T18:25:20Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2015 06:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheMoonRover\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espoiler tags\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Overland","CreatedById":119812,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T09:55:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edoes this include exploding runways? something I rather hate with god like proportions..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhy should a runway explode?.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethere I was marshalling my fuel wagons into a long 10 car train with 2 locos on the front.. when the final coupling manuver to couple up the last car to the train caused half of the train to jump.. less than 2cm i\u0027d say off the runway and land back harmlessly.. this was over 4000 units of fuel by this time with modified wheels that are twice as heavy as stock..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewith that slight bounce.. the runway exploded.. taking both locomotives and 3/4 of the train with it.. all that survived was the lead locomotives cab.. with a smiley jeb at the throttle with bill and bob in dire distress.. as much as I was at this point\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edoes this ever happen to anyone with aircraft by the way? or are my trains simply too heavy? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehas anyone ever had the runway explode on landing?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T18:03:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYesterday I was bringing an SSTO back to KSC and encountered this bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBackstory on the flight: flew SSTO-style up to LKO, where I rendezvous\u0027d with my orbital fuel station.
