I was reading the book \u0027The Apollo Guidance Computer\u0027 and the authors talked a bit about attitude control. There were two interesting points: (1) in space, the control is simpler because there\\\u0027s no air drag. And (2), the control algorithm requires a \u0027deadband\u0027 or \u0027deadzone\u0027 within which the RCS thrusters are turned off. Without the deadband, you have the thrusters continually firing back-and-forth, using up fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve attached two diagrams from the book. One is generic, the other one shows how the attitude control is separated into \u0027decision areas.\u0027 The vertical axis is the rate error (degrees per second) and the horizontal axis is the angular error (degrees). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the Apollo crafts, you could choose two accuracy modes. Fine grained gave a deadband of 0.5 degrees, and coarse grained had a deadband of 5 degrees. The latter number seems quite large, but hey, if it worked for Apollo, it should be OK for KSP!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majiir","CreatedById":7550,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-03T00:39:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESee \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=10326\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis thread I made on the topic\u003C/a\u003E. A lot of that stuff is out of date, and a lot of it is also just plain \u003Cem\u003Ebad\u003C/em\u003E information. I abandoned it when I realized KSP\\\u0027s requirements are just so different from anything a real-world spacecraft deals with. In some ways, it\\\u0027s easier\u00E2\u20AC\u201Dfor example, there\\\u0027s no instrument error to deal with. We always know exactly how fast the ship is going and exactly where it is. Great! Then again, it\\\u0027s difficult because you aren\\\u0027t designing a specialized controller for a single spaceship\u00E2\u20AC\u201Dyou\\\u0027re building something for any arbitrary configuration of parts. It\\\u0027s not harder or easier by any obvious degree; it\\\u0027s just \u003Cem\u003Edifferent\u003C/em\u003E, and thus requires some dedicated analysis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I ever get back into plugin coding, I\\\u0027ll probably work on a unified control system for engines, SAS, RCS and control surfaces, and then see how that might play into control software.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fowlplaychiken","CreatedById":30748,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-02T14:50:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice, if it puts an end to asas-enduced occilation. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"antiquark","CreatedById":25542,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-02T15:02:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022fowlplaychiken\u0022 data-cite=\u0022fowlplaychiken\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice, if it puts an end to asas-enduced occilation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would for sure. The current ASAS modules rely on PID equations for control. However PIDs are generic and have to be fine-tuned for every situation.
