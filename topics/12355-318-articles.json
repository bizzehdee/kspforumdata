You need to build symmetrically, make use of the throttle limiters, use an automated fuel pumping mod like TAC Fuel Balancer or Goodspeed.\u003Cp\u003EThere is a mod for separately throttling groups of engines but AFAIK MechJeb will only control one group.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the reply. I had kind of realised MechJeb didn\u0027t have that functionality at the moment, I was just wondering whether it was in the pipeline for development. Autopilot and autothrottle tend to go hand in hand afterall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with building symmetrically, is that multi-stage shuttles are fundamentally asymmetrical. This was more of a technical exercise to see if I could design a classic NASA style shuttle. I had been trying to use the throttle limiters to balance the CoM and CoT but encountered two problems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Eyeballing the collinearity is inaccurate and pretty difficult and tedious. Plus, the starting point for each stage needs to be ascertained seperately, and changed midflight which is nigh on impossible, without some kind of automation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The CoM constantly changes as the fuel is used, and therefore the CoT must be varied in real-time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jacke\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jacke\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t think something like that is in MechJeb (although I\u0027m not fully versed on all the many extra functions in MechJeb).

That has helped stability no end. I\u0027m still running into trouble it high altitude, but I think I might be able to control that with a well timed manual throttle limitation! Begs the question why the base program doesn\u0027t do this already. Surely keeping you pointing where you want to go is the whole point in thrust vectoring? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Surefoot","CreatedById":89084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T17:55:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you look at Goodspeed fuel pump and similar mods ?
