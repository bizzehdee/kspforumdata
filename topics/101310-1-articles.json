This last time I recorded a video because i was hopeful and turns out it was for a good reason. I\u0027ve left myself with fuel in orbit!\n\nDoes anyone mind watching the video and letting me know if you think i have enough fuel for a munar orbit and back to kerbin ?

Mun is on an equatorial path around Kerbin, and you\u0027ve got a lot of polar velocity you need to remove (think of it as having to undo about 1000m/s going north and add 1000m/s going east).\n\nFrom an equatorial orbit, you\u0027ll need about 850 to reach Mun\u0027s SOI, and 250 to circularise around it. ~300 would get you back from there, leaving a grand total of about 1400 required. But I think with that inclination, you\u0027d be talking double that, perhaps more.\n\nFor future missions, try to stay as much in the plane as possible to help minimise your fuel requirements ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) (Also your rocket really is overkill for a Mun orbit, if you don\u0027t get knocked off course.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T20:28:46Z","Content":"All those SRBs give your rocket a massive amount of torque and you SAS can\u0027t handle that and that\u0027s why you can\u0027t get a decent orbit heading to the east. With a TWR of more than 5 you also lose most of the delta v from the SRBs to drag. Try to aim for something around 1.5 or 2."},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T21:55:50Z","Content":"Tweak down the thrust of the SRBs in the VAB and you won\u0027t be fighting drag as much. You should also be starting your turn much earlier as you were only at 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 by about 63km instead of 12km. By 40km you should be pretty horizontal. Once in low orbit you\u0027ll need just under 900m/s to get to the Mun\u0027s orbit and another 270m/s to capture followed by another 270m/s to return to an aerocapture at Kerbin. With that ship you\u0027ll definitely be able to do a flyby and with better piloting you might be able to get it into Mun orbit and back but you\u0027ll beed a bit more if you want to try for a landing.."},{"CreatedByName":"Mallock","CreatedById":107548,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T22:00:38Z","Content":"Holy boosters.\n\nYou ended up with more than enough delta-v to make it to the Mun and back ... if your orbit wasn\u0027t so inclined. I can\u0027t build a demo rocket to serve as an visual aid right now, but dial back those boosters to only 4 in your first stage. For the rest of the rocket use liquid engines and the starter engine (whatever it\u0027s number is). Give yourself 4500 delta-v in the VAB according to mechjeb. Note that your first couple of stages you should use the \u0022atmosphere\u0022 delta-v values from MJ and your last one will use the \u0022vacuum\u0022 values. Don\u0027t just total up the vacuum amounts. When you launch go straight up to about 10k meters and then start tipping over slowly to a heading of 90 deg (due east). \n\nYou\u0027re also wasting delta-v by circularizing too early. Don\u0027t start burning horizontal right away when you leave the atmosphere (70k), wait until you\u0027re closer to your apoapsis. With an early rocket like this and assuming a TWR of 1.2-2 you can start burning when you\u0027re only 5-10 seconds away from your apoapsis. That will leave your orbit nice and circular at 100k instead of elliptical from 100k-160k like the video shows. After all that you\u0027ll need an additional 1400 delta-v as eddie says just to orbit the Mun and return. Minmus would just be another 100 delta-v if I remember right, but it brings extra challenges since it\u0027s inclined."},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T22:25:54Z","Content":"Do you want an equatorial orbit? You don\u0027t need one. Try an encounter first, and an inclination change once you\u0027re in orbit.

Best to aim for an Apollo-style free-return trajectory and settle for a fly-by rather than orbit, I\u0027d say.\n\nFor future missions:\n\nMuch less low-altitude thrust - the white atmospheric effects show you\u0027re going way too fast (any faster and they\u0027d become red plasma effects, as in re-entry).\n\nLose the SRB second stage - they might be cheap but they\u0027re heavy and uncontrollable so only use for a first stage, if at all.\n\nStart and finish your gravity turn much earlier - be flat by the time you\u0027ve got an apoapsis around 60km, using more thrust to get the horizontal speed you need for orbit.\n\nRead any tutorial on how to get to orbit - \u0027Induction To Construction\u0027 has the standard newbie-rules in Chapter 6, although it is intended as a guide to the screens and controls rather than flight.\n\nLook in the drawing board (link also in my signature) for tutorials that *are* intended to teach how to orbit, and orbital manoeuvres.\n\nOn the other hand ... there\u0027s no wrong way to have fun.

Slow down a bit. If you ever see visible speed lines while ascending, it means you are WAY over speed.\n\nto do this:\n\nDrop the thrust on those SRBs. You need less than half the thrust.\n\nWith less thrust on your launch, you will actually achieve a better resulting speed by the time your first stage burns out.\n\nThe reduced thrust will also allow your stability controls to keep a better grip on the launch.

Less thrust and an earlier turn will get you far better results. \n\nAs far as the Mun, a free return mission carrying a couple of goos and a materials lab can be a boatload of science, particularly if you add EVA and crew reports, it\u0027s great for kick starting a career. I never quite hit the pure free return trajectory but my last one required only 2 very short correction burns.
