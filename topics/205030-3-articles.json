Remember, as I have pointed out, and others, too, I have no insider information. I do have a lot of experience as a gamer and can tell you what I have seen other studios do, both the good and bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do not think micro-transactions to buy a ten-part pack would work with the KSP2 community.

If done right, it would not take away from the KSP experience, but provide a well-rounded game and one that could be customized by the player for the \u0022perfect\u0022 experience without having to resort to a ton of mods to do it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDLCs do not have to be bank-breaking either. Civ VI messed up in this area, as did Paradox Studios. I paid as much for the DLCs as I did the core game.

Instead of it being something that seamlessly added to the experience of the game, it seems to make the game more clunky.

Yes, this because I wasn\u0027t able to install it probably due to lack of interest. For some missions, yes, i really think it could be great use an autopilot, but let me introduce my perspective as aviation enthusiast. I played a lot of time on Xplane and Microsoft Flight Simulator, I\u0027m also a virtual Air Traffic Controller inside some flight simulation networks which has allowed me to meet real pilots and other aviation enthusiast and learn a lot of things about real procedures of real aviation. When I think how they are made the real planes, their autopilots are basically developed with the purpose to reduce the work of the pilots, not to substitute them. Space flight are basically something of different. In the entire space history, only few times it was required a manual control of the flight. The most notorius event was certainly Apollo 11, but also during our days, when is required to change the docking port for some spacecraft on ISS, this procedure it could be done manually. No one has guided manually the rocket in real life during the ascend phase.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt could be a good idea if a standard autopilot could be done for control the ascend phase and allow to your spaceflight a initial temporary Low Kerbin Orbit, expecially for optimizing the deltav requirements for the ascend phase and avoid any potential waste of fuel burning, but when I think to the other maneuvers, is nice try to done the change of trajectories manually. So it could be nice an autopilot, but I hope that for the players will be done a system which for some missions, Autopilot will be not allowed for the entire mission or for some phases. After all is nice take the control!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4)Life Support.

After all KSP1 was developed without a multiplayer, a thing which seems incredible that today a game could be nice without this feature. For KSP2, multiplayer will be THE CHALLENGE from my perspective. A collaborative mode between 2 players, 1 pilot, and the other playing the Mission Control Center, is definetely much easy, but a competitive mod between 2 or more players seems something much more complicated. It could be nice make a carrer mod between different space agencies with their differen program and see who is the best player to achieve the final target.

Have within the stock game the basics in pace for interstellar travel, colony building, and even ocean exploration. Yes. For those players who want more hard core things, offer it as DLC. Just as Cities:Skylines has done. They fixed bugs in the core game while offering new content - an exactly perfect way to handle DLC. So, the DLC in KSP2 could offer more in the way of things such as nebulae, more planetary systems further out, more futuristic technology (Nertea is now a part of the development team, wink, wink),\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCIV VI had good intentions with their DLC. But the core game was faulty to begin with, yes. And their DLC made the core game even worse. Intentions were good but execution was bad, andI even said something as such. And I never defended The Sims. Even in its first release, Maxis milked it through expansion packs (the forerunner to DLC) until the proverbial cow ran dry. The Sims4 is a horrible mess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I am afraid of is this - so much resources and time goes into the development of KSP2 that the price blows through the $65 (US) barrier and the game requires a beast of a system to play it. Sure, many of us can afford to upgrade every three years (I am overdue for an upgrade now as we speak) but there are members of the community that cannot afford to upgrade technology just to play a newer version of their favorite game. We also have a lot of young folk still in high school and younger who cannot afford an expensive game (I know I make my daughter buy her own computer games and she only gets $20 allowance per week - if she were to do \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E her chores).
