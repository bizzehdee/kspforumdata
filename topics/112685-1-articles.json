My alignment is really good. The two docking ports are really close (less than 1 meter). The magnetism between the ports seems to be absent this time. As close as I am the ships should be pulled together. I have tried to dock this ship with two different ships with no luck. The first attempt was with a ship it had previously docked with. \n\nIs there a bug that makes a port forget it is a port or am I forgetting something? The ports have come together several times but they won\u0027t join.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T20:27:18Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 08:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Invader Jim**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T17:33:27Z","Content":"A picture is worth a thousand words.\n\nPlease post a screenshot of your docking attempt.

So here\u0027s what you need to do (I looked it up):\n\n1) Open your persistent.sfs file for your save game in Notepad (TextEdit in Mac or your text editor of choice - but **not** MS Word).\n\n2) Search for the string \u0022state = Acquired\u0022.\n\n3) If you come across this string, change it to read \u0022state = Ready\u0022\n\n4) Save the file.\n\n5) ???\n\n6) Profit.\n\nHopefully that\u0027ll sort things out for you. I might suggest you go ahead and make a backup copy of your persistent.sfs file before you go hacking around in it, just as a precaution.\n\nIf it doesn\u0027t work or if you don\u0027t find any instances of \u0022state = Aqcuired\u0022, Try SCE to auxiliary (let us know so we can see what else might be happening). sal\\_vager has asked for your savegame file - that\u0027s the same persistent.sfs file, and posting it would help with any further diagnosis needed.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T20:13:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 08:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"Invader Jim","CreatedById":142312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T20:37:17Z","Content":"The port on the first ship was bugged.
