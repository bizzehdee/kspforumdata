Its not game breaking, but its kind of annoying. Basically, when I\u0027m flying, almost every time I hit certain altitudes or orbits (about 100k around Kerbin, about 30k around the Mun), the game zooms the camera out. A lot - to the point that I couldn\u0027t see a 200 tonne ship. Not even as a single pixel. I can zoom back in fine, but its aggravating because it can take a good 10-15 seconds to zoom back in and I can\u0027t figure out what\u0027s doing it or how to stop it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else hit this (and ideally found a solution)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-03T19:20:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etry toggling map view, that normally resets the view.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ASW122","CreatedById":79272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-07T19:17:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022zekes\u0022 data-cite=\u0022zekes\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Etry toggling map view, that normally resets the view.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry its taken me a few days to reply but I just started a new job, so today was the first day I could test this, and it works, so thanks. Its weird though. Sometimes it doesn\u0027t do it at all, others it zooms out miles (until the ship vanishes) but a few times its zoomed out further than map view.
