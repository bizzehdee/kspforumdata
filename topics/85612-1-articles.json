I really like this. I have some caveats, but this is very good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOld fogy bloviation: Nicely done! I like the emphasis on action that is the result of deliberative exploration rather than explosions for lulz. The music choice, while a beautiful cover of the Tears For Fears tune, doesn\u0027t mesh very well though. I think it\u0027s the lyrics, which are a bit too dark for KSP. IMHO KSP revives the techo-optimism of the mid-20th century, and it needs lyrical content similarly positive in outlook. On the other hand, I like that you avoided the stereotypical marshal instrumental score ala Star Trek: TNG. Overall I\u0027d like to see more action-exploration shots in a KSP trailer, and fewer tracking shots of the space center.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-28T14:21:12Z\u0022 title=\u002209/28/2014 02:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by lincourtl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-28T14:35:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery nice!
