I think it would be so much easier to be able to use a keyboard and mouse because those who want to use it can use it if you simply log onto the game but those who don\u0027t want it wouldn\u0027t have to have a keyboard and mouse they could still use a controller if they wanted. \u00A0It would just make the game a lot more fun and easier to do stuff. That is why EVERY console game that involves things such as shooting have aim assist because it\u0027s so much harder to aim with a stick than it is with a mouse. If you read this far thank you.....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
