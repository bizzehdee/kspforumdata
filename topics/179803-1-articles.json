It was discovered using the Doppler method, a technique which usually\u00A0works for large planets, but cannot truly detect smaller planets. However, since Barnards star is so close to the earth, it was easier to detect the minuscule effect the orbiting planet has on its sun. It also probably helps that Barnards star is so low mass, because that will amplify the effect of the gravitational pull from the planet. If this star system were further away from earth, or the planet was smaller and the star larger, it is likely that we would have never discovered the planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, it took decades of collected data to prove with reasonable accuracy that this is truly a planet.
