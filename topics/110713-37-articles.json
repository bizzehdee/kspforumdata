I\u0027ve not been known as 5thHorseman anywhere but here (and the Factorio forums) since I made that original request 4.5 years ago. I never actually **liked** HMV but liked it better than 5thHorseman, and from the looks of things Superfluous J will be my moniker at least as long as 5thHorseman was (First use: 2006) so i should be good.\n\nI plan on keeping the signature the same, and changing my Title to \u0022I used to be 5thHorseman\u0022 or something like that.\n\nAbout the only way you could talk me out of it would be to tell me that you have to go through every post where someone referenced me and change that.
