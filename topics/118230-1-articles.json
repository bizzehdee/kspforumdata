My goal is to setup a mega space station in orbit around kerbin, a very large mining base on the mun, and lastly a small refueler/miner rover near the KSC runway, I think you guys can see where this is going. The SSTO spaceplane I want to build will need to be able to reach and dock with my space station where it can then be refueled, then de-orbit, land on the KSC runway and refuel there. However I cant design/launch my station until I know what my SSTO is capable of.

A truism with spaceplanes is that the smaller you can make them, the more efficient they can be. It may be tempting to load it up with fuel, but that will bite you if you try to carry too much. Making a functional spaceplane requires a lot of experimentation and tweaking, so be prepared for several attempts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou always need a little extra liquid fuel for a spaceplane to power its jets before the rockets kick in, but you do not need much. An ideal solution are the air intake nacelle, structural nacelle, or engine pre-cooler, which carry a bit of liquid fuel inside of them. Not a lot, but unless your spaceplane is a serious gas guzzler, it should be enough. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinimize drag. Cannot emphasizes this enough. Shock cone intakes are ideal for this, but do not go overboard on intakes. As long as you have enough air to power everything under your non-rocket flight ceiling, you should be fine. Speaking of flight ceiling, most planes will start to cut out at about 20,000 meters up. Try to get to 12,000 meters as quick as possible, then go into a gentle ascent from about 15,000 meters to 20,000 to build speed. Watch the thrust output of your jet engines. When they start to drop significantly and your acceleration begins to slow (but before it stops,) hit the rockets. If you have separate jets, leave them on even when the rockets go until they cut out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen ride that acceleration until your apoapsis clears the atmosphere.

Drag is a significant force for much higher than lift. Some craft are aerodynamically stable only until a certain height. A mistake while it is in unstable phase can put you into a flat spin. Thankfully this often is high enough that recovery can be done easily, but it still mucks your trajectory up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course it is also important to tune craft performance.

It usually starts showing at about Mach 1.5 and if you can get into it the spaceplane will work. The air-breather combination also affects how high you can go, and you can get over 1200 m/s at 20,000 m. How fast do you dare go? You\u0027re going to lose some of that deltaV as you climb to 40,000m, but there is a trade-off between time and temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use MechJeb, and there\u0027s an acceleration-limiter option, applied generally. Once you get into the super-thrust speed range, using that will show you, by the throttle setting applied, if you could raise the nose some more. But as you close 20,000m drop the nose and go for speed. I keep the Ascent Guidance window open, since that gives me decent gidance for the rocket stage of the flight. Check the shape of the ascent curve at the start, you want to avoid a sharp pitch change in the transition as it\u0027s both a huge burst of drag and, potentially, a disaster for stability. In effect, it\u0027s as if you started the gravity turn very early. You can be doing a zoom-climb to bring the nose up before the transition to MechJeb Ascent Guidance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the Ascent Guidance window has a toggle for the acceleration limiter. which applies whether the autopilot is active or not. And it had settings for the target orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I sometimes find it that there is a surprisingly long coast to the edge of atmosphere (you\u0027re in sub-orbital flight with the right apoapsis) followed by a long circularization burn. A pure rocket might not go quite so fast in the atmosphere and, by the edge of atmosphere, have lifted the periapsis more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m inclined to the view that a good spaceplane looks way over-powered. A light single-RAPIER setup can work well, but if you can\u0027t get frightening acceleration through the sound-barrier it\u0027s going to be tricky to get enough speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest flights matter. It feels like a bit of a trick, but transfer the craft file from your career game saves to those for the sandbox. Do your testing there. Is that any different from NASA testing a design in a flight simulator? Some of what MechJeb does you can see in the same light. That acceleration limiter is a way of testing the climb angle. But you have lift; you can sustain a high climb angle, but climbing with lift works better for fuel consumption.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt depends on the design but I would consider reduced throttle and a relatively shallow subsonic climb to 6,000 m, full power to boost through to Mach 1.5 (about 450 m/s) and then you\u0027re in the bat-out-of-hell stage that takes you to the transition altitude and \u0022excessive speed\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sandbox is the flight simulator for your designs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vegvisir","CreatedById":148279,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T10:08:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOkay, that\u0027s a start. \u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g13/GoSlash27/ProBuild1_zpsyxdac06t.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g13/GoSlash27/ProBuild1_zpsyxdac06t.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve literally spent days trying spaceplanes to orbit again and again....decided to dl your craft and give it a go.
