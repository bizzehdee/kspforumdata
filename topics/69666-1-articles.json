Pressure is created by the impact of these molecules into other things. Gases also work a bit differently once you get below a certain pressure at which mean free path length becomes longer than the size of the vessel- viscosity and collisions between molecules (or atoms, if noble) of gas become infrequent and you can no longer really have a flow to suck out the air. You need special kinds of pumps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut no, I don\u0027t really know, at least off hand, a technical term for a gas\u0027 propensity to fill a container equally. It\u0027s pretty basic, does that really need any terms other than the ones you\u0027ve already used?

In order to escape the Earth, you must reach escape velocity. Particles of gas at room temperature move at an average of like, maybe 500 meters/sec. The escape velocity of the Earth is ~11 km/s. So gas particles cannot escape easily, they have to get very \u0022lucky\u0022 to build up enough kinetic energy to escape- unless that particle is hydrogen or helium. The velocity of a gas particle at a certain temperature is inversely related to its mass, so because hydrogen and helium are so light, it\u0027s a lot easier for them to obtain the velocity needed to escape Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe magnetic field may play a role though, in protecting the upper atmosphere from the solar wind. Solar wind particles are moving very fast, and would slowly strip away an unprotected atmosphere.

You fill one of the tanks with compressed air, in doing so you\u0027re essentially packing kinetic energy into the first cylinder. Then you open the valve between the two cylinders and what happens. Entropy causes the gas leaks to between cylinders until the pressure is equal and the same amount of kinetic energy is stored in both cylinders, if you released all the air from both cylinders the gas would diffuse and lose energy until it matched that of the surrounding environment, likewise if gravity suddenly didn\u0027t exist the atmosphere would (thanks to entropy) float away and diffuse throughout the universe, but thankfully the gravity is applying enough force to create what could be considered an entropy \u0022barrier\u0022, Due to the magnetosphere among other variables, the atmosphere cannot gain enough energy to reach escape velocities and climb higher than this \u0022barrier\u0022 If the magnetosphere was to disappear (like mars 4 billion years ago) then the atmosphere would be swept into space, slowly at first but as the atmosphere itself thins the process would increase in speed, until it neared a point where the sun could no longer provide enough energy for the atmosphere to reach escape speeds. by which time the atmosphere would be thin and low and would probably be unable to support surface life and we would all be either dead or living deep underground where gravity is strong enough to hold a dense atmosphere in. Which is why if there ever was going to be life on mars, its had the choice of either evolving to live underground or evolving to live on an increasingly hostile surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dwayne_Knight","CreatedById":108937,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T10:39:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m wondering what the disagreement is?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find at high speeds gasses in confined systems behave increasingly like fluids with flow characteristics and viscosity playing a role.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T11:56:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn a very simplistic level it\u0027s just the relationship between pressure and force.
