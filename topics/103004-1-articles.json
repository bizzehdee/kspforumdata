I plan to do .625m and smaller engines next, then move on to 2.5m and then 3.75m as well, that is, if you guys are interested \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the first set:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/hlaf9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I also went into the save file and disabled stock vessels, they clutter up the list, especially when it\u0027s alphabetical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slab\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bakanando","CreatedById":126310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T19:28:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor some reason, KER is not accounting for thrust/isp loss at low atmosphere.
