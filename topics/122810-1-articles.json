On rails, objects ignore atmosphere drag. I\u0027ve left booster stages alone when their peri was well below 69k, and yet come back after a trip to Minmus to find them still speeding along like that\u0027s what they are supposed to do. At least with those I don\u0027t feel bad about terminating, since they were supposed to go boom in atmo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is a crazy angle, but it is possible Minmus might have contributed to it with its own wonky orbit. Not all asteroids have their orbit right on the ecliptic, and any one could just as easily make a pass over a pole of the Mun or Minmus on the way in, with them getting a bit of a slow down in the process. Or it just can be written up to the Kraken having its fun while your eyes are diverted to other things. Which, if that is true, that is definitely the Kraken being very nice. These days asteroids have grown in value a hundred fold so that would be like going on vacation and coming home to find a semi tanker parked on your front lawn filled with premium gasoline.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-13T16:02:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022samstarman5\u0022 data-cite=\u0022samstarman5\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E... that would be like going on vacation and coming home to find a semi tanker parked on your front lawn filled with premium gasoline.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, \u003Cem\u003Ehell\u003C/em\u003E, why couldn\u0027t they have parked that thing there \u003Cem\u003EBEFORE\u003C/em\u003E I left for vacation?
