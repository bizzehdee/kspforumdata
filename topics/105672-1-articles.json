One parachutes right now FUNCTION at interplanetary speeds (any real life chute would be instantly vaporized at 4km/s), so you get massive airbrake functionality for a somewhat light object that doesnt have much inertia. Until chutes are fixed you dont even need heatshields let alone anything else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for spaceplanes, i feel its perfect at 100%, perhaps a teeny bit too much, but its all a matter of limiting the way you aerobrake. Ive managed to get to laythe (from a encounter trajectory) using under 50 fuel, JUST by aerobraking over jool a few passes until my AP matched laythe\u0027s, and waiting for a capture, then it was a matter of a minor course correction to get the right PE for a aerobrake into laythe orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts perfectly balanced right now, it allows you to do stuff like aerobraking, aerocaptures, and reentry without shields at very shallow trajectories from relatively low orbits, but it stops those unrealistic 8km/s straight at planet\u0027s center instantaneous stop braking attempts (which are both unrealistic, unplausible, and make no logical sense from any perspective). It honestly does exactly what i expected it to do, and makes the gameplay much more logical. That said, i wouldnt mind a minor (maybee 5-10% at most) decrease to reentry heat, would make it a tad easier to reenter with some SSTOs, but it wouldnt make anything too easy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T17:41:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerdinand\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kerdinand\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI must say that I, too, feel that reentry is underpowered for space rocket-things but overpowered for spaceplanes.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EAs I understand it that\u0027s because of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry#Blunt_body_entry_vehicles\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eshape of objects\u003C/a\u003E.\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EH. Julian Allen and A. J. Eggers, Jr. of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) made the counterintuitive discovery in 1951[6] that a blunt shape (high drag) made the most effective heat shield. From simple engineering principles, Allen and Eggers showed that the heat load experienced by an entry vehicle was inversely proportional to the drag coefficient, i.e. the greater the drag, the less the heat load. If the reentry vehicle is made blunt, air cannot \u0022get out of the way\u0022 quickly enough, and acts as an air cushion to push the shock wave and heated shock layer forward (away from the vehicle). Since most of the hot gases are no longer in direct contact with the vehicle, the heat energy would stay in the shocked gas and simply move around the vehicle to later dissipate into the atmosphere.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically, when you reenter your spaceplane, you need to have the nose pointing up at a very high angle. The Space Shuttle held a 40-degree nose-up attitude while performing S-turns to help reduce speed. This helped protect it from the majority of reentry heating effects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wing parts in KSP shed heat very quickly and also have a high thermal mass for their mass (four times as much), but because the wings are so light they really don\u0027t have much thermal mass to multiply in the first place. Therefore, you need to take care during reentry. E; If you come in nose-first, or even at a shallow angle with your spaceplane, more air will strike the surface of the plane, heating it quicker.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T17:44:40Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 05:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by regex\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jnz","CreatedById":121746,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T21:12:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have yet to destroy a SSTO from LKO with either steep reentry or shallow.
