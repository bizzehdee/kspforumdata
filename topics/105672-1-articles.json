Parachutes are way overpowered and indestructable once deployed, so they can slow your descend down before prolonged exposure to heat really becomes an issue. The issue is mainly with the parachutes in that case.\n\nNow, when you\u0027re doing a reentry without deploying chutes (at least not until the heat is gone) and you\u0027re coming in too steep you\u0027ll simply penetrate the surface at 1.5km/s. I agree that in those cases we should simply be burning up.\n\nIt definitely is fun that reentry is now a nailbiting experience, as your capsule is roaring through the sky, leaving a fiery trail.

I did a reentr from 150km with 100% reentry heat without any heatshield, coming in very steep, and I survived without loosing a single part. Parachutes deployed at 1000m. However as far as I read on the forums it seems near impossible to re-enter with a SSTO (haven\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t tried myself, I\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4m rubbish at spaceplanes.)\n\nI suggest that maybe lift and the steepness of your orbit are more important.(Rockets -\u003E No lift, coming steep -\u003E High heat / Planes -\u003E High lift, low descent -\u003E Low heat)."},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T17:22:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Nope i deploy the chutes while subsonic usually 6km.\n\nI\u0027ll have to try that.

One parachutes right now FUNCTION at interplanetary speeds (any real life chute would be instantly vaporized at 4km/s), so you get massive airbrake functionality for a somewhat light object that doesnt have much inertia. Until chutes are fixed you dont even need heatshields let alone anything else.\n\nAs for spaceplanes, i feel its perfect at 100%, perhaps a teeny bit too much, but its all a matter of limiting the way you aerobrake. Ive managed to get to laythe (from a encounter trajectory) using under 50 fuel, JUST by aerobraking over jool a few passes until my AP matched laythe\u0027s, and waiting for a capture, then it was a matter of a minor course correction to get the right PE for a aerobrake into laythe orbit.\n\nIts perfectly balanced right now, it allows you to do stuff like aerobraking, aerocaptures, and reentry without shields at very shallow trajectories from relatively low orbits, but it stops those unrealistic 8km/s straight at planet\u0027s center instantaneous stop braking attempts (which are both unrealistic, unplausible, and make no logical sense from any perspective). It honestly does exactly what i expected it to do, and makes the gameplay much more logical. That said, i wouldnt mind a minor (maybee 5-10% at most) decrease to reentry heat, would make it a tad easier to reenter with some SSTOs, but it wouldnt make anything too easy."},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T17:41:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I must say that I, too, feel that reentry is underpowered for space rocket-things but overpowered for spaceplanes.\n\nAs I understand it that\u0027s because of the [shape of objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry#Blunt_body_entry_vehicles).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E H. Julian Allen and A. J. Eggers, Jr. of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) made the counterintuitive discovery in 1951[6] that a blunt shape (high drag) made the most effective heat shield. From simple engineering principles, Allen and Eggers showed that the heat load experienced by an entry vehicle was inversely proportional to the drag coefficient, i.e. the greater the drag, the less the heat load. If the reentry vehicle is made blunt, air cannot \u0022get out of the way\u0022 quickly enough, and acts as an air cushion to push the shock wave and heated shock layer forward (away from the vehicle). Since most of the hot gases are no longer in direct contact with the vehicle, the heat energy would stay in the shocked gas and simply move around the vehicle to later dissipate into the atmosphere.\n\nSo basically, when you reenter your spaceplane, you need to have the nose pointing up at a very high angle. The Space Shuttle held a 40-degree nose-up attitude while performing S-turns to help reduce speed. This helped protect it from the majority of reentry heating effects.\n\nThe wing parts in KSP shed heat very quickly and also have a high thermal mass for their mass (four times as much), but because the wings are so light they really don\u0027t have much thermal mass to multiply in the first place. Therefore, you need to take care during reentry. E; If you come in nose-first, or even at a shallow angle with your spaceplane, more air will strike the surface of the plane, heating it quicker.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T17:44:40Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 05:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by regex**"},{"CreatedByName":"jnz","CreatedById":121746,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T21:12:40Z","Content":"I have yet to destroy a SSTO from LKO with either steep reentry or shallow.
