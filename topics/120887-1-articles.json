I am experiencing an issue with a fairing that closes over another fairing. Sorry no pictures, but I think I canexplainit well enough. My payload is enclosed on a fairing and my transfer stage is also tucked inside a fairing. This fairing closes over the payload fairing for a consistent shell over the whole. When deploying the transfer stage fairing, an explosion results in a decimated craft. I have since edited the transfer stage fairing to close at the base of the fairing for the payload and do not experience this issue. This is my first attempt at a setup like this so I am wandering what is going on here. My best guess is the transfer fairing is actually clipping through the payload fairing but I cannot see any obvious since of this in the vab. I\u0027m really disappointed in the new look, so I hope someone has had a similar experience and can offer advice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo mods used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust to clarify, the transfer stage fairing closes at the widest part of the payload fairing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-14T19:56:31Z\u0022 title=\u002209/14/2015 07:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ForScience6686\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eclarification\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Friend Bear","CreatedById":123301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T18:50:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReading it and without pictures, I think I have an idea of what happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have two fairings, both of which decouple/eject at a different stage, but one clips through the other?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds like you just have an issue of collision. While clipping is sometimes ok, the programming has become more strict with clipping of movable parts since pre-.9. I would try to avoid that entire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, use a single fairing through both the transfer and final stage. Once you get to the fairing stage-wise, you are high enough (upper of 45k) that removing all fairings would have only a beneficial impact of less overall weight and therefore more delta v. That high up, there is very little issue with atmosphere. In fact, you can even deploy solar panels in the upper atmosphere safely (although that just causes minor drag if you are keeping that close of attention).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, use a single, longer/bigger fairing to save weight and collision issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-18T18:52:15Z\u0022 title=\u002209/18/2015 06:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Friend Bear\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T19:36:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom the sounds of it, your fairing for the transfer stage goes around the entire payload and it\u0027s fairing yes?

I\u0027m using the payload fairing for atmospheric entry, so I want it in place for the journey. My hope was to have 2 separate fairing that gave a single fairing look in hopes of eliminating the drag behind the first fairing. I am guessing that this will not be possible. Oh well, that ship has since launched and is enroute to duna.
