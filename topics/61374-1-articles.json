To make money. I would have deposits or certain resources like Iron,Titannium, Platinum, copper ect scatted through out the Kerbal solar system. Mining them and bringing them home will give you money. Of course the money made has to be more than the money spent getting them (the hard part) and certain resources values will go up and down as the game progresses. Id also like to see orbital construction with certain resources needed to build components on site. You can either ship the resources up from Kerbin or mine them. Could also be expanded for planetary bases and colonies so that they can build extra modules on site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway that my take on how to possibley make them work.

The function of posting it on a forum is to get it discussed, and debated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, back on point - you\u0027ve mentioned resources as adding to career, and orbital construction being added to sandbox and career. To cover the first point, my issue with resources in career mode is pretty well summed up in this post on the register (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/24/planetary_resources/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/24/planetary_resources/\u003C/a\u003E). Having plenty of something reduces your return on investment so quickly that it\u0027s totally pointless to do it - TL;DR - if it takes me $100m to launch a rocket to an asteroid to mine some precious metal, I\u0027d have to bring back $100m worth of that precious metal to make the trip viable, minimum. Problem is that by bringing back $100m worth of that precious metal, i flood the market and my $100m is now worth $1m, or worse. Exercise is left to the viewer to see how that scenario plays out for the shareholders...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, adding orbital construction to career mode (which you have said should be a difficult task, and I appreciate that), which is the only place it makes sense (because in sandbox just use hyperedit? like you say, it\u0027s a sandbox, do what you want), means you\u0027d have to build an end game structure around someone acheiving the goal of building an orbital construction output.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis presents two problems: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. not everyone wants this - a lot of the joy \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E personally get from KSP is the design and launching of that design from the launchpad - getting the dV requirements right, TWRs correct for each stage, ensuring aerodynamic stability, etc etc. You yourself have said you are bored by this - perhaps you may want to get hyperedit, if that\u0027s the case, as it sounds like there\u0027s a large chunk of KSP gameplay you don\u0027t enjoy any more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. not everyone would be able to achieve this - since you\u0027ve pointed out it would be very hard, it means two things - 1. to complete the most difficult contracts it presumes you would need this infrastructure in place and 2. it means that this would leave part of the game out of reach for players who were unable to perform this difficult feat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you see where I\u0027m going? Adding something like this into the game removes the challenge post-orbital construction, and presents a challenge to a lot of people pre-orbital construction. Plus, the irony isn\u0027t lost on me that to build an orbital construction post you\u0027d probably have to do rocket launches \u0027a billion odd times\u0027 to unlock and build it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monger","CreatedById":4143,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T17:00:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022crazyewok\u0022 data-cite=\u0022crazyewok\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow would it?
