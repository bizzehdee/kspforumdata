Laptops tend to have weak cpus. I recommend using ubizour welding mod which got a dev upgrade for 1.02 lately. It still has its bugs but usable nontheless. This mod allows you to weld parts together creating a single part from multiple part build thus easing your cpu load. Another mod you can use is the tweakscale which you can use to create bigger longer versions of normal parts which will allow you to use a single engine where you would use multiple engines by creating a bigger engine or single fuel tank where you would use multiple fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your problem is caused by low ram you can launch the game with opengl which will solve that problem. Also there are texture reduction mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your problem is about gpu you can lower every graphic option there is untill it stops lagging. There are mods for further reducing the graphics but i doubt it will come to that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-01T11:59:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2015 11:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
