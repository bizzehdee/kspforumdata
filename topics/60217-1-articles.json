I am using spaceplanes a lot these days, and I know that Mechjeb can keep the nose pointing at a given angle. However, prograde usually differs from the angle of the nose. Is there a way to make prograde stay at a given angle? Or is there a mod that can do that?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasmic","CreatedById":64885,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T14:53:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure, and anyway, this is the wrong section for the question.

Prograde is your velocity vector; the way you keep it at a given angle is by pitching and thrusting to change your velocity vector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you mean something like, \u0022stay at a given angle *from* prograde\u0022? I.e. \u0022I want my spaceplane to maintain an angle of attack [i.e. pitched above velocity vector] of 20 degrees\u0022? If so, then alas no, but that would be a good function for MJ.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T17:44:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat you CAN do is use the \u0027SURF\u0027 part of MechJeb\u0027s Smart A.S.S.
