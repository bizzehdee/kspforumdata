Until one day, I was working in my career mode, and found that I haven\u0027t unlocked that TT-18A Launch Stability Enhancer. I thought that it should work fine without that launch clamps, so I tried offsetting with that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe results are very satisfying: It works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, since the career I\u0027m playing has some mods, and one of them is \u0027Editor Extension Redux\u0027, I\u0027ve decided to recreate that in Vanilla KSP 1.1.2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe results are, again, very satisfying: It works again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would brought joy to me till I have to post this thread to tell the world what I\u0027ve found. Well, \u003Cstrong\u003EI could beat all \u0027get to sub-orbital\u0027 challenge with this trick and without fuel\u003C/strong\u003E. Heheheheheh....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, here\u0027s a way to do it:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nMake a rocket, no launch clamps, ensure the first stage decoupling (can be empty decoupling).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOffset them, make sure they\u0027re far enough to be in space, but not too far (I\u0027ll tell you why).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLaunch it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nEasy, right? The only hardest part is the step 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I\u0027ll tell you why the first stage should decouple, even it is empty decoupling. This is needed to update your space craft in space, without that, you\u0027ll still be in space, but the game thinks that you\u0027re in launchpad. It would say \u0027at Launchpad\u0027 in the map view\u0027. Instead decoupling, you can go EVA and then board again. I don\u0027t know if this breaks things, but with decoupler I managed to transport many tourists to suborbital with this way in my modded KSP career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy you shouldn\u0027t offset too far from KSC? Because, your space craft will get stuck in space and you cannot trigger the staging sequence. I suspect the \u003Cstrong\u003Elimits to be about 100km\u003C/strong\u003E altitude from Kerbin, or 360km horizontal offset. That means no free KEO for you guys. \u003Cstrong\u003EYou\u0027ll still fall down, so you still need thrust to get to orbit\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow do I offset them, anyway? Well, I used \u0027Editor Extenstion Redux\u0027 and offsetted while seeing how far I offset via debug (not the alt\u002Bf12, but from the mod). However, It works in Vanilla KSP, although we cannot tell how far you offset the vessel (so you\u0027re basically offsetting in the dark, with trial and error). In the end, you might even have a .craft file already in space when you shared your .craft file!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScreenshots:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/by2Hw/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-04T01:03:46Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2016 01:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Anbang11\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Codraroll","CreatedById":163815,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-03T13:27:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... you\u0027ve effectively made a space elevator?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mastikator","CreatedById":135309,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-03T14:08:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI look forward to pictures. 2860 km is keostationary orbit btw.
