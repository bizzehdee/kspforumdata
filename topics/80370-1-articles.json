And your launch altitude looks good, that\u0027s around 6m I reckon (nice low drop speed too). The specifics of the rover is to get around the otherwise inevitable skid or leg lander (another reason for the ridiculously low drop altitude)... although, I can\u0027t see a problem with a pallet drop as long as the drop probe operates on four wheels and independent of the pallet after landing. Still needs chutes though, even a pallet can\u0027t stand a 50\u002Bm/s impact.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darren9","CreatedById":58062,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T10:55:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI did fly up to 500m and do a 5Km\u002B loop around but it\u0027s not in the video, I doubt it rolled 100m either but I\u0027m not sure how to judge that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/DxAbuVu0Bt4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
