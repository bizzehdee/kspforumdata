I used landing gear wheels as alignment bearings to accomplish the rotational component. The rotating shaft and blades are disconnected from the main craft, but held in place by the wheels. And as for more SAS, I wholeheartedly agree. However, I\u0027m almost at the critical weight. That brings up a question: With respect to torque/weight, which do you think is better: RCS or SAS?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iDan122","CreatedById":24439,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-07T14:05:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESAS, i suggest the small and striped one.
