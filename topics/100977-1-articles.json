When you approach a vehicle, first there\u0027s the lag at 2.2-2.3 km because of the actual rendering which starts to happen at that distance.\n\nBut ever since v0.9, even more serious lag happens at the 200 m barrier. If the total part count is considerable, it can even crash the whole game.\n\nI\u0027ve noticed this immediately after the upgrade back then, but never reported it.\n\nSo, what happens at 200 m and can I avoid it?"},{"CreatedByName":"gmpd2000","CreatedById":37101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T01:21:13Z","Content":"My guess would be that the physics load.\n\nOnly way to avoid it would be to reduce part count."},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T02:17:11Z","Content":"a while back there used to be a horrible bug that would cause craft to explode around the 200m mark when approaching. (although you first had to depart from that craft, go outside 2.5km and then return for it to happen). I wonder if this is a form of the same sort of issue.\n\nWhat sort of part count are you dealing with? and does it happen in a pure stock install?"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T03:16:15Z","Content":"The physics load happens at 2.2 km as usual. What I\u0027ve noticed is that if you have your craft rotating and you switch to another craft inside that radius, the first one stops rotating.

If this is something that consistently happens with a save file, upload it and I (or someone else) will try to have a look and see if we can tell what is going on.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
