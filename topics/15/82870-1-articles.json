The error is as follows: Ignore collision failed. Both colliders need to be activated when calling this IgnoreCollision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone of the logs give any useful information about exact what is causing this. They all just state this error without giving a part/object name that is causing it. I spent forever looking for the problem and I\u0027ve narrowed it down to jettisonable parts. It doesn\u0027t matter what the part is, whether it has a collider or not, or where it is placed. If you use the jettison module for that part you get this error spam in the log. The issue seems compounded when you have multiple parts with multiple jettison modules on the same ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would really appreciate help with what is causing this as looking around the net has not yielded any useful results. If worse comes to worst I will have to remove the jettison module and just make the parts decouplable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6T25hOp.png\u0022 alt=\u00226T25hOp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-26T04:43:11Z\u0022 title=\u002208/26/2014 04:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by raidernick\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Justin Kerbice","CreatedById":101695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-27T18:18:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes the LV-N generate the same errors ?

I get it out to the launch pad and it crashes while initializing fiziks. I have tried everything I can think of to settle out any design issues that might have crept in. The stack is extremely simple two stage design with 14 radial SRBs. I re-did the nose cones and separation thrusters on the SRBs, but that\u0027s the only noteworthy change. The main tank is simply a KW rocketry 5M tank tweakscaled up a notch... The main engines are Hikari F1 rockets, in a pentagonal arrangement. The second stage is a bit rough, it\u0027s a lab module from stanford torurses and it isn\u0027t quite put together right but I\u0027ve flown it like a dozen times without crashing the game. The only really dodgy thing about the stack is the reaction wheel, I\u0027m using one of the large HX parts from B9 because it is the only thing big enough to deal with a stack of this scale without breaking or buckling...
