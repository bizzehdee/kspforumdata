I\\\u0027m attempting to convert some of my existing models into something that works in KSP. Currently going very well. I can even get things in the game by using Blender to export the Collada file. However, if I try anything with a \u0027node_collider\u0027 mesh, the game (or PartLab) completely refuses to work. Any idea on what I need to change to the collider mesh? I\\\u0027ve renamed it, given it a texture and UV map (no .png file though). But it seems to corrupt the file or something.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EIf anyone has had a successful export, could you explain how you did this?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E[/edit]\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003ETurns out Blender had defaulted back to 24bit textures on reload. \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003ENow I\\\u0027ve just got to figure out the collider mesh.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EThanks!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DYJ","CreatedById":8636,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-27T08:08:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck if your node_collider is concave.
