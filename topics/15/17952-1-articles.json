You will want to do this with the cylinder projection option when you highlight what you want to map and hit U for the uv map options. On the left toolbar there is a pull down menu labled Direction - choose align with image as the mode and it should flatten the cylinders out you chose to map. Grab those maps on the UV map window and move them around like you do with the object window and proceed onto the next part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECylinder projection will basically take all the faces of the part(s) you\u0027ve selected and flatten them out for you, and Align with Image will straighten them so they\u0027re rectangles instead of oddly shaped blobs. Do this with the different sections of your engine body and line them up vertically so when you\u0027re texturing you can smoothly transition from one to the next. Use faces as your selection mode and alt click the ring you want to map. If you get a vertical strip, move the cursor closer to one of the vertical edges of that particular face and it should select the ring instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, use seams. Seams are ways that the program breaks down complex objects and decides where to cut when uv mapping and functions as you\u0027d expect, much like a zipper. Those circular parts that breach the top plate cylinder would be good candidates for this. It looks like you used rotated cylinders for this instead of manipulating a normal one to make it curve. That\u0027s fine, I guess, and I\u0027m going to assume that those parts are complete rings that join somewhere inside the model. Highlight the edge that bisects the rings vertically and on the toolbar you can click \u0022Mark as Seam\u0022 on the toolbar, and it will change it to a red line; do the same for the bisecting line on the interior of the rings. The edge will still function if you want to manipulate it, so no worries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, you should probably mark that first edge that you can see on your rings where they protrude from the engine body. Mark it as a seam so it should be a circle selection, that\u0027s the edge I mean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow when you map those parts, it will cut along the bisecting seam to split each ring into two parts, and then the last seam you chose will allow those parts to be mapped flatly instead of in rings like you have. This will make texturing them a whole hell of a lot easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember that you can move all of the stuff around in the UV map window like you do with the object window, so place things where you know what they are and don\u0027t have to reference the model too much. After you\u0027ve mapped everything, select all in the object window and you\u0027ll see all the different projections show up on the UV map as you did them, instead of allowing the program to do it for you and not necessarily getting it right. This makes for a much more organized UV map and it\u0027s a billion times easier to work with than just letting the program do it for more complex shapes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope it helps, good work, and good luck. I\u0027m just getting into part modeling too and I know it can seem overwhelming at first, but it\u0027s a good feeling to see that first part come together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I took two screenshots of what the difference is when you do the individual mapping versus letting the program do something like smart uv mapping or just using seams yourself. The big key is the cylinder projection option and aligning to model, then just moving stuff around and all that jazz.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmart UV Unwrap with a few seams: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Se3iI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Se3iI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManually using Cylinder Projection for each section and using seams:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NBVMB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NBVMB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see a huge difference in how easy it would be to work with and just avoiding headaches.

Hitting tab goes from object to edit mode, and when in object mode, if you go to Add, Mesh, Cylinder, you\u0027ll get a 2nd object in the shape of a cylinder (if you add it in edit mode, it adds a separate, unconnected mesh to your main object (the one that represents the visual portion of your model)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERigth after you add the 2nd object, there will be a new options menu on the left side (below all of the editing functions like duplicate, unwrap, etc) that lets you set the cylinder parameters like radius, height, and number of \u0022sides\u0022 on the barrel. For a 1m engine, you need a radius of 0.5, and from the tutorial we know that cylinders should have 24 sides. You can set a height if you have a specific length in mind, or ignore it. Then once you click in the main area, the parameters are \u0022set\u0022 for your cylinder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the idea is to make your engine \u0022fit\u0022 this cylinder so that it sort of describes its top, bottom, and sides. You\u0027d use the scale functions to do that (right click to re-select the engine object, then go to edit mode, hit S to scale. You can lock in an axis after hitting S to only scale one axis (so hitting S, then Z would lock it into Z axis mode and you only scale the models height. Or you can hit S then shift\u002BZ to lock out Z and leave the height unaffected while you scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have that done and you are satisfied with your UVMap, its time to finalize the model setup and export it. How you do that depends on which method of adding parts you are using; the \u0027old style\u0027 of using DAE and PNG files, or the new style of importing your model and img into unity and setting it up in there. In any event you need to add materials, set the object names properly, and set up smoothing on the model (so the engine bell doesn\u0027t have \u0022faces\u0022 but appears round, there are topics about that in this forum somewhere)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut take it one step at a time, and come back and ask questions about steps you don\u0027t understand. Its also useful to import some old DAE files to look at how they are set up (try to find some made in Blender, as importing models from other software can do some weird things and its hard to understand) - A lot of the newer engines I added to NP would work for that purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Navy4422","CreatedById":27157,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-05T12:38:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Tiberion, I\u0027ll get back to work once school calms down\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tjitte","CreatedById":38033,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-06T16:20:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethat looks good!! i would lofe to see that whit a texture \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei usualy unwrap the uv map manualy, just by marking the seam, gives me the best result \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
