However, this is the first time I am making a suntracking panel and I am having difficulties. The panel works in game and rotates, but the ALWAYS tracks the sun from the top edge of the panel instead of the face. I tried rotating the suncatcher in blender \u002B/-90 in x y and z axis as well as unity and it doesn\u0027t make a difference. In game it always follows the sun from the top edge of the panel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MamvapI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MamvapI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-13T04:16:15Z\u0022 title=\u002209/13/2014 04:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by raidernick\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"raidernick","CreatedById":97711,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-13T04:18:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was able to finally fix this. For anyone wondering i had to entirely redo the animation in blender. First I applied the rotation with the flat side of the panels facing \u0022up\u0022. I then redid the animations in that orientation. Then after I rotated the panels 90 degrees and DIDN\u0027T apply it. Then I exported to unity and then ksp and it finally would catch sun at the proper angle. seems ridiculous that it needs to be baked facing \u0022up\u0022 in blender although maybe this has something to do with blender and unity reversing the x and y axis.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
