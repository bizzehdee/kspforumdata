But I have one issue that\u0027s been nagging me; would anyone be able to give me any advice on matching the white parts of the model to an MK2 Part?\n\nI\u0027ve used the eye-dropper tool in Photoshop and adjusted the levels of the whites to match somewhat close, but I can still tell a difference and it kind of bothers me.\n\nDoes anyone have a method they use to match colors?"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T18:37:25Z","Content":"Yeah, I use the eye-dropper and eyeball things a bit too, when matching to stock parts. Are you comparing them in the same position/orientation in the VAB/SPH? The lighting is really strange in the editors, making things super bright on top, and less so on the sides."},{"CreatedByName":"martinezfg11","CreatedById":59995,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T18:57:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yeah, I use the eye-dropper and eyeball things a bit too, when matching to stock parts.

Save copies of them as PNGs, and you now have actual samples to work with.\n\nAs for how to actually get your parts to look stockalike, it depends on on what level of quality you\u0027re aiming for:\n\n - The quick and dirty method is to copy and paste entire sections of the stock textures, and remap your own UV islands accordingly. For instance, the SDHI SMS Pod Boost Protect Cover\u0027s texture was based on a hacked-up copy of the stock 2.5m nose cone, with additional smudging to represent additional weathering and extra graphics.\n\n - You can, of course, use Photoshop\u0027s eyedropper tool to manually sample colors from the original for use in your mod part; shadows can be baked in Blender via Ambient Occlusion, while scratches and dings will need to be painted by hand."}]}
