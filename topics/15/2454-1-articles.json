The problem was probably the nodes being inside the collision meshes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah. To sum it up: the models are perfectly fine, the problem comes from the fact you just stuck out-of-proportion models to existing parts without editing them at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to sleep now though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lucek","CreatedById":4051,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-20T08:06:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk I know how to make parts, thees aren\u0027t my first ones, however I was being cheap so I could test my parts relatively fast, however I did spend quite a lot of time making shore the node position was correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote forinstans the differance between,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Enode_stack_top = 0.0, 7.72552, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0\u003Cp\u003Enode_stack_bottom = 0.0, -7.43024, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Enode_stack_top = 0.0, 0.8, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0\u003Cp\u003Enode_stack_bottom = 0.0, -1.62, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lucek","CreatedById":4051,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-21T22:46:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor note I spent another half hour refining the node position.

That might help me tell you how to get things fixed in way that works for you. It appears that liquid engines output force directly down from the scene origin. If you want to know how this works, just load up an existing engine, and make sure your nozzle is pointed the same way. You can control where your part connects and the angle, but as far as I can tell there is no way to control the angle of the engine thrust on a liquid engine. However if you\\\u0027re making a solid booster, you can angle the thrust in any direction you like by using these options in the cfg file specification. If you happen to be using 3ds max, there is an excellent script that will allow you to find the vectors and co-ordinates easily. Its called the get_vector_tool. You can get it from the KSP sdk, which is hosted on the KSP downloads section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EthrustCenter = 0, -0.5, 0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EthrustVector = 0, 1, 0\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lucek","CreatedById":4051,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-22T04:25:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m using milkshape.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lucek","CreatedById":4051,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-27T21:44:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK got an idea today.
