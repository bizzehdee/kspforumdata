In the way on which axis the \u0022split\u0022 of the two fairing halves occur? (Meaning that the fairing is set to to halves only by it\u0027s cfg)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNormally, they do split on the left-right axis in regard to the parent object\u0027s alignment (on part would fall in direction of the VAB door, one 180 dregrees from it in the VAB @ default orientation of the parent part.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would need a 90\u00B0 rotated split, one that would result into a bottom/top fairing part split. Currently, i have the parent part 90\u00B0 offset to its intended orientation to do so. IE when you grab it in the VAB, you have to rotate it first, before attaching. But that is not THAT great of a \u0022solution\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ven","CreatedById":109931,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-08T20:01:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could try rotating the entire model by 90* with a MODEL {} node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027ll turn the transform that the fairing is fixed to at least.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002BPART [modelnamehere] {\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n!Mesh = del\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n!MODEL{}\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMODEL{\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmodel = model path goes here\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nrotation = 0.0, 90.0, 0.0 //X,Y,Z rotation\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n}\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InsaneDruid","CreatedById":137849,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-09T16:45:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks, but unfortunately, I already rotated it by rotating it in blender and re-exporting everything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNevertheless, now I know that I could have just used the rotation-entry in the .cfg instead \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
