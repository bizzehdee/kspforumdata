In game it was obvious one wing was upside-down so I made two wings, one and inverted (upside-down) version of the other so that I could make a symmetrical looking when they were placed opposite of each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn build mode this held up fine. One extra step, no big deal. When I would go to the spaceport, however, the inverted wing would switch to the original version, giving me one upside-down wing. I assumed it was because they shared the same .OBJ name, so I switched that up. Same thing. Renamed them within the .OBJ. Got to spaceport, same thing. Change the texture name so they\u0027re different, same end result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt always look right in build mode, the first time. Then whenever I leave build mode (main menu and returning to build mode, spaceport) the new version would use the same model as the old one.
