I have found some tutorials that deal with .mbm, .pbm, .png, blah blah blah... I cannot get anything to open up properly in PS. I have PS CS4 64-bit. The closest I have come to getting a real editable image was a greyscale image that was out of proportion and had a blank line every other line.\n\nIs it because I\u0027m running 64-bit PS?\n\nIs there a more direct option? idk why Squad makes this type of edit so ridiculously complicated and unpredictable.\n\nI have followed every step, done all the math and still nothing will open up properly. I just want to edit a plain boring fuel tank texture... is it really this hard?"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T21:51:36Z","Content":"**[MOD - Moved to** [**Modelling and Texturing Discussion**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/14-Modelling-and-Texturing-Discussion) **subforums, as this is the appropriate place to be asking this sort of question]**\n\nThe MBM (Mu Bit Map) is a proprietary texture format developed by SQUAD specifically for KSP, so no version of Photoshop will ever be able to directly open and edit it. It\u0027s an holdover from the earliest days of KSP\u0027s development, when SQUAD (at the time) didn\u0027t expect people to make add-ons for the game, hence the apparently non-intuitive file format.\n\nThat being said, it is possible to convert MBMs to the more readily-editable PNGs:\n\n - Download and install Blender\n\n - Download and install [taniwha\u0027s Blender .mu import/export addon](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43513-Blender-mu-import-export-addon)\n\n- Import the fuel tank .MU model into Blender using the addon\n\n- In the Blender\u0027s UV/Image Editor pane, you should be able to access all the textures used by the part, and individually save them to PNG format for editing\n\nIf you want to convert the PNGs back to MBMs, you will need to follow a more complicated process involving the Unity editor and the KSP PartTools package, but thankfully, the **latest versions of the game can also directly load PNG textures for parts**\n\nAlso, KSP 1.0 will soon switch to using DDS textures for parts - while DDS is also a proprietary standard, at least there are more texture converters available for it than for MBM."},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T01:51:25Z","Content":"PS will open ( and write ) DDS directly if the nvidia plugins are installed. There are some utils around to convert from MBM to other things ( I\u0027d pick tga if you can, opening transparent PNGs in PS is a bit unnecessarily annoying unless you script it ) but off the top of my head I can\u0027t remember where."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T14:07:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E but thankfully, the **latest versions of the game can also directly load PNG textures for parts**\n\nHas the \u0022white texture\u0022 bug been resolved?"}]}
