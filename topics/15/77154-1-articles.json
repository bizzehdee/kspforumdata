I ended up making the pod a single convex collider and making the hollow piece a separate part. Everything works fine now with airlocks and ladders, it would have been nice to have the pod all one piece but it\u0027s such a pain in the ass that I think it\u0027s better this way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
