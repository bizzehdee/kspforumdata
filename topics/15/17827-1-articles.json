It isn\u0027t done in unity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnity is the game engine KSP uses not the program with which the models and textures are made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond there isn\u0027t a single tutorial possible for modeling and texturing because there are loads of programs for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost popular for modeling are for example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlender\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3Ds Max\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlender is a free modeling program and most people use it. There is a full modeling tutorial available as a sticky in this section (look at the top)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for 3ds Max (the program I use) it isn\u0027t a free program and is rather expensive. A few thousand dollar if I remember correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use a student version since I\u0027m a game design student. If you\u0027re a student you might get acces to the program too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion it\u0027s a bit easier then blender but thats just personal opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the textures most people use photoshop or similair programs to make the textures and you need to understand uv maps to make good textures for models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for modeling basics its best to look for a tutorial outside the ksp forums to look up on the basics of the program you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA quick google search with the search terms: \u0022blender basics tutorial\u0022 or \u00223ds max basics tutorial\u0022 will give you loads of results with tutorials on the basics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStuff like uv mapping is a bit more advanced and you will need to be able make a proper correct model or else you will still get problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would advice you to try blender as its free and there are alot of tutorials available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust look up a basic tutorial and do some more tutorials and then experiment a bit with models and such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake it slow and easy or else you might get demotivated or run into trouble with your models later on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPractice is the key with stuff like this.(modelling and texturing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for configuration of the parts you can look here and then try to edit a few parts and see what everything does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart configuration tutorial:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/~kerbalsp/wiki/index.php?title=CFG_File_Documentation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/~kerbalsp/wiki/index.php?title=CFG_File_Documentation\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
