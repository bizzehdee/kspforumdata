The Fairing is only one piece, so I don\u0027t need the Fairing module itself at all, I hope. So I have just copied the ModuleCargoBay Module from the Stock Size 2 Fairing and inserted it into my part cfg. However, it is, of course, as everytime if you just copy stuff from other configs, not working, or not correctly. And I have no idea what those things mean, so I just opened a thread here. \n\n MODULE\n\n {\n\n name = ModuleCargoBay\n\n DeployModuleIndex = 0\n\n closedPosition = 0\n\n lookupRadius = 2.5\n\n // nodeOuterAftID = bottom\n\n // nodeInnerAftID = top\n\n }\n\nWhat do I use DeployModuleIndex, closedPosition and lookupRadius for? I believe the lookupRadius is how big the area which should be phisically covered by the Fairing is, but if I turn it up, it should, at last if I think now correctly, also cover the tank under it, which is not what I want to happen. \n\nCould somebody help me there? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T16:37:13Z","Content":"DeployModuleIndex is the index of the animation module that opens your cargo bay. If your deploy animation is the first module in your part config, this should be 0.

If your animation starts open and goes to closed, this should be 1.\n\nlookupRadius is probably the distance from the center of mass of the cargo bay to do part containment lookup.
