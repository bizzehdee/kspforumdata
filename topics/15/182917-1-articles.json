The problem is that when importing an xnalara file into Blender, merge only the objects and export them as fbx files, the texture does not appear when importing files from mixamo. When you import a file from Unreal Engine 4, the texture disappears and the object disappears when it gets closer to the camera. When you import a texture into an object, only one applies and overlaps with other objects. How do I fix this? I am Korean and I can not speak English. I do not know the program like Blender.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://sta.sh/01iwmq4qrd9t\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://sta.sh/01iwmq4qrd9t\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://sta.sh/0qkaznpj9kq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://sta.sh/0qkaznpj9kq\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://sta.sh/021c1ytp1x1a\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://sta.sh/021c1ytp1x1a\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://sta.sh/0vxkmgrdwna\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://sta.sh/0vxkmgrdwna\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceMouse","CreatedById":126931,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-21T04:07:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm, welcome to the forum!
