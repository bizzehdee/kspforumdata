I added it to one of my parts (the LAS shroud in MRS) using only this:\n\n    \tMODULE\t{\t\tname = ModuleSeeThroughObject\t\ttransformName = LASshroud\t}\n\nBy just supplying the transform\u0027s name for the entire object, the whole thing can go transparent."},{"CreatedByName":"Squiggsy","CreatedById":139947,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T18:32:40Z","Content":"ah thanks a lot! I didn\u0027t see that when searching through monodevelop for interesting modules the other day, probably should have just checked the config for a service bay but I assumed it\u0027d be tagged in unity instead, cheers for the info! will be useful for my service bay for the lander I\u0027m building ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"qm3ster","CreatedById":150338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T10:38:01Z","Content":"Hue hue procedural fairings just attacked us all with this goodie :v"}]}
