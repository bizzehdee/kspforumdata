The animation is attached to the \u0027object\u0027. So when you move polygons from one object to another the animation doesn\u0027t go with them. As a slightly complicated work-around, you should be able to do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit each panel - select all polygons - tap \u0022P\u0022 to move all of the polygons to a new object (leaving the original object empty, but animated).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoin the NEW objects and fiddle to your heart\u0027s content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESplit the objects back from the composite object you made with the joining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESelect each split object and it\u0027s original animated object and join these.

Whichever way keeps the name of the animated object.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough at this point it\u0027s probably faster just to split them and reanimate them, unless the animation was just crazy!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
