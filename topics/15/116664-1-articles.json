So I\u0027m trying to reuse one of your assets, namely EVAHandle.\n\nI want to use it as an external door handle. But I am having some issue with the animation that I can\u0027t figure out.\n\n[**Here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Byg_V2NhUC_ZYmxKSDVRbmp6UXM/view?usp=sharing) is a video of the animation working in Unity as expected.\n\n[**Here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Byg_V2NhUC_ZMkpUQ1NDX1FwVDA/view?usp=sharing) is a video of the animation not working quite so well in KSP. For some reason only half of the animation runs and I can\u0027t figure out why.\n\nI then tried to import the fbx file from the unity package you provided into blender, and well, the animation seems fine in blender as well, except the transforms are out of wack. I don\u0027t know if that has something to do with it. [**Picture**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Byg_V2NhUC_ZUzBpY0pXcnFGMjA/view?usp=sharing) of the fbx imported into blender.\n\nAny ideas? - Can you supply the original fbx file?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-31T20:35:39Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2015 08:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo**"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T20:48:05Z","Content":"that\u0027s really weird...

D\u0027OH!! I renamed the gameobject for the handle from EVAhandle to Doorhandle. So of course the animation wasn\u0027t finding it. I renamed it back and success. I am using Unity 4.6.4 (same as current KSP version) and the legacy animations are read-only. I don\u0027t think there is a way to edit them without downloading an older version of Unity. Unless someone knows of a way?\n\n[**Video of animation working.**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Byg_V2NhUC_ZanVGdHh2QS1COGc/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-31T22:31:47Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2015 10:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Redneck","CreatedById":2030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T17:10:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hi all, haven\u0027t been doing much KSP modding for a while, don\u0027t think I will be doing more in the foreseeable future.\n\nThats sad to hear.

I think many of the parts need quite a bit of fiddling to get functional in 1.x.\n\n\u003E I cant get the landing gears loaded into unity correctly. I am interested if the wheels roll or not.

I think it happens because the packages are exported from different projects.
