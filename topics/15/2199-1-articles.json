In a zealous swing of parts creation, I launched myself into modelling (ended up using Maya, thing is pretty damn intuitive). And as such, in a single day, I have made a good model for my new part and extracted the UV map, checked if everything would load correctly in the parts lab using a dummy texture, and everything works. My last step is my (now only) bane: texturing. Do you guys have any tips on where/how to start, or anything that could help me make textures that will not suck?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frostiken","CreatedById":1837,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-08T16:40:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wish I could help.
