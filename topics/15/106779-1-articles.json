guys, I need some help with the emissive for my engine, already saw videos, helped, but didn\u0027t resolve totally the problem\n\nhere\u0027s what I\u0027ve done\n\n![G5YlfqM.png](http://i.imgur.com/G5YlfqM.png)\n\nWanted to add emissive at the bottom of it so :\n\n![UIporwG.png](http://i.imgur.com/UIporwG.png)\n\n![9yUxuH2.png](http://i.imgur.com/9yUxuH2.png)\n\n![zoE8cAA.png](http://i.imgur.com/zoE8cAA.png)\n\n![XDkxJJT.png](http://i.imgur.com/XDkxJJT.png)\n\n![WAfKNgs.png](http://i.imgur.com/WAfKNgs.png)\n\nbtw I added the emisive color in unity and not in blender, when I\u0027ve choose \u0022emissive\u0022 instead of \u0022diffuse\u0022 in order to modify my engine in from it\u0027s .fbx file, I saw that new texture needed, so I\u0027ve put that color in it because I saw that the color of emissive is choosen from the animation curves.\n\nSo, once .mu produced, got this:\n\n![IdNawDY.png](http://i.imgur.com/IdNawDY.png)\n\nSo, I\u0027ve made the .cfg file, here\u0027s a copy\n\n    PART{    name = rotor_XT1    module = Part    author = Samy    mesh = model.mu
