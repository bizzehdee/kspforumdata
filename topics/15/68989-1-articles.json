However when the part is converted to a dae and then imported into Unity, the animation is only 37 frames. I can tell the animation doesn\u0027t go to completion when I run it in the game. Has anyone seen this before? Are there particular settings for exporting I am missing? What framerate should the animation be exported at?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"frizzank","CreatedById":57210,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-11T15:21:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat are you exporting too, dae, fbx, or just using the maya file?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may be compressing the animation and droping frames.
