However, when I try to create a new project, partTools isn\u0027t listed in the list of packages to import. \n\nIdeas?\n\n==EDIT==\n\nDisregard but I\u0027m leaving this up in case someone else has this issue. You can drag and drop assets into unity. For future use I then right clicked the partTools folder and exported it as a .unityPackage.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T20:43:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 08:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Styles2304**"}]}
