I have been an avid fan of it since 1995, so that would make it 18 years I have been using and enjoying Poser since v1.0 - so when I say I know of it\u0027s pro\u0027s and con\u0027s, trust me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is just a few things off the top of my head that I can think of why I never used poser to animate for KSP..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Too high Poly. The average poser model is 250,000 polygons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. No rigging support for Unity. Poser was designed to Render and run in it\u0027s own IDE, and bring others things into it, not the other way around. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So you can\u0027t export something from Poser to Kerbal, there is a few processes you would need to take to do that, each one requiring\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E a third party 3d modelling software as a work-inbetween Poser and Unity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Daz3d and poser are pretty much the same thing, Poser just has a better interface. Daz was a poser user that got so good, he ended up creating his own\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E version, which to this day I absolutely hate. It\u0027s a terrible program to use. Good thing it\u0027s free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E** Note DAZ Studio now has more Export features than Poser, so you might find this could also be a go, but as I said, interface sucks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Buildings, and other structures are ok in poser, just more work at baking textures, as they need to be. Poser considers all meshes to be double sided too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Everything you do in poser is based on an animation that is rendered and post processed, you are not doing any of that in KSP, the model needs to be in its raw format.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Kinetics for Poser are extremely complicated (as in alot more of them) compared to Blender kinetics. You can cut it down yes, but the animation suffers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Poser Pro comes with a plugin for Max which imports PZ3 scenes, including animations - but within Max it appears as a keyframed mesh, not a rigged biped. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. It can work if you do all your editing in Poser and refresh Max to update the mesh, . You can bake the meshes into Max so you can edit them, but doing so breaks the link to the PZ3 file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10. If you want to transfer the Poser character into Max so your rigging goes across, then the most common solution is to export/import through a Collada file, but once in Max it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not as easy to go back again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-08T01:01:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2013 01:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Devo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T13:04:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELol, thanks for the thread hijack. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew video up covering some simple UV texture mapping tools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess the next video will be setting up the model in Unity. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KhaosCorp","CreatedById":61149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-02T19:15:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you SOOOO much for these vids!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am very new to 3d modeling and Blender (actually just downloaded it friday).
