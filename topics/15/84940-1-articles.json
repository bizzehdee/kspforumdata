I started testing because I really wanted to see how much I can benefit from it. results were unexpected to me. I just tested again with the same large tank scaled up 3x (that\u0027s about all the VAB can handle without extension plugin). holding 10x fuel. each tank weighs 720t. with 3 tanks and using node sizes 1, 2, and 3, same attach arrangement as before. Results were about the same. considerable rubber banding for size 1 node; negligible for size 2 and 3. Node size can go up quite high, 1000 or so. I think most benefit is from increased node size rather than number of nodes. and biggest beneficiary would be surface attach nodes since there\u0027s no green ball to block visibility.
