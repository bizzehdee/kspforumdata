I practiced with some basic shapes like cubes and cylinders beforehand, but can I unwrap my model? No. It looks like a spider on caffeine has tried to make a web in my UV image viewer \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E, and now I have no idea what to do.

The more you practice the more you\u0027ll do the things that seem difficult or tedious now automatically, and you\u0027ll find your textures look twice as good for what seems like no extra effort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlipping normals has to do with your model not your texture. I typically handle this while modeling when I create new faces that are not correct. I don\u0027t know what program you\u0027re using, but in 3ds Max there is an option to \u0022unify\u0022 normals, as well as flip them, so you can make all of your selected faces the same and if they are still wrong then you can flip them all at once. I imagine Blender has fairly similar options somewhere. In 3ds the indication of whether a polygon is facing inward or outward is indicated by it being darkened and greyed when inward facing. You can also just make a quick render to see exactly what is happening with your model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother trick that probably works in almost any program is to make your materials double sided.
