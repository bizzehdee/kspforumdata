I\u0027m overlapping to add decoration to larger, tiled faces. Specifically, I\u0027m creating buildings for the KerbTown plug-in / Kerbin City. Here\u0027s an example where I\u0027ve overlaid a plane with a door texture on top of a wall that uses a tiled texture (ignore the fact that the door is upside down :-) ):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HyPM6El.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HyPM6El.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the same situation in another part of the scene where the textures are interfering with one another:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LYlzlUH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LYlzlUH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI run into two situations with this modeling. Either the meshes are too close together and I get interference from some perspective or distance (rounding in rendering) or I move the overlaid mesh far enough away that there is no texture interference, but it is clear when you get close that there is a gap between the two meshes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a minimum distance of separation to avoid texture interference? (or is there not because the rounding errors vary with distance?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs the only way to avoid this to make a \u0022cut out\u0022 in the underlying mesh and then fit the overlaid mesh in the resulting \u0022hole?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a completely different technique someone could point out to me?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T04:50:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve experienced similar things. Some things I\u0027ve done which have improved my results: separate the meshes by a short distance (a few cm in Blender) ... or ... experiment with different shaders in Unity ... or ... flip the normals of a problem mesh. There are probably other things but this is what I\u0027ve experienced. As to cutting meshes, I\u0027ve not needed to do that, although I\u0027ve joined meshes.

The problem I tried to describe is commonly called \u0022z-fighting.\u0022 You can google that term to read more. Basically, when two meshes are co-planar, the render engine doesn\u0027t know which mesh to draw, so it picks one. If it picks a different one every few render cycles, you get flickering. \u0022Co-planar\u0022 is hard to nail down in a game like KSP because you can zoom anywhere from right against a texture to kilometers away. What was not co-planar within a few meters becomes co-planar at distance, because the range of numbers is limited and becomes coarser. The only solution in this situation is to remove the mesh you don\u0027t want to render. So, I\u0027ll have some geometry editing to do...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-18T01:08:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe other solution to z-fighting is to slightly offset the two layers - much easier to do then deleting faces.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-18T04:13:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, another thing I\u0027ve done is ADD yet another mesh. (It was for translucency effects.) But sumghai has a good suggestion. One way to offset the planarity is to ever so slightly rotate one of the meshes.
