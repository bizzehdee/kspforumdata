Googled a little, learned: Blender can be used to convert between the two. Problem now is, importing fails with a generic \u0027Cannot create image.\u0027 error... (Blender 2.58)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found a absolute path to the texture in the .dae wich was pointing to HarvesteR\u0027s desktop... fixed that but I still can\u0027t import the mesh, same error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I delete the whole section with the texture the error disapears and the import fails without error, I love when software does that...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there anyone who could help me out here? Any way of converting from dae to obj would do I guess...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried a second program, meshlab, but it only imports vertex data and no faces :-\\\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf all else fails, does anyone know how a radial decoupler is set up? I noticed some parts stay on the rocket when I blow one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, how far are two objects connected with a standart radial decoupler apart?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImporting would make me happier than a bunch of numbers though...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks a bunch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Privateer","CreatedById":3492,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-29T22:23:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAutoDesk has a free converter that works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConvert to FBX first then convert to obj.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Search for AutoDesk FBX converter will give you the link.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darrknox","CreatedById":2513,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-29T22:42:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E3ds max, Maya, Cinema4D and Sketchup are all programs that I believe can easily process .dae\u0027s.
