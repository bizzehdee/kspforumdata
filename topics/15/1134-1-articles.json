UV mapping and other stuff you still need something like Blender. \n\nI\u0027d love to be able to use it to model some things as I am fairly proficient with it. I just haven\u0027t used it for making game objects.\n\nCheers\n\nSkunky"},{"CreatedByName":"Jack","CreatedById":265,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-28T00:39:55Z","Content":"[http://forums.sketchucation.com/viewtopic.php?f=323\u0026t=33448](http://forums.sketchucation.com/viewtopic.php?f=323\u0026t=33448)\n\n ;D\n\nHappy model making."},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-28T00:50:59Z","Content":"Ok, well then.

There is one downside though. Unless you have the plugins to change the settings, Sketchup will delete/remove textures, resize and change the axis (rotation) of parts. So you may end up with the wrong sizes and no textures.\n\nHowever, you can model in Sketchup and then use Blender or some other program to texture and export back into KSP. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
