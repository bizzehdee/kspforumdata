Just a small reserve of solid fuel with high ASL \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E mini deployable engines for the final suicide touch down. It would also house a deployable airbrake to aerobrake in the lower atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow would i go about increasing the drag value for the pod when the\u00A0 air brakes are deployed? Iv\u0027e looked at cfg files for the stock air brake and also the grid fins from the re usable parts mod and i can\u0027t seem to figure it out. Also, do imported animations from blender affect the actual mesh when deployed? As in the case of the storage containers and landing gear. It would seem that there are two drag cube values for a deployed state and stowed state. Any pointers to the proper cfg modules would be great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bottle Rocketeer 500","CreatedById":178766,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-02T22:03:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/179693-dundrogen/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022179693\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/179693-dundrogen/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Dundrogen\u003C/a\u003E The airbrakes are controlled by the ModuleAeroSurface, in which you specify how far to deploy it and how much drag it creates when deployed, etc. In the airbrakes config, the ModuleFxLookAtConstraint is just to animate the piston part, so no animations in blender needed for this.
