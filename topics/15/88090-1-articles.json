Would it be possible to switch animations on events, like day/night cycle or based upon the weather mod which uses FAR to simulate wind? \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96031-Kerbal-Weather-Systems%21-Alpha-0-0-3-5e-WIP%21-%28Oct-17%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis one.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for your answers!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, if #1 is not possible but someone wants to create a plugin that would allow this behaviour, I\u0027d gladly contribute the assets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have great ideas to enhancing it further if this should come alive.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-21T14:18:21Z\u0022 title=\u002210/21/2014 02:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ximrm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-21T13:33:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, Kerbal constructs allows for animated scenery objects, although they\u0027d have to be placed individually. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStatic objects don\u0027t need to have a collision mesh, many of the scenery objects in KSC\u002B\u002B for instance don\u0027t have a collider\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve a feeling that several dozen animated trees in close proximity could act as a Kraken attractant \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is some work being done on day and night cycles, though how you could incorporate weather eludes me and I\u0027m fairly certain that the animation calculations plus weather on the aforementioned several dozen trees could lead to frame rate drops etc\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ximrm","CreatedById":111063,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-21T14:12:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just want normal scatter objects that have animations, everything the same, no colliders but (baked) animation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the simulation..I don\u0027t want to calculate anything, just faking it. Let\u0027s say the wind speed increases the animation speed of the trees increases or changes. I don\u0027t know how the Kraken should strike if no real physics are involved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, a randomizer could be enough or the animation settings depend on biomes. (ie. trees wiggle more in the highlands, almost no animation in lower altitude areas and a bit at the shores)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027d like to have it implemented at fixed points, so you don\u0027t have to set it manually, maybe just exchange the stock trees to the animated ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course there would be the issue with random rotation along the y-axis for the trees and a baked animation might look strange if there\u0027s heavy wind but each tree wiggles(sry, I have no other word for it) in another direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s an issue that can be fixed later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust checking the possibility first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure how KSC\u002B\u002B works but if it is possible to fake it this way and save the positions of the trees (to share it) without too much memory hunger.
