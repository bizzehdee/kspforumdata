I just started working on importing models to the game and I am wondering if there is a difference in the memory footprint of one vs the other. It seems like DDS is a popular format nowadays but I did not see the option to export DDS out of Unity. Can I just manually assign a texture through the Part cfg data file?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-01T18:48:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDDS will be better in the long run, but Part Tools can\u0027t create them. So what I do is let Part Tools export as MBM for in-game testing, and before release I use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Telanor/DDS4KSP/releases\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDDS4KSP\u003C/a\u003E to convert them to DDS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hoojiwana","CreatedById":57079,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-01T19:32:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExactly as NecroBones said. I use the Nvidia tools for Photoshop to make DDS files rather than DDS4KSP since I don\u0027t like the texture degradation that happens due to the multiple compressions/conversions that occur otherwise, it\u0027s not a big issue though. It doesn\u0027t particularly matter how you make the file, as long as the DDS has the same filename as the MBM. I seem to remember hearing somewhere here that if you export from Unity as anything other than MBM, the DDS file that replaces it may not be picked up right by the game. Not entirely sure if that\u0027s just something I\u0027m misremembering though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-01T20:07:21Z\u0022 title=\u002202/01/2016 08:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by hoojiwana\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-01T20:14:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far I\u0027ve only run into that problem when exporting as PNG (or was it TGA?
