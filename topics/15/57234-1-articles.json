But I also want to play with the big boys on Blender, and have been groping around the program figuring a few things out. My issue right now is that Blender refuses to let me open the files I\u0027ve exported out of SketchUp (.dae format) without crashing. The file will load. I will be inside this model. When I try zooming out, it crashes. I can however open the .dae file on Preview and look at it (no holes, all faces are the right direction).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny tips, tricks, ideas, help? I want to texture this model (or at least try, heh).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raoulsch","CreatedById":92843,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T00:31:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExport sketchup using the Obj file to blender.. thats what i have to do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
