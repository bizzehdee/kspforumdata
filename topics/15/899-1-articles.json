Sure, I managed to take a sphere and kinda stretch it into a deflated blob of an engine nozzle, but then I couldn\u0027t figure out how to do things like... add more nodes to expand my mesh and form a combustion chamber, or to form a set of nodes into a radially-symmetric form after diverging, or EVEN FRIGGIN\u0027 UNDO A MISTAKE. And now, the fact that I\u0027m on a MacBook seemed to aggravate things, seeing how I have no MMB and have to use my num-pad to look around, and that half the supposed keyboard commands didn\u0027t work (including said undo shortcut). And THEN I found out that Blender 2.5 and onward was supposed to be the version with the NEW AND IMPROVED INTERFACE.

I could now build the thing EXACTLY the way I wanted - structuring the general outline from a few 2D jigs, placing nodes EXACTLY where I wanted them instead of having to stretch them from some arbitrarily-generated primitive, connecting nodes where and when I wanted, deleting or hiding faces at my own whim so that I may work unobstructed behind them, going up to the toolbar for most things and to a conventional menu for more advanced features... and in no time at all, I\u0027d made myself a glorious reproduction of the Atlas V\u0027s RD-180:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i55.tinypic.com/atnlnl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022atnlnl.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Atlas_V_rocket_raised.jpg/398px-Atlas_V_rocket_raised.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022398px-Atlas_V_rocket_raised.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, yeah. I know I can export it as .dae, but the issue is I don\u0027t know much of what to do beyond that. I don\u0027t know how to go about making a separate collision mesh and tagging it as node_collider, and I don\u0027t know how to go about UV mapping or texturing.
