Is this possible? I tried creating two empty game objects named \u0022smokePoint\u0022 and set the effects to use that transform. But I only get one trail in game.\n\nNot a big deal, and as I think about it, probably only need to use one trail anyway to get roughly the same visual effect.\n\nTHE SOLUTON: This is fully explained in the thread, but to summarize: in Unity, you need to set up a separate transform, each with a unique name for each smoke trail effect you wish to use. Then, in your part config, you just create a separate entry for each effect and point each entry at a separate transform.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-12T09:24:29Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2015 09:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kurld**"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T11:10:07Z","Content":"I think you need to setup on effect per smoke origin and use different transform name.

There are two thrustTransform\u0027s on the first stage and two smokePoint\u0027s on it. The FX which is using the thrustTransform works perfect, two nice flames come from the thrustTransform, but the smoke which should be coming from the two smokePoint\u0027s only appears on one smokePoint. I didn\u0027t got a real solution for this, as you said, making only one smokePoint which is in the Center of the stage emitting the smoke then.\n\nMaybe a Plugin guy could have a look at Squad\u0027s Smoke System...? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kurld","CreatedById":79950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T12:47:18Z","Content":"Also, I found this thread which seems to explain how to do it.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/48222-2-nozzles-in-a-engine](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/48222-2-nozzles-in-a-engine)\n\nit sounds like in my case, the paths to each smokePoint need to be different.

Smoke trail can eat up all your FPS if you are not careful however, I would use it sparingly.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/87101](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/87101)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kurld","CreatedById":79950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T08:11:22Z","Content":"I did get 4 working. Not sure it\u0027s a major improvement over a single one pointed straight down.\n\nSorry I wasn\u0027t more clear on my other question.\n\nI had always thought the heirarchy for multiple thrustTransforms needed to be broken out into separate paths with separate objects for each nozzle, etc. But what I found as I was doing this project was that you can just put them anywhere under the game object which has part tools. So, basically I had that as the root object and its children were the model, a collider, 4 smoke trail transforms (each with different names) and 4 thrust transforms, (each named the same).\n\nI guess what I was asking was, why put them into more of a tree-like structure? My assumption is you would do that if you wanted to animate them. Is this true? Are there any other reasons?"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T14:46:24Z","Content":"any transform that is a child of the PartTools Scripts object can be used in a part module, assuming it has the correct object name needed by a part module. No need to split objects with same name into separate branches, except smoke trail transform apparently (I never used multiple smoke trails so don\u0027t know first hand). Other than animation and for your own organizational preferences, hierarchy doesn\u0027t benefit from being tree-like structure."},{"CreatedByName":"Kurld","CreatedById":79950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T09:19:37Z","Content":"Thanks.
