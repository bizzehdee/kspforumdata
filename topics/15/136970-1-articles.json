I suggest you look up some tutorials on how to use the UV tools in your 3d software of choice. It\u0027s hard to give direct advice on exactly how to do it, since you can use more than one way to get the same result.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EStill, if I were you I\u0027d take those propellers down a few notches. They have more curvature detail than they need, and you could easily get your model down to less than 1,500 tris without much loss of detail. But then again, 7k tris is not going to bring the game to a halt, so it\u0027s up to you. For reference, I threw together a very quick \u0022sketch\u0022 of your model to show how it could be done with less tris, but this was before you posted your updated images and it does not include propellers. Still, you can see that it has pretty much the same level of detail when viewed from a distance, and weighing in at less than 500 tris, you\u0027d still have another 500 or 1,000 tris to spend on the blades. I also included some screens of one of my models along with the textures (UVs laid on top) in case that would help you figure out how to properly unwrap things.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/JkMvN/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bananashavings","CreatedById":156147,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-15T18:43:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222515594\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022136970\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460745248\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022160047\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022heliobyte\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 minutes ago, heliobyte said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, it is not supposed to do that.
