There are two[] parts of any part in KSP, the visible model and the colliders, and really this can entail any number of actual models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople have loaded some absurd visible models into KSP and had it operate, shortly after .20 came out a guy imported a movie quality Millenium Falcon model and the real issue was that he had HD textures on it; ****loads of textures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s really the third component of the two, textures take up lots of memory, doesn\u0027t matter what you do. Models don\u0027t. In my mod I have 218KB of .mu files, prepared models; and 2.17MB in textures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite the variance in computer power from player to player, KSP is limited to about 3.5GB total useable RAM due to being 32bit. No matter how good your or somebody else\u0027s graphics card is, textures are the real enemy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo put it in numbers, a decent computer can in the right circumstance handle 4000 tris without issue, I haven\u0027t heard of people going beyond that too successfully; But large textures will cut that down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you have the colliders, which are physically active and as such MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE. And also in KSP likely to behave strangely if the collider mesh is too dense with verts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR The visible meshes are only expensive in graphics power, which in a game like this is usually available to spare; the textures take up a very limited resource so use them wisely. Colliders are expensive, have as little detail as you can get by with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
