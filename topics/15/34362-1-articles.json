I also have worked with CAD and photo editing programs before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor an initial KSP modding project, I figured that an SRB pack would be simple enough. I\u0027d like to add variety to our current limited selection, and if possible, build in the decouples and parachutes to help with part counts.
