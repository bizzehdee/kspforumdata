Again I\u0026#39;m updating my .90 era mods to work with the current version and.... \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI never managed to get the stock landing gear module working before, and I was using Firespitter for airbrakes and some control surfacey stuff, so I just used FSWheel and moved along.... but now the stock aero pieces are to the point where I can make it fly without firespitter... which leaves the landing gear as the only thing that are dependent on FS, and whenever I CAN clear a dependency, I like to... \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow - The biggest hassle is that my development computer is rather dead and I haven\u0026#39;t taken the time to put the hard drive into an external enclosure yet... so I don\u0026#39;t have any of the original blender or unity source files handily available. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhich brings me to my first problem with the landing gear - at the moment the animation seems to be reversed of what the modul expects... because my gear show as retracted when they\u0026#39;re deployed and vice versa.. which means that when they LOOK like they\u0026#39;re deployed... the wheel collider and such are actually disabled, so they\u0026#39;re sticking through the ground. Is there any way to reverse the animation in the .cfg file?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;ve tried flipping both startingState and StartDeployed and these seem to relate to whether the gear loads deployed or folded in the editor/flight scenes, but not whether the animation in the file begins deployed or retracted? Am I missing something simple, I hope? If not... is there a less painful way to work backwards from the .mu to reverse the animation... or do I really need to dig out the original project to make it work?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks! \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nArt\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T18:52:13Z","Content":"\nReverse the animation in your 3D app?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"artwhaley","CreatedById":118388,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T20:03:45Z","Content":"\nThat\u0026#39;s the problem - I don\u0026#39;t HAVE easy access to the .blend or the unity source files, so I\u0026#39;m hoping there\u0026#39;s something I can do FROM the .mu.
