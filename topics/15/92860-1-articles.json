That could be a problem. When you tried the capsule collider, did you use that in place of the other mesh, or in addition? I\u0027d try just one, very simple collider and see if that works. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWherever I can get away with it, I try to use a 12-sided cylinder, like the fuel tanks, or even simpler. Obviously sometimes you don\u0027t have a choice, and might need several collision meshes, or other complexity. But even for an engine, usually a capsule or cylinder collider is fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat works for me: Collider as a separate mesh in Blender.
