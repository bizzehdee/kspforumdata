Imported that texture into Blender, only to find, 6 of my faces were upside down, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimple enough I selected those faces and rotated the UVs till it was correct. I went on to another object, only to look back at the main cylinder and now 6 different faces had rotated 180 degrees. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI swear I\u0027m not crazy, can anyone tell me what\u0027s going on?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SasquatchM","CreatedById":11888,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T03:29:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor simple objects mark certain edges as seams and just use the unwrap function, in a cylinder for example, just mark the edge loops on the top an bottom of the cylinder ( the outside edge of the circle ) and on of the edges that go the length of the cylinder. When you unwrap you should see 2 circles and a sheet of retangles on your UV map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow when you say your faces where upside down, do you mean upside downin the UV map or that the normals were reversed?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
