Does anyone have any idea of\u00A0what trickery Squad used to achieve this? I would like to replicate this function for one of my own parts but\u00A0cannot see anything obvious in the part cfg. The behaviour is more obvious if you try radially symmetry, where two covers point forward and one points backwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s an image of what I mean:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022_e570754cb8784eadad06643b50997ae8\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.cubbyusercontent.com/pl/GearFixedSymmetry.PNG/_e570754cb8784eadad06643b50997ae8\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks,\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Zodius\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-05T23:16:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0mirrorRefAxis = 0, 0, 1 in the config file\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntakes a bit of trial and error though depending on the direction your gear is exported out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZodiusInfuser","CreatedById":76163,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-05T23:31:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI saw that, but it didn\u0027t register in my head.
