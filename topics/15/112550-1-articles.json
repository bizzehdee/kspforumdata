See the code fragment below:\n\n    \tMODEL\t{\t\tmodel = Squad/Parts/Utility/mk2CrewCabin/model\t\t// The following two lines work with the standard mesh scaled to 2x the height\t\t// to match the size of the Large Crewed Lab\t\ttexture = Squad/Parts/Utility/mk2CrewCabin/mk2CrewCabin\t\tscale = 1,2,1\t\t// The following is what I\u0027m trying to make work\t\t// texture = Squad/Parts/Science/LargeCrewedLab/Large_Crewed_Lab\t\t//scale = 1,1,1\t}\tmesh = model.mu\trescaleFactor = 1\tnode_stack_top = 0.0, 1.875, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0\tnode_stack_bottom = 0.0, -1.875, 0.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0\n\nThe commented out code just doesn\u0027t work. I did some research, and it appears that there is something inside the model itself which is interfering with what I want to do.\n\nSo,\n\n1. Is this something that I can do without too much problem? Can you provide instructions?\n\nor\n\n2. Is there someone who can help me with this?\n\nThanks in advance\n\nLGG"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T13:04:16Z","Content":"The code snippets you\u0027re showing are only part of what needs to happen.\n\nThe model has something that is referred to as \u0022UV mapping\u0022 (the \u0022U\u0022 and \u0022V\u0022 were chosen since they\u0027re near X,Y,Z in the alphabet and additional letters were needed).

It\u0027s a simple shape and UV map.\n\nAll the files are in the folder ../GameData/Squad/Parts/FuelTank/RCSFuelTankR25/\n\nTricky bit: you need a texture editor that can load .dds files. There is a plugin for the GIMP, and that\u0027s all free. There are other options.\n\nMake a copy of the folder and work on the copy. It\u0027s worth having your own personal ../GameData subfolder and even better to have a folder for working on files.\n\nThe file with the visible texture for that model is named model000.dds\n\nYou can change the rectangle to change the texture for the outside of the tank. It\u0027s like a sheet of paper that\u0027s wrapped around.\n\nWhen you save the file as .dds, remember compression, and tell the editor prog to create the mipmaps\n\nBest change the name and desription in the .cfg file. Put the revised set of files in a folder in your personal /GameData subfolder, start KSP, and it should be sitting there ready. Check how it looks.\n\nPay attention to the existing texture. I found that I had to do a vertical flip so that text came out right. That model has some text on the top and bottom of the tank, and you can see how that works out.\n\n(I was making a combined RCS Tank and battery. The part.cfg changes are fairly simple, and I spent an hour or two making a distinctive texture. There\u0027s a trade-off between texture-size and detail. I tried to put in too much detail. It ended up looking like a blurred blob.)"}]}
