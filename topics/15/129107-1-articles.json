For example the stock SLS solid. I like how the plume looks, but it\u0027s too big for my smaller kicker solids. If it is possible to change the size of the plume, which values in the .cfg would I need to change to get it smaller?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T16:21:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can only change the emission rates.
