Same with copying the window layer to the luminosity layer. If you need to change just one feature you don\u0027t need to redo the entire texture. You can also try out features you\u0027re not sure will look good like a logo or text or a noise layer over the color layer to simulate grime or wear.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-25T00:28:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing you may do after selecting the islands you wish to color is to (in Gimp) go to Select\u0026gt;Grow.
