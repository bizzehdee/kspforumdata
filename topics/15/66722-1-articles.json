Unity is an interesting beast. Obviously you are wanting to save on file size with the TGA. I haven\u0027t tried that, as I have always used the MBM format (simply because Squad does so). I\u0027ve not had any problems with MBM. Interestingly, .tga origins are in video, rather than still images. The problem you describe may be occurring if Unity is using a lossless compression scheme like PackBits or such. The problem is that said compression is geared for simple graphics (think, generated characters and graphics in video) more so than for photographic images. Since that form of compression is probably lossless, you get the larger file size \u003Cem\u003E(edit: and worse looking results)\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-25T17:31:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dispatcher\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dispatcher\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...lossless...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell.
