My envisioned goal is to make several parts that will mesh with B9_Aerospace and Stock Squad parts, but with a focus on VTOL applications. I already got my big toe wet a while back trying to build the Eagle 5 (almost everthing worked except the wings and the wheels....damn those wheels!!!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI need information on building a landing leg with some sort of suspension. That one image of the stock wheel assembly confuses and infuriates me almost as much as the concept of \u0022wuv\u0022. Seriously though I have no idea. Seeing as these landing legs will not need to produce locomotion or roll at all, I\u0027m hoping it will be easier. I know how to animate the parts and even get the animation to work in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have no idea how to make a working wing. I was told that, even if immobile, the wing needs a separate control surface or something. I really have no clue on that one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny documentation that I could be pointed toward that still holds up to the new version of KSP would be appreciated greatly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now comes the touchy subject of source models. I want my parts to mesh with the B9 and Squad fuselages and parts as seamlessly as possible, but I cannot seem to be able to import them into 3D Studio Max to assure a good fit. I actually only need the cross sections of the various fuselage types, not even the models, themselves. But I have no idea on how to go about getting that stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first intended fuselage adapter is what I guess could be called a \u0022Doughnut Mount\u0022, basically it will be a small section of fuselage with a smooth hole punched in it, with a node inside that will allow the mounting of an air breathing propeller (I\u0027d need Firespitter for that wouldn\u0027t I? :S), Air breathing jet, or a new type of engine I want to include that is basically a hollow ring engine that will light up with an emissive, but will not produce particles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will construct my Wings in a similar fashion, but with smaller engine holes (for style...and stability).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut here\u0027s where my wings get a little weirder: They are also housing the landing legs. I want them to be able to, at the gear deployment command, have small, slim panels extend out of the wing and move to position as landing legs. I plan to build small canards that can bend down and telescope out for the same purpose. In addition to radially mountable leg pods the will extend downward or sideways downward the the case of bottom mounting or side mounting, respectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will try to sketch out the ideas on paper tomorrow, so that it will be a little more clear. Right now these are all just wacky ideas I have floating around in my head from a severe lack of sleep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
