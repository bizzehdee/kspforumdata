Is there something I am missing to do with what needs to be facing z\u002B? \n\nI have also tried making an empty in unity and parenting it to a panel and changing its local orientation and setting that as raycastTransform with the same result, always the same edge points to the sun...\n\nok I have done this over and over now, remade it from the ground up making sure everything is lined up the same as the set i made that work, no matter what happens they just point edge on! really confused, thought maybe it was the config because that is the only thing that has remained the same over the multiple version but i can\u0027t see anything in it that could possibly cause this so I am stumped.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T12:02:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 12:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Squiggsy**"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T16:05:05Z","Content":"If raycastTransform is the object that rotates dynamically in the game then obviously rotating it in Unity wont work, right?

I\u0027ve never done panels before but if I had to guess you need to rotate the hierarchy UNDER that parent not the parent itself.\n\nhmm but surely since its the local orientation I\u0027m changing (in blender) and the local orientation moves with the object, it will always be the same relative to the object regardless of dynamic movement? \n\nthe problem is that with panels you have to make a parent chain going from the last panel up the chain to the main parent which is the pivot point, and changing the local orientation of the pivot point will change the way it pivots, which ruins the whole thing.\n\nthen again i get very confused trying to get my head around roations in unity and blender because orientations change from one to the other, the thing that is really odd is that I looked back at my first set of panels that work fine and sorted all the local orientations so they were the same as that one, re animated it and still got the exact same result,"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T16:35:00Z","Content":"I\u0027m pretty sure the game rotates this object absolutely, not incrementally from what you set it.
