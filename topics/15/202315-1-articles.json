I used the Bumped Emissive Specular shader and got a dark/metallic effect in game (that wasn\u0027t there when I used the Bumped Diffuse shader). The issue peristed when I lowered the shinyness value to 0. There\u0027s no Bumped Emissive Diffuse shader present, so I\u0027m a little stumped on how to deal with this. Anyone know what to do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
