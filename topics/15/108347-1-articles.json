It\u0027s missing some important bits, but it\u0027s leaps and bounds ahead of what I could do a week ago. I find the more I get into it, the more questions I have.\n\nShould I be creating collider models in Blender or in Unity? I\u0027ve seen both, though admittedly the unity created collider was not for an engine.\n\nSame question for thrust transform and attach nodes, unity or blender?\n\nAnd finally (for now), any suggestions on programs to create a normal map without the nvidia scripts for photoshop? Because photoshop wants a monthly fee, and that\u0027s lunacy."},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T05:20:00Z","Content":"All of that should probably be done in Unity, though you can use blender empty objects to make the transforms and nodes too. You can also make simple cylinder colliders for engines and just turn it into a physics-\u003Emesh collider in Unity; you can also do that to the actual engine models too, as long as you check \u0022concave\u0022 it\u0027ll fill in the polygons needed to make a solid shape physX will recognize. The third option is to add Unity primitive colliders (capsules or cubes) to your hierarchy. I\u0027ve done all three, there\u0027s a right time for all of them.\n\nAs for normal maps, there are normal map generators out there, but if you need an image editor you can try \u0022gimp\u0022 which is a free open source \u0022photoshop\u0022 type program, and there\u0027s a clone of the nvidia plugin for it: [https://code.google.com/p/gimp-normalmap/](https://code.google.com/p/gimp-normalmap/)\n\nNever used it though; Personally I use Corel Paintshop Pro, which is an old competitor of Photoshop and most photoshop plugins are compatible with it, including the Nviidia one. It\u0027s much much cheaper than Photoshop and a one time fee, but its also different in a few ways so you might want to do some research."},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T17:03:16Z","Content":"Thanks for the tips!\n\nYour tutorial helped me out a lot. Between yours and the coffee cup (totally related, I know) tutorial on youtube, the whole mess just clicked in my brain. It was literally in a space of maybe five minutes that it went from trying to decipher an alien language to making (relative) sense."},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T20:50:53Z","Content":"Well, I managed to get a working engine in-game, with some minor issues. I even put a fairing on it! =D\n\nThere was some minor hilarity due to the rotation of my thrustTransform node at first.\n\nOnly lingering issues seem to revolve around Blender/Unity. For some reason, objects that have two \u0022facings\u0022 (such as the fairing, the outsidewall and the inner wall) are getting their textures flipped between Blender and Unity, IE the inside wall texture gets placed on the outside wall, and the outside wall is semi-transparent so you can actually see the inner wall. Does the same thing for on my engine nozzle as well."},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T21:55:19Z","Content":"IN blender, make sure you\u0027re in edit mode, then hit \u0022N\u0022 to open the properties of your model (in a vertical meny inset in the main window) then scroll to the bottom until you find \u0022Normals\u0022\n\nNormals determine which side of a 2d face reflects lighting and is thus visible, if they are flipped backwards then the outward facing side will be transparent, but it will show up through the model on the other side.\n\nIn the normals section you\u0027ll want to click on the small button that has the face highlighted, if you hover it says \u0022Display face normals as lines\u0022 - click that and then adjust the length so you can tell which way each line points. You\u0027ll see that the troublesome faces have no lines (they\u0027re actually pointing \u0022inward\u0022)\n\nThere are a couple of ways to fix them. The way I do it is via the left tool panel (the one with the vertical tabs) Click on the Shading/UVs tab and you\u0027ll see another \u0022Normals\u0022 heading with 2 buttons; Flip and recalculate. Flip works by flipping all faces you currently have selected, so you can use sift\u002Bright click on the model to select the incorrect faces and then hit Flip to fix them. Recalculate takes the whole model and tries to decide which faces should be visible and adjusts the normals accordingly. Recalculate works in MOST cases but it won\u0027t handle some complex geometry quite right. Be ready to Undo and try the other method if you don\u0027t like the outcome.\n\nOnce that is done you can save and the changes should appear in Unity for you to re-export to KSP.\n\nThis post has some more info in it; he and I may be using different versions of Blender so the tools may be in different places.

Then find it in the Unity assets list, click on it and in its info panel change the texture type to Normal Map, then uncheck Create from Greyscale if its checked, the other defaults are normally okay to begin with. Hit Apply.\n\nOnce that is done you need to click on the Material for your model and make sure the shader is set to KSP/Bumped or Bumped Specular, this adds the 2nd texture slot for the normal map, select it and you should see the added detail on your model in the scene right away, and now when you export it will put both texture files in there.\n\nYou might want to adopt a naming convention for your normal maps, the standard one for KSP mods is using the same name as your diffuse texture and then added \\_NRM; so like engineTex.dds and engineTex\\_NRM.dds\n\n(Note: if you use KSP/Bumped Specular you might want to add a specular map to your diffuse texture to tell it where it should be shiny/reflective and where it should be matte/dull. You can also change the settings on the material to change exactly how shiny the part is overall. That\u0027s a bit more advanced, so get the basics down first."}]}
