The top and bottom faces are now basically one polygon with N-number of sides (being equal to the number of edges around the ring of the cylinder)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey added this \u0027N-Gon\u0022 support in a recent version of blender, and cylinders are being created like that, so that particular step is invalid. You can re-create those \u0022spokes\u0022 easily enough. Highlight the top and hit E for the Extrude tool and move the mouse up. notice how it clones the ring and makes a new \u0027section\u0027 of the cylinder?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enow hit S for scale and shrink it down until the vertices of the new ring converge in the middle. Then swap to vertex select mode, select just those few vertices, and go to Edit, Vertices, Merge (and select \u0022at Center\u0022) This is also a good place to use circle-select mode by hitting C and painting the area you wish to select (its basically an AOE selection tool. Scroll wheel changes the circle size, left click is for selecting, and Center mouse button is de-select)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enow you have a single unified vertex in the middle. Select it if its not already, and hit G then Z and drag the mouse down to move it \u0022down\u0022 on the Z axis until the top is flat again. (hitting G starts Grab/Move mode, and Z locks the action to the Z axis)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I explained all of that to give some tips for manipulating the mesh. You don\u0027t NEED to do it that way. Way back in the step then you ADD the mesh and spawns in the main view, if you look at the bottom left where it lets you set up the height and diameter, there is another option there; the Cap Fill type. Not surprisingly, its set to N-Gon mode. Change it to \u0022triangle fan\u0022 and then set up your height/diameter and you\u0027ll have the \u0027old style\u0027 of cylinder as shown in the video.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor KSPs usage, I would suggest using the triangle fan and avoiding \u0027N-gon\u0027 whenever you can. Not to get too technical, but upon exporting, any \u0022N-Gon\u0022 with more than 3 or 4 sides will be \u0022broken up\u0022 into smaller pieces just like the cylinder cap. For very detailed meshes, the conversion can warp your mesh in undesired ways... but that is a more advanced concern.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-05T21:59:19Z\u0022 title=\u002210/05/2012 09:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 5, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Tiberion\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
