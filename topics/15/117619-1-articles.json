I get the same stuff that are on ModuleControlSurface but the rest doesn\u0027t really make sense to me.\n\nI guess actuatorSpeed is how quick it rotates out? What about transformName? Assuming they\u0027re empty game objects like thrustTransforms for engines, why is that needed? What direction do they point in? And how do you use dragCoeff?\n\nI can\u0027t find any documentation on this module so any help is really appreciated ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Porkjet","CreatedById":92433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T10:30:13Z","Content":"transformName = name of the rotating object, the actual flap.

Now my only problem is the control surface doesn\u0027t rotate around the X axis (if I have done everything correctly).\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/MgWle](http://imgur.com/a/MgWle)\n\nYou can see here that the x axis is aligned... obj\\_ctrlSrf is just a game object because the actual mesh (Aileron object) isn\u0027t aligned right so I set obj\\_ctrlSrf as the transform. It seems more as if it rotates around the Z axis. Any advice or have I completely dun goofd?"},{"CreatedByName":"Porkjet","CreatedById":92433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T15:12:34Z","Content":"Ah right, I forgot to mention, this is a bit obscure but it seems like the parent object\u0027s X axis *also* needs to be aligned with the rotation axis. \n\nSo it might be enough to create an empty gameobject, align its axis to your CtrlSurface and use it as parent transform."},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T08:47:03Z","Content":"The first thing I\u0027d check is the axis that the animation is changing and exactly which object is being changed.
