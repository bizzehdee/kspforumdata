You will have to First open the DAE file with note pad or some other text editor and scroll through the CFG data and remove anything referring to /diffuse and everything in between too diffuse/ start and finish of the diffuse lines. Just remove those and it should open in Blender. This is due to the original model being made in some other program like Mya or 3D Max and not in Blender.
