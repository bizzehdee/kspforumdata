I\u0027m trying to modify the stock docking ports to have moving guide teeth that only allow you to dock in one orientation instead of at any angle. How do you give the teeth collision and movement in Unity, and how do you get the Deploy Limit bar like with cargo bays? I already know about the part where you have to chop concave meshes into smaller convex bites.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
