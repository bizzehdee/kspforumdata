In other words, about how many vertices in a part before it starts becoming really important to strip every last cotton picking hidden one? Along with that, is there any tool in Blender that would let me select all the faces that intersect or fall within a given volume (or mesh)?

Blender, being a 3D art program has many tools and features that KSP does not. One of these is it can use shapes that are \u0027true\u0027 curves or even make shapes out of \u0027Quads\u0027 (rectangles). However, nearly all games and graphics cards use triangles to make 3d objects and put textures on them.

You now see a blue line pointing outside. To see the same as in game you can also go to \u0027Display\u0027 and tick \u0027Textured Solid\u0027. This will use the same type of display system the game uses. So any \u0027back to front\u0027 normals will show as transparent.

I agree most of the options in Blender are not user friendly. But when we learn how to do it, it should allow us to mod anything needed.
