Now Ive created the part and exported it as a .dae file. This opens in blender, where I plan to texture it, but it is all in seperate parts which means I can\u0027t create one big texture file with all textures on the item.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not really asking for help with making or explaining whats happening but I\u0027m really asking if there are any tutorials for working with Sketchup to create a mod for KSP. A google search turned up only discussions with people only saying how Blender should be usee and the topic would then go off-topic and be closed, so please dont go off-topic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InsaneDruid","CreatedById":137849,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-10T11:02:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can combine meshes in blender by selecting them and pressing control\u002Bj.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a sidenode, personally I would highly suggest learning blender, if you want to use blender (for UV layout) anyway.
