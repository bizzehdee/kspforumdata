Now, I want to edit the textures for the model, but I can\u0027t successfully save the texture map as .png, because when I try to save it as .png, I only get the background colour. For this reason, I can\u0027t edit my textures. Could anyone tell me how to do this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rottielover","CreatedById":73403,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T18:24:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am also only a beginner, so grain of salt. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not familiar with Paint.net, I\u0027ve been using Gimp. If your only getting the background color is it possible that paint.net is only saving one layer?

Did you actually perform a UV unwrap in Blender? If so, next go to the UVs portion of the toolbar of Blender\u0027s UV/Image Editor pane. A set of options pops up and you would select Export UV Layout. The default is .png. You will then want to name the new file and then press the Export UV Layout button at the upper right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is true that a default new image is solid black, unless you specified something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you take the image file and open it in your image editor (Paint; I use Gimp but it shouldn\u0027t matter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that helps, given I don\u0027t have a clearer idea of what you actually did while in Blender.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T19:01:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zc2cHaw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zc2cHaw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I went to edit mode, select all (A) then in the bottom mapping pane I also hit A to select all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I went to UVs -\u0026gt; Export UV Layout and it prompted me to save a PNG file.
