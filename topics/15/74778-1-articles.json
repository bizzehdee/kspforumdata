I was just wondering if anyone knows if it\u0027s possible or even ok to try to get those folders down in size a bit maybe by reducing the default textures (like they did with the low res B9 pack) or even removing some default parts I may never use so as to cut way down on all memory usage, not just what mods use. Think KSP Lite. A mod friendly version. There are definitely some Squad parts I never use and wouldn\u0027t miss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not to keen on messing with the default content tho- Just wondering if anyone knows if this has been tried or is even a sound idea to free up memory and avoid memory crashes until we all have 64bit memory support and don\u0027t have to worry about it anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-11T18:07:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2014 06:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by mcbmaestro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-11T19:08:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot only is it possible, it\u0027s strongly suggested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m even running an instance at the moment that has the ARM pack deleted, and all of the Squad parts I was able to replace with mods removed. Just delete any part you don\u0027t need; but if you really want to save space, eliminate the stock IVAs (/GameData/Squad/Spaces/), just remember to edit the parts that use them to remove the INTERNAL{} block, or delete those parts too. A part that is supposed to have an IVA but the IVA doesn\u0027t exist can cause hella crashes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcbmaestro","CreatedById":59577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-12T05:51:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool thanks a lot. I didn\u0027t realize IVA\u0027s took up so much resources. Not an easy thing to part with tho, they are pretty awesome. I\u0027ve decided to have my resource manager running lately to monitor how much KSP is using, to avoid hitting that 3gig crash mark. So far it seems to hover around the 2gig mark with vanilla KSP \u002B City lights and Clouds mod. Does the game crash at 3 or below that on 32bit Unity?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-12T05:59:49Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2014 05:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by mcbmaestro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
