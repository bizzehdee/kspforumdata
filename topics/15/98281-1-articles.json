Import the blend file directly into unity it will always work better. Second some of your normals are reversed and some aren\u0027t.

I found the problem, and why it has been caused.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlender did something weird with material, and re-setting it fixed my issue. I think it has been caused, because i imported it from 32 bit Blender from Windows XP (Some ancient version).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again and good night.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
