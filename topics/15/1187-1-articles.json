And definitely if someone DID want to try to give a one-man course on 3D, then go ahead.. But what the OP is asking is a major task and the asking of the OP\u0027s question indicates he has no idea of that. \u0027Hay guise u can halp me 3d?\u0027 If he has no concept of his software this isn\u0027t the place to start learning, primarily because of the complexity of the task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the OP was asking something specific related to collision meshes for example, that\u0027s different.
