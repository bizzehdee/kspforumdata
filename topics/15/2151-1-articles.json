First step is to create a basic shape. With cylinders you can specify the number of sides, how many stacks, and how to close the ends of the shape. Make sure to check \u0027Snap to Grid\u0027 so your part is scaled to be exactly 1 meter square. Left click and drag from one grind intersection to another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.captainslug.com/temp/ksp/ksptut_02.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ksptut_02.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Now you need to \u003Cstrong\u003EMove\u003C/strong\u003E your part precisely by entering the coordinates in the boxes so that its center of mass will be the same location as the origin (0,0,0 for X,Y,Z). Enter the coordinates then hit the MOVE button next to the coordinate entry fields. If your part went the wrong way, Undo, and change the affected direction to a negative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.captainslug.com/temp/ksp/ksptut_04.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ksptut_04.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Now you can \u003Cstrong\u003EScale\u003C/strong\u003E your simple shape to the final size of the part you are trying to create. Here I am making a 3m x 3m x 0.25m cylinder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.captainslug.com/temp/ksp/ksptut_05.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ksptut_05.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. The Y axis indicator is in the way of something I need to select.

I\u0027m going to make this cylinder into a ring, so I need to \u003Cstrong\u003EExtrude\u003C/strong\u003E the top of the cylinder to add a stack to it.

With the top face \u003Cstrong\u003EExtruded\u003C/strong\u003E, I can now \u003Cstrong\u003EScale\u003C/strong\u003E it. I don\u0027t want it to move along the Y axis when being scaled, so I have checked \u0027Center of Mass\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.captainslug.com/temp/ksp/ksptut_09.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ksptut_09.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. After moving the newly \u003Cstrong\u003EExtruded\u003C/strong\u003E stack back down a precise amount to put it back at the same height where it came from, I can extrude again to make the inside of the ring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.captainslug.com/temp/ksp/ksptut_10.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ksptut_10.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9.

Duplicating some of the steps from Part One, you will need to make a node_collider mesh from a simple shape, scaled to match your visual mesh. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will need to: have the \u002702___Default\u0027 material assigned to it, be a single group named \u0027node_collider\u0027, and be a convex shape in order to work correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.captainslug.com/temp/ksp/ksptut_26.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ksptut_26.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E25. Now you are ready to export your mesh into a part folder you have created for your new part. Name your folder without using underscores. It mush include a /texture directory in it (with a texture file in it). The part.cfg file that references the correct mesh and texture file names as well as having a unique part name will also be required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe orientation of your part in-game is affected by both the node parameters in the part.cfg, and the accurate interpretation of the node_collider in your mesh.

You will need to define in your part.cfg file where your attachment nodes are. If the Scale in your part.cfg is set to 1.0, then you can get these location values directly from the mesh within milkshape.
