Blender uses a different coordinate system (z is up/down, x is left/right and y is front/back) than unity (y is up/down, z is left/right and x is front/back). When I import my objects into unity, this results in some weird behavior. In the assets screen, the preview of the blender-import as a whole has the correct rotation, but the individual meshes do not. They are being rotated, such that their bottom is now pointing to the side. When I add a mesh to the scene, it is rotated correctly again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I have finished all of the preparations and exported the part to be used in KSP, it is rotated the same way the meshes inside of the blender-import are. I suppose there must be a rather simple fix for this somewhere, but I couldn\u0027t find it. It be nice if there were some way to automate the correction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECyclonit\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-02T13:27:30Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2013 01:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Cyclonit\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded [solved] tag to title.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cyclonit","CreatedById":67359,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-02T13:23:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks to Greys from the #KSPModders channel over on esper, I was able to resolve the issue. This is the solution:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe PartTools script will always use the rotation of the object is has been added to. This means, if you use the PartTools directly onto an object, which has been imported from blender, the change in coordinate systems will screw up the mesh\u0027s rotation ingame. To avoid this, you simply add an empty GameObject to the scene (GameObject -\u0026gt; Create Empty), put your model inside of this GameObject and add the PartTools to the GameObject instead of adding them directly to the model. In my case, the menus look like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s8.postimg.org/g05rwxbkl/image.png\u0022 alt=\u0022image.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s8.postimg.org/mpcbcxwwl/image.png\u0022 alt=\u0022image.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-03T06:38:41Z\u0022 title=\u002212/03/2013 06:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Cyclonit\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
