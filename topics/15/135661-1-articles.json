The big s wing are\u00A0white on both sides, and I found out that I cannot just change one side of the wing without changing both.\u00A0I figured if I had the stock Big-s wing in white, I could have a physicsless Big-s wing in black with tiles that I could clip on the bottom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI copied the ShuttleWings folder from squad\u0026gt;parts\u0026gt;aero and place it in GameData. After I renamed the part and\u00A0modified the config for the wing to be\u00A0physicsless, I retexured the DDS. And that sort of worked. Both parts show up in game. But the issue is the model uses the DDS from squad\u0026gt;parts\u0026gt;aero\u0026gt;shuttlewings.The Shuttlewings.mu must state that the associated DDS is in that original file path, and It seems I\u00A0cannot simply copy the folder with a new DDS and expect it to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there an easier way to achieve what I am after?
