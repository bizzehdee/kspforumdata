And more days fighting against the interface in various 3D programs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end I managed to get Unity to spit out a few KSP objects, but it was a totally random thing.

Ever heard of Cad3D? It was my first 3D program on the Atari ST written by Tom Hudson who later went on to write 3D studio for Autodesk. Then I got an Amiga where there was lots of 3D software. I got pretty good at Sculpt 3D, Videoscape, Imagine, Real3D, Lightwave on the video toaster, and probably a few I\u0027ve forgotten over the years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then I got out of that hobby and didn\u0027t touch a 3D program for a couple of decades. When I went to try it again last year I found out that not only had I forgotten most of what I knew, but that relearning it was very difficult/impossible. Apparently the part of my brain that used to be good at that sort of thing is no longer functioning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bad news is that this could happen to you guys one day since the only way to prevent old age is death. So enjoy your ability to do this while you\u0027ve got it cause it might not last.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, as I said, thanks for all the advice but I think it\u0027s time to go back to playing Xbox games for a while.
