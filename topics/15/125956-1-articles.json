I have been successful at getting several parts into the game already, but this time I\u0026#39;ve run into a problem.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;m at the point where I am trying to add a mesh collider to the part. As you can see, I have a separate model, a simple rectangle, that will serve as a collider. When I try to select which mesh to use, however, this doesn\u0026#39;t show up as an option. Shouldn\u0026#39;t any model in the Assets folder show up as an option here? Does anyone know why this one isn\u0026#39;t?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/Jkr4FiAh.png[/img]\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-21T07:33:31Z\u0022 title=\u002211/21/2015 07:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aurum6\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Equestion answered\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T02:36:31Z","Content":"\nYou could try just adding a box collider.
