In other games\u0027 modeling, I see this is the case as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy the preference for triangles over quads? I know there must be a darn good reason for triangles.

A triangle will always perfectly appear in a single plane, whereas a quad isn\u0027t guaranteed to do so. However, a quad can always be broken down into triangles to achieve basically the same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-03T13:35:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etriangle is the simplest polygon, everything is triangulated in a game engine. it\u0027s under the hood. nothing you can do about it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-03T13:52:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nli2work\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nli2work\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Etriangle is the simplest polygon, everything is triangulated in a game engine. it\u0027s under the hood. nothing you can do about it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...But you should still model things using quads as much as possible.
