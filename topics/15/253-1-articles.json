For some reason, though, KSP doesn\u0027t like the files it makes. When the game loads, I get a purple silhouette of what I presume is my object, and the loading message just keeps flashing. I assume the game has crashed, because it can\u0027t progress beyond that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven taking a DAE file that comes with the game, and then exporting it back, breaks it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Just spotted the SDK download.
