The problem is: I don\u0027t know how. I tried it already with putting the sound file in the KSP/Sounds directory or KSP/GameData/Squad/Sounds, but that didn\u0027t helped. And it would be great if it would work without a plugin or module manager or whatever.. Has anybody got an idea?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-06T13:51:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edepends what sounds. Most engine sounds are built-in. to use custom sounds you need to use ModuleEngineFX. IVA prop sounds are just full file paths to the sound clip you want to use, just have to edit the config files or use MM patch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kartoffelkuchen","CreatedById":108501,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-06T13:59:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI want to install an Engine sound.
