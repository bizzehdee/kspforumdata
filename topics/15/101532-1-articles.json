The first animation runs just fine on the model but the second one never runs. Or, is there something special about tying a animation to an antenna (send crew report) config that I missed. Copied the .CFG elements from one of squads antenna files, the buttons show up in the context menu but still, no joy.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-08T14:50:39Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2015 02:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MLWostal**"}]}
