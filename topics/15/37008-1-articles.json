Is it possible for the \u0022Activate Generator\u0022 and \u0022Shutdown Generator\u0022 buttons in the GUI provided by ModuleGenerator to start and stop an animation? I can get the animation to work fine via the \u0022toggle\u0022 button that pops up when I use ModuleAnimateGeneric, but that does not activate the generator itself, and the generator buttons do not activate the animation... It seems like there should be something really simple here I am missing?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T17:44:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I know there\u0027s no mechanism for the stock modules to interact with each other like that, you\u0027ll need a custom plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheebsta","CreatedById":74167,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T17:51:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was really hoping maybe there was a state based way to call animations, like sounds, but was worried that the answer would be the one you\u0027ve given once I started looking at how the Kethane mod handles similar situations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the input.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
