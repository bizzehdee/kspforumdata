Now these two new tanks have a small coloured line, to indicate their content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the stock part, doens\u0027t have this line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is, i would like to clone the stock part, alter it texture to add a small yellow stripe, just for esthetic reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould any of you point me out, somewhere where i can alter these?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T15:11:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe mbm files are the texture files, nobody\u0027s written a conversion utility yet but they\u0027re basically just bitmaps with a custom header. There was a guide on the details but I believe it got lost in the forum crash. It wasn\u0027t particularly complicated though so if you\u0027re handy with a hex editor you can probably work it out, otherwise I believe there\u0027s a new loading system coming next patch that should allow easier retexturing so you could wait for that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JeBuSBrian","CreatedById":66324,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T15:20:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Editing_MBM_Textures\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEditing MBM Textures\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t say I\u0027ve tried it myself, but there you go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JustinKingr","CreatedById":47483,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T18:56:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022EndlessWaves\u0022 data-cite=\u0022EndlessWaves\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Enobody\u0027s written a conversion utility yet \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally?
