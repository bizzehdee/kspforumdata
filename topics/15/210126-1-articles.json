You could also set a colour grid texture with different colour boxes, using as many different shades as possible, name it to texture name and load, then you can compare where on the model matches what shade and so get an idea of the UV map layout.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy thread can get you started on using the .mu plugin if you aren\u0027t already, all software is free apart from whatever your service provider charges for data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022211123\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed8792924609\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/206781-somewhere-to-put-any-knowledge-learned-about-using-the-mu-plugin/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=4087557\u0026amp;embedComment=4087557\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment\u0022 style=\u0022height:296px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood Luck\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"quicksilver384","CreatedById":223314,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-23T14:31:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAwsome.
