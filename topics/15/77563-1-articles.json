I am using a mod called kerbPaint which requires .png or .jpeg images for texturing, reason I need the mbm\u0027s converted is so their compatible with the texturing I plan on doing. That said, I cannot figure out how to use unity and would like a few mods to be converted if it isn\u0027t that hard for you pro-unity users, I would like to convert KAX, pWings (some are already done), and TVPP new parts (and re-sized parts!). (Links later.) Once you pro-unity users have those converted send them to me somehow, I don\u0027t care how, just somehow. I will send them to the mod creator with the ones he\u0027s lacking (the ones he wants) and I will keep the rest.
