SO I think you just orient the node directly out from the face of the part, so it points AT the part that will be attached at that node...

But then it would kind of be the same thing since you would need to use \u0022Local\u0022 vs \u0022Global\u0022 orientation, to get the Z\u002B pointed in the correct direction... ??

The only thing is, it doesnt work with surface attachment nodes, only stack nodes... So I sometimes create a \u0022fake\u0022 stack node, just to get the proper coords/placement, then use the coords in a node_attachment def in the cfg... The nice thing with NodeHelper, is that it visually shows the attachment orientation, and you can see it live, while making changes to it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I apologize if i am way off base, but I figured I would post this, since I figure I, or someone else, would only post asking questions/clarifications on the thoughts I just posted, later on, so i might as well do it now, and get it out of the way... \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-01T18:25:44Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2016 06:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Stone Blue\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-02T01:43:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been placing the transform so the Z axis blue arrow is pointing to what the node will attach to - or away from the parent object.
