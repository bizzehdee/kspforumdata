You\u0027ll first need to UV map your project in whatever 3d modeling software you are using. You can technically do this in reverse, IE create your skin first then map the project to it, but either way it will have to be done. \n\nIf you\u0027re using Blender, there are many tutorials available on Youtube.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/NpkG6ygVals?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nIf you\u0027re creating your own images for textures/skins, there are some free programs available to do so, such as paint.net or GIMP. \n\n1. I\u0027m not sure what you mean by loading meshes, do you mean import existing Mu files? If so, you can do that in Blender with [this.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43513-Blender-mu-import-export-addon)\n2. You will need unity to export your models as .mu files, with the KSP part tools package installed. Preferably Unity 4.2.2 if you intend to do animations.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/EFWF6Qv9Dhk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nYou can find a link to the part tools and lots of other stuff in this thread: [Development Links Compilation-START HERE](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94638-Mod-Development-Links-Compilation-START-HERE)\n\nIt seems pretty daunting at first but it\u0027s not overly terrible really."}]}
