I think it\u0027s a config file issue.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have two animations being used, one that opens the nozzle, and one that closes it. I\u0027ve seen that the stock Panther has three\u00A0animations, but I know others get away with two.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried multiple different combinations for the animations to play at the proper time (mode switching, throttle level), and for the one that has the correct animations, bizarrely, it encounters the problem that the animation does not close the nozzle fully when it should close.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe it would help if I actually understood all of the module parameters for FXModuleAnimateThrottle? Primarily, what does \u0022layer\u0022 refer to? Is it a KSP internal layer that layers animations? How does it work?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDiscovered it was a bit of an animation curve related issue. That said, I still don\u0027t exactly understand how the layers interact, but my issue was resolved by changing one of the animations to remain a constant value, instead of throttling like I thought it should. But I still don\u0027t really understand the animation layers.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNever mind, I was ridiculously overthinking this.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-17T21:37:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2019 09:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Box of Stardust\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerboNerd","CreatedById":195433,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-07T12:51:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just do a single animation that includes the expanding of the petals and slightly shrinking with full throttle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far in my expertise of making jets, i haven\u0027t encountered a need for other animations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso it\u0027s true that i haven\u0027t made that many jets, but it\u0027s enough to say i\u0027ve mastered jets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-07T12:52:24Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2019 12:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by KerboNerd\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
