To confirm this I exported to 3ds/ac/fbx and reloaded the file into blender. The edges were back again, as if I had not deleted them. Is there some step I\u0027m missing to ensure that these edges stay deleted once I dissolve them? I even tried manually rebuilding the faces and the edges are STILL there after exporting and importing again.

It just makes them invisible in blender, and maybe sometimes changes how the edges flow. If you want those edges gone then you need to dissolve the corresponding vertices too.
