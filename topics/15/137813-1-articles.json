Without animation layers, inflating the ring would cause it to stop spinning, while trying to get the ring to spin would cause it to deflate. The new layers system solves this issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-26T12:21:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat @sumghai said (multiple simultaneous animations on the same part).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
