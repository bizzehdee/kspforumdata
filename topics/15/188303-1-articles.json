They are start to finish (includes Blender, Gimp, Unity files plus notes) but may leave out details I thought I would remember. Models and textures are very rough - these are just reminders - and my modeling and texturing skills are a work in progress. After starting this it occurred to me they might be of help to others so I made a post for them here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022120438\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed2209517423\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/169578-parts-demo-%E2%80%93-blender-gimp-and-unity-files-june-2-2019/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:214px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
