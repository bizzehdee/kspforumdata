I am trying to merge copies of a single part into a larger three part version for a few different reasons. There is already a two part version of it, but when I set the parts in the cfg at 1m apart they collide with one another instead of being together properly like they are in unity. In unity I set them to 0, 0, -1 ; 0, 0, 0, ; 0, 0, 1 and they align perfect because they are 1 meter across. When I use these numbers in the cfg file, they overlap a bit. what am I doing wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for any advice \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-18T12:11:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould you provide a picture and the config in question?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrWizerd","CreatedById":106063,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-18T22:03:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/pUzZwBRy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/pUzZwBRy\u003C/a\u003E thats the cfg file and the picture is below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XHtId5d.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XHtId5d.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
