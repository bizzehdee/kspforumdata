For example, if you made an engine, copy an engine .cfg file from one of Squad\u0027s engines. Then once you are out of the game folders, open your new copy of that .cfg file using a text editor. Look at what it has in it and then change the portions that you want to be different. You will of course change the name of the part to something unique and put your name as the author. Once you are done, save your new .cfg and put it in the same folder where your new .mu file (and textures) are. Then get out of the game files and play the KSP and see if or how it works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"O.R.C","CreatedById":81880,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-10T01:52:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you need to add a folder called mesh in your part folder as well?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-10T03:08:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGive this a read and see if it helps you out:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25013-Compilation-of-modding-information-links-for-0-19-20-21-Last-updated-3rd-September?p=642248\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post642248\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25013-Compilation-of-modding-information-links-for-0-19-20-21-Last-updated-3rd-September?p=642248\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post642248\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"O.R.C","CreatedById":81880,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-10T03:38:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for that i followed a long in the tutorial.
