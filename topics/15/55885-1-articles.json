Simply get the floor collider out of the anim tree allow the kerbal to stand up normaly)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI m almost sure that the same process may solve a few other things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Earound 23184856 or so edits later ...:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E *grumpf* ...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-12T18:16:59Z\u0022 title=\u002212/12/2013 06:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by WinkAllKerb\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo \u002B additional info\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
