But for the average you should aim for something between 1k-2k.\n\nThe game should be able to handle your 130k model, but it\u0027s WAY above the usual polycount for parts.\n\nAlso note that the mesh collider shouldnt have more than 256 polys, stay as low as possible with those, they are expensive. \n\nUnity collider primitives on the other hand are cheap, use them when possible."},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T14:45:43Z","Content":"What is it?\n\n\\* How complicated is it\n\n\\* How big is it\n\n\\* How many are going to be in scene at once\n\nUse as many as you need, and as few as possible - remember you\u0027re not often really close to models in this game ( note I didn\u0027t say never ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) ), you can do a lot of detail and trickery in paint. Personally I think it\u0027s probably time we started bumping poly budgets a little but for KSP\u0027s style there\u0027s not often much reason to. Your 130k poly model might look somewhat out of place among all the other less detailed parts."},{"CreatedByName":"dominique120","CreatedById":128648,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T23:10:01Z","Content":"Its the model of a whole ship from a SciFi game.\n\nThis number comes from all the parts together(wings, engines, body, etc)"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T05:04:45Z","Content":"KerbalX rocket from Squad is around 62k triangles; around 70 parts IIRC.

For an intire vessel comprised of multiple parts id say 130000 is not too bad. I dont reccomend automatic decimation. Thats more for organic objects or background props. Do it manually instead. for example like \n\nthis:\n\n![optimisation.png](http://i42.photobucket.com/albums/e305/muzzoid/optimisation.png)\n\nand:\n\n![spheres_and_polycounts.png](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/448525/keep/Polycount/spheres_and_polycounts.png)\n\nthese are from polycount.com\n\nyou can also eliminate whole loops or rings where they are not needed by selecting them and pressing delete and selecting collapse edges\n\nBut as said 130k triangles isnt bad. Some fps games have upwards to 900k character models. Thats probably more than the entire vab model\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-27T18:21:37Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2015 06:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by landeTLS**"}]}
