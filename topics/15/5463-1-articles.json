(this applies to surface-attached things too, of course) Basically, start lowering the node\\\u0027s number until it won\\\u0027t connect anymore, and then make tiny increases until everything will connect. Don\\\u0027t be afraid to use decimals:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enode_stack_top = 0, 2.542, 0, 0, 1, 0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewill connect much more solidly than either 2.5 or 2.6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse something like the stock fuel tank to test your parts, rather than another part which might also have sloppy node settings; makes it easier to get them tuned right (then as a last step, make sure your parts connect to each other, small adjustments might be needed)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are also config settings that manage how much force the parts can tolerate; they aren\\\u0027t in most configs by default:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EcrashTolerance = 45\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EbreakingForce = 5000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EbreakingTorque = 5000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecrashtolerance is how much impact a part can take before exploding, either from a crash, or just from a lot of weight from parts attached to it crushing it. Stock parts tend to be less than 50, while the heavy parts in NovaPunch are closer to 200, Its also how people make capsules or landingstruts that won\\\u0027t explode when they crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EbreakingForce and Torque define how strong the connection between parts are; there isn\\\u0027t much documentation on them, but force seems to be \u0027in-line\u0027 forces and torque is \\\u0027side to side\\\u0027 or twisting forces (the bendy rocket issue)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course, all of this depends on having a good collider inside of your DAE file; simple shapes, lined up properly over the scene origin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have continuing issues, post a pic or a file of the troublesome part so we can poke it with a stick.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
