What I do (and always seems to work fine) is to save the textures as PNGs, to import into Unity or use directly-- to then convert to DDS via a program called DDS4KSP. I\u0026#39;ll usually test my part\u0026#39;s appearance several times before converting, saving that step for last.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dboi88","CreatedById":150676,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T18:32:32Z","Content":"\nI saved as a png in photoshop and the texture now loads but the location is all wrong, see below. The image when loaded into photoshop is also different to any tga files i\u0026#39;ve edited before, there are multiple copies of the texture with a full size on the left and the other copies on the right at a 50% reduction each time until i count about 7 copies before it\u0026#39;s only a pixel wide. I\u0026#39;ve no idea what i\u0026#39;m doing at this point.
