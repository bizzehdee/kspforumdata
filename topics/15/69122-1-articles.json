All I know about it is what I noticed from doing thing myself. For some reason Unity compresses TGAs in a way that makes them a)larger and b)uglier, than TGAs compressed by GIMP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo use GIMP to save TGAs for your models making sure the \u0022compressed\u0022 check box is checked, and after you export your model from Unity, overwrite the TGAs that it creates with your originals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Kriger","CreatedById":107995,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-12T15:02:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m only attempting to edit the textures of some stock parts so I won\u0027t be using Unity.
