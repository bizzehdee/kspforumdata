It all started when Bob was killed... so I began snooping in the save files to resurrect him (I was succesful!) and then procceeded into re-working engines and thermal limits and physics and generally mucking about.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a good grasp on .cfg files and how to make/edit/rework them to get all sorts of cool effects and outcomes (custom fuels/isps/thermal effects/ ect) but now I want to model my own engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried the .mu converter addon for blender.... to no avail. (perhaps I\u0027m doing it wrong?) I need some guidance.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat should I be using to model? How do I impliment a collision mesh on whatever recommended program? Are attachment nodes only defined in the .cfg files? I am using paint.net for the dss files.\u00A0 How do I make sure KSP applies the textures? does the .mu converter work or am I wasting my time and need to take an alternate route?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-04T17:33:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t used the .mu add-on myself so can\u0027t speak to how to use it or how well it works but I have seen some comments from some modder\u0027s stating they prefer using it over Unity. I think (big grain of salt here) you need pay careful attention to the .mu add-on version and Blender version - any .mu add-on does not work for all Blender versions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as making your own models there are lots of details and they vary depending on what you\u0027re making. I made some notes for my self \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/169578-parts-demo-%E2%80%93-blender-gimp-and-unity-files-dec-7-2019/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E - includes notes, blender file and Unity file (Uses Unity instead of the .mu add-on). I would recommend you start with a fuel tank just to figure out the flow and to make sure you have the steps correct.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCollision meshes are just a simplified mesh (usually) - using the fuel tank for an example I create the fuel tank mesh and when I\u0027m happy with it I duplicate it, remove any small details and convexities (is that a word? Is now!) and reduce the number of sides from 24 (the standard # of sides for a round part) to 12. Later in Unity I set the collider mesh to a mesh collider and then remove the actual mes - otherwise the collider will be visible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy modding!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
