In reality its because I would have to select specific vertices on the surface to apply the smoothing. \n\nCritiquing my own part.\n\n- No Iva (since I have never built an IVA space)\n\n- It needs an EVA port (Near the bottom)\n\n- Visible depression and attachment Node coordinates for the Ports are not deep enough, needs \n\n- Horizontal nodes need symmetry = value\n\n- On the north and south sides it needs EVA holds (climb handles)\n\n- Glass windows lack \u0027reflections\u0027 \n\n- Smoothing on surface triangles (except around the attachment nodes, this had a spoiling effect)\n\n- The cfg needs a crew capacity, and since it has windows it can serve as a command. (it should be moved to a different catagory)\n\n- The decompression chambers on the ports need submarine door graphics. \n\noh and most importantly it needs a vanity Decal for the blingy stuff. \n\nThe station needs docking lights. The problem is that the ports need to be back lighted, with a LED emmissive, but since this is a stock part the altnerative is a telescoping boom with lights attached that."}]}
