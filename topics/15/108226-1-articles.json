The only advantage to triangulating faces by yourself is in places where you need to specify how the edges flow. That\u0027s not something you need to worry about for now.

It looks like 24 sides for the main nozzle. with that many sides you will mainly make the model hard for you to work with(ie. Many segements close together) and it wont look much smoother (thanks to smooth shading and small cross section) i would suggest 8 12 or 16 sides. also good for not spending too many polys where it doesnt help the model.\n\nnr 2: cylinder segement numbers not sync between detached parts (the tubes going around the main nozzle) this makes the segementing more apparent even tho there are lots of segements. Detached cylindrical parts should retain the same amount of segements as the main part. Horizontal segement amounts look good.\n\nNr 3: (related to nr 1/2)No scaling of segement amounts in relation to radius/size. Ie: as pieces get smaller they should recieve less segements. both to reduce polycount and to make the model look more \u0022even\u0022. id suggest 12/16 sides for the nozzle, 8 for the mid sized cylinder\u002Btouruses on the right (cooling loop pipe?) And 4-8 for the smallest tubes)\n\nnr 4: detached parts with matching geometry wastes uv space. Id suggest joining those tourus shaped tubes to the nozzle and pipe detail. The other intersecting/detached geometry is completly fine. \n\nhope its readable. Im writing on my phone.\n\nKeep in mind this is pretty harsh criticism for a beginner. and more meant as pointers that you can use to become more efficient as you progress in your modeling. \n\nIt is a nice model.

For edges that should stay sharp use edgesplit/crease or simply ignore it. Apply the modifier, go into *edit mode*, *edge selection mode*, select the new, unwanted edges (for example on edges that should not be rounded) and delete them with *delete-edgeloops*.\n\nAlso, the *add edgeloop* function (control-r) is handy to insert new edges.\n\nTo \u0022couple\u0022 between , for example, 8 to 12 faces, merge the appropriate vertices. Easiest on halving the facecount, say 48-\u003E24 faces: just select every other vertice, and use *edge slide* to slide them to the vertices that should remain, *select all*, *remove doubles*.\n\nFor 12 to 8: if you look from above, you need to merge the double vertices on the \u0022diagonals\u0022, see the picture on the left. *select* the first couple (second image), *merge* them at center (third image), repeat.
