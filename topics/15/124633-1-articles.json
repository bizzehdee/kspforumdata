I wasnt sure from the op. You are using a quite different workflow than what i would use for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIll try to explain what im seeing as the main issues based on what i see. Nr 1: there are uv stretching both at the top of the pod (the innermost part of those uv islands) this is caused both by the fact that the inner circle is tapering too much and that the islands are shorter in 2d space than they are on the model. (This could be fixed somewhat by scaling the inner ring of those uvs out but you would need to repaint your texture)Nr 2: the issue you are having with the grey line going up too far is caused by the un-even(different from the model) distribution of the uv verts on that ngon. It would be easier for you to fix if it was triangulated or all quad, as you would be able to see the corresponding lines on the model and the uv islands causing the skewing of the texture. The smart unwrapping in blender also does a better job with quads/tris than ngons on nonflat surfaces. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are open to re unwrapping and painting the sides of the pod again i would suggest a manual cylindrical (left to right with slight tapering at the top) unwrap instead since there will be much less stretching. You can also write the text in a normal left to right fashion by doing it that way. The reason for the \u0022wierdness\u0022 of the white line is both because of uv stretching mentioned and that the uvs are going slightly past your painted white line.

It consists of a grayscale image (black being 0 specularity white being full specularity) you can paint it on a seperate layer and later paste it into the alpha mask of your main texture in ps. But id suggest leaving both it and normalmaps to a future part once youve got the basics down. Normalmaps are a bit more tricky. As they are xyz values encoded in the red green and blue channels of a texture they cant be painted using standard methods. Youll need to either paint a bumpmap (grayscale texture where black is -1 depth and white is \u002B1 height) then use it as is or convert it to a slightly inaccurate normalmap via xnormal etc. Or some plugin for photoshop. The other option(also for a pure 2d texturing workflow) is to use ndo(a plugin for photoshop)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
