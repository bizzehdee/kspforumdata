I created mine with just one animation, and called it \u0022Retract\u0022 like the stock examples, and that apparently isn\u0027t good enough. The ladder retraction animation plays while placing the part in the VAB, and there\u0027s no context menu option to re-deploy it.\n\nFor now I left the \u0022ladderAnimationRootName\u0022 value alone for that first test, and I have a \u0022ladder\u0022 part trigger collider named \u0022colliderLadderClimber\u0022.\n\nStock ladder example:\n\n    \tMODULE\t{\t\tname = RetractableLadder\t\tladderAnimationRootName = Telescopic ladder\t\tladderColliderName = ladderCollider\t\tladderRetractAnimationName = Retract\t}\n\nMy ladder config:\n\n    \tMODULE\t{\t\tname = RetractableLadder\t\tladderAnimationRootName = Telescopic ladder\t\tladderColliderName = colliderLadderClimber\t\tladderRetractAnimationName = Retract\t}\n\nMaybe it would work fine with just ModuleAnimateGeneric, but I wanted to try it the stock way.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T22:08:42Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 10:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NecroBones**"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T22:08:30Z","Content":"Nevermind, it looks like \u0022ladderAnimationRootName\u0022 just has to point to the name of the root transform. \n\n\\*slaps forehead\\*"},{"CreatedByName":"jumpzakjump","CreatedById":121360,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-04T03:37:07Z","Content":"would you be able to explain how you got this to work a little better?"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-04T03:47:37Z","Content":"There are some tutorials out there, but they kinda left out the bits about the config module I was talking about above. Basically you just create a part with a normal animation, and in Unity make a capsule collider that sits in front of the ladder, which will function as the actual space that the kerbal climbs through. This capsule collider needs to be on the \u0022part triggers\u0022 layer, and use the \u0022Ladder\u0022 tag, otherwise there\u0027s nothing special about it. This collider can have a radius around 0.25, and whatever length it needs to be to cover the length of the entire ladder, and even stick off the ends a little to help with kerbals clibing onto another ladder if there is one on the vehicle. Make one edge of this collider overlap the visible surface of the ladder, but otherwise it should be out in front of it. You can test in game and adjust later to get the distance right.\n\nThen that part module just needs a few settings:\n\nladderAnimationRootName is the name of the transform that is the root object for the ladder.\n\nladderColliderName is simply the name of that capsule collider that is a \u0022part trigger\u0022.\n\nladderRetractAnimationName is the name you gave to the deployment animation.\n\nAnd that\u0027s basically it. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"jumpzakjump","CreatedById":121360,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-04T03:59:08Z","Content":"Thanks so much!

It\u0027s just that it won\u0027t activate and deactivate via the animation, so Kerbals will still be able to grab it if they can get to it, even when it\u0027s stowed. The only possible caveat I can think of is if KSP has a problem with animated ladder colliders that are moved by something other than that retraction module. I guess you\u0027d just have to try it and see if it works."}]}
