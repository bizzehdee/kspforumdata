Go to pivot point settings select 3d cursor select ypur animated object and alt\u002Bd. R to rotate, then Z to rotate on the z axis then type in \u0022120\u0022 ( because 360 degrees / 3) press enter. Then repeat from the alt\u002Bd step.\n\nnr3 dupliframes:\n\nSince you want your objects arranged in a circle create a bezier circle arrange it in the center of your baseplate then select the animated object (delete or hide the rest of them) then ctrl\u002Bselect the circle then ctrl\u002Bp select follow path. Go to the curve settings of your bezier curve and rightclick on the green evaluation time field and clear keyframes. Above it (frames) select 3 then go to your animated gear and go to object properties (the box) and under the \u0022duplication\u0022 menu choose frames then set \u0022end\u0022 to 3 and uncheck speed.\n\nThere you go.

I tried grouping them but when I moved a copy of the leg to another location 120 degrees out and rotated, as soon as I played the animation, the leg worked but it reverted to the original rotation on Z of 0. The ladder (steps) is, I guess, my baseplate? It is the parent of my landing leg.\n\nWhen I add the parts to a group, they do not seem to actually be IN the group. If I select the ladder (steps) which is set as parent, the other parts do not get selected. I seem to recall that when I accidentally did it, selecting the parent selected the child as well. Now, nada.\n\nWill I have to wipe all animation data, join them all as a group and then recreate the animations? Only about the 1000th time I\u0027ve done it so that\u0027s easy, just time consuming. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI \u0027think\u0027 though that hurts ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) that I did use your option 2 on my first attempt on the original model, now nothing seems to work like it did before.

You wont need groups or remaking the animations. You may need to parent all the \u0022root\u0022 object(s) or your animated part to an empty transform first before doing the steps in method 2 (you can use shift\u002Bd as well for normay copy instead of instance).(sounds like you are using parenting as your animation method) by root i mean the object(s) that are the first in the chain/last pparent probably the \u0022top\u0022 of your object(it should be the object (s)that you can use to move the entire landing leg with. \n\nok slightly updated guide:\n\nSelect heatshield\n\nCtrl\u002Bs snap cursor to selected\n\nadd an empty object\n\nshift\u002Bselect the root object (s) then shift\u002Bselect your empty object\n\nctrl\u002BP parent to object (keep transform)\n\nThen rightclick your empty in the outliner(top right by default) and select hierachy\n\nshift\u002Bd then enter and repeat that.\n\nnow you should have an empty, an empty.001 and an empty.002 each with your gear nested under it in the outliner. leave empty 001 where it is and select empty.001\n\npress R then Z then 120 then enter\n\nthen select empty.002\n\npress R then 240 then press enter\n\nnow you should have 3 identical gears arranged in the grooves with animations intact\n\nHope this helps\n\nSelecting the parent object doesnt select the child objects but you can move the child objects with the parent by moving just the parent. You can also choose all child objects by rightclicking the parent in the outliner and chose \u0022select hierachy\u0022\n\nBy plate i mentioned earlier i meant the big black heatshield thing Since i assumed the that the groves in it was where you intend to place your landing legs/stairs\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-06T17:18:35Z\u0022 title=\u002203/06/2015 05:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by landeTLS**"},{"CreatedByName":"MLWostal","CreatedById":134330,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T18:11:42Z","Content":"Well....\n\n![2e530p4.jpg](%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i60.tinypic.com/2e530p4.jpg)\n\nNot sure this is exactly how you instructed me but, it did work in blender! I, for some reason, had to create dummy boxes on each of the 4 components and parent the actual part to each of them. Then I parented the dummies to the main one at the center of the ship. In Unity, I\u0027ll just remove the mesh render from the dummies so it should look right but hope this will not cause an issue with adding real suspension to the legs.\n\nThank you for all the help. \n\nBTW, do you know if I can setup real suspension to a tripod type landing gear arrangement?\n\nP.S.

Yes you can have it. Roverdude did a gear with 4 legs inbuilt so you could take a look at that. Im not sure how the setup differs from the standard setup but perhaps just try to setup each component with the same names in unity and write those into the appropriate fields in your landing gear module. Its been a while since i setup something for ksp so perhaps someone else can be of more help\n\nIf you wanna quickly make those boxes dissapear instead of removing the renderer in unity you can tab into edit mode on each of them and press A to select all the geometry then delete it. The object is still there but it has no mesh. btw the reason i said empty object is because blender has an object made spesifically for these kinds of cases. Its called an empty object and is just a point with no mesh.

Are you sure its saying the models polycount is too high and not the collider polys?(you need extreme polycounts for ksp to reject it like that. If it ever does) if its the collider then that has nothing to do with your model geometry but the collider you are generating in unity is too complex. You need to create a super simple mesh to put ontop of your object and use that to generate your collider instead of your main mesh and remove the mesh renderer on it.

For example, Not all unity shaders and components can be used in ksp. Best to stick with the ones that come with parttools tho you can use the default ones too.
