I forgot to load the unity dev kit (500mb) on my laptop before leaving the house today and I don\\\u0027t have the bandwidth to slurp that down currently, so I am working on modeling a 1:1 scale model Jumbo Jet (very loosely modeled after the 747, with a 767 style nose).... in KSP-usable chunks, sort of like the CSS Shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=3597.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECSS Shuttle\u003C/a\u003E in KSP just has two very stiff wings, but it\\\u0027s only designed to fall in the direction you want it to go. Someone here right after the .15 update mentioned that the trick to stable flight is to just keep adding more wing panels. Is this grounded in reality? Or does the engine just pick your physics lift point from the center of the panel and apply the force there?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR Should the wings be massive \u0027monolithic\u0027 pieces (one per side), or should they consist of multiple smaller pieces?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParts are coming in as 6m diameter fuselage broken in to 5 or 6 main chunks (7-10m each) with approx 20m wings on either side. Harvester mentioned issues with rocket parts feeling particularly skittish below 1m in diameter, so I figure going large may help smooth out flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hadlock","CreatedById":23439,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-18T18:33:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHas nobody made any wings in this game?
