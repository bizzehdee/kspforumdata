KSP used to load some file formats directly, but last time I tried that, it wouldn\u0027t associate textures with it. \n\nSome people start with something like Wings 3D since it\u0027s easy to get started. Blender has a steeper learning curve, but a lot of people here use it and can answer questions. It\u0027ll also do a lot that Wings 3D can\u0027t do."},{"CreatedByName":"Avetho","CreatedById":144683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T23:29:12Z","Content":"Hey thanks NecroBones!

It can be used to create concepts pretty quickly, and has a decently simple interface. Now, having never modded KSP, I\u0027ve no idea what sort of process would be available for converting .skp files to something Unity. In a quick search I\u0027ve found this approach, which does require Blender, but only for importing from one format and exporting to another. [http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/how-to-import-a-sketchup-skp-model-into-unity-with-textures.99965/](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/how-to-import-a-sketchup-skp-model-into-unity-with-textures.99965/) Of course, SketchUp Pro would alleviate these issues allowing you to directly export to a format Unity can work with. Within the KSP community, I know bac9, creator of the wonderful B9 Aerospace parts either used to, or still does use SketchUp, so it\u0027s definitely viable."},{"CreatedByName":"Avetho","CreatedById":144683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T23:27:40Z","Content":"Ok, so that would be good if I want to present something fast in game, but if I don\u0027t care so much for the textures, and of course because I have Sketchup 2014 on my PC.

Then, in Blender, UV unwrap it, do all your texture work, and then off to Unity. There\u0027s a ton of tutorials for basic UV unwrapping and texturing in Blender, and it doesn\u0027t require you to mess around with the mesh too much.

It\u0027s a quick [4 entry blog](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/3232-Part-Modding-Tutorial-1-5-Modeling) by Beale on using Wings 3D. While Wings doesn\u0027t nearly have the power of Blender, I loathed the Blender... interface. This will get you started on modelling though and it produces very acceptable results. When you\u0027re ready for animations, take a look at [Daz](http://www.daz3d.com/home). Like Wings, it\u0027s a free program that imports .obj files, which Wings can export and has an intuitive interface. As for Unity, you have no choice in that matter.\n\nTo give you an idea of what you can do with Wings, Daz and a decent paint program...
