Not sure if I\u0027ll have enough thrust to finish this little project, let alone to move past the initial design state. But anyway I\u0027d like to share a concept of two radial command modules and their basic meshes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFH series Radial Command Modules are designed to be hooked radially onto parent parts. The core-facing \u0027skirt\u0027 should ensure seamless coupling with parent parts as small as 1.25m. Both modules have inward facing hatch, theoretically it should wind up inside structural fuselage if hooked onto it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe FH-1 is a single seat command module. It features upward(forward)-facing seat and external airlock in the bottom half.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe FH-2 is a two-seat command module. The upper half is similar to that of FH-1, the bottom half features a side-facing second seat that could be used in landers. Although, its reversed position would require some appropriately placed additional reference part on the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlbum: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/chQGw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/chQGw\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBlender files: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://mega.nz/#!pUEkRbJb!7hhUlcYG72Oct1f4uo9F1dsM8_nd5YnvXdxzknwE77U\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://mega.nz/#!pUEkRbJb!7hhUlcYG72Oct1f4uo9F1dsM8_nd5YnvXdxzknwE77U\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShared under CC-BY-NC-SA\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone wants to screw around with these, feel free to do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T02:29:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think I\u0027ve seen radial command pods before - good idea - looks interesting!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
