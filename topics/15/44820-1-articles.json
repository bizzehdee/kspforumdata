I solved the issue that is just another one of those vague things...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInside the CFG, there are TWO PRIMARY axis that dictate what DEFAULT orientation a part must be facing in order to be attached. These axis are Y and Z. The order of Y and Z is important in the CFG. The last read axis determines what default orientation a part must be in to be attached. So if your last node_stack is a Z (front/back) orientation in the CFG, the first child part must be aligned as such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise.. if you want the regular Up/Down orientation for the first child part, your last node_stack commands must be the X axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Side orientation last, Side orientation first in VAB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enode_stack_UP = 3.7549254,1.657563,-3.315132, 0, -1, 0, 0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enode_stack_FRONT = 3.7549244,-1.657569,-3.315131, 0, 0, -1, 0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Top orientation last, Top orientation first in VAB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enode_stack_FRONT = 3.7549244,-1.657569,-3.315131, 0, 0, -1, 0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enode_stack_UP = 3.7549254,1.657563,-3.315132, 0, -1, 0, 0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis fact has been undocumented, and is now clarified.
