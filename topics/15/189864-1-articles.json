Objects being the blender objects. So if you have a fuel tank with two end meshes and a tank mesh it\u0027s best to join the three together if possible. There are situations where this won\u0027t work - like if you have variants (in KSP) to swap end types.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#3: Blender only has one animation. You might be able to play some tricks like having the deploy animation from frame 1 to 40 and the first rotation from 41 to 61. Then in Unity specify your two animations - the first being frames 1-40 and the second 41-61 looping at the end back to frame 41. Another possible approach - I thought I saw a mod by linuxgurugamer that sounded like it might be able to do multiple animations (sorry don\u0027t recall the name (fairly recent though)) - have not used it myself so it may not do what I think it does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-21T04:26:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I dimly recall seeing that Quaternions don\u0027t survive the trip from Blender to KSP - could easily be wrong on this but something to check if rotations are giving you problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nit coming back - I think this was a problem with Blender\u0027s collada export\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-21T04:30:22Z\u0022 title=\u002211/21/2019 04:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 21, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by wasml\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ememories slowly seeping back\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NermNermNerm","CreatedById":174264,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-22T09:04:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/120438-wasml/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022120438\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/120438-wasml/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@wasml\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0!\u00A0 I have dorked around for some time and have started to form some ideas which may or may not be right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nUnity has this \u0022Animator\u0022 concept which appears to be an orchestrator of \u0022clips\u0022, which were the \u0022Animation\u0022 object.\u00A0 I haven\u0027t been able to get any life out of the \u0022Animator\u0022 thing in KSP, but I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s there because I saw KerbalExpressionSystem is using it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe \u0022Animator\u0022 thing looks to be a whole lot fancier than you really need for space ships.\u00A0 All we ever do is extend/retract and maybe some spinning round \u0026amp; round.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI\u0027ve been able to roll my own animations in Unity, but it\u0027s definitely pulling teeth to do it.\u00A0 Seems like the whole process is more than a bit wonky in their editor.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI imported my blend file directly in Unity - and it looks like each individual part \u0026amp; property got its own clip.\u00A0 I guess there\u0027s a way to roll all the right clips together somehow, but I haven\u0027t figured it out.\u00A0 I\u0027ve been figuring to get a handle on Unity animations by themselves before trying to combine Unity\u002BBlender\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-23T04:39:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as I know parts all use the Animation object (be sure to set to \u0022legacy\u0022 mode)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve briefly tried the Blender direct to Unity but didn\u0027t see a way to split the models up - I like to have multiple models in one Unity file (like all truss parts for a set) - so went back to using Collada which gives you one animation per model.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
