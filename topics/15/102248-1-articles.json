I cannot figure out why it has decided to \u0022split\u0022 the mesh into those two parts. I even tried deleting all of my Blender materials but the \u0022mk2vtol\u0022 material keeps importing. I made sure that the mesh is one piece in Blender, and the UV map is all the same so I have no clue what the issue is. The missing material in the slot below is one that I deleted to better show how the mesh has been divided. The only other thing that I can think of is that I appended a mesh from a previous part to use in this one that uses the mk2vtol material, but idk where I would access that if it was stored in a different place.\n\n![3fV5yrCh.png](http://i.imgur.com/3fV5yrCh.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T09:14:32Z","Content":"But did you remove the material references from the object itself."},{"CreatedByName":"Quiznos323","CreatedById":114900,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T09:22:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E But did you remove the material references from the object itself.\n\nYes I believe so. \n\n![4az5UiS.png](http://i.imgur.com/4az5UiS.png)\n\n![qEFOaiG.png](http://i.imgur.com/qEFOaiG.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T09:37:28Z","Content":"In the material slot in Unity, just set the size value to 1.\n\nThe best solution is to tell Unity not to import materials from the model, of course."},{"CreatedByName":"Quiznos323","CreatedById":114900,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T09:53:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E In the material slot in Unity, just set the size value to 1.\n\u003E The best solution is to tell Unity not to import materials from the model, of course.\n\nIf I do that though I get this (It\u0027s like it\u0027s treating the mesh as 2 parts..) :\n\n![UlJpLAP.png](http://i.imgur.com/UlJpLAP.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T12:12:32Z","Content":"I guess you\u0027ve managed to assign a different material to that part of the mesh in blender, then.
