One way do do pipes and wires with the model involves creating a curve and then changing it into a mesh. The few times I\u0027ve tried this I started with an edge and extruded to the general shape I wanted, used beveling to round corners then (OK - memories a bit fuzzy here - was some time ago) change to a curve then back to a mesh with some settings to give it depth. Try Googling blender and curve to mesh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fundati","CreatedById":208109,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-08T20:36:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/120438-wasml/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022120438\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/120438-wasml/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@wasml\u003C/a\u003EOkay, I\u0027ll try that out, thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-19T03:51:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCame across a link: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/42591/how-to-approach-the-modeling-of-duct-work-piping-wiring\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/42591/how-to-approach-the-modeling-of-duct-work-piping-wiring\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve used the vertex extrusion (answer with 4 votes) in an attempt at rocket engine plumbing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
