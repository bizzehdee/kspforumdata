Honestly for 0.625meter stuff you can probly get away with 8 faces and it will look fine in most cases. When I model I have been using 1/2 what it says above..as in 10 faces for 0.625, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Deep Space Kraken","CreatedById":65142,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-08T17:44:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks a rep to both of you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
