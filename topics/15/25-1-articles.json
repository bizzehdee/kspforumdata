It requires every mesh to have a material, even the collision mesh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what I recommend is giving the collision mesh a default, semi-transparent material. It won\u0027t be visible in the game anyway. that material gets discarded during the import phase, but if it\u0027s not there, the game will hang on load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ll release an SDK package this week, that contains an addon debugging tool called PartLab. This tool has a console that let\u0027s you see exactly where the loading halted, so you can know what needs to be fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, we\u0027ll be posting a part-making guide in the wiki, that will explain all that is needed to make an addon part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!
