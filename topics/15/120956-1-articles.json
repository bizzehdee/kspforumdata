I\u0027ve managed to UV Unwrap a long cylinder, imported it to Paint.NET (thank you to whoever that was who recommended paint.net!) and messed around with it, added colour here and there, added a logo, all is jolly good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut heres when the bit I\u0027m stuck on comes up...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApplying the texture to the Blender model...!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tutorial says to add a material, couldn\u0027t figure that out, looked it up on the Blender wiki and that manual is obviously outdated because pressing F5 in editor mode as it says does not bring up a little thing on the program with a shading bit in it that had an add material thing on it, so I\u0027m stuck here, which is really annoying me now as I worked quite hard (for my standards.) on that texture and I can\u0027t apply the texture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMay somebody help me?
