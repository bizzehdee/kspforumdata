I have created a simple model in blender, a large cylinder, set it up in metrics and designed it to have a 2.5 meter radius and 19 meters high, but had to scale down to 0.1 size AND multiply the size of the model by .1 in blender to get it to load in at the correct scale in game, I\u0027m guessing there is an easier way to do this but it seems to work for the game scale and loads the model fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. When I add the part the attach nodes are messed up, I have the node on the bottom in the right spot but I cant seem to get the node on the top correct, with that in mind a general and simple overview to how node_attach and node_stack work would be grateful because I think I am messing it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. After attaching the part I can no longer select it, I can\u0027t remove it, adjust it, or even click on it.
