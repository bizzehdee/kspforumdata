I\u0027m not interested in doing the texturing part and it is not my strong suit, but I do create models on occasion. The model I am referencing can be viewed at [http://youtu.be/4QpMVufaAVU](https://youtu.be/4QpMVufaAVU). I\u0027ve made small tweaks since I made the video but that is it essentially. A lot of the pieces can share texture space. I intended to allow this model to be included in kspi extended. If my collaborator wishes inclusion to another mod, that can be arranged.\n\nI can include all the images I\u0027ve used for inspiration if it will help the process.\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T13:12:29Z","Content":"The part looks very good, but it\u0027s not meant for KSP. It has too many polygons for a part that should be used in quantities. I\u0027d reduce the number of polygons to around 3-4k to make it KSP friendly."},{"CreatedByName":"somewhatcasual","CreatedById":102043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T14:52:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The part looks very good, but it\u0027s not meant for KSP.

When you said poly\u0027s, Did you mean tris or faces? I primarily model in quads, so if you meant tris, the task will not be as easy. I was operating under the assumption that poly\u0027s = face count.\n\nThanks"},{"CreatedByName":"Reax","CreatedById":143112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T14:21:02Z","Content":"go with tri count for game stuff bud."},{"CreatedByName":"somewhatcasual","CreatedById":102043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T23:28:52Z","Content":"I\u0027ve gotten the model down to 6269 from~35k tris. Pretty close to goal. Hard pressed to remove anymore, but I\u0027ll take another look over it. UVmapping afterward."}]}
