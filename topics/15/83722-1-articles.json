Problem is, conflicting information. One says do this, other says don\u0027t do this, and most people even admit that there is so sort of voodoo involved. After hours of trial and error, I\u0027m about to try the voodoo, but can\u0027t seem to find a live chicken anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I have two pods and can\u0027t get the hatches on either of them working. I\u0027ve tried every suggestion I\u0027ve seen on the forum. Origin at 0,0,0, above 0,0,0, below 0,0,0, hatch mesh only intersects with one mesh, no meshes, multiple meshes. I just can\u0027t see to get these things to work. They always seem to result in \u0022obstruction\u0022 errors.
