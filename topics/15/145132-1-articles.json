I have discovered a fix for this, but i cannot figure out how to get the effects working .e.g Sandstorms, Auroras, Snow, Better textures for Eve and Jool. I want to bring this old mod back to life;\u00A0so if you have any ideas of how I could edit the configs to have functioning sandstorms/ snow/ auroras. At the moment i have only got the clouds to function although what i have so far shows hope for a revival of this long dead mod. If i can get the mod fulling running I will ask Astronomer for permission to take over AVP. As of now any help would be appreciated and any major helpers will be included in the credits \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0I will also include an addition of Rareden\u0027s Skybox to add to the stunning visuals that AVP provides. If you have any solutions to fix/improve current visual effects please tell my because i would love to get this mod moving again!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
