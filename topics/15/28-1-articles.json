Basically we have 2 standards right now. Later, as more and different size parts are added, we\u0027ll settle on other standards as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, basically it works like this: For a generally cylindrical part of size 1 (fits under the pod), we use a diameter of 1 meter. The height doesn\u0027t matter as much. If the part will accept other parts, like winglets, to connect to it by the surface, the collision mesh should have 12 sides, so it\u0027s possible to arrange parts symmetricaly in 2\u0027s, 3\u0027s 4\u0027s, 6\u0027s, 8\u0027s and 12\u0027s. This collision mesh is then rotated 15 degrees, so that there are flat sides on each axis, instead of edges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a general rule, the main cylinder for the visual mesh is 24 sides, but that depends also on the design of the part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there is standard 0, which is for small parts (that fit over the pod), for these, the main diameter is 0.43m, and we usually use 18 sides for the main cylinder. But that, again, depends on design. Currently the only part that uses this standard is the Mk16 Parachute, but later on more size 0 parts will be added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor parts that attach sideways, like radial decouplers and winglets, there isn\u0027t much of a standard format. Those parts can have pretty much any format, so it\u0027s just a matter of tweaking until it looks good \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, we\u0027ll release the SDK shortly, which will explain all this in a lot more depth. In the meantime, I hope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if all the above fails, you can import one of the DAE meshes in the Parts folders, and use it as a baseline \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbalOmmex","CreatedById":161010,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-25T10:37:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know this is a necro but hey!
