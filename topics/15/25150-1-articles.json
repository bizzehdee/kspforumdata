I am just getting into modding for Kerbal Space Program, and although I am awesome at SolidWorks, that seems to be the only modelling software which I can use professionally. Because our team of modders is moving into Kerbal Space Program modding, and although we are currently a very small organisation, we are looking for a new member of our team (maybe more, depending on the response I get for this), who can create models (and maybe textures, this doesn\u0027t really matter), for Kerbal Space Program. Ideally, we want someone who can build what we ask of them (doesn\u0027t have to be too good, just functional), and they will be given the full credit, for their work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Thanks in advance,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E EsvDefcon\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Defcon Corporation\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skeligandrew","CreatedById":57194,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-02T20:37:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat parts do you have in mind\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EsvDefcon","CreatedById":62949,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T15:32:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022skeligandrew\u0022 data-cite=\u0022skeligandrew\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat parts do you have in mind\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E First of all, thanks for replying! We\u0027re currently working on a neat little oxygen, food, and water mod (plus some extra resources), so what we really need are some basic containers, plus some habitat modules. We will also need some living spaces, (kitchens, bedrooms, etc.), but we only really need one part for this, with slightly varying textures. I am working on all of the coding for this mod, but if you are capable of creating these part, then you can definitely consider yourself a member of the Defcon Corporation. And, honestly, as of now, we don\u0027t need your initial models to be perfect. Just functional. And, don\u0027t worry, you would be completely credited as a big part of the team.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Thanks for your interest,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E EsvDefcon\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Defcon Corporation\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EsvDefcon","CreatedById":62949,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T15:54:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESkelligandrew,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Thanks for your reply, I have already replied, but I\u0027m not sure if the message sent, so just in case, here it is again...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the list of parts, (If you have heard of a modder called devogen, well, he is working on this project with me (he is from the Wayland Corp.

From there you can explort the model in Blender as a .DAE Collada file, which is natively accepted by Unity. I don\u0027t know that Solidworks supports saving as .STL but I can\u0027t imagine why it wouldn\u0027t.
