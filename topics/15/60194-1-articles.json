I have applied two individual materials to separate objects in blender, and then tried importing it to Unity; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, Unity apparently ignores my materials and assigned the model to the default material. I can\u0027t seem to figure out how to assign different textures/materials to objects in a model in unity, so this is a problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone help me? How can I assign my two materials to these different parts of the same model?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nazari1382","CreatedById":62013,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T00:01:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESelect the object, and if it has a Mesh Renderer component, you can select a material.
