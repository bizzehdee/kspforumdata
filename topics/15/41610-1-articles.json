Something with animations is going to be a bit more intensive, if that\u0027s backed with Damned Robotics/Infernal Robotics that\u0027s a lot more intensive. Transparencies will slightly increase the cost because less is being obscured by the object and thus more has to be rendered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you\u0027re dealing with cylinders there are actually pretty straight forward rules on how many sides a cylinder should have at a given size, generally between 18 and 32, and they\u0027re available on the wiki, in the compilation of links thread, and probably in the bathroom. To an extent you can apply those rules to anything circular like the nozzle of an engine or a circular porthole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn important thing is that once you start putting textures and bump maps and whatnot all over the polygons, if you\u0027ve done it right the polys just don\u0027t matter, the textures add detail and obscure the lines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KhaosCorp","CreatedById":61149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T18:14:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnly time ya need 32 faces on a cylinder is if its 8meters around. 16-24 faces should be enough to get a nice smooth look on cylinder that\u0027s between 1.25m and 5m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines are typically between 1.6 and 3.5k total tris (that render mesh and colliders) some are a bit more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure what ya mean by bodys....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETanks should be really low for just a basic tank, small ones should be in the hundreds. More complex tanks should be no more then 2/3 the amount of same size engine average (as in a complex 1.25m tank you should try and keep around 1k or so).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlot of polys can be reduced by cleaver texturing and using bump mapping though. Just because you CAN make a model intricate, and you CAN get it loaded in game does not mean you should (lookin at you truss guy!).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T18:45:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eeh, trusses kinda have to be modelled complexly because KSP\u0027s transparency shader is a big pile of donkeys, only the smallest parts can get away with having alphas, anything larger than the octo truss would look really bad.
