I have been flying solo for the initial time with some balancing help from Logan Darklighter and Ultravires and an AWOL Neronix, but essentially I\u0027ve been a one man band. Now, I don\u0027t mind doing it all (sometimes it has it\u0027s advantages) but I know I could be doing better if I had even just a small bit of help, hence the reason I am going to attempt to recruit a few people! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E My background is mainly in IT, but I also worked in the Film and TV industry for some time and have a general love for science fiction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe revived development and release thread can be found \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24677-%280-19-1%29-Wayland-Corp-Development-and-released-download-Thread\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not I suppose your typical recruitment thread, as I am not desperate for a team to do all the work for me, as I said things are shuffling along fine by myself but its a slow run. Release something then spend months going through comments to fix things up, where as lately the test pilots have proven to be great in making sure the final product is at least what you intended. I would like to ask people to join who feel they have something to offer in the way of making mods, but either don\u0027t have the time or experience to do it themselves. So instead of saying I need a graphics artist, concept artist, modeller and all that stuff, it\u0027s not like that at all. I also did not want to really ask for or start a team until I was confident I had a grasp on all aspects of making mods (or at least enough to be self sufficient and not rely on people and be a bother to them). Essentially, this isn\u0027t something I started yesterday, and haven\u0027t simply logged on today and thought \u0022oh I would like some help!\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I\u0027ve been slogging away at it for some time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission statement:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Wayland Corp. is dedicated to providing the ability to pilot some of the fantastic spacecraft designs from the 1950\u0027s until the modern day, meanwhile maintaining the games performance at an optimum level.
