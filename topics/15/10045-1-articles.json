I don\\\u0027t want to use it in game (though that would be cool too) but I\\\u0027d like to \\\u0027export\\\u0027 (or is it import) a 3D image of my favourite Mun lander for use in ... idk ... a wire frame image for my desktop/wallpaper.

I\\\u0027d have to look up the exact method, but I\\\u0027ve seen tutorials that do just that; since you can render the scene in Blender and get a nice quality output.\n\nDon\\\u0027t forget lightning and camera! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
