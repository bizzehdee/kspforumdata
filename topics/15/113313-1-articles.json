Everything else works fine, hubs turn, props turn, but the rotor disc wants to spin on a different axis then the parent transform. Everything spins on Z but the disc wants to spin on X.\n\nAny way to fix this?\n\nEDIT: I keep tinkering with the hierarchy, but the mesh for the prop blur keeps rotating around a different axis other then Z.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T18:40:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 06:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Eskandare**"}]}
