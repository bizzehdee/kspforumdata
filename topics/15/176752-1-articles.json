So I know C# to a degree I actually can do something in Unity/KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow what is far more intense is my \u0022IPTS - Interplanetary Transport System\u0022 which shall be a balanced set of a few modular pieces\u00A0to reduce part count and fit into stock look but a bit cleaner at certain places. Currently I have dependencies to Near Future Construction, Color Coded Cans and whatnot, using just very few pieces welded together with Ubzio\u0027s Welder Mod.\u00A0As I dont have the time to do everything on my own to the degree I am satisfied with, I am looking for someone who could model those meshes and fit them some clean textures. I have spent hours preparing the crafts ... not yet flown them to planets yet because I am astethically - let\u0027s say - demanding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere a few screenshots of the IPTS parts so far:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/WHwH3ej\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/WHwH3ej\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-07-16T09:16:47Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2018 09:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by sArge_ch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
