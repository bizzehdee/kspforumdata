I renamed the materials, so there were no dashes or underscores. I changed the texture so it was a power of 2 1024x1024. I deleted the third mesh in your group, and renamed the deltawing mesh from \u0027node_collider\u0027 to \u0027deltawing\u0027 and made a box and called it node collider. I also exported with these settings in 3ds max.
