With your model I\u0027d be tempted to see if was possible to assemble quarters in the VAB/SPH, as a last resort you can miss out colliders that are not important, i do this all the time, if its just deco and out of the way, and wont affect the intended use, or make for wierd playability , like walking through walls. You prob have worked all this out anyway by now, but you aren\u0027t alone in having theses probs \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cxg2827","CreatedById":57380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-03T17:25:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eim guessing you will need to do something similar to this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dK5KLBZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dK5KLBZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelhester07","CreatedById":96470,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-03T18:39:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking splitting it up would produce the best results, especially for the larger versions of these. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I split it up do I have to do anything in Unity to make sure it doesn\u0027t fall apart?
