Although another option would be to create the profile of your booster, then use the spin modifier. It\u0027s been a while since I\u0027ve done that so I\u0027m not 100% certain on the exact steps needed to make it work. I did this for a part though and everything was fine except the size/orientation. Once in KSP the part was rotated 90 degrees, so that left/right was actually up/down (top of the part pointing sideways). Eventually I gave in and rotated the part in Blender, and it ended up the right way around in KSP lol.
