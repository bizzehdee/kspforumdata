Both have 4 bays for fitting RCS fuel and thrusters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Fuel tank that fits under the body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Optional heat shield.

I plan to make a tiny version of each autopilot(ASAS, Mechjeb, etc) that you can plug in to this cubby, then cover up. Out of sight, out of mind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Deployable landing legs(legs will have to clip until we get support for animations).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I think I may add a protrusion to the fuel tank as well, so fuel can be routed up to it easily. Maybe a premium model. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it looks high poly, thats because it is.
