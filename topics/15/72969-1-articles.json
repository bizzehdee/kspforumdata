I saw some threads here but I couldn\u0027t find a real \u0022step-by-step\u0022 explanation. I read that I would need 3 models..an exterior, interior and props. But that doesn\u0027t help me, I need a tutorial with starts in Blender, which explains me how to set it up in Unity and how to get it in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it will be loads of work but it would be great if anybody would be so nice to explain that.

This is of course what works for me and I\u0027ve done loads of IVA\u0027s now but others may have other ways of achieving the same results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TarU1Q3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TarU1Q3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dtobi","CreatedById":90882,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-31T15:06:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know the process of placing props.
