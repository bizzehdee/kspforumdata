Is it supposed to be visible through the part? Please note that the second screen shot only displays the command module above because I deleted the polies beneath. I had set them to Black alpha, and they were cause a weird streak effect, kind of like the Predator when he was invisible. I do notice that little dude\u0027s helmet has some transparency to it but the crew module shows up fine through it, so maybe I\u0027m doing transparency wrong. Also, the Kerbal shows up fine through the expanded steel grate when he is standing below it, just not the rest of the ship. EDIT: Apparently his faceplate does not show up through the grate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe normals are showing up fine, if a little misdirected because this is a 6x rotationally arrayed model. I\u0027ll eventually have to rebake the normals for the whole thing at once. Is this maybe a limitation of my video card (8800 GTX)? That would suck. Additionally, are two sided polygons an option in Unity?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LaydeeDem","CreatedById":5984,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-05T18:55:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbal is not the greatest with transparent textures.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AdmiralStewart","CreatedById":20612,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-05T19:17:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, that\u0027s too bad.
