guys,\n\nI\u0027m into modding, since I created the first fully electrical engine just before 1.0 was released.\n\nThe problem is that it\u0027s perfectly working in 0.9, but, in 1.0, when I try to launch it, I have \u0022intake air deprived\u0022\n\nI have enough air intake for it, but still have the same message... even when I integrated an air intake into it.\n\nGot some ideas how to arrange that bros ?\n\nFor the code, I took the basic jet engine, changed :\n\nEngineType to electric (took that from ion engine)\n\nChanged liquidfuel to electriccharge,\n\nadded air intake (module\u002Bressource)\n\nhere\u0027s the whole code\n\n    PART{    name = rotor_XT1    module = Part    author = Samy    mesh = model.mu    node_stack_top = 0.0, 0.9, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0
