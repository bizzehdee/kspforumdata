Been searching for and hour now: changed orientation of the models and exported them to Unity, also tried changing orientation of the root as well as the subs in Unity, written the model.mu again and again, reloaded the database or even restarted again and again ... KSP seems to ignore everything and just plants the parts in the same orientation ... over and over again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe old parts are based on the Squad wing parts and are in the distance in the correct orientation, the new parts need to be in the same orientation but won\u0027t do what I need yet.

Prefab means (for me, surely there is a way better definition) the object is just some sort of \u0022link\u0022 to the actual model (from assets/models). This means whenever you update the model (new export from the 3d app) the prefab that is the child of the game object with the part tools script in the actual scene in unity is updated, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you change the hierarchy of the model object in unity\u0027s hierarchy window (by deleting some part of it, or changing the hierarchy of it by changing a parent/child status of parts of the model (like the actual mesh, the collider or an empty or anything that will result in unity warning you \u0022This action will break the prefab instance! Are you sure you want to continue?\u0022), then you will loose the \u0022linkage\u0022 between the model object and the model from assets/models. Than the object in the scene has no connection to the actual model any more. It is now a instance of its own. That means even if you re-export the model from your 3d application, and the model in assets/models gets updated, the object that is in the scene, as the child of the game object with the KSPpart tool script, is NOT updated and NOT changed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou then have to manually delete the object from the hierarchy of the scene in unity, re-drag\u0026amp;drop the models from assets/unity and make your changes that broke the prefab instance again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have this problem with my parachute models. I use a bone armature to animate the different parts of the parachute differently, so that the cable doesn\u0027t change in diameter when the canopy inflates, and the canopy can change it\u0027s lenght when inflating while the risers dont change etc). To work properly the actual mesh of the canopy has to be a child of the armature, but whether or not i set this up in blender, after importing the two are siblings, not in a parent/child relationship, so i have to drag\u0026amp;drop the mesh to be the child of the armature, thus braking the prefab instance. So I have to repeat this process of adding the model to the scene whenever I re-export it from blender.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-13T15:40:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222747201\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022128812\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221473360545\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022141335\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jasseji\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 08/09/2016 at 7:49 PM, Jasseji said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry for Necro but i am facing the Exact same problem as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Original Post(er).
