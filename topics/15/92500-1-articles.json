Last week was spent writing the plugin, which works flawlessly. However, developing it was done by copying over the stock accelerometer part and editting its config, just for testing. I have spent the past 2 days modelling the new part in sketchup and finalizing in Blender. I now have a blender file (.blend) fully textured and cannot figure out for the life of me what to do now. Some tutorials say you need a collider object in blender, some don\u0027t create one until unity. On top of that, this mod is going to be submitted as a final project for my computer science course, and I will be documenting the entire process in a technical report. As a result, while helping through replies on the forums is great, I need to actually have a conversation with someone who will walk me through the process, with screen-sharing and the whole lot, so that I really get a feel for each and every step. Anyone willing to video chat with me to help me finish, just private message me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T21:52:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhat shape is the object? if it\u0027s a simple shape like a sphere, cube, or something. use Unity primitive collider. info here (disregard the bit about \u0022rigidbodies\u0022, not applicable to KSP.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/bh9ArKrPY8w?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E or this\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/naFLJSzzfdY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou\u0027ll have better chance of getting help with specific questions than asking for someone to walk you through the entire process.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gkorgood","CreatedById":124879,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T22:19:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nli2work\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nli2work\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewhat shape is the object? if it\u0027s a simple shape like a sphere, cube, or something. use Unity primitive collider. info here (disregard the bit about \u0022rigidbodies\u0022, not applicable to KSP.)\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/bh9ArKrPY8w?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E or this\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/naFLJSzzfdY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou\u0027ll have better chance of getting help with specific questions than asking for someone to walk you through the entire process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewill definitely check it out. thanks for the rapid reply. I was actually hoping you\u0027d see this, your work is quite impressive. its a cylindrical shell with another cylinder on the side (its a wristwatch for your rocket, because the plugin adds a real-time clock window) but i think the collider only really has to cover the band, the parts of the watchface that extend past the band don\u0027t need to be collidable, i don\u0027t think. As such I was attempting to use a simple cylindrical mesh as a collider. so the blender file should only be the part, with no other mesh? and how do i go about installing part tools. which version, in what order, where? i\u0027ve seen a couple different sets of instructions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T22:30:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELots of information\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/D19L9cvZVhQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E, and nli2works superb IVA tutorials cover a lot too.
