My initial thought was that anything good enough for Bac9 ought to be good enough for me. Don\u0027t remember where I heard he used it or if that was accurate, but it has worked out fairly well for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first and most fundamental thing to note is that, while export from SketchUp is easy and\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eusually\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0fairly clean, I\u0027ve found no good way to handle UVs, normals, or really any postprocessing within it. My workflow has been SketchUp -\u0026gt; 3ds Max -\u0026gt; Unity, with unwraps, optimization, and normal repairing done manually in 3ds. I\u0027m sure this all can be done in blender as well, but like you, I hate blender with a passion. Autodesk gives out their software free to students; look into that. 3ds Max is a handful too (I\u0027ve only really just conquered it functionally\u00A0in the last month; I did the bulk of my work in SketchUp for the same reasons you do), but in my experience it\u0027s a lot more ergonomic than blender is, and I figure if you\u0027re going to put in the hours to learn something like that, you might as well learn the professional industry standard. All that said, SketchUp is much less of a hassle to use and navigate, and is serviceable as a modeling\u00A0environment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that I understand 3ds max well enough to actually use it outright, I will even say SketchUp is still\u00A0better in a few very specific ways. \u003Ci\u003EVery\u00A0\u003C/i\u003Especific. \u003Cstrong\u003ESketchUp automatically splices faces around lines that run through them, and will allow you to select faces in large numbers based on smoothness, while also navigating comfortably.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EWhat\u0027s so great about this? It enables the interior and exterior model to be built as one model, and severed from each other later, then realigned as separate parts. In this manner,\u00A0perfect congruence between interior and exterior models (sloppy alignment can be very obvious and annoying if any of your pod geometry, including window bezels, is visible from inside) can be ensured. In brief, the ideal process is as follows (it rarely goes perfectly):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nModel your part in and out, especially windows. Windows in our case can be any shape but should not have depth. The faces of the window will provide the seam between interior and exterior, and should coincide in the final version. No backfacing in KSP, so they won\u0027t flash.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSmooth your model so the whole of the exterior skin (or as much as possible) can be selected \u003Cem\u003Ewithout \u003C/em\u003Eselecting any faces on the interior.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDrag-clone the model twice, leaving the original as backup. One copy will become the exterior, one the interior.

In all likelihood it will work about 95%, and the rest of it will be hours of cursing and painstaking manual triangulation to make sure the seam stays true so both models still line up when all is said and done.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWe can now delete the entire interior, leaving the windows and the exterior skin.

All the furnishing can stay in groups. Curse as necessary.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou now have an interior and exterior separate from each other, cut from the same model along the seams of the windows. Both models still have their windows, and if dragged together, the windows should sit perfectly on top of one another, and the composite model should look exactly like your original \u002B a nice seam where the windows are.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nExport to 3ds (or whatever), make sure the origins of both the interior and exterior are in the same position, UV, etc.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nImport to unity (can come right from the .max file, or just about any other. Unity compatibility is incredible)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen both the interior and exterior are in the same position in unity, our model should be perfectly aligned. If they aren\u0027t, you can fix here too (but not as precisely/easily). If correcting is necessary, make sure you reset the origin pivots so they coincide. KSP will be looking at that.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n???\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHave a perfectly aligned model\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nProfit\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe images and text wall below show how my models go together and will illustrate my point:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222529113\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022129967\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461275117\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002217192\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Balto-the-Wolf-Dog\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/21/2016 at 1:45 PM, Balto-the-Wolf-Dog said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do my modelling in sketchup where this particular tactic is uniquely approachable, but you may be able to replicate it elsewhere: I just model the entire thing together, inside and out, as one \u0022realistic\u0022 model, then cut the inner skin from the outer skin along the seams created by the windows. The result is a perfectly matching IVA and EVA version. Since the windows don\u0027t have a thickness, I align based on the inner bezel of the window matching the outer bezel on the exterior. This has to be done manually (in theory you could do it with snaps in 3ds, but I usually just do it in unity) but is easy to varify by inspecting the window frames for proper alignment and checking the glass for proper thin-ness.

I usually do this part in unity and eyeball it, as if you watch along the window rims while you\u0027re doing this you can bring it down to a lot of points of precision. For this alignment to remain true when exporting, the origin of the IVA and exterior must coincide as unity defines them, though their angles must be different because reasons. This is easy enough to do:\u00A0Do the alignment as they are, then create a new GameObject and place it at the same coords as the exterior origin and change its angle as necessary. Simply re-parent the interior parts to this new aligned origin, and you should be set as alignment goes. In theory you could also align the parts with snap\u00A0and move their origins together in 3ds, then\u00A0export them together.\u00A0This is arguably more precise, but I prefer not to as it makes it a little harder to keep track of what belongs to what. \u00A0If you have several windows at several different angles, its easy to tell when things are aligned just by looking at the seams and comparing them.

It definitely makes scaling and shape easy, and I\u0027d recommend it if it can be made practical in whatever program you\u0027re using.

Working in small environments is not easy in 3ds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll this\u00A0established,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eis SketchUp a good idea?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that I\u0027ve figured out 3ds, I\u0027m going to do as much there as I possibly can. SketchUp is only as powerful as the plugins you can find. Some of them are great, but many aren\u0027t really built for the kind of work we\u0027re doing. SketchUp itself isn\u0027t either. We\u0027re forcing the issue. I, personally, have a very bad habit of irresponsibly lofting skins between spline lines because it generates\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ereally cool shapes\u003C/em\u003E. This is all well and good if the polygons that result are fairly congruent in size, but if they aren\u0027t, you\u0027re going to have a hell of a time trying to get the lighting right. SketchUp\u0027s lighting engine often won\u0027t show you the extent of the problem, but it can be nigh impossible to rectify. If you look very closely at my models, you\u0027ll notice some of them, particularly the earlier ones, look like they have ship acne. Those are crappy normals and drastic changes in face size. Bear in mind, you will not have this problem if you are triangulating manually. Just work with the understanding that you don\u0027t want one big, regular polygon surrounded by a bunch of smaller ones, regular or otherwise.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qHjR4xR.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qHjR4xR.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat mistake is definitely avoidable, but it\u0027s much easier to make in SketchUp than it is in 3ds Max. Be conscious of it. I wasn\u0027t. If it does happen, don\u0027t be afraid of retriangulation. You will suffer less remaking bad polygons than you will trying to fudge them. Expect to suffer at least a little regardless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNon user-error issues with SketchUp:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nExports to 3ds Max are\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ealmost\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ealways clean. Almost. To date I am not sure what makes the difference, but I\u0027ve had models export with tons of empty objects (no big deal, just lots of select- delete), weird normals (despite okay geometry), and broken faces. By and large this can all be repaired easily enough in 3ds or whatever, but it does happen.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere seems to be some kind of a scaling disagreement between 3ds, SketchUp, and Unity that results in me having to half the size of my final models in Unity. This could be on me, but I\u0027m not sure where my bad config is if that\u0027s so.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSketchUp isn\u0027t always spot on with filling complex faces, cutting faces with lines, etc. This results in tons of frustration in SketchUp, and often bad geometry in 3ds. On several occasions I\u0027ve cut models in half, mirrored them, and had one side throw bad geometry errors for no reason. I\u0027ve had faces refuse to cut in the interior/exterior process (very common). I\u0027ve had perfectly planar faces refuse to fill without an arbitrary line drawn through them. These faces would then triangulate VERY strangely in 3ds. These issues are common, and presumably a symptom of our abusing the program a little.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSketchUp is powerful, easy to use, and, for me, responsible for bridging the gap between wishing I could do something and doing it. That said, it is\u00A0quirky and not always reliable, often breaking in arcane and nonsensical ways. A purpose-built piece of software won\u0027t trap you in nearly so abusive a relationship, but\u00A0If you think SketchUp is the difference between doing it and not doing it, then \u003Cem\u003Euse it\u003C/em\u003E. You will learn to deal with its eccentricities (and experience relatively few of them if your models are geometrically simple and/or hand tirangulated), and you\u0027ll learn a lot about modeling in general regardless. Like I said, I\u0027m only just now getting the hang of 3ds. Had I forced myself to use that and only that in the beginning, I\u0027d either have figured it out much sooner, or given up. Getting something ingame is cathartic. Do it however you have to.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll leave you with a quote from a friend of mine that does a lot of abstract SketchUp work:\u00A0\u003Ci\u003ESketchUp has to think you\u0027re modeling a building.

I export .3ds from SketchUp, import it into 3ds Max, do my UV work and make sure my alignment is good, and then pull my .max project into unity. From there its all parttools as normal. Part tools is easier to learn than it looks like it should be, and fairly well documented. If you get frustrated, remind yourself how glad you are you aren\u0027t exporting for FSX instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, you cannot really UV in SketchUp. I\u0027ve seen plugins, but none I got to work. I don\u0027t recommend\u00A0assembling collision models in SketchUp either, but rather using the 3ds optimize modifer (decimate in blender, IIRC) to produce a reasonable LoD from your original model, at least if you\u0027re as lazy as I am.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you can\u0027t figure out blender or 3ds\u00A0for modeling SketchUp is a good alternative, but you will still have to use one of the formers as a middle man. You cannot escape UV maps. I\u0027m not really sure how to teach that because it took me literally years of occasionally throwing a week at it and then giving up until I finally figured it out. All the youtube guides in the world didn\u0027t help me. One day it just clicked. That said, once it clicks, you will start to get better, and suddenly all the youtube videos will make sense. It seems really simple once you\u0027ve managed it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-09T08:29:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2017 08:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Balto-the-Wolf-Dog\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceMouse","CreatedById":126931,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-09T14:20:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis will sound clich\u00E9, but if i learned Blender anyone can.
