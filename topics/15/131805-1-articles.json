Is it possible to have 2 versions of Unity installed on the same PC? I still want to make my own parts for my 1.0.5 install, so I don\u0027t want to uninstall Unity 4.\u00A0Also, which version of Unity 5 should I use? I think I read somewhere that Squad is on 5.3.1.\u00A0Is this the version I should install, or does it not matter as long as it is Unity 5?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-10T18:44:25Z\u0022 title=\u002202/10/2016 06:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by fairy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-10T22:34:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmultiple versions is no problem, just specify different install folder for Unity5; Any 5.x should be okay for making mods, really depends on which version Parttools plays best with, so best to go the same release as Squad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-10T23:17:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been using Unity 5 the entire time. \u00A0It\u0027s worked perfectly fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
