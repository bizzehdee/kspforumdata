There will be full tutorials on everything when I have time. But in short. You need to load them in unity, and assign an emissive shader to the part. The emissives are controlled by a simple diffuse map. That is then multiplied by the emissive color. \n\nYou can use this in two ways essentially.\n\nYou can use a grayscale map, which is then multiplied by the emissive color. The light areas will show brightly and purely the color, and the dark areas will not show it at all. Brightness of the emissive color will determine the maximum shine.\n\nAdditionally you can use a color diffuse map, and multiply it from black to white, to control the intensity of the emission."},{"CreatedByName":"Spoot Knight","CreatedById":8302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T03:25:18Z","Content":"Best that I wait for those tutorials then."},{"CreatedByName":"CardBoardBoxProcessor","CreatedById":10179,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-02T12:10:01Z","Content":"[http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=13450.0](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=13450.0)"}]}
