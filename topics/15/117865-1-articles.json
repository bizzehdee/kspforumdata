No matter what I did the rotation was wrong. \n\nNertea has [working heat pipes](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124391-1-02-Heat-Control-Manage-your-ship-s-heat!-%2815-06-2015-new-radiators-and-heat-exchangers%29), though I\u0027m not sure if they use the same compound part module as stock or he wrote his own plugin. ASFAIK fuel lines and struts use the same mechanic for placing the visual parts, so it might be helpful.\n\nEdit: I don\u0027t think they are entirely from scratch though, which sort of invalidates my post.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-07T13:51:09Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2015 01:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ven","CreatedById":109931,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T15:11:14Z","Content":"I think that you need to just scale up the line object a bit, extending it past your target transform may just work.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-07T16:24:46Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2015 04:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ven**"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T16:41:48Z","Content":"Yeah, I was going to try extending past as the next test. As long as it lines up correctly at all possible deployment lengths, I won\u0027t complain, but it may not look right in the menu icon. I\u0027m just wondering if I\u0027m missing something, since the stock ones show two different behaviors. The stock strut meets up with the target transform\u0027s origin. The stock fuel line falls short of it, touching the target \u0022cap\u0022 transform\u0027s mesh, but not the origin. I tried similar setups with mine without things lining up right. \n\nI\u0027ll experiment with it some more next week. I won\u0027t have time before then."}]}
