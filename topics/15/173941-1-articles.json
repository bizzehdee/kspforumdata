If it\u0027s completely invisible it sounds like you may have the normals reversed(in conjunction with multiple textures). To fix this you\u0027d need to flip the normals in whatever program you used to model it. This problem can also happen if you use multiple textures on a single mesh only without flipped normals. KSP only supports a single texture per mesh and if you apply multiples and then import it into unity, any parts of that mesh that use the textures beyond the first one listed will be invisible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing that could be wrong is that your colliders have too many vertices, there is an upper limit of 256?(I think), and when a part has more than that it exports a corrupted mesh file, the game will load it but it won\u0027t show up in game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-19T17:08:56Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2018 05:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by raidernick\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
