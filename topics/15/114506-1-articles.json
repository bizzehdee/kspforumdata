But seriously without your config and model I\u0027m guessing the transforms for your internalseats are in the wrong place. Have you set them to local in unity? Have you rotated your internal correctly before creating your mu file?"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T04:56:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Haha.

The seats are inside the internal, named to match and facing, I assume correctly, so the Kerbals are upright and facing forward.\n\nHere\u0027s the Unity screen. I did have the internal basically overtop the mesh for the external. But, I ripped it out and copied it over to a new scene thinking that might be it, then doubled it\u0027s size and exported it back to Unity thinking they might be bashing their heads... same result. I can move the internal seats and the Kerbals shift positions but anytime the seat is in a position to put them inside... it tosses em back to this location regardless of where the seat is. I was thinking this must be a \u0027default\u0027 location when it can\u0027t place them inside. I dunno... I\u0027m all confused with this one.\n\n![IVA2.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/IVA2.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T05:50:07Z","Content":"Well, I found part of the problem.

Omg this should not have taken hours to figure out. The IVA inside the runway, was me not remembering to set the layers when I moved the entire object from one scene to another. That was about 20 minutes. The rest of the time... several hours... was trying to figure out TT\u0027s IVA \u0027tutorial\u0027 listed in the mod development links. I had this really difficult concept with Z being \u0027backward\u0027???? Seems pretty ambiguous.\n\nAnyway, crude IVA in place. And below is a screenshot, for those having this same issue, showing the orientation of the IVA to the object I was attaching it to. I chopped the IVA out of the original model but didn\u0027t move it from it\u0027s location so that (theory being) as an IVA it would match the location on the external model for where I wanted it. It\u0027s rotated X 90, Z 180 in relation to the external object. The seats are rotated Y 180 in relation to the internal object. Yea, all confusing. You see why it took me a few minutes.\n\nAnyway, thanks JP, you put me on the right track.\n\n![IVA4.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/IVA4.jpg)\n\n![IVA5.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/IVA5.jpg)"}]}
