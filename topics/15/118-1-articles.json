I had a few problems though.\n\nWith both 3DSMax 2010 and the OpenCOLLADA plugin for it, whenever I try and import a vanilla model it crashes. If I save an object I\u0027ve made and import it, it\u0027s fine. I\u0027ve never used COLLADA before. As a side note, for those who model, which would you say the best program for modeling in this game is? Preferably something simpler and/or free if it\u0027s not 3DS.\n\nWhenever I export to a DAE or OBJ file, set the .cfg file and load the game, the part appears on the left side of the loading screen after a bit and the game doesn\u0027t get any farther. Yes, I\u0027ve red the guidelines for modeling on the wiki.\n\nI\u0027ve tried using the SDK tool provided, however when I highlight the part folder (such as fuelTank), the select button is greyed out.\n\nI seem to be out of any way to figure out what\u0027s going on without help, so any tips on what I\u0027m doing wrong/how to do it would be greatly appreciated."},{"CreatedByName":"Badot","CreatedById":611,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-12T23:18:34Z","Content":"Got it... except for importing models now... OpenCOLLADA seemed to be breaking stuff, and there were a few little stupid mistakes I made."}]}
