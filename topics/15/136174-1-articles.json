After looking at the LFB KR-1x2, I decided to do what Squad did and cut the single KR-1 engine off the rest of the model, leaving me with this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/hmT9I/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem I\u0027m having now, is what tweaks to make to it. If I just divide the information from the \u0022Twin Boar\u0022, I\u0027m left with an engine that gets 1000 kn of thrust in Vac, 933 kn in Atmosphere, and a slightly worse Isp than the \u0022Vector\u0022. The LFB KR-1x2 gives a description that the KR-1 sacrificed thrust and efficiency for the booster design. Would this be a good fit as a upper stage J-2x or RL-10 analog to compliment the KS-25 \u0022Vector\u0022 when that is used as a lower stage booster?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-06T13:36:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGosh, yeah that\u0027s a tough call. Usually when splitting clusters, I prefer to make the stats make sense, by giving it the correct fractional thrust and mass, and similar ISP. But from a gameplay perspective and balance perspective, sometimes you have to fudge things. If it\u0027s stepping on the Vector\u0027s toes,making it a J-2 equivalent upper stage engine isn\u0027t a bad idea. But then again, the Twin Boar is modeled after some of the earlier SLS concepts, and those LFBs would have used F-1B engines, which are of course high-thrust kerosene engines with a lower ISP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess it really depends on how you want the engine to be used, and whether it will completely obsolete the other 1.25m engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
