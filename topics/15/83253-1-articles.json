I noticed that it likes to put the camera seemly where the actual dockingNode is located so if you docking port is a probe, the view you get it obstructed because the camera is \u0022inside\u0022 the docking probe so you can\u0027t see anything. Is there a way to move the camera further forward while keeping the docking node where it is?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have an empty game object called DockingNode I am however not using that in the actual module. In the module definitions in the CFG I am using the stack node which is placed in the same location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EMODULE\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E    name = ModuleDockingNode\u003Cbr\u003E    //referenceAttachNode = dockingNode\u003Cbr\u003E    referenceAttachNode = top\u003Cbr\u003E    nodeType = size1\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RM4C6CN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RM4C6CN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"raidernick","CreatedById":97711,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-03T08:12:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnybody?
