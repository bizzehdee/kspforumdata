If you had checked out the newly updated KSPIE 1.25.13, you\u0027ll found something like \u0022FusionBeam\u0022, \u0022CentralBeam\u0022, \u0022AMBeam\u0022 and \u0022AMRadiation\u0022, don\u0027t try them out, they DO NOT WORK! I\u0027m a beginner modder, I knew about modeling and texturing (although learned recently), but I don\u0027t know how engine plumes work. I added an empty object in Unity, titled it \u0022plume\u0022 and then added KSP Part tools and a \u0022position\u0022 empty object as it\u0027s child, then applied a particle system, with KSP particle emitter, and a lens flare as texture. the material was using KSP particle shaders too. For better effects, I used particle size of 0.1-0.25, and applied the \u0022trail\u0022 effect. After I compiled and wrote cfg, I find only tiny particles are showing up, horizontal to the direction of thrust, and the trial of each particle is completely gone. how to fix this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-23T06:41:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/196817-synx/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022196817\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/196817-synx/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@SynX\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0 Here is a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.eskandare.com/blogs.html#efx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etutorial \u003C/a\u003Eon how to create custom exhaust effects\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-23T06:41:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2020 06:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
