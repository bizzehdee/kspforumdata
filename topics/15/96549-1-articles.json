I\u0027ve noticed that both you (specifically on the Nuclear Lightbulb) and Ven have been able to create engines that, when gimballing, move the supports connected to the bell with it. I\u0027ve tried to find out how to create this effect and so far I think that the supports have to be their own objects, but beyond that I\u0027m not sure how to set it up..\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-15T19:00:29Z\u0022 title=\u002201/15/2015 07:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Quiznos323\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"artwhaley","CreatedById":118388,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-15T19:56:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never seen that behavior where it selects additional faces when you hit unwrap! If you figure out what\u0027s causing it, definitely post back here to let us know, because if I ever DO have that problem, it\u0027ll make me throw things around the room! A temporary work-around for you.... Pin and unpin coordinates so they don\u0027t move on the next unwrap. So you\u0027d start be unwrapping the whole model, then in the uv/image editor select all the UV\u0027s.... move them off to the side, and press P to pin them in place. Now you can select just the part you actually want to unwrap, press Alt-P to unpin them, and unwrap them, and everything else should stay put. Position and tune the piece you\u0027re working with, then press P to pin it. Select the next bit and do it again!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope porkjet doesn\u0027t mind me answering your question about how he makes magic... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe secret is module FXModuleLookAtConstraint . Take a look at the .cfg file for the lightbulb engine and you\u0027ll see that module with a bunch of blocks that look like this :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECONSTRAINLOOKFX\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E {\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E targetName = Anchor01\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E rotatorsName = Piston01\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose blocks tell KSP that an item named Piston01 should always point towards an empty game object (or other model object) named Anchor01. So, for example, you set the pivot point on Piston01 to be the point that should remain fixed on the engine housing... then parent an empty named Anchor01 to the gimballed nozzle. That way, when the thrustTransform moves, the nozzle moves, dragging the Anchor objects with it, and the pistons wriggle on their pivot point to keep aiming at the targets. (You also can set it up exactly opposite, where the Pistons are parented to the nozzle and move with it, and the Anchor objects are fixed in place on the engine housing. I didn\u0027t look to see how Porkjet did it.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you need more travel room before the piston pops apart you can set one end of the piston attached to the house and the other end attached to the nozzle (each with their pivots set to the point where they touch their parent) and then make them look at each other, so the whole thing will stay lined up over a pretty wide range of travel and the pistons will just slip inside each other.... like a piston. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that wasn\u0027t clear, let me know and I\u0027ll try again.
