It will reset the default scale to 1 with the current dimensions. Having an oddly scaled object sometimes leads to weird artifacts. It could also be the projection used to UV map it. I\u0027ve found the least artifacty way to unwrap is just the basic unwrap and then manually aligning the axes. There\u0027s bound to be a better, faster way but I haven\u0027t figured it.
