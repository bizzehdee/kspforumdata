The two additional parts added in KSP have a mass of 0.0. The actual ship has a mass of 225 tons. Hope that\u0027s clear.\n\nNow, I changed from the 2 fuel source of normal rocket engines to a single fuel source (and removed the RESOURCE for that fuel as well). I also changed the max thrust.\n\nNeither of those items touched the thrustTransform. Both of the items dealt with the same ship at 0,0,0. Fuel stored internally so any mass change of fuel would just change mass of entire ship so CoM would not change.\n\nYet now, if I even attempt to bring the ship up to even 1/3 throttle, it starts cartwheeling stern over bow.\n\nIt makes no sense what happened. I triple checked Unity to ensure the thrustTransform is at 0,0,-10~ and that is pointing directly away from CoM of 0,0,0. Even the landing legs are part of the ship as a whole so should not effect CoM. Yet something is. What did I miss? What did I screw up?\n\nPlease, any help would be appreciated.\n\ntwo pics to hopefully help.\n\n![1j6dl3.jpg](%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i58.tinypic.com/1j6dl3.jpg)\n\n![2ekosvp.jpg](%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i62.tinypic.com/2ekosvp.jpg)\n\nNot sure what the issue was but loaded Unity, rewrote the unaltered file and bingo, working normally again.\n\nSorry to have annoyed anyone.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-08T23:57:11Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2015 11:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MLWostal**\n  \nadd pics"},{"CreatedByName":"MatterBeam","CreatedById":133334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T13:59:57Z","Content":"I just started modelling yesterday, but I\u0027m pretty sure the little thrustTransform cube should be right under the center of your model.
