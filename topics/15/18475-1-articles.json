I\u0027ve also looked in the other files and don\u0027t see anything that could be a Kerbal model (no .obj or .dae files)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other issue I\u0027ve been baffled about is most of the files in the \u0022parts\u0022 folder do not have the .dae files for example \u0022fuelTank1-2\u0022 does not have any .dae files, only .MU and .MBM files. Is this just a way to save poly count in the game and just re-texture the same model?

The building models and planet models specifically?
