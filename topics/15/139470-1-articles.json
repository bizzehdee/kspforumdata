I UV unwrapped the different parts of the model onto a single UV map for simplicities sake.\u00A0It looks fine in Blender (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/xty5SDM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esee here\u003C/a\u003E). The textures aren\u0027t finished, but somebody else is going to do them so these are simply for testing. I then try to export the model as a .dae for import into Unity. When I import into Blender, the model is untextured, and I must drag the texture onto the material. \u00A0Because the model is separate parts, Unity simply wraps the texture around the model, disregarding the way I set it up in Blender.

I feel like I\u0027m being really dumb as I\u0027ve never had this issue before, but I\u0027ve got no idea how to fix it so it would be great if someone more experienced could give me some tips.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me know if I can provide any more info.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"martinezfg11","CreatedById":59995,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-10T18:59:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo your UV map isn\u0027t exporting?
