I have successfully been able to produce a 2.5m fuel tank, however upon trying to make a solid rocket motor, I ran into various problems. I followed the same procedure for making the fuel tank, but upon trying to load it into the game, the engine didn\u0027t produce thrust and did not\u00A0produce any plume or exhaust\u00A0(it did consume whatever resources were in the motor, however). So, I am wondering now what I would need to do differently in order for this to work, and what other sorts of things should I take into account.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI followed this tutorial as posted in another thread:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/7hRJ1qI8uoY?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will still try to go through the thread for any other things I may have missed, but I was wondering if anyone had any sorts of tips on where to go or what to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end, I would like to produce very small parts (and custom effects, like different color exhaust plumes and custom thrust curves)\u00A0but for now these are just test works in order to get somewhat comfortable with creating parts before jumping into the madness, so to speak.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-19T01:41:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you add a thrust transform to your engine? I have a dim recollection of needing a FX transform for the plume too - though I think you can use the thrust transform for that if you want. I think the rationale for using a separate transform was that changes to the plume were easier to make without changing the thrust transform.
