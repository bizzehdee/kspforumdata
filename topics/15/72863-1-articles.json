Worst thing in KSP!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheres no real pattern behind this, you just gotta keep moving and resizing things around until it magically works. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had situations where it wouldn\u0027t work, no matter what or how long I tried.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, make sure your colliders have the correct tags and layers like you read in the tutorials and that the colliders \u0027is trigger\u0027 box is activated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s only a few vague things I can say:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The model must have a single collider. Having the hatch touch overlapping colliders will obstruct it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Hatch collider should be big enough for a kerbal to fit in, at least 0.5 in all directions (although I\u0027ve succesfully used smaller colliders in some cases)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thing I\u0027ve read about but I can\u0027t directly confirm:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u0022If hatch is positioned too far from the center it will be obstructed\u0022 - this may be true under some conditions, but I\u0027ve succesfully placed hatches as far as ~3m above the center (PA550 habitat)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esome notes about Ladders that may or may not help you:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The ladder collider will \u0027obstruct\u0027 the \u0027clickability\u0027 of the hatch, so if your ladder collider is bigger than the hatch and covers it completely, you won\u0027t be able to click the hatch. Make your ladder colliders small, the hatch must surround it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Squad seems to be using Capsule colliders for their hatches and ladders. Personally I have not found any advantages or disadvantages between capsule or box colliders, both work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wish you the best of luck with your project, lets hope squad will rework the way those hatches work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blackheart612","CreatedById":42741,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-21T10:52:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, porkjet, tried all of them already.
