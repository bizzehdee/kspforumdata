I imported a mesh from an existing asset into the software and made my new part. However when I export it I can\u0027t seem to find the right combination of maya scene scale and dae scale export settings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe part keeps coming out huge in the VAB and in partlab. If I make an OBJ and then scale it down to .01 before exporting it looks like it is the right size. But I have had no luck with dae files. I have tried all the different conversion scales in the exporter and none of them seem to make a difference. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the .cfg file I have the scale set to 1.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny suggestions are much appreciated. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mashed","CreatedById":1040,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-14T06:23:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell to sort of solve my own problem I tried using the open collada exporter and that seems to work. I haven\u0027t had any joy with the out of the box FBX/DAE exporter though. Open Collada isn\u0027t available for Maya 2012 yet, luckily I have a 2011 install still on the go. \u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
