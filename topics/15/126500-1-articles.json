So far I have not added emission to my engine nozzles. I only see 2 slots designated for textures in Unity. Is there a way to add a third slot? How does one go about doing this?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThank you :)\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-26T15:15:02Z\u0022 title=\u002211/26/2015 03:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by fairy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nookos","CreatedById":144067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T13:34:20Z","Content":"\nYes it is possible. You just need to use the KSP emissive bumped shader. You can even use the one that adds specular on top of all that.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit: [IMG]http://lacroixdidier.com/temp/KSPShader.jpg[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOf course this requires part tool.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-26T13:37:21Z\u0022 title=\u002211/26/2015 01:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nookos\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fairy","CreatedById":152892,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T15:14:12Z","Content":"\nOh ok, nice.
