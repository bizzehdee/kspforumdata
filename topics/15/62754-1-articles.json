But whenever I edit and save the file (or even just save it without editing), every transparent turns into black. I use Gimp, paintDOTnet, and infranview. To my knowledge Gimp can save alpha channels. Also if the rest of the texture for the Gigantron is not in this png file, then where does KSP store it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZVAhBMB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZVAhBMB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also see how I used a painful manual method to locate the missing texture places on another part:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68174-ION-engine-modification?p=943553#post943553\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68174-ION-engine-modification?p=943553#post943553\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stubbles","CreatedById":36867,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T07:24:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI only know how to edit them in Photoshop.
