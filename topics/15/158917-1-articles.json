So for those that model or have modeled propellers, I\u0027d like to know:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow did you model them? Did you use any kind of software to get the blade geometry close to accurate, or did you just make it look close enough?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know Firespitter allows for motion blurring of the blades in rotation, but I\u0027ve seen it on other props that I\u0027m not sure use Firespitter; so if it\u0027s possible to blur the blades in the rotation without Firespitter, how can it be done?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-08T18:26:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi the blade geometry apart from it\u0027s position on the hub is irrelevant, Things such as pitch and chord have no influence on how a propeller\u00A0 in KSP works because they do not function like propellers,\u00A0 yes they do accelerate the craft but it\u0027s not the blades that are doing it. Like all other KSP engines (aside from mod/stock turboshafts etc) they\u00A0 provide the acceleration and thrust\u00A0 via a thrust transform.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe blades do all have to be the same size length etc and balanced around the hub , as an unbalanced mesh will cause vibration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn Firespitter the prop blur is achieved by a little bit of mesh switching,\u00A0 the model consists of usually engine body, prop spinner and prop blades,\u00A0 and a blur disc,\u00A0 In use when a certain RPM is reached the firespitter plugin switches off the visible blades and switches on the blur disc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can use the stock animate throttle for prop simulation. and with the correct animation speeds, some form of automatic blur takes place.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever I have used both methods recently and to get an accurate simulation of a propeller using the stock modules takes a good amount of fiddling. The firespitter method seems to be much closer to a real world behavior. and easier/quicker to set up\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example using stock engine modules and animate throttle, when you shut the engine down it just stops dead, there\u0027s no, what Firespitter calls windmill time, a real prop will rotate a bit after shutdown and turboprops have a long spool down\u00A0 generally\u00A0 and only Firespitter ( There may be others )\u00A0 does this properly\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SchwinnTropius","CreatedById":165170,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-08T18:54:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m aware that the power provided by the engine is solely through engine modules, I intended to ask solely about visual accuracy and what people use to achieve it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout the stock module blurring: I\u0027ve used the stock modules to make the prop spin when the engine is activated even at 0 throttle, I just couldn\u0027t get the blur at the higher throttle settings.

Pretty basic stuff really,\u00A0 it gets a bit trickier with odd number a blades and you need to take a bit of extra care to make sure the center stays in the center.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022o1CDSjn.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/o1CDSjn.png\u0022 width=\u0022960\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the blur its never as good as the Firespitter version and very much depends on frame rate, but it is passable, just being a matter of trial and error with anim speeds and cfg values\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SchwinnTropius","CreatedById":165170,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-08T20:58:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks interesting.
