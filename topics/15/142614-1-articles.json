Below is an imgur album showing what it looks like in game and what my hierarchy is in Unity. Help would be really appreciated.

Your wheel collider is in the wrong place, it should be for best performance at the extreme outer edge of the wheel, along with the suspension transform, moving those out to the correct positions will help resolve some of your issues\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
