All this information is gathered from several sources and whilst it is not a great way to do things it has been working for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly I use Gimp, it\u0027s free and I\u0027m used to it so we will stay VERY basic even though PS can do oh so much more (like Random seed your brush for example) but that\u0027s not what I\u0027m doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I start with Grey - r155 g155 b155 (\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/DVhgkRNXuJQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E) and use that as a background. You will want to add a tiny bit of noise to this with a filter like HSV Hurl. \u003Cp\u003ENext I add new layer and start painting shadow by hand (something not too dark as it wants to be subtle) and messily with my mouse until I\u0027m happy that all concave bits are done. I use an airbrush tool but I don\u0027t worry about nice clean gradiants. This layer will need a major dose of gaussian blur like 20pixels or more for a 1024* image!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, new layer. About this point I have looked at the UV enough to have an idea what I plan to do with it. I only put detail in blocks so either pick the Magic Select tool (less good due to pixelisation on any angled selection line) or the free line marquis tool and trace out some choice blocks from the UV map. Make sure your new layer is selected (to transpose your selection from the UV layer to your blank layer) and then use the bucket tool to fill the selection with the same grey as your background (r155g155b155 more \u0022Magic Grey\u0022) you will be very pleased to see nothing change. Now with those blocks selected run \u0022Bevel\u0022 and see your new panels spring forth from the background!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow back to shading - Add new layer and add detailed shading around the panels you have made. This will also need a 20pixel Gaussian blur and please note the effects of putting this layer above or below your panels as you can get a good effect either way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENearly done! - Add new layer and add highlights to the edges as they need it, I use something light but still grey (I think it\u0027s ~r191g191b191) and I try to keep this layer to the bare minimum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast layer - I have been tending to use \u0022splatter\u0022 as a brush to just add some gruffness to the leading and trailing edges. In my minds eye this is caused by small impacts like bees for example and just acts to messy it up a little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPutting it all together:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am a messy git so I will tend to have layers everywhere and none of them named - it\u0027s not good practice but I\u0027m not being payed so hey ho. You will want to get your layers arranged like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBackground - 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPanels - 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShading (both layers) - 3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDetail - 4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving them in this order makes it super easy to vary the opacity on your upper layers until everything looks right. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETinker with it and you are done! I tend to try and brand stuff with a JonzCo\u0027ness but JonzCo is such a new company that their corporate style is still in flux and we don\u0027t even have a proper Logo!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETips: Keep it subtle, even the very tiny noise you added to your base layer will be really visible in game so bare that in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are planning to make a Normal Map then you can make a functional one with the filters available in Gimp or PS, just remember to save as copy and don\u0027t use the shading or background layer you added noise to!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no such thing as \u0022too many layers\u0022 but there is such a thing as \u0022crap I can\u0027t adjust that without effecting this\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that\u0027s all - I don\u0027t think I make good textures but I do make consistent poor ones which is a start.

Group and label them so you can find the right one later...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* If you can\u0027t seem to get a particular effect, browse some art sites ( even DeviantArt ) and see if there\u0027s a brush that will get nearer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* I\u0027m not going to talk about actually creating textures because there\u0027s tons of tutorials around who can do it way better than I can. Get to know some texture sites, you might find some tileable texture that\u0027s 80% of the work already ( but beware licensing, etc ).
