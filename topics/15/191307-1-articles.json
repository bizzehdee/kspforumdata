And I like the orange and grey color scheme in KSP, which is not well represented among the space station parts mod. Also, I\u0027m kind of bored of the cylindrical \u002B toroids habs, and I\u0027m a fan of modular configuration, or honeybees. A system you can grow around, going in all directions, not only along an axis. Also, if you can use the same part for space and landed bases, that\u0027s a plus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve started to design some modules using FreeCad (yeah, not blender, but again, math, dimensions and mechanical constraints speaks to me, and I can export a mesh in whatever format I want, so I\u0027ll d the texturing, UVmapping and stuff using Blender). I\u0027ve tried hexagons, but they\u0027re excrementsty at making a sphere with them, so I\u0027ve gone octogonal (and triangles), to have a enclosure around a spherical modules.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022FD1A288B1AC2B35412A99AAA774C0B82007E9BAC\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002255.70\u0022 height=\u0022570\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/775118071083504736/FD1A288B1AC2B35412A99AAA774C0B82007E9BAC/\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe color are really not final, they just helps me with having an idea of it. The blueish parts are the windows, and I need to decide what to do with the top, I\u0027ll probably do some door / inside hatch system. The idea is to be able to stack them around, either by the faces, or by the triangular corners, and to add functionnality to them by adding triangular modules and adapters (1.5m parts should fit on those triangle faces).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know it\u0027s not really going to be stock-like, but what do you think of it ? (yes, I need to add details, ladders, grab bar and stuff). I\u0027m not sure about the top ring either, it kind of forces it to be the \u0027up\u0027 part of the module, while I\u0027d like to have no such thing as top, and remains in a plug and play system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Okhin","CreatedById":201182,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-04T11:46:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m thinking about this a lot these days.
