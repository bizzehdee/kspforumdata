My problem isn\u0027t HOW do I do this, it\u0027s just what should it look like?\n\nBasicly, I need design ideas. The engine is a 3.75m Nerv, and for those who have seen my EnginesPlus thread, I\u0027m working on the beautification update. And I need design ideas for the Supernova, cause the old one doesn\u0027t look good, and looks very similar to Tsar. So yeah! Some help would be appreciated, thanks in advance. \n\n-Astro"},{"CreatedByName":"mariohm1311","CreatedById":114131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T20:27:03Z","Content":"A good thing I recommend you to do is to learn about how rocket engines work, the power cycles, and so.

This texture should be grey-scale, and is like a brightness-map. Black areas will correspond to parts that don\u0027t glow at all, whereas white areas will glow quite brightly. Then, in Unity you will want to use one of the \u0022Emissive\u0022 shaders (usually \u0022KSP/Emissive/Specular\u0022). Leave the emissive color set to black, and then create an animation in Unity where the Emissive color starts at black, and ends at something brighter after 1 second.\n\nPersonally what I do is make the outside of the engine bell glow only a little (relatively), and the inside glow a lot. I set the final emsissive red/green/blue values to 5/2/1. The reason I use this is pretty simple. As various parts of the emissive map \u0022warm up\u0022, they\u0027ll pass through shades that are mostly red at first, then yellow, then a hot white, because a value of \u00221\u0022 (or higher) is fully saturated. At low percentages, the red is the brightest part of that emissive color, and higher up they\u0027re all saturated, so it hits orange, then yellow, and then white in the brightest part of the map, but darker parts of the emissive map will still be red or orange."},{"CreatedByName":"mariohm1311","CreatedById":114131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T14:47:13Z","Content":"Oh, and don\u0027t forget that in a nuclear engine the hottest part is the nozzle throat."}]}
