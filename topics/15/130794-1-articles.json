With such a high level of work needed it would actually be much more productive to take several detailed pictures(top,bottom,left,right\u002B\u002B) of the instruments in question and just model them using those pictures as references.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-28T08:18:46Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2016 08:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by landeTLS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-02T15:24:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsearch photogrammetry; autodesk\u0027s 123D Catch (don\u0027t use the mobile version it\u0027s junk). not for 3D beginner though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
