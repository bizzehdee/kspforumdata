I\u0027m just starting to model, so I\u0027m sorry for the banal mistakes if they have a place to be. My problem is that the part (fuel tank) that I made .... It doesn\u0027t work properly. The aerodynamic effects on it are not the same as on all other parts. As you can see in the screenshots, they are twisted in a spiral somewhere under 45 degrees. Used by Unity 2019.2. 2f1, the latest version of Part Tools and TextMesh Pro Release 1.0.56. Everything was done according to the guide that is fixed in this branch. In Blender, I did the standard manipulations. Created a cylinder of certain dimensions. Smoothed it out and applied the Edge Split modifier. That\u0027s all. What can cause such strange things to happen ?\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MA2fdyI.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002241.75\u0022 height=\u0022469\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/MA2fdyI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fundati","CreatedById":208109,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-22T23:00:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom what I understand, modifiers applied in Blender do not translate out, so that might be your issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
