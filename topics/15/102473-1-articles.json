With parts clipped it\u0027s even worse and the craft tends to explode.

I was using the NODE{} blocks with transforms, and I switched to the old way which is also what is in the video, but changing that didn\u0027t seem to have any effect either..\n\nMy Mk2 parts also seem to have an issue with clipping, but not nearly to the degree of the Mk1s.\n\nIn Unity:\n\n![302LVBrh.png](http://i.imgur.com/302LVBrh.png)\n\n![6JtE9x3h.png](http://i.imgur.com/6JtE9x3h.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-07T04:07:12Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2015 04:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Quiznos323**"},{"CreatedByName":"Quiznos323","CreatedById":114900,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T19:05:27Z","Content":"Maybe this has something to do with the parts being animated? I\u0027ve noticed that the turbojet part from Ven\u0027s stock revamp does the same thing when clipped. I imported it to blender to take a closer look and it uses an animation to expand the nozzle. Idk why an animation would cause this problem but that\u0027s the only similarity I\u0027ve found between parts that cause rapid unplanned disassembly on the runway lol."},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T22:11:39Z","Content":"I\u0027ve only seen this sort of thing one time, it was due to a bug with a mod, it\u0027s been fixed now. moving parts can cause colliders from different parts to push the craft apart, but it takes quite a lot of force. minor clipping between parts like your jet doesn\u0027t seem like it would cause the problem. colliders on a single part would never do anything like this. Does this happen in a clean install?"},{"CreatedByName":"Quiznos323","CreatedById":114900,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T05:43:04Z","Content":"Ah ok, what mod was that? On a clean install it seems to be normal when there is no clipping, but when parts clip into the engines parts start to wiggle a little and apply small amounts of force to the craft still. It\u0027s weird xD"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T14:25:19Z","Content":"FAR or Kerbal Joint Enforcement, that was back in 0.24.5."},{"CreatedByName":"Quiznos323","CreatedById":114900,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T08:49:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E FAR or Kerbal Joint Enforcement, that was back in 0.24.5.\n\nHmm, yeah I\u0027m not running KJR and have only very recently been using FAR for compatibility testing. It doesn\u0027t seem to be linked to moving colliders either because I tried making a Mk2 profile twin turbojet engine with animated nozzles, and it has no moving colliders, yet it doesn\u0027t even like to be placed on a craft without causing wonky forces to be applied to it. There isn\u0027t any info on this issue in the modding development links thread that I could find, so I\u0027m really stumped as to how to go about fixing it. I would really like to solve it though, as these vtol parts are critical to my mod xD\n\nIf anyone would be willing to look over a model or two I can provide any files that you may need!"},{"CreatedByName":"Quiznos323","CreatedById":114900,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T04:06:49Z","Content":"Fixed it! I had the colliders childed under the main mesh instead of the empty game object for the part, so the animations were doing funky things with the collders... Phew, glad that nightmare is over."}]}
