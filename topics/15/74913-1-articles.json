So when your part animates, the mesh moves, but nothing else cares. The only way to overcome this is via a plugin which will move the child part\u0027s attachment coordinate to match, but having that be based on the animation is not really practical using surface attach nodes. Stack Attach Nodes can be made to use transforms built into the original mesh object structure, so you can place a node childed onto an animated bit so that the transform moves as part of the animation.
