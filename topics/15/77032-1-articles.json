Anyway, on my researches I have learnt that the thing used spin stabilisation, rather to the same effect as a rifle bullet i suppose, so my question to you bright sparks out there, is it possible to create in KSP? If i have to learn how to code and make a plugin I will, and I know and can get it spinning like a top but it\u0027s not exactly beneficial at this present time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo a re phrase of the question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Is spin stabilisation a valid option for non manned craft or should they and I just bite the bullet and go with canards?

And yes, it works decently in KSP, although max rotation allowed in KSP is far lower than the thousand-RPM stabilization something like that would use. Also, time warp kills rotation unless you have skykooler\u0027s Time Warp Rotation fix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait. You\u0027re talking about during *launch*?
