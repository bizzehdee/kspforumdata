How can I make it smoother? (more rounded) Does that mean editing the model in blender to give it more \u0022faces\u0022 basically? In game it just looks really clunkey if you know what I mean. I tried to \u0022count the sides\u0022 of the default fueltank and Im fairly sure there are the same number of sides compared to the stock fueltank. Not sure what to do about it @.@\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LaydeeDem","CreatedById":5984,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-03T18:40:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you turn on smooth shading?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-03T19:04:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, there\u0027s a smooth and flat setting in the left menu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you probably want to do an Edge Split on your model; its a modifier you select from the \u0022Object Modifiers\u0022 tab on \u0022Outliner\u0022 workspace panel (the one on the far right in the default workspace)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Soporific Donkey","CreatedById":52175,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-03T20:13:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, had a look at the file. Maybe its a conversion thing (I\u0027m using 3dsmax) but trying to edit the smoothing groups of that mesh didn\u0027t work. I\u0027ve had a similar issue before and had to reset the mesh normals (I don\u0027t know how you do this in blender) using an edit normal modifier in 3dsmax. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also had a peak at your UV\u0027s and noticed a lot of the seams are not welded. You may want to fix this as each split adds to the vertex count (see the image bellow) which is inefficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ATTACH=CONFIG]34112[/ATTACH]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want more info read the section \u0022Welcome to Splitsville\u0022 located \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.ericchadwick.com/examples/provost/byf2.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027ve uploaded a version with it fixed for you and a version with fixed UV\u0027s but you would have to remake your texture to use it (but I did a simple blockout for you to help).
