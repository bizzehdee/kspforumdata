I know 3D modelling and texturing in blender, and have a very basic notion of Unity, I wanna start with a very small parts mod, I0m following this tutorial\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/mFRICd-0zYo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n. I have my model textured in blender and I exported it as a Collada file. I then set up PartTools in unity, and import a folder with the .dae model file and the texture file. Now, in the tutorial right after the model is imported onto the scene a lot of components appear by default like a mesh renderer and a mesh filter with a default diffuse material. Whenever I import my model to the scene it doesn\u0027t have any components. I can add them myself and then add the texture, but then whenever I write the final .mu file with PartTools only the .mu file is created, without a texture. What am I doing wrong here?\nAny help much appreciated, thanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T09:05:15Z","Content":"Some screen grabs would be really helpful. Those components will have been added, or the model won\u0027t get rendered in Unity, but they are applied to each object in the model. The top level object may just be an empty object.\n\nLook in the console in Unity to see what gets logged as you export too."},{"CreatedByName":"nestor_d","CreatedById":138673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T15:48:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Some screen grabs would be really helpful.

What size is the .mu? Does it export the textures with the .mu?"},{"CreatedByName":"nestor_d","CreatedById":138673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T18:10:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s a good start.

I forgot to delete the camera and the lamp in blender so I guess the PartTools exporter didn\u0027t really know what was going on. I even managed to open it in KSP now ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) However I will probably need help further down the road, since this is my first try at modding!"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T21:17:28Z","Content":"Great stuff. You\u0027re doing OK so far if you\u0027ve got a part into KSP. Good luck"}]}
