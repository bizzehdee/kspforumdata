I\u0027ve made small changes to the .cfg files of different parts before, just for the sake of experimenting. So I decided to try making a half scale (.625m) turbojet engine. I set the scale to .5 rather than 1 and halved the mass, thrust, and a handful of other properties. And when I loaded KSP, the new part (with the correct table and cost/thrust/mass values I gave it) was there, but at exactly the same size as the original. The attachment point simply moved into the approximate center of the part, rather than at the flush end where it would normally attach to a craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m just wondering if there\u0027s another value I can modify to get the result I want of a half-sized jet engine. If it\u0027s more complicated than that, then that\u0027s all I need to know and I suppose I\u0027ll try to hunt up yet another mod for a few more small-scale parts.
