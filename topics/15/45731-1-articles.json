There is no need to try doing anything about nodes in your 3D editor (that I am aware of). Just take the model you make in 3DS Max and put it in Unity in a folder you create, within the Assets folder. Also put any textures you will use in that folder (or another asset folder, whatever you want to do). Open your model folder. Select your model. A menu will open on the right. Click on the Generate Collision Meshes and Generate Lightmap UV check boxes. Then press the Apply button. In a few seconds your model will be ready (replaced by the import). Drag your model to the Part Tools Object (you should have made this when setting up the Part Tools in Unity); this will be in the Hierarchy. Click on the arrows in this object to reveal all the meshes in your model. Select which mesh you want to use as a Collider and set it to Convex. Any other meshes may not need to be set as Colliders. For your render meshes, set them to the KSP shaders you want and select their textures and specular settings, if any. Then select the Part Tools Object which now has your model in it. On the right the menu has changed and is the export menu. Press Write to export. Copy your exported files (.mu and .mbm textures) and put them in your own folder in the KSP GameData folder. While in the GameData folder, open the Squad folder, then Parts, then the folder which has the kind of part you made (engine, for example). Open, for example, an engine folder. Copy its .cfg file. Close the KSP folder and open the .cfg copy with a text editor. Study it and use that file as the basis of your own .cfg file. Once you have changed the copy the way you want it to be, save it and put that .cfg file into the same folder where you put your .mu and .mbm files. Close the folders and play KSP. Your model should appear in the VAB or SPH assembly areas if there were no problems. As for the node vectors, these will be in that .cfg file too.
