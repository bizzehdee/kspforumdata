I am new to modding, and this is my first mod, just for fun. I am taking stock parts (starting with the MK2) series, retexturting them, and adding an ablator and increased heat resistance.\n\nI had been copying the files from GameData/Squad to my own folder (NBI) and redoing the configs. During this I discovered that I can not rename the texture file or it will not show up in game. From what I understand it is because the texture is baked into the .mu file. \n\nThe problem now is, that I am trying to switch over to [Interstellar Fuel Switch](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117932-1-0-2-Interstellar-Fuel-Switch-0-8-%28released-5-5-2015%29) so that instead of all these extra models, etc, I can just have config files and textures. I was looking at how Near Future Construction does it and tried copying that, but it still will not work.\n\nHere\u0027s the code I am using.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E MODULE  \n\u003E  {  \n\u003E  name = InterstellarMeshSwitch  \n\u003E  moduleID = 0  \n\u003E  objectDisplayNames = Structural; Service Module; Liquid Fuel; LFO Tank  \n\u003E  objects = Tank; Tank,SupportTank; Tank,LiquidFuelTank; Tank,LFOTank  \n\u003E  affectColliders = false  \n\u003E  hasGUI = false  \n\u003E  useFuelSwitchModule = true  \n\u003E  fuelTankSetups = 0; 1; 2; 3  \n\u003E  }  \n\u003E   \n\u003E //I can\u0027t find the documentation for this module.

But I can\u0027t figure out what and where to name and put the additional textures."},{"CreatedByName":"EvitableInventions","CreatedById":109158,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-16T19:55:24Z","Content":"I\u0027m a noob at this, so, anything more would be awesome."},{"CreatedByName":"martinezfg11","CreatedById":59995,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-16T20:03:06Z","Content":"Try looking into the FireSpitter mod.
