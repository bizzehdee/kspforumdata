My usual workflow goes like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESketchup(meshes) \u003Cstrong\u003E=\u0026gt; .dae =\u0026gt;\u003C/strong\u003E Blender(unwrapping \u0026amp; animation) =\u0026gt; Photoshop/Fireworks(texture sheets) =\u0026gt; Unity =\u0026gt; KSP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem comes in at the bolded section. The model, which I made a component before export, is being imported to blender as multiple mesh objects, which is not supposed to happen considering the current part I tested this with is a Mk2 plane monopropellant tank. I know multiple modders who can make this work. Bac9 was one but he has gone AWOL. Lack is another. Basically, what am I doing wrong and why is it not cooperating?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
