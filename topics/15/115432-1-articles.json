If you change the hardness of an edge in the middle of those squares, it\u0027ll split them apart at that edge."},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T17:27:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well, without seeing the unwrap I could only guess.

You have the hardness set to hard for every single edge. Wings will split the UV by hardness lines. When your model is loaded into Unity and then KSP, any edge set to hard won\u0027t have that edge smoothed out. It\u0027ll look very blocky. Smoothing tells Unity to \u0027round\u0027 the edge. Wings is trying to preserve that hardness in the UV by making all those faces separate entities. Which is why your UV is scattered all over the place. Soft edges in Wings are black. Hard edges are orange.\n\nAn example of what you want on your nozzle. All of the vertical edges around the nozzle, you\u0027ll want soft, so it smooths it out and makes it look more round. At the very bottom of your nozzle, you\u0027ll want those horizontal edges to be set to hard so that it looks crisp and sharp. Also, at the very top, you\u0027ll want the edge where it joins to another part to be hard. Hardness and softness also affect how lights and shadows are cast on your finished part.\n\nI had to learn this the hard way too. [Here\u0027s an example of what my hulls looked like with outside edges set to smooth](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124663-Uneven-part-lighting-issues-another-noob-question?p=2002477\u0026viewfull=1#post2002477). Beal came to my rescue on this one.\n\nTry this:\n\nClose your UV window.\n\nHit space to deselect everything.\n\nAt the top, select the red cube and click on your model to select the entire model.\n\nAt the top, select edges, it\u0027s the cube with just one edge in red. That should highlight all of your edges.\n\nRight click. Select Hardness/Soft. That sets all of your edges to soft edges.\n\nNow you have two choices. With the edge selector still chosen, you can hit space to deselect everything then manually go through your model and select all of the edges you want hard and once you have them selected, you can right click, select Hardness/Hard.\n\nThe other choice is to let Wings try to determine where harness should be. Choose the red cube at the top to select your entire model again then right click and select Auto-Smooth. The way it works is, any edge that has an angle of greater than a specified degree, it\u0027ll make it smooth. Any edge with a sharper angle, it\u0027ll set it to hard. The default is 60 degrees. So, an edge that has an angle of say 45 degrees will be made smooth while any edge of 90 degrees will be made hard.\n\nIf you right click with your entire model selected to bring up the menu, to the right word Auto-Smooth is a little white box. Click in it and you can change that default 60 degrees to whatever you want.\n\nOnce you have your edges set, click the red cube and select your entire model again. Right click to open the menu and this time, right click on UV mapping to re-map your model. Once you\u0027re done, it should look a lot different.\n\nFor future reference, smooth should be your baseline.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-11T23:10:40Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2015 11:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T04:53:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Ok, my guess was correct.\n\u003E [Helpfulness]\n\nThanks a lot!

I\u0027m not going to critique your work. Mainly because no one was terribly harsh with my first part pack release, even though I can look back a month and a half later and think, \u0022man that was horrible.\u0022 But I will give you some advice that I\u0027m slowly learning:\n\nThe one advantage I have with my parts, as ugly as the first alpha parts were, they\u0027re rather unique. People are willing to tolerate a certain amount of my noobishness in order to have something unique. And thus far, they\u0027ve been very patient with my learning. But, I\u0027m sure you saw the poll results. People want nice looking parts as much as they want big parts. As I keep playing around with Wings and Unity, I keep learning things. I have concluded that Rembrandt was not a master with his first painting. He may have been better than most, but not a master. As you continue making parts and learning how to unwrap and texture them, you too will gain skill. While I\u0027m still very much a noob, I have gained enough skill that I can do things like [this](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125063-1-0-4-Maritime-Pack-Beta-0-0-14-Lights-Sound-IVA?p=2082628\u0026viewfull=1#post2082628) now without a lot of effort. And even now I look at that part and go... eh.. it\u0027s ok. Not great, but ok.\n\nSo, here\u0027s my advice. Take that engine, set it aside. Take some of the other ideas you have rattling around in your head and implement those. Try an animation. Try adding particle effects and emissive effects. Play around with specular lighting. Learn how to do lights. Get some of the basics of making your part more than just a static model. If you\u0027re brave, try an IVA. If you\u0027ve lost your mind, try a wheel... and then, come back to that engine. Take a critical look at it and then you decide if it\u0027s your best quality work.\n\nOh, and here\u0027s one trick for working with Wings and Unity and getting your .cfg nodes right.\n\nIn Wings, you can do two things that will make life easier.\n\n1. Select your entire model and I think it\u0027s under the tools menu / put on ground. It\u0027ll drop it to the x,y,z zero point.\n\n2. Select your entire model, right click and absolute commands/move Enter 0,0,0. That too will center your model.\n\nOnce you have it in a centered location you can then click any verticies anywhere on the model and it translates into the .cfg location. For example: If you center your model and then click on a vertices at the top, where it would join a fuel tank, you can look in the upper left corner of Wings and it\u0027ll give you the x,y,z coordinates for that vertices. For example, if it\u0027s Y coordinate is 2.5 then you know in your .cfg that the node connector needs be 2.5 on the Y axis in your .cfg (if you have the part oriented in Wings correctly). This is also handy for matching parts up. One of the things I did to get all the parts on my hulls to match up was to use the Wings merge ability. I was able to get the hull and bow loaded at the same time and was then able to absolute/move the vertices to match them all up, down to 6 decimal places.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-15T22:26:32Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2015 10:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T22:29:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [Good advice]\n\nThanks for the advice, I understand that that\u0027s not a... beautiful model or texture.\n\nGood idea, I have some ideas for a shorter, 2.5 meter, less efficient, but more efficient ASL nuke for lifters, and I\u0027ll try more advanced modeling and texturing stuff.

I the mean time, [this mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128486-Simple-Nuclear-Reactor?p=2074893#post2074893)is using squad textures and models, so I\u0027ll keep an eye on that and see if it\u0027s okay to redistribute squad stuff. If it is, I\u0027ll release that cfg tweak for the stock nuke. Then I could do the ion engine... But I\u0027m getting ahead of myself.\n\u003E \n\u003E That paddle wheel looks great!\n\nYou can never have too many ideas!\n\nAnd thanks. One of the things I try to challenge myself to do to make me learn is to make all of my parts out of one primitive object. I don\u0027t always succeed but most times I do. The paddlewheel started life as just a cylinder. By extruding and bridging I was able to keep it one part. Makes me think outside the box when it comes to making models."}]}
