It\u0027s a hassle to attach them in game, as if you don\u0027t orient the camera just right in the VAB, the bottom node tries to attach instead of the top one and your part winds up completely inside the part you\u0027re trying to attach to, which depending on collider design, can make it hard to grab it and try again without throwing the whole part above yours in the trash and reattaching both...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could, of course, offset one or both nodes from the centerline of the rocket, but this would limit the player\u0027s ability to rotate the parts if they had a reason to... and might make any rocket wobble asymmetrical, which isn\u0027t good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that with plugins I could disable the bottom node until the top one is attached, or require a right click to show the bottom node, or some other clever solution like that... but... the parts pack I\u0027m working on doesn\u0027t currently have any plugin dependencies and I\u0027d love to keep it that way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not totally useless without doing anything, but if there\u0027s an easy fix I\u0027m just ignoring, I thought it was at least worth asking!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-01T04:51:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think you can do anything to the nodes themselves.

It looks like the node spheres are a pretty good indication of the radius they need to come into, in order to snap into place. If the spheres overlap, then placement becomes more difficult. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as a general rule, I try not to get ultra-thin with my parts. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yes, that would be a great suggestion of but report. Since the node data in the CFGs contain orientation information, the VAB \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E prioritize the stickiness of the nodes accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
