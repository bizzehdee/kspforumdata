And it works beautifully. But, the light color isn\u0027t tweakable. Any idea what I did or didn\u0027t do?\n\n-edit-\n\nOk, nevermind, this was a DUH moment. I don\u0027t think it worked like this in earlier versions of unity but with the new 5.1, when you copy a game object it has a tendency to rename them like Spolight (2), Spotlight (3). At some point in making this light, I copied it and forgot to match the lightName in the .cfg to the object name. It worked just fine without it but wasn\u0027t tweakable.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T20:41:22Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 08:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"}]}
