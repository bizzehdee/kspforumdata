Of course, my next step is to UV Unwrap and texture, but when I try to unwrap it, I find that some of the faces get really distorted (pictured below). I was wondering if anyone knew how to get around that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s my current progress:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002261qetFG.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/61qetFG.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here\u0027s the UV issue I was talking about:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022GGkQ4mI.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022551\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GGkQ4mI.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"liquidhype","CreatedById":112415,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-18T10:54:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell there are a few different things you can do.
