Problem is, the Soyuz has a roughly bell-shaped descent module, so every automatic tool gives me funny curved shapes that I am waaay too unartistic to be able deal with. I am also way too unartistic to be able to manually caress them into a simple rectangular shape that would just wrap around my model as if it was a cylinder. So is there maybe some magic button somewhere that unwraps a roughly cylindrical object into a simple flat map?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Epsilon","CreatedById":392,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-24T12:25:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t know.

You can highlight specific faces and run a uv map command on them. For instance use a planar map with the bottom connector plate because its likely flat. You could then run a cylindrical or spherical map on the bell shaped faces. Just take the part plane by plane. It\\\u0027s rare running an automatic operation on all faces at once will produce a good result. I\\\u0027m spending some time learning advanced uv mapping in max. If I can manage to get a really good process down, ill write up a guide.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
