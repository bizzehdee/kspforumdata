I am building an enterable (cilindrical) module right now and I got it working by placing 12 box objects in circle to which I gave convex colliders in unity each, and it works perfectly. But remember that more complex the collider is, the slower it will run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: by \u0022enterable\u0022 I mean EVA-able, not IVA\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
