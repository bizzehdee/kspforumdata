Of course you need to UV Map and texture it like any part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you import it into KSP through Unity or just as a DAE file, KSP assumes that the thrust goes straight \u0022down\u0022 (down being -Y) from the origin/pivot of the collider, so if you want a simple, non-gimballing or vectored engine, you\u0027re pretty much done except for the config work - mostly setting up the attachment nodes and the visual FX (flame and smoke) - which you can work off of one of the stock engines to understand that\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, there are a lot of advanced things you can do engines, you can make them gimbal (meaning the bell/nozzle moves to allow \u0022steering\u0022 - you can make the bell animate if it should, but its not required for the actual vectoring of the thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also set a permanent, non-moving vector (IE: the thrust doesnt go straight down, but at a 45 degree angle) by using the \u0022ThrustVector =\u0022 parameter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can make a surface-attached engine instead of an engine that goes on the bottom of a stack, the only thing that really changes is the design of your mesh and the node config in the part.cfg file; KSP still assumes the thrust goes \u0022down\u0022 from the origin\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deltafee","CreatedById":32333,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-18T21:03:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks again ill work when i get home, but how do you make it gimbal?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deltafee","CreatedById":32333,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-19T03:37:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAm i doing this right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://db.tt/wu1GwZjN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://db.tt/wu1GwZjN\u003C/a\u003E i know that the dialog box nod_collider is spelled wrong, ive fixed it afterwards.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-19T04:04:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell, keep in mind the collider is basically the invisible \u0022box\u0022 that ineracts with the collider of the next part it connects to In the case of an engine, usually a fuel tank\u0027s collider) So you want the collider to be in the place where your part connects, and big enough to \u0027cover\u0027 the part of the mesh you want to be solid. If your engine is ust the triangle-shaped nozzle, then you want the collider to be a box just big enough for that shape to fit in, that fits flush against the bigger part in front of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you want that engine to gimbal, you\u0027d name that mesh piece obj_gimbal.
