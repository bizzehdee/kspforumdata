preface this by saying that up until very recently, all of my 3D modelling experience has been in Sketchup for the purpose of 3D printing.\u00A0 When you\u0027re modelling for printing, you ideally want to remove ALL internal lines/faces, otherwise it can cause undesirable effects when slicing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s also fairly easy to do in Sketchup.\u00A0 I\u0027m finding

With that in mind on all my models I don\u0027t worry about clipping. I do remove extra faces - in the middle picture of your \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er).

A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E I would remove the inside cylinder end and slide the remaining face ends closer to the cube surface but wouldn\u0027t worry about getting too close. In fact I have found that if I try to get things flush - no clipping - I sometimes get sparkles in game when moving around. One situation I don\u0027t worry about flush edges is when I separate one mesh into two - cylinders are a good example - if you smooth them with the end caps it doesn\u0027t look very good so after I have my cylinder where I want it I separate the end caps to a different mesh and the smoothing works much better -\u00A0 but the edges are dups so exactly the same (or close enough not to matter - not clear on the inner workings of Blender) and I don\u0027t see the sparkels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-16T20:38:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/179753-geonovast/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022179753\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/179753-geonovast/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Geonovast\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThere is no issue in Blender/Unity from self-clipping geometry as far as physics are concerned.\u00A0 Clip away.\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0 Same thing with using multiple colliders for a single part -- they can intersect and clip as much as you need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ENow, hidden faces are often still rendered to some degree, at the very least a culling/depth test on the fragment, so they do add some minor overhead to rendering (fill-rate based), and should be avoided and minimized wherever possible.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAlso note that it is often \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ebad\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E to use the Blender Boolean tool (it \u003Cem\u003Edoes\u003C/em\u003E have uses, but simple intersections are not it).\u00A0 The meshes created from cutting/joining are so far from optimal, they make me cry (so many useless and skinny triangles created).\u00A0 Much simpler to intersect the geometry and deal with a bit of extra overdraw than to render dozens of un-needed triangles.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-16T20:48:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223636088\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022186059\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221563309507\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022138730\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shadowmage\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso note that it is often \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ebad\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E to use the Blender Boolean tool (it \u003Cem\u003Edoes\u003C/em\u003E have uses, but simple intersections are not it).\u00A0 The meshes created from cutting/joining are so far from optimal, they make me cry (so many useless and skinny triangles created).\u00A0 Much simpler to intersect the geometry and deal with a bit of extra overdraw than to render dozens of un-needed triangles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had seen quite a few mentions of using the Boolean tool not being the best.\u00A0 As much as I hate clipping, even in this, some of the situations like I have up above is just too much work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve actually been playing lately instead of dealing with this, but I\u0027ll be in DC all next week without my main install, so I\u0027ll probably do some blendering in the hotel while I\u0027m away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bottle Rocketeer 500","CreatedById":178766,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-02T11:03:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/179753-geonovast/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022179753\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/179753-geonovast/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Geonovast\u003C/a\u003E I just found this and I thought it might be useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/28574/simple-way-to-creating-vertices-at-intersecting-planes-and-deleting-leftover-int\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/28574/simple-way-to-creating-vertices-at-intersecting-planes-and-deleting-leftover-int\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dundrogen","CreatedById":179693,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-10T12:55:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could shift the vertices of the cylinder edge with snap on from an orthogonal angle to make sure the end of the cylinder stops flush with the surface of that cube.
