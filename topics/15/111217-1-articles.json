I can set the \u002BX and -X axis gimbal in the editor just fine, but when I put it on the runway it\u0027s backwards:\n\nEdit: It also twitches a lot when SAS is on and over-corrects wayyy too much, causing the craft to flip out of control.\n\n![dSKcsYSh.png](http://i.imgur.com/dSKcsYSh.png)\n\nHow does each part need to be oriented in respect to each other and the global/local axis?\n\nHere\u0027s the setup in Unity. I can provide more pictures if necessary.

I tried replacing the km\\_Gimbal module with a stock ModuleGimbal but then nothing gimbals at all.
