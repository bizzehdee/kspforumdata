I need to create some tanks and was wondering if it would be okay to take some of the stock tanks and change their texture. This would be for an add-on to the Kethane mod using its API - I\u0027ve been provided with the required tanks with a different colour and was wondering if thats okay to release to the wider community as long as I keep the author information and add mine?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T18:56:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFriendly advice from a non-expert forum member.

I\u0027m looking at creating just some plain white tanks of the same size as stock ones - as they are just basic cylinders, nothing fancy I\u0027d thought it would just be easier to retexture the ones that already exist. I saw the EULA but just assumed that was basically for taking the game code and making a separate game from it (stealing in other words) but I wasn\u0027t sure on using parts of the game for a mod/add-on for the game itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
