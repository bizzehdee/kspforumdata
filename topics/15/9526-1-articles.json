Just a straight import/export doesn\\\u0027t work. It is behaving like a model that has no material assigned to it, ie: it appears in the list of parts that one can use in the VAB, but when selecting it it does not appear in the main view to be placed. I ran into that with basic parts not properly materialed. I suspect it has something to do with the colliders and anchors coming in as \u0027empty\u0027 objects, of which the four submodels are children.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETroubleshooting thus far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaterials assignments to the meshes themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaterials assignments to the meshes and the colliders/anchors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe-UV-mapping the meshes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeleting the parent empty objects (nodeCollider, nodeLegCollider, objAnchor, objLeg).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecreating the parent empty objects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecreating the parent objects as meshes themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you guys run into this?
