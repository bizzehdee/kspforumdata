Most 3d programs will automatically add a default material to your part. If for some reason the material isn\\\u0027t assigned, your part will not work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe node_collider is how your part interacts with the physics engine. This is simply a part that has had it\\\u0027s name changed to exactly node_collider. Though you may be tempted to just duplicate your part and name it node_collider, this is typically a bad idea! The more complex your collider is, the slower your part will run, especially on weaker computers. In addition, most aesthetically pleasing models are in some way concave. I use simple geometry for my node_colliders such as squares, or other primitives. Your collider must also be convex, if it is concave on any axis it may cause \u0027undefined behavior\u0027 from the physics engine. Signs of this will include, improper attachments, g-spikes, part explosions, missed collisions and general bad times. If you are unfamiliar with the concept of Convexity, please reference the link below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concave_polygon\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concave_polygon\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUpdated 1-2-2012\u003C/strong\u003E: Resetting part X-Form. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhenever you move or scale a part in 3ds-Max, a transform is applied to it. For instance, if you scale up a part to exactly fit another, the scale may be 110% instead of the original 100%. I\\\u0027ve noticed that these transformations often cause issues when importing a part to KSP. By resetting the X-form we can ensure that your part will be the exact same size in game as it is in 3ds-Max.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to Reset the X-form. (Generally not needed unless you are having problems)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the right hand of your screen, select the toolbox icon. (If you are using a different version of 3ds the icon may appear differently then below, but it is typically the one on the far right.) Under the Utilities header, select reset XForm. You\\\u0027ll now see a window below that says \u0027reset selected\u0027. Select your parts, and click \u0027reset selected\u0027. Once this is done, you should now see \u0027XForm\u0027 on the top of the stack in your modifier list. Right click on the XForm entry and a context menu will appear. Select \u0027Collapse All\u0027 This will collapse all transformations into the 3d model, and should prevent any scaling or distortion of your part in KSP!
