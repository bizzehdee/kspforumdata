The part is question is cylindrical and in 3 sizes. Before I used separate models, textures, and configs. In those configs I ended up using plain scale and left rescaleFactor alone. This still works, but I was trying to consolidate everything down into a single folder/file. For ease of use I figured I would try using rescaleFactor to move the nodes around, and that\u0027s where I ran into troubles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I first select a part from the menu it appears in its \u0022raw\u0022 size. IE a standard cylinder modeled at 80cm, which would normally be 1m in game, appears 80cm in game. However, if I leave the VAB and return the part shows at the proper size. The workaround is just to do it how I was before with scale... But I am kind of curious if there is a way to get around this problem and still use rescaleFactor?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T13:06:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never experienced this but I\u0027ve also never worked with a non-1:1:x part. You should try correcting the model in Unity or earlier so your actual model file is the size of your \u0027normal\u0027 sized part and then you get simple rescaleFactors to the other sizes you want without having to involve scale, which generally speaking should always equal 1 (and always be declared) unless you modeled something in the wrong scale and can\u0027t be asked to fix it or don\u0027t have the raw assets anymore (ie, certain old stock parts)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you\u0027re using MODEL{} and a necessary because of that MODEL{ scale }, it has a whole different set of glitches which don\u0027t sound like what you\u0027re experiencing, but suffice to say the value of MODEL{scale} and rescaleFactor must multiply to equal 1 or refactorScale has to be the square of what you want, but don\u0027t quote me on the later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheebsta","CreatedById":74167,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T13:45:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe original part is modeled at 80cm, which ends up 1m if I don\u0027t use rescale at all (Default seems to be 1.25?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll 3 sizes are set to scale = 1.0, 1.0, 1.0; is that what I want, or are you saying I have to play around with a combination of the two?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am also just going to make the original bigger. Main thing I am trying to do is just use the one model and set of textures rather than 3 like I had been before. It sounds kind of like I\u0027d be better off just doing what I had done before and altering scale then calculating the new nodes myself. Not a big deal, but cuts down on how lazy I can be if I decide I want a bigger or smaller part later, lol.
