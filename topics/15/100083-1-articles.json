What the heck do you do if the axis of your model is not up\u0027down, left\u0027right but at odd angles?\n\nBlender lets me create a box in just the right location but, the axis\u0027s are all over the place and Blender is braindead when it comes to a simple function as AXIS ROTATION!!!! Something older programs for the Amiga had in 1985.\n\nUnity lets me move the axis but this moves the entire box. I can create a transform in Unity that allows me to move it around but not the actual \u0027airlock\u0027 mesh itself. That moves as the axis does. And I have not seen a tutorial that says to use a transform for an airlock. The box, turned into a collider and set as trigger is, as far as my research is, is the way to do it. Undoable from what I can find out.\n\nWhat am I missing? What tutorial have I not seen/read at least 10 times each? What thread, in the deep dark recesses of this forum, have I missed?\n\nI still am not 100% sure that Z has to face out and Y \u0027up\u0027 but 99.8% is close enough.\n\nI\u0027ve had Unity and KSP blowup on me as I\u0027ve fiddled around and I don\u0027t want to have to reinstall Unity again.\n\nAny help, even if it\u0027s a \u0022DUCK!\u0022 when someone else starts throwing things at me, would be much appreciated."},{"CreatedByName":"bac9","CreatedById":57757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T06:23:58Z","Content":"Uh, create a box primitive in Unity, remove it\u0027s mesh renderer component, scale it to dimensions you need, rotate it into orientation you need and move it to position you need?

It would not rotated, just move around on the axis\u0027s.\n\nLet me try again. Doubt I missed something, done it about 20 times but I\u0027ll try once more. Maybe my frustration is blinding me.
