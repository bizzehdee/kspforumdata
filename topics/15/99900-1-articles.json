Now that I\u0027m starting to get into the thick of this NX course we\u0027re doing things like surface modeling. And I kind of see how most of these tools really aren\u0027t needed for game models. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve installed Blender and am taking a look at it. Most of the things I imagine making would probably follow pretty basic meshes, at least for now. So it shouldn\u0027t be too big an issue to learn Blender. Maybe I\u0027ll return to NX in the future, but probably not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
