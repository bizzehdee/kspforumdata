I\u0027ve tried mechanical alignment and it just does not work.

Now, you might be able to assist this by using animations to gimp the docking port, give it a toggle which moves the docking node transform into a position where it cannot resolve, allowing the player to flip it back when the ship is fairly well aligned, moving the transform towards a resolvable state. Better choice is using some kind of post-docking correction factor, for HexCans I\u0027m considering making a mod that immediately on docking, hopefully same frame as it, simply overwrites the hexcan\u0027s position and orientation to be a perfect match; yes this will cause a weird looking jump but the largest hexcan is 3 meters long and most of a meter wide, I don\u0027t think for such small things it would be too immersion breaking. For docking ships that\u0027s not really a choice but you could use a method like Magic Smoke\u0027s docking washers to slowly rotate the ship back into alignment and set up the docking ports to get it close enough so it doesn\u0027t have to correct much.
