It took me long enough to learn SketchUp and that\u0027s why I use for my 3d architectural work. If there was a program that did nothing but UV mapping, I might consider using it, but for now I have no need or desire to learn a new 3d package. They tend to be quite complex and my learning style would take months to learn a new one.

It currently has a weird UV at the ends and the side are squished. As you can see in the picture, there are bands at the top and bottom that are generated by stretching the end texture which is making it hard to match up properly. It\u0027s also distorting the flag a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rVKAw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rVKAw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help guys!
