It\u0027s a wheel arch/mud guard for the medium wheel (TR-2L). It has a thin mount that copies the shape of the wheel mount and then has a few horizontal arms that holds a half-cylinder above the wheel that acts as the guard, as can be seen here with it attached to the first part I made, a simple custom chassis for rovers:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WLAwxDL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WLAwxDL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the pic shows the symmetry isn\u0027t working right - the mirror part is rotated 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 on the y axis (upside down). I\u0027m thinking this may have something to do with the origin being centred on the flat surface of the mount, rather than near the centre of mass of the whole model, although that\u0027s the point I want it to pivot around and it seems like the stock wheel does the same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, in panning the camera around the model at different angles some panels disappear and then reappear as others disappear. It\u0027s most noticeable with the arms that join the guard to the mounting plate - first an edge to the arms will look like it\u0027s missing then as I zoom in and alter the pov for a better look it\u0027ll reappear and one of the other faces will disappear. I haven\u0027t had this problem with my first pat, but it\u0027s collider is just a simple box collider, so I\u0027m wondering if this problem is associated with the collider. I\u0027ve made the collider concave because it looks a lot better than the convex option, although I\u0027ve read in a few places that convex are preferable (in which case I\u0027s have to wonder if a convex collider would interfere with the wheel that will be placed inside it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help much appreciated, thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aeTIos","CreatedById":17032,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-15T12:33:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe try uninstalling editorextensions?

If the stock parts work with it, the problem is obviously my part and not the extensions. I\u0027ve also seen this problem before in one of the Infernal Robotics hinges, which has been really annoying when trying to use it. If I could fix this then I might be able to suggest a fix to MSI dude. If I don\u0027t get any more suggestions I\u0027ll try centering the origin and see if that helps and also try some different file formats (I was exporting to Unity as .fbx, but having some issues with this part so tried .obj instead).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HanzBlix","CreatedById":100704,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-16T08:40:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37474-CFG-variable-to-make-a-part-reflect-over-an-axis-when-using-symmetry-mode-in-SPH\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37474-CFG-variable-to-make-a-part-reflect-over-an-axis-when-using-symmetry-mode-in-SPH\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShort story shorter, EndlessWaves namedropped mirrorAxis, mirrorRefAxis and mirrorVector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E// --- standard part parameters ---\u003Cbr\u003EmirrorRefAxis = 0, 0, 1\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding this line fixed a similar issue with my radial engine which was flipping the mirrored part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the values work similarly to the last half of a node_stack\u0027s .cfg values, but I\u0027m guessing since I\u0027m about as new to this as you are.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
