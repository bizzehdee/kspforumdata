I have a question on the best way to unwrap a model while considering tris/quads and vertices. Sorry if this has been asked before, I checked the forum and some tutorials but couldn\u0027t find a \u0022best practice\u0022 answer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst a quick background: I\u0027m trying to make a new command pod, shown in the first picture below. Originally, my plan was to outline my texture\u0027s pattern on the model itself by splitting faces and such, then I would use seams to separate each area so I could texture them separately. You can see my seams in red in the first picture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my main question is about the bottom section of my pod, with all the little squares. These are all meant to be individual heat tiles, which would share up to four separate textures (just different shades of black). Each would be unwrapped separately, as in the second picture, then overlayed on each other, then all the islands would be scaled up as one so that I can use larger and higher quality textures. BUT doing it this way increases the number of polygons by quite a bit. A lot of these faces are on the same plane and can be merged together, but then I would have a lot of long parts that don\u0027t fit onto a UV map as nicely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs separating parts like this the best way to apply textures? Should I merge planes together and just use lower quality textures?

That\u0027s just my opinion though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for Tri\u0027s and quads, I usually aim for no more that 1500 tri\u0027s on a finished model, even though I don\u0027t think it would much of an issue if you went higher.

I have several models with tri counts \u0026gt;10k, with negligible (unnoticeable) performance impact in my games/on my comp (even when used in larger craft with lots of other parts). Granted, these parts take the place of 4-8 stock parts, so there is a decent tradeoff there anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Physics updates (specifically rigidbody calculations) are the single largest limiting factor for most computers running KSP (CPU limited). I would wager even mediocre video cards should be able to handle 100-200k tris without issue (100k or so is actually Unity\u0027s maximum guideline for MOBILE, with 1-2 million tris for desktop). Keep in mind that the rest of the universe would also use some of those tris (rendering planets when they are rendered as 3d, most notably when you are low enough to see terrain). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would go with whatever makes the best use of UV space / allows you to use the smallest texture while still achieving good looking models / whatever is faster for your development time. Also, keep in mind the limitations that using AO bakes has on your UV unwrapping/mapping methods -- you need mostly unique UV mapping to get the most out of AO bakes. They are of course, optional, and you can certainly omit using them. A good compromise to allow UV re-use while still using AO bakes is to use mirroring of any symmetrical areas to reduce the amount of identical quads that need to be individually mapped; most models can be easily split into 2-way, 4-way, or 8-way symmetry on just the horizontal axis; as long as they are truly symmetrical, the AO bakes will work out fine. It looks like the bottom area on your pod is a prime candidate for the mirror-reduction method; it is symmetrical and the angling between the lower portion and top means that the AO bake for the lower sections would not be effected by the asymmetry of the upper portion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETexture size is a major concern for modded installs; I am (and probably many others) running into the 32-bit ram limitations, limiting adding more mods to my games. So making the most out of your UV maps is one of the best ways to reduce distribution size and problems with modded installs. Keep the textures as small as possible (while maintaining detail!) and use as much of the available texture as you can. I generally aim for 128px/meter uv scale, and squashing everything as close together as I can in the texture (usually leave about 8 pixels between islands, for MIP-map/texture reduction purposes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOthers have already mentioned the problem with N-gons, so I won\u0027t go over that... other than to say that they are a PITA to UV map properly, and do -not- grant any performance increase (they are all converted to tris in the end for rendering, at least in the current engine version). They do work properly in-game (as they are auto-converted to tris during export from blender/import into unity); however the UV mapping on them can be....akward and unpredictable, generally resulting in very skewed/stretched unwraps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn extra few hundred or thousand tris on a (semi complicated, such as a pod) part is likely a good tradeoff for efficient use of UV space and development time. Sharing textures wherever possible is generally a good idea and will result in better overall texture quality and use of texture memory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-03T01:56:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome great answers already.

Looks like there\u0027s some different opinions about how many tris to be aim for... so I\u0027ll try the best of both worlds. I did a pass over the model and red-seamed the hell out of repeating textures (might even be able to do a bit better, or I may have gone overboard). I saved about 800-1000 tris down to ~2,700 while being able to use similar textures for all those heat tiles.
