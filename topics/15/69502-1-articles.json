So, I did a little research, and found that most other types of models actually include baking the texture to the model, and using that \u0022render\u0022 to determine the shadows and everything else using the geometry/lighting positions etc...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just wanted to hear a few suggestions from everybody as to how they\u0027ve accomplished realistic effects and such!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy goal is to provide the community with the best models I can, and any help would be greatly appreciated!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blackheart612","CreatedById":42741,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T06:06:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, baking is a good way. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"700NitroXpress","CreatedById":90322,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T12:44:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want an alternative to hand painting everything, you could check out dDo and NDo by Quixel. Using these programs you can have the program do the texturing work for you and generate the AO, diffuse, spec, color, and normal maps. Then all you have to do is plug them into the proper channels of the material in Unity. It helps make fantastic looking textures really quickly. The programs are basically plugins that run using Photoshop.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"frizzank","CreatedById":57210,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T13:45:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EX normal does an excellent job of baking ambient occlusion and is not dependent on any particular modeling program and supports many different modeling formats Obj, LWO, 3DS....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso it is FREEE!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.xnormal.net/1.aspx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.xnormal.net/1.aspx\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
