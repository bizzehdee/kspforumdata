In the end it was far easier to learn how to model with max, tried blender didnt like much, than waste hours trying to convert something i\u0027d already spent hours modelling, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts taken a year or so to properly get to grips with the max way of modelling to a semi proficient std but its soooooooooooo much easier than all that frustration of endless failed exports\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starn","CreatedById":25059,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-10T12:30:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eso SpannerMonkey you\u0027re basically suggesting on saving up for max?
