Create a material and set the shader to KSP/Bumped - notice the \u0022_MainTex (RGB spec(A)) beside the top texture slot - this is looking for a RGB with spec in alpha and a second texture (_BumpMap). Now switch the shader to KSP/Diffuse and you\u0027ll see it\u0027s looking for only one texture in a RGB format denoted by \u0022_MainTex (RGB)\u0022. Benjee has a real nice metallic on a docking port in Benjee10_SharedAssets - I\u0027ll add a link here if I can find it again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
