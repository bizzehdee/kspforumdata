If you just want to create an emblem, you can use a painting software, and make it as a flag in KSP (they are just 256x160 png files), no need for modding. If you look to create an add-on to let you have something different than a flag shown with your vessels, than this thread should better go [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/30-Plugin-Development-Help-and-Support) (but I need you to confirm if that\u0027s the case)."},{"CreatedByName":"stickman939","CreatedById":131481,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T11:32:36Z","Content":"What I\u0027m looking for is a part creating tutorial, essentially."},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T11:41:07Z","Content":"Good, then you are interested in [this section](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/14-Modelling-and-Texturing-Discussion).
