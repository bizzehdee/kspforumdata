First, in your texture file, make sure that you \u0022paint outside the lines\u0022 a little bit. If you just run your texture up to the edge of the UV map, it can leave a little black line on your part. Also, how the edges in your model are set up can cause some weirdness. Play around with either explicitly setting edges to be \u0022hard edges\u0022 if they are places where there should be a crease, or play with smoothing, so that places that should be a flat or rounded surface at the intersection of two polygons meld smoothly together. Third, make sure that when you import the part into Unity, you\u0027re using one of the shaders under the KSP subcategory (KSP/Diffuse, KSP/Specular, etc). The standard Unity shaders don\u0027t work well in-game\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck.
