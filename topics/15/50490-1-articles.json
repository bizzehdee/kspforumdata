So I am not sure what I\u0027m doing wrong. I am very new to modding and 3d modeling, so I tried some tests. I\u0027m trying to make a simple airlock for a manned laboratory. However, I couldn\u0027t get Kerbals to exit the lab once they entered (the dreaded \u0022hatch is obstructed\u0022 error). So I tried something simpler, and I got a weird bug: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y5g4LMgSAoE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInfinite Bills coming out of the airlock. The Kerbals stay unresponsive, and their lights are always on. I\u0027m not using any other mods at this point either. I\u0027m not sure what I\u0027m doing wrong.
