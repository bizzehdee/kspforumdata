I created a very basic engine, and two actuators, which should move when the engine gimbals. I\u0027ve setted it all up, but the actuators don\u0027t move to look at each other. I would be glad if someone could have a look at it guys! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload .zip file, including blend file, .mu and .cfg: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/2t2ng1bnm7800c4/SE1.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/2t2ng1bnm7800c4/SE1.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T20:29:20Z","Content":"\nMaybe just show a screen of your hierarchy.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kartoffelkuchen","CreatedById":108501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T20:44:44Z","Content":"\nOK, I\u0026#39;ll do tomorrow.

Each transform (or object) that will have a look-constraint applied needs to have its Z\u002B axis be the \u0026#39;pointing\u0026#39; axis; e.g. z\u002B will always point towards the target. Targets need no specific orientation as far as I\u0026#39;m aware (unless you are -also- using them to aim back at the base actuator parts, as per a piston setup; in that case they too will need the z\u002B axis alignment).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne last note, with the stock module. It might need to be \u0026#39;activated\u0026#39; (e.g. activated in staging, or have a module that calls forceActivate()) in order for the constraints to work. So, for an engine, make sure it is actively staged. Many stock modules have this...erm.. behavior.. for whatever reason. I don\u0026#39;t have the source in front of me though, so could not say if the look-constraint module was one of them or not.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd one last silly question; you are using the FXModuleLookAtConstrant as the module, correct? (There are about 3 half-finished look-at constraint modules in the stock code; that is the only one that I know functions properly).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDisclaimer: I have not used the stock constraint module, as it did not meet my needs and I had to implement a custom look-constraint module (multiple same-named transforms in the same model, each being aimed at targets which were duplicated in the model as well; all done pair-wise); however, my module uses the exact same functional code as the stock module (transform.LookAt()).\n"}]}
