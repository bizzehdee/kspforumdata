Now when you select PartTools in Heirarchy, the Tank mesh should become textured wireframe and turn blue. in the pic, you can see the Tank mesh doesn\u0027t have blue wireframe highlight, that means it\u0027s not going to get exported.\n\nyou did everything correctly, except attach the tank object to the export process. PartTools script exports all of it\u0027s children into a \\*.MU file. since you didn\u0027t assign it any children before export, it returned an empty \\*.MU file and so you see no object in game. All things considered, this is far less frustrating than a part not loading at all. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Xyphos","CreatedById":139010,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T05:43:16Z","Content":"Like this?\n\n![rXh82l8.png](http://i.imgur.com/rXh82l8.png)\n\nand it worked!\n\n![h5xOVRt.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/h5xOVRt.jpg)\n\nthanks a bunch mate, but now I see that it\u0027s too big. the center node can dwarfs a kerbodyne tank, it\u0027s supposed to fit a rockomax. trying to scale it doesn\u0027t seem to work.\n\nalso, got any tips on node placement? this is the final step I believe and it\u0027s a bit perplexing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-28T05:59:36Z\u0022 title=\u002203/28/2015 05:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xyphos**"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T13:28:25Z","Content":"Scale = 0.1 ? did you really mean that? also check the actual size in Unity, make sure you imported it at the correct scale."},{"CreatedByName":"Xyphos","CreatedById":139010,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T21:40:37Z","Content":"imported scale? say what now?
