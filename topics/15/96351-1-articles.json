Particularly with .fbx format, Unity for some reason imports them at tiny scales. You fix that by selecting the model in the \u0027asset\u0027 window (not the hierarchy view ) and looking at it\u0027s \u0027general\u0027 properties tab in the Inspector panel. If it says .01, there\u0027s your problem. Change that to 1 and click apply and you\u0027re good to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that WASN\u0027T the problem... let us know and we\u0027ll start on the less common stuff. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see your texture imported yet? Unity SHOULD just show it as grey until you import a texture and assign it to the material, but I\u0027d do that next if it\u0027s not the scale problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Quiznos323","CreatedById":114900,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-11T12:05:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAha, that was it, thanks!
