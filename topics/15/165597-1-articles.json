For a couple of month everything was working fine, just as I was used to from Windows. A few days ago Unity seems to have broken down for no apparent reason. From one day to the other the Inspector looks like this (debug right; normal left):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tyx1r4F.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/tyx1r4F.png\u0022 width=\u0022601\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Materials settings have entrys I\u0027ve never seen before. Any attempts to fix this have been in vain. I\u0027ve found a similar problem on the unity forums and reported my problem over there too. I was told that it seems like a bug, unless I have some strange editor plugin that is taking over somehow. So, before writing a bug-report I want to make sure PartTools is not the problem. Has anyone here encountered a problem like this or may even have a solution?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe strange thing is, beside everything looking messed up, it actually still works. I went through all the Element X entrys and the fifth revealed the name \u0022_MainTex\u0022. So I\u0027ve set the texture here, exported the model and KSP loads and shows it in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost likely I have to reinstall Unity, but I couldn\u0027t find Unity 5.4.0p4 in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-on-linux-release-notes-and-known-issues.350256/#post-2556301\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elinux releases\u003C/a\u003E. So I\u0027d like to ask other Linux users: What unity version are you running?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
