You\u0027ll need a sort of pivot point, could be an object or empty transform. Then place the part of the engine you want to gimbal as a child of the pivot point and insert name of that pivot point into module gimbal. You don\u0027t need any animations or what not, gimbal is coded into KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
