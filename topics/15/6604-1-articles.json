So I revisited the UV mapping process in Blender to try to see what was going wrong. There\\\u0027s a frustrating problem that I don\\\u0027t know how to fix... When I used UV unwrapping on the model I\\\u0027m working on, I get a large web of unscaled triangles, rather than flattened surfaces. I\\\u0027ve defined four surfaces on my model, which is roughly cylindrical in shape, and only the flat top and bottom export to a flat plane, whereas the other two are exploded into individual triangles, making texturing pretty much impossible. I know that when others do the same thing, the editor automatically adjusts the surfaces to get a flat plane, so I\\\u0027m not sure what settings I need to change to make this work.
