You do not use any user created code in making part only mods so no need for C# (that\u0027s not to say it\u0027s not handy, saves a lot of hassle if if you pick it up and start working out what is what, as imo all the best things are driven by plugins) I make a lot of parts that use\u00A0 other mod makers code in order to function, such as Infernal robotics.\u00A0 and there are times when you need to find out something, such as what a particular transform needs to be called in order for the code to work and the only way to find that is to look in the code, Fair enough you may never need to , but I do frequently\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGimp is just another paint brush, and\u00A0 doesn\u0027t matter which one you use , pretty much everyone uses what they prefer as unity can deal with most things\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPart of the trouble with the varying opinions is that a lot, and awful lot of outdated info is out there, and it\u0027s a lot easier to find than the correct stuff.\u00A0 But trust me , there of plenty of kats in KSP that can only be skinned one way \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood look with your modding adventures\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-08T07:48:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2017 07:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by SpannerMonkey(smce)\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZuluDoggy","CreatedById":175217,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-08T14:57:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\u00A0 I kind of suspected that Visual Studio (for C#) is a \u0027nice to have, but not necessary if you are making parts\u0027 program.\u00A0 I d/l\u0027d it and will probably look at it - some other time!\u00A0 I will probably stick with Photoshop versus Gimp as well, since I know the former.\u00A0 Now to check to see which version of Unity I downloaded...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I tend to agree with your comment on outdated stuff out there.\u00A0 I\u0027ve watched a ton of videos only to realize halfway through that they are referencing KSP v0.90 or v0.23, or somewhere in between.\u00A0 Ah well, off to do some work, and thanks again!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nZD\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InsaneDruid","CreatedById":137849,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-09T14:22:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDefinitely stick with PS over Gimp, especially if you are fluent in PS. Unity can read .psd files directly so its really easy and perfectly integrated in the workflow with unity. I work on psd file the whole time and let unity convert it during exporting to .mbm (as it created mipmaps that way) and manually export to tga and convert the tga to dds externally when doing the final export. Gives me the most control over the quality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding Blender, as said even a very very old one would work, but so does the latest beta. Unity can read .blend files just fine, too, though I stick with exporting to fbx as this allows for having multiple versions of one .blend file and also having a metric crapton of parts in one blend file that can be exported individually but can be modelled together for a perfect fit. I never had trouble migrating to a never version of blender even during a project. Biggest difference was the layout of the fbx exporter changed slightly somewhat in the last two years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI learned emissive animation with the newer unity, so i cant say if it was easier in 4.22.
