Nor is the updated mesh structure showing up in KSP, but the .mu file-size is bigger than the old file. Are there any other glitchy things i should look out for?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"martinezfg11","CreatedById":59995,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-03T03:13:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve never had issues like that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPics?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceMouse","CreatedById":126931,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-03T05:24:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThink i figured it out, I think the texture issue again was unity, but the mesh problem was because i wasn\u0027t referencing it correctly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
