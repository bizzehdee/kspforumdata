I have been having lots of fun blowing Jebediah up in a number imaginative and interesting ways, but now, I am modelling up my 1st parts pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my question is this, anyone have any suggestions, recommendations, or links to anything to do with Poly count? I have modelled for games before, I know most of the good stuff, like pipes do not render visual better after 6 faces and can make poly efficient models. I am assuming, 500 - 1K for a mid size part max?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will mainly be concentrating on structural sections and other module repacks (into new, interesting forms that I want to use). I intend the releases to visually match stock parts, as well as game values being in the \u0022realistic\u0022 range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHit me with \u0022the knowledge\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELillegre \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-01T18:26:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2013 06:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Lillegre\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EInability to spell my own name consistently\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bluegobln","CreatedById":59640,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T19:42:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, from what I have seen, you can pull off parts with quite a bit larger poly counts than that (I\u0027ve made as high as 8000 I think). Poly count isn\u0027t a huge limiter in most GPU\u0027s nowadays I\u0027m pretty sure, it\u0027s the textures, the other graphic effects, those are what matter. If you have a large part with LOTS of little intricate details, one trick I\u0027ve quickly learned is a huge part of how a part performs (especially if animated) is whether shadows are enabled for smaller parts. For example: I recently made a large animated folding shield thing, the hinges are there but they caused HUGE lag when animated because they had shadows. I disabled both shadows and specular highlights on them and now they perform considerably better (they still accept other object\u0027s shadows since that appears to be much less demanding on GPU).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is important if you have a complex model that you use either convex collision or a much simpler collision mesh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want some examples of really rather high poly parts, check out the THSS pack linked in my sig. The parts are all pretty high poly, especially the adapters with round attach points.
