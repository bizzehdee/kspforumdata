I have no experience in modding, and i have learned everything i know now about models/textures from doing models for KSP (I\u00A0have done 2d pixel sprites before though, but thats a lot different). I have control over non-animated models,\u00A0Im alright at unwrapping\u00A0and I\u0027d say\u00A0pretty decent at texturing, but i have a hard time with\u00A0animations. When i want to animate something i have a lot of objects because i use the log scale and rot to animate it. But when i unwrap them i end up with a lot of UV maps. Are there any better way to do it than to use log scale and rot and then having several maps? Or is that just how it works? I am using Blender for animations and Photoshop for texture btw.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-15T16:08:28Z\u0022 title=\u002201/15/2017 04:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 15, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Flamingo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InsaneDruid","CreatedById":137849,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-14T23:41:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy and when do you have multiple objects?
