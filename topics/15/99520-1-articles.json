Everything seemed to work fine, except it was missing some graphics in the texture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI couldnt figure out what was going on, but I\u0027m guessing I had more than one material assigned to it...So I scrapped it and started fresh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOW, the textures are perfect, but once I surface attach the part, i cant pull it off, and also now the right click menu doesnt appear at all.
