But I\u0027ve created a model in Blender, textured it and exported as .mu file. It loads into the game, but without textures. I tried converting the textures to dss, that didn\u0027t work. Renamed them to model000.dss, that didn\u0027t work.\n\nSecond problem is that although I have a collider mesh (node\\_collider), there are no collisions. And I can place the part and attach it, but once attached, I can\u0027t grab it again in the VAB.\n\nIs using Unity a MUST to make models or can it still be done using only Blender? Am i better off using Unity only?\n\nI\u0027m lost ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"cxg2827","CreatedById":57380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T16:31:17Z","Content":"No need to convert to .mu, Unity will recognize the blend file.
