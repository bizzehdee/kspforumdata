The simplest GameObject is a Transform, which stores data for position, rotation, and scale. Nothing else. What\u0027s visible as an object is a GameObject with 2 additional components, Mesh Filter (filters out meshes you don\u0027t want displayed); and Mesh Renderer (renders mesh you\u0027ve selected with Mesh Filter). Mesh Renderer is where you do material set up. Knowing this, you can easily see object creation step in Unity is the same, whether you are creating a light; camera; or something else. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModel Imports are simply a series of automated steps of creating empty GameObject, add MeshFilter, add MeshRenderer. Imports are marked Read Only because they are your source, and you want them around in unmolested form in case you need to revert to it. Unity also refers to them so you manipulate them directly, Unity looses track and your actual unity assets get jumbled. Next to the Apply button in the import\u0027s Inspector Panel at the bottom right, there\u0027s \u0022Reimport\u0022; this reverts all the import settings to default so you can go back to the baseline you started with. similar to Photoshop\u0027s history window, by clicking on the very top of the window, you can revert to the initial state when you first opened the file, even though your history of actions has progressed far beyond the total steps tracked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor exporting you want to write to a location outside of Unity\u0027s project folder tree (directly to KSP Gamedata; or some 3rd location). Creating files directly inside Unity project will slow Unity down, and can mess up Unity\u0027s file tracking system. For the exports, the MU file has texture references embedded, it expects \u003Cstrong\u003EA\u003C/strong\u003E texture of the same exact name in the same folder that it resides in. whether the texture is the same as the original doesn\u0027t matter, as long as the name is exactly the same. This is where MODEL{} comes in to allow you to assign different textures during part compile time. For simplicity sake, any part you put into KSP\u0027s Gamedata should have MU, CFG, and as many Texture files as referred by the MU file; all in the same folder inside of GameData, as long as the asset is in GameData somewhere, KSP will attempt to load it. If you do a lot of texture sharing, every part must have at least a dummy texture, a 32x32 square, in order to allow the MU file to load properly. B9 uses this extensively to save on memory footprint; as does Karbonite and my parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003Ethings became much clearer.
