I\u0027m making a deep submergance vehicle (inspired by the Alvin) which has 7 thrusters which are used to maneuver. Since they are used similarly to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports in KSP, I thought it would make sense to have them operate as such. \u00A0But I\u0027m wondering, should I animate the rotation of the blades\u00A0in Blender just as you would for a jet engine? And then trigger the animation\u00A0when the thrusters are used.\u00A0Similar to how the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports produce\u00A0the thrust plume effect when they are being used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022pTaWoKH.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022539\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/pTaWoKH.png?1\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022DZ4w08d.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022540\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/DZ4w08d.png?1\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-26T01:45:26Z\u0022 title=\u002210/26/2017 01:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 26, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbal Astronautics\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-26T17:16:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmmm... this sounds like an interesting problem.\u00A0 Sadly I do not think that you can reference standard animations in particle effect definitions (which are what the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E module uses for the thruster plumes).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as existing solutions go, I think FireSpitter -might- have what you are looking for.\u00A0 I do know that it has support for bladed/propeller driven engines, but I\u0027m unsure if it has been applied to anything \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E related.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you were up for writing your own plugin script I don\u0027t think it would be too hard to code a PartModule to manage an animation to correspond with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thruster use.\u00A0 Again, I think FireSpitter would probably have quite a bit of example code on how to accomplish what you are looking for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither way I think you would want to animate the blades in Blender, and reference that animation in the corresponding PartModule (FS or custom).\u00A0 I think FireSpitter even uses two separate meshes for the spinning blades -- one standard mesh of the actual blades for when RPM is low, and a secondary \u0027blurred disk\u0027 mesh for when RPM is higher -- blending between the two animated meshes through the plugin code and material transparency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
