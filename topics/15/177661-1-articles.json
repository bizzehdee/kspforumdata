Do you need to know about modeling the parts? Texturing? Animating? Programming?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts important because things like modeling I can help with. But I know nothing about working with config files that would be helpful to any of your questions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn general, if you\u0027re starting from scratch, you probably want to make a really simple 3d model that you can use to prototype your decoupler or fairing and see what pieces and sizes you need. You can then go back and model them with confidence that you won\u0027t need to have to make painful fixes to your art after the fact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-31T17:50:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your looking for modeling info I\u0027ve started a page with the complete project for various parts\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed6471646376\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/169578-parts-demo-%E2%80%93-blender-gimp-and-unity-files-may-12-2018/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:228px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach demo part includes the Blender, Gimp and Unity projects and some notes.
