Immediately \u0022SAVE AS\u0022 A new name you choose. Then change the \u0022name =\u0022 at the top of the config file. \u0022name =\u0022 is how the game tells the difference with parts. If you have 2 configs with the same \u0022name =\u0022 then you are going to get strange results. Create a new folder. Cut and paste the new config file after you save it into the new folder. Copy into the new folder any textures the model seems to need and of course the model.mu it uses. Rename the .mu file to whatever you like and make sure the config file is amended to look for the new .mu in the folder structure you are now in e.g Squad/Parts/Aero/Wings/\u0022What you named the .mu\u0022 But without \u0022.mu\u0022 suffix. Do the same for any mentioned textures. Again no suffix. Rename the texture you want to change to have \u0022old\u0022 at the end e.g \u003Cspan\u003E\u0022\u003C/span\u003EWingsold.dds\u0022 so you know where the original is. Then rename the texture you created to the same name e.g \u0022Wings\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow for those difficult parts where it is still not working. Do the above then you will need the program \u0022HxD Hex Editor\u0022 ( which is free but make sure you get it from the developers site)\u00A0 use it to open the .mu file and scroll to the very bottom of the translated text. Here you will find the textures that the mesh is directed to use. Apparently the type of image file doesn\u0027t seem to matter as I have seen many whose suffix doesn\u0027t match. What matters is the name of the texture. Rename your new texture to something with exactly the same number of letters as the original. In the hex editor highlight just the name, not the suffix of the texture you want to change and then type it in. do not delete or backspace or do anything other than replace the original name with new name of exactly the same amount of letters. If you get it wrong close without saving and try again. Save the file (it may ask are you sure). Hex editor will automatically create a backup along with your amended .mu with the suffix .bak\u00A0 The Hex editor is also a good way of finding out what textures your mesh is looking for. Your new .mu will look for your new texture rather than the original.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this doesn\u0027t work you need a Yoda level modder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of this was worked out through reading forums and trial and error.
