Thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Actual polygon budget: Okay, put down the pitchforks. I see a lot of games that, like KSP, are very physics intensive, and people don\u0027t realize that the lag they get is not due to the graphics, but the physics.

Has anyone done any definitive experiments to see how much model complexity affects the framerate? Probably more importantly, does polygon count make a sizable impact on memory usage? The intuitive answer is \u0022Duh, yes,\u0022 but again, I don\u0027t know. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Animations: I\u0027ve heard it mentioned that Animations can slow things down a bit, especially with a lot of keyframes. This makes sense to me, but I\u0027m curious if a very, very fast animation, but with simple keyframing, causes a big hit. For example, a Turbine spinning at very high speed, but with only two keyframes. On that topic, is there an easy way to adjust rotational speed? I can make a looped animation of a spinning turbine, but if I want to vary it with altitude, or airspeed, or thrust, or what have you, I\u0027m not sure how that would work. For the heat animation, as an example, KSP seems to move along the animation depending on the heat. This would just cause the turbine to quickly spin to a certain rotational offset, rather than vary its speed in continuous rotation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry if these have been covered already, but like I said, it\u0027s hard to know what information is still valid.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T06:13:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll start. 3) I don\u0027t know about other 3D programs, but with Blender, the obvious controls for smooth vs. hard edged are the buttons ... Smooth and Flat. I\u0027ve not yet encountered where these might be fine tuned (probably a box I\u0027ve missed over on the right side in one of the object or object data menus; even one or more modifiers might deal with that). 4) No clue about the KSP/ Unity poly budget, but its not a bad idea to optimize. Most KSP parts aren\u0027t really all that complex (stock, anyway). I\u0027ve also found out the hard way that if I join meshes in Blender and export as .dae, Unity doesn\u0027t consider the object to be a mesh, even though a .blend is fine for Unity (but of course not for KSP). But Unity has no problem with multiple unjoined meshes. Fewer meshes and the fewer polygons (then tri\u0027s) is generally best. I\u0027m sure experts will join the thread and cover all your questions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hoojiwana","CreatedById":57079,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T06:49:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Torminator\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Torminator\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) the .2 part tools script comes with a KSP particle emitter.
