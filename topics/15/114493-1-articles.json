So you can create it with something like a 1-second duration, from dark to bright, and that\u0027s all you need."},{"CreatedByName":"Xyphos","CreatedById":139010,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T00:11:17Z","Content":"So... basically, I\u0027d need to pretend that the model is a light, and create a [transparent-\u003Ered-\u003Ewhite] color curve animation?"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T15:03:20Z","Content":"Yep, basically. For a lot of the heat animations on my engines, I go from black-\u003Ehot with a single ending keyframe, where the RGB color is 5,2,1 (which turns to white due to saturation, on the brighter parts of the emissive map). \n\nI\u0027ll usually put the hottest parts of the emissive map up inside the nozzle, with it getting less bright toward the inside of the rim, and then the outside of the bell will be maybe 25% as \u0022bright\u0022. With such hot colors on the emissive animation, the outside of the bell will get a nice orange-red, while the inside will reach yellow and white."},{"CreatedByName":"Xyphos","CreatedById":139010,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T03:05:00Z","Content":"OK, I setup the animations in Unity v5.0.2f1\n\nI write the MU file\n\npart is missing from the KSP menu (yes, the cfg is there)\n\nbut when I remove the animation, recompile and reload, the part shows up.\n\napparently, KSP doesn\u0027t like the animation for some reason, any idea why?"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T03:27:52Z","Content":"Downgrade your project to Unity 4.2.2, and redo your emissive animations there.\n\nKSP uses the legacy animation system for emissive animations, which was taken out from 4.3 onwards."},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T05:41:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E OK, I setup the animations in Unity v5.0.2f1\n\u003E I write the MU file\n\u003E \n\u003E part is missing from the KSP menu (yes, the cfg is there)\n\u003E \n\u003E but when I remove the animation, recompile and reload, the part shows up.\n\u003E \n\u003E apparently, KSP doesn\u0027t like the animation for some reason, any idea why?\n\nI just dealt with this same exact problem doing cockpit lights. I found a way to get it working without installing an earlier version of unity. [The solution I found is here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126518-Resolved-Cockpit-lights?p=2043262\u0026viewfull=1#post2043262).\n\nOnce you figure it out, it\u0027s pretty easy to search/replace in the animation files. After that, it\u0027ll load up your model and it works. So far, the only editing I\u0027ve had to do is with animations involving emissives. Point lights and such work without having to edit.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T05:46:31Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 05:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"}]}
