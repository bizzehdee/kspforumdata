Been playing with a new UV packer tool called iPackThat, and chatted with the dev about it during its development. I wrote up a review, and got 3 Steam keys to give away in a contest. \n\nShort version: it has a progressive packing algorithm that beats the heck out of what Max, etc, do by default, and probably gets better results than a hand-pack that took you hours to do.\n\n[http://warrenschultz.com/ipackthat-review-contest/](http://warrenschultz.com/ipackthat-review-contest/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-23T14:18:59Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2015 02:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by WarrenSchultz**"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T17:15:23Z","Content":"What is UV packing?"},{"CreatedByName":"WarrenSchultz","CreatedById":125481,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T17:41:23Z","Content":"When you\u0027re creating a texture map for a model, you are able to put more detail on each individual poly the bigger it is, right?\n\nSo the idea of UV packing is to reduce the unused space on a texture map as much as possible, to give each polygon cluster as much real estate on the map as possible.\n\nDoes that make sense, or is it clear as mud? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nFor example, using this software, my UV map on a test model went from 59% wasted space to 21%. \n\n![1.png?shared_name=ldcx6ojcmaeqcyisv7lrvvdjezk875cv](https://app.box.com/representation/file_version_27817879056/image_2048/1.png?shared_name=ldcx6ojcmaeqcyisv7lrvvdjezk875cv)"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T18:58:05Z","Content":"What program did you use for the original?

There are other options, but I\u0027m not a pro modeler. I do, however, have a lot of friends who are pros who have already integrated this tool into their workflow.
