I\u0027ve learnt Blender and Unity basics in two days, and I\u0027m basically just getting to grips with part production atm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have my first test piece (a simple 2x1 sheet) built and textured in Blender and im-exported with Unity to .mu/.mbm files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EO frabjous day! My beautiful part loads in the game, renders its texture correctly and the two nodes I assigned it in the .cfg are spot on! My problem is that as soon as the part is dropped/placed in the VAB it then becomes totally unselectable. I haven\u0027t got the slightest clue where to look for the source. Is it likely to be something I did wrong/overlooked in modelling, or a simple oversight in the .cfg?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-05T15:19:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou forgot to assign collision mesh in Unity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SirSnoopy","CreatedById":114402,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-05T15:28:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh my god.
