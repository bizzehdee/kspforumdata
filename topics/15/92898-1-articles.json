Create the low poly and high poly separately?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of my inexperience and lack of a formal education in 3D Modeling, I actually use all three. I find that some models won\u0027t subsurf properly, so I create a high poly and decimate/retopo. On a few occasions, I\u0027ve created a low and high poly separately. Most commonly, I use low poly to high poly via subsurf. Such as, a low poly base with a few hundred tris. Subsurf once, add big details, subsurf again, add medium details, subsurf again, add small details. Then I usually use xNormal to bake normal and AO from the high poly. When these results aren\u0027t desirable, sometimes I will do the normal and AO bake in Blender.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-15T17:14:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I wouldn\u0027t bake normal maps for KSP mods in the first place. IMO baking normal maps is mostly useful for organic models, not machines, where sculpted imperfections are fine. You\u0027re better off designing a bump map manually and converting it. It\u0027ll give you more control, and you wont have to worry about seams.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"noonespecial","CreatedById":81942,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-15T17:35:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn some things, I whole heartedly agree with you. But baking from high poly is not without it\u0027s uses in KSP or for hard surface models all together. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll offer the following as an example. In this one, I made the high poly (right model) first. The engine bell with ridges is a single mesh, and each pipe a single mesh. I then created a low poly from the high poly by manually retopo\u0027ing it, then baked the normals from the high poly onto the low poly in xNormal to create the normal map used in the low poly (left model). It came out rather clean and with less than a quarter of the tris of the original model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9D9VjFc.png?1\u0022 alt=\u00229D9VjFc.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"landeTLS","CreatedById":97925,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-15T18:25:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI usually do highpoly first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei Start at lowpoly. add bevel modifier (dont use edgesplit for highpoly. It will leave jagged edges around details when baking normals) Add subsurf (turbosmooth for you maya/max users) and add any detail by floaters and modelling(i highly recommend using floaters for highpolys that are made for baking, even cavities and grooves works well it, looks odd close up but bakes out very well). Make sure your highpoly model is made up of mostly/all quads. Otherwise subsurf/turbosmooth wont work properly(quad \u0026gt; \u0022tri-like-quad\u0022 \u0026gt; tri \u0026gt; ngon) you can however squeeze in the odd tri or ngon here or there on flat surfaces if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then recreate the general shape via snapping for the lowpoly model(note: this is technically retopology) Unwrap the lowpoly and Bake normals and ao from the highpoly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReal retopology really isnt needed for mechanical modelling. Retopology is more for a different workflow used in organic modelling(Sculpt a detailed model with dynamic topology, then manually create a new mesh ontop with bsurfaces and or the shrinkwrap modifier)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo other workflows i know some ppl use are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecage model(make a general shape that you can create both a highpoly and a lowpoly from) requires a some planning. Good if youre working off a drawing/concept art.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELowpoly to highpoly: what it says, you make your lowpoly first then copy it and create the highpoly from it. Requires more planning that high to low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso like cpt. Kipard said. You dont need to create highpoly models for ksp. But it does take the load off your texturing workload as most details will already be established on the ao/nrm. That being said with good texturing you can achieve some really cool artistic effects you just cant achieve simply by baking.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-15T21:08:37Z\u0022 title=\u002212/15/2014 09:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by landeTLS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
