How does the new model/texture system work. I\u0027ve seen mods able to call meshes and models from other directories and use several different part CFGs with the same model. Anywhere that has the info available?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Ive seen command pods with extra fairings like the engines. Since my new command pods will make use of this, is there a tutorial with this info somewhere as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. What happened to the IVA tutorial?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
