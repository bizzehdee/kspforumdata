I started up a new project and just fixed it that way. The problem with my main project now is if I wanted to write a model.mu to a specific folder I would have to create a new game object and set it to the folder. The ones that already exist are going to write directly into my gamedata folder. If the folder isn\u0027t there they create one. The part tools are jacked up. I must have set it to my gamedata folder at some point. When I do that it seems to mess them up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-22T16:45:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223153662\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022164457\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221503298562\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022177745\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022harrisjosh2711\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 21/08/2017 at 7:56 AM, harrisjosh2711 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem with my main project now is if I wanted to write a model.mu to a specific folder I would have to create a new game object and set it to the folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy can\u0027t you just change the fielpath on the part tool\u0027s exporter?\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 Bit concerned that only one IVA is showing you should be able to spawn every IVA in the GameData folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor part tools to work correctly it really needs to be linked to whichever KSP GameData folder you do your dev work in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for part tools that break when linked to a GameData folder , unity always tells you why, and usually , an almost guaranteed fact, that empty cfgs will break part tools, there are empty example cfg\u0027s in tweakscale and TakeCommand, and probably loads of other mods, finding and deleting these usually restores part tools functionality\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"harrisjosh2711","CreatedById":177745,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-22T17:38:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223154744\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022164457\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221503420303\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002250907\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpannerMonkey(smce)\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n41 minutes ago, SpannerMonkey(smce) said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy can\u0027t you just change the fielpath on the part tool\u0027s exporter?\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCouldn\u0027t tell you.
