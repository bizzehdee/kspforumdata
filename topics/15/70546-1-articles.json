Cpt. Kipard gives good advice on picking a project as well. Your best bet is to find something that isn\u0027t well represented yet (which can be difficult sometimes, but possible).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI take it from your initial post that you are literally just beginning the process of modding, so my first suggestion would be to do a couple of relatively easy projects just to get a handle on the basics. Make a couple of fuel tanks (just cylinders with textures) and get them in-game. Post your work in a WIP thread and ask for feedback and advice on specific things that you are working on. There are a LOT of great modders that will be willing to help you like this if approached in the right way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you are comfortable with your chosen modeling program, then start coming up with ideas for a pack that you actually want to release. Keep a sharp focus on what you want it to be. It\u0027s very easy to just keep adding \u0022one more piece\u0022 and having the whole thing get unwieldy (one of my biggest problems, personally)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbove all, make parts that \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eyou\u003C/span\u003E want to play with. If you want to make the most spectacular looking fuel tanks in the game, do it, even if you are told that there are plenty of other mods that have them. If they truly are the best looking ones, you will get downloads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd lastly, have fun and good luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T14:01:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll good advice above. I made parts that I wanted to use, but which were not in the stock game. I checked to see if there were mod parts which did what I wanted. I found none. So I made them, and I use them a lot. Check out the links for my parts in my sig line. Most of them are not too fancy, but they do the job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you use that kind of approach, you\u0027ll find that you are not making parts which are \u0022a dime a dozen\u0022 out there; you\u0027ll also have fun using your mod parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: its easy to make them to be compatible for Career mode too.
