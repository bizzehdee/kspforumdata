I.e does it\u00A0cause lag or slow down the game in any way? I am by no mean a computer wizz, but as far as I understand it, having parts with big textures would mostly affect RAM.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason why I ask is that I am modeling a few different real rockets, and I want decals and logos on the tanks and fairings to come out crisp and high resolution. A 1024x texture map does a nice job at it, but I\u0027d much rather\u00A0have 2048x or even 4096x texture maps to really get the logos looking sharp.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an example, let\u0027s say I used 4096x texture maps for 2 fairings, 1 interstage and 1 fuel tank, would that be an issue, other than just increasing RAM usage?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-05T22:24:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you just want logos crisp, then make sure the geometry for the areas with logos has some discrete quads and map those areas at higher resolution.

The biggest impact is the number of draw calls (with triangle count being a distant second to this), and every separate mesh object will create an additional draw call.
