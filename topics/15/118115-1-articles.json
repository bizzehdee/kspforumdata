I don\u0027t have any metrics on this, but anecdotally it seems to be true.\n\nYes, multiple models, or multiple parts, can use the same textures. And they can reference them from outside the same directory, with some caveats, and details that are worth keeping in mind.\n\n\\* All models (.mu files) and all textures (png, mbm, dds, etc) are loaded FIRST, before the part CFGs are dealt with, so memory is used right away whether the texture or model is referenced by a part or not. This mostly doesn\u0027t matter here, but it\u0027s worth keeping in mind, especially since it influences the next point:\n\n\\* When the model (mu file) is processed, it needs to find a corresponding texture with the correct name in the SAME directory, or those meshes will come up as untextured, even if you assign a different texture in the part CFG. This is because it\u0027s looking at what assets are currently being loaded, and not what\u0027s in the part\u0027s CFG yet. This means if you want to use a texture in another directory, you need to have a dummy texture in the same directory as a placeholder. It can be stupidly tiny if you want. I usually make them something like 8x8 or 16x16 in size, but a 1x1 texture might work too. Textures this small sometimes don\u0027t work in DDS format, so I\u0027d use MBM or something for these. You can try DDS and switch back to MBM if it fails to load it. \n\n\\* The re-assignment of textures (particularly when using one in another directory) is done in the part\u0027s CFG file, and is name-based. This reassignment also works on an absolute directory path (from GameData), not a relative one. You use the \u0022MODEL { }\u0022 syntax for this. For example, in ColorCodedCanisters, I have an orange tank that uses the stock orange textures (including the normal-map), in addition to its own texture. The local texture is in the current folder, but obviously the stock textures are elsewhere:\n\n    \tMODEL {\t\tmodel = ColorCodedCans/CC2m-Jumbo64\t\ttexture = orange-jumbo-0, Squad/Parts/FuelTank/fuelTankJumbo-64/model000\t\ttexture = orange-jumbo-1, Squad/Parts/FuelTank/fuelTankJumbo-64/model001\t\tscale = 1.0, 1.0, 1.0\t}\n\nIn the above example, the model was compiled in Unity with a texture named \u0022orange-jumbo-0\u0022 and a normal map named \u0022orange-jumbo-1\u0022. I made small dummy images for those, and reassign with the above code.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-10T15:18:40Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2015 03:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NecroBones**"},{"CreatedByName":"Porkjet","CreatedById":92433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T15:14:50Z","Content":"Using atlas textures over mutliple models is more efficient since it reduces the amount of individual render calls for the textures.
