Have you tried applying \u0022shadows\u0022 directly to your textures in your image editing app (such as PS or Gimp)? As you probably know, that method (through the use of layers and filters, such as bump mapping) only yields fixed \u0022shadows\u0022, but they do help with the illusion of depth. Perhaps you are referring to a way in which non static shadows are applied?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ohfive30","CreatedById":74380,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T11:10:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dtobi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022dtobi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI am looking for a way to generate and use radiosity information (fakes shadows in the textures) in blender 2.86.

Radiosity is a form of global illumination which can be rendered either to screen or texture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest you use ambient occlusion, it\u0027s even better than shadow mapping cause KSP already has already got dynamic (sharp) shadows and what you need in KSP is only pronouncing detail and having \u0022soft\u0022 shading.
