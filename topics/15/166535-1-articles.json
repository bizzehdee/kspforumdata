The result is, that after going into timewarp and out again for about 20 to 40 times (sometimes also reloading the scene does this) my parts are... well... still connected... but far away from each other... with a huge gap between... why is that? I guess the main point where this happens is, when I connect my part to a cubic strut.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-14T21:26:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi i suspect it\u0027s the good old floating point errors\u00A0 and them adding up over time.\u00A0 Once time warp ends and objects snap back or dont ,\u00A0 the new position as far as the game is concerned is the new one, so the gap remains,\u00A0 and the more times the cycle repeats the bigger the gap and the greater the distance from the original coordinates.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile not nice, and although there\u0027s a current\u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E physics bug\u003C/a\u003E, well a couple that are related to this, i think it\u0027s edge case bug and bog standard unity behavior\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-16T03:56:11Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2017 03:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by SpannerMonkey(smce)\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
