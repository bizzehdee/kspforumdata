Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with the whole \u0022all parts must have convex colliders\u0022 issue? With 1.1 basically forcing us to use convex colliders, making good aerodynamic colliders seems like kind of a pain to do. I\u0026#39;m sure I can find a way around it, but I was wondering if there was anyone out there who had any brilliant ideas to make the whole ordeal a bit less painfull.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;m not 100% sure how FARs voxelization thing works, but as far as I know it basically prefers aerodynamic shapes for the colliders, no?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAny and all suggestions is appreciated :)\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T02:02:09Z","Content":"\nMy understanding is that FAR goes by the visual model, not the colliders. At least, that\u0026#39;s what I was told by someone in the FAR thread when I asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor stock aero, it\u0026#39;s based on \u0022drag cubes\u0022 that are generated automatically for your part, based on the visual model, but can be overridden since it\u0026#39;s not always perfect, particularly with regards to hollow or highly concave parts.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut, you\u0026#39;ll probably want relatively hollow colliders for a fairing anyway. Unfortunately the only way to do this with convex colliders (which are *mostly* required now, but will be 100% required in KSP 1.1), is to just simply use several smaller colliders to approximate the shape you want.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fairy","CreatedById":152892,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T11:08:30Z","Content":"\nThank you :)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf I understand correctly, when using FAR, you don\u0026#39;t necessarily need aerodynamic colliders, as long as the models themselves are aerodynamically sound? So when 1.1 comes around, I can just use a bunch of \u0022randomly shaped\u0022 colliders for the fairings as long as they are convex?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI don\u0026#39;t play in stock atmo, so luckily I don\u0026#39;t need to do anything about drag cubes.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kartoffelkuchen","CreatedById":108501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T12:38:09Z","Content":"\nWell, you\u0026#39;ll already need those convex-only colliders in 1.0.5.

The new version didn\u0026#39;t really excite me anyways, so I don\u0026#39;t mind being stuck in 1.0.4. But with 1.1 right around the corner (probably), I want my colliders to work. I never plan on publishing any of my parts/mods, so if some colliders are a bit wonky, but still functional, that is fine by me.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI don\u0026#39;t play in stock, ever. I always play in RSS/RO with FAR and all the realism addons/mods, so having the fairings work in stock is none of my concern. But I would love a tutorial on how to make good convex colliders that will work in FAR.\n"}]}
