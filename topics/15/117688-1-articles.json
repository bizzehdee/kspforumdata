After searching for tutorial and all, I was able to make some simple parts.\n\nNow, I would like to make something a \u0027lil more difficult and have some questions about that.\n\nI\u0027ve searched for tutorials but there isn\u0027t any who could really help me understand what I wanted.\n\nSince it\u0027s more easy to answer while knowing what I\u0027m using, I\u0027m doing modeling on Blender then I\u0027m using Unity to finish the part (and export it as .mu)\n\nThe first question is more for information. It\u0027s about colliders.\n\nI\u0027ve seen that you can either add one when modeling (calling it node\\_collider) or applying one in Unity.\n\nWhat\u0027s the difference between the two method ? it seems for me that the two method worked ... so I don\u0027t really know which one is better and above all, why.\n\nFor reference, I\u0027ve imported some parts in Blender to see how they were made.\n\nWith this, I\u0027m now wondering another things about collider. I\u0027ve seen somes with a totally different name and well ... I don\u0027t know if it was done in the modeling program or in unity but ... what I want to know is how the game know that it is a collider ? From what i can tell, I think when you use a mesh for collider, you need to call it a special way, but you don\u0027t care if it\u0027s done with a collider object.\n\nAnd lastly for now, I wanted to make a simple wheel but ... I don\u0027t understand how you add an axis of rotation \u003E.\u003C\n\nI searched on the web but couldn\u0027t find a tutorial for this. Could someone redirect me on a tutorial for this, or explain me how it works please ?\n\n(if possible, not a video so that I could print it or at least follow it without having to rewind the video X times when I don\u0027t understand something =p)\n\nThanks in advance !"},{"CreatedByName":"AndyMt","CreatedById":123144,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T12:01:03Z","Content":"About colliders, the way I do it (I\u0027m not at my KSP PC, so this is from memory): \n\n- model part in Blender, including the collider object, the name actually doesn\u0027t matter\n\n- importing in Unity\n\n- remove the mesh renderer on the collider object\n\n- add component \u0022physics \u003E mesh collider\u0022\n\n- select \u0022convex\u0022 for the collider\n\nBy adding the physics, the KSP part tools do the right thing and know that the collider is a collider...\n\nI haven\u0027t tried wheels yet.

If you want complex colliders that conform to your model nicely, this is the way to do it.\n\nSometimes it\u0027s advantageous to add some in Unity though. The situations where that\u0027s useful are ones where you only need the primitives it provides (boxes and capsules), and you can save yourself the trouble of removing the renderer and adding the physics, when rebuilding the part repeatedly while testing it.

It\u0027s much easier to do these things in Unity.\nA trick I also use for colliders in Blender: I change the \u0022max rendering\u0022 of the object to \u0022wireframe\u0022 and make sure no material is associated with the object. This way the collider doesn\u0027t show up as a massive object in Unity right away in the \u0022Models\u0022 preview.\n\nYou still have to remove the rendere component, though."},{"CreatedByName":"nimaroth","CreatedById":148350,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T13:00:30Z","Content":"Thanks all for your answer, I\u0027m starting to understand differences about each method.\n\nFor wheels, I still need to make some tests but I think I\u0027ve found out what was missing."}]}
