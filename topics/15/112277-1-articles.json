I\u0027m still learning at this and again, I\u0027ve ran into an issue I can\u0027t quite figure out so, I\u0027m asking the masters.\n\nBelow is an image of my part. I\u0027ve tried various lighting in Unity from diffuse to bumped specular (with a bumpmap) and I can\u0027t get my lighting right. This image is an early morning shot and you can see plainly where my parts connect. It\u0027s shaded in the rear and lit in the front. I\u0027m not so much worried about the \u0027wood\u0027 texture just yet, my question is, what am I doing wrong to get such uneven lighting. I\u0027d prefer it look somewhat uniform where the parts connect.\n\n![lightingissues.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/lightingissues.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Squiggsy","CreatedById":139947,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T17:02:30Z","Content":"when this has happened to me in the past it has invariably been a problem with the normals in blender or with how I\u0027ve shaded it,\n\neither you have some fipped normals in which case (if you are using blender) you can just select all in edit mode and hit control\u002B n and flip normals. If it\u0027s not that you might have shading problems in which case you just need to select all in object mode, then on your toolbar select smooth shading and then go around marking which edges you want to be sharp in edit mode by selecting them and pressing control\u002Be then \u0022mark sharp\u0022. then go to the modifiers menu and select the edge split modifier.\n\nsorry if it\u0027s neither of these or if you already know all of this, thought i\u0027d explain in as much detail as possible in case you didn\u0027t, also sorry if you\u0027re not using Blender, I don\u0027t know how to use any other programs! ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nHope this helps though!"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T17:12:24Z","Content":"Thanks Squigs,\n\nSince Blender is beyond me atm, I\u0027m using Wings3D. Most of what I\u0027m doing is really simple stuff. I made sure to go through my parts before exporting them and marked the \u0027softness/hardness\u0027. One thing I did do is I left the edges with connection nodes marked as \u0027hard\u0027. Using your suggestion, I went in, marked them as \u0027soft\u0027, and...

I\u0027m still trying to get the hang of all this part modding stuff. All I can confirm now is that I have created parts before in Wings and the lighting worked fine. What seems to be happening is that when I connect the parts in the SPH, they\u0027re not getting joined into a single part for lighting purposes. I thot it might be my connection nodes but I\u0027ve gone over them and they look pretty good. I tried adding the \u0027rimFalloff\u0027 and that did nothing. Right now, I dunno."},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T04:03:06Z","Content":"Ok, so I loaded up Blender and attempted to follow your instructions.

Apparently in Wings there is no way to change normals for specific vertices or faces, only the entire object (which would result on the texture on the inside problem you had in blender the first time), at least that was the information I found from my 10 minutes looking on google that may be wrong.\n\nglad you got it sorted though ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T13:28:08Z","Content":"Took me a bit longer to try to determine what a \u0027normal\u0027 is and no, it has an \u0027inverse\u0027 command which works on the entire object, exactly like the blender effect I created.
