So here is my basic knowledge, Kinda know CFG\u0027s (I have written 1) and I think I know blender pretty good for where im at. Also another problem I am having is exporting these models, collision mesh (I think thats what its called) and textures. I am using mac as well to add to the challenge aha. If someone could please help me with these small problems that would be great thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T17:12:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou do need to detail what the problems are before anyone can help. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other files in a part folder are simply the model and textures.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"J_Man_X_663","CreatedById":29355,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T17:14:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ebasically, Exporting the file from blender and in what format, and making the textures.... sorry if it was a bit confusing aha\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
