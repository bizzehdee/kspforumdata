I\u0027ve tried figuring out what the different parameters does, but I\u0027m not coding wizz so I don\u0027t really know which\u00A0parameter does what. What basically seems to happen is that the engine sounds are being played at twice the speed compared to the original sound files.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a \u0022standard\u0022 way of setting up these parameters in order to have the game play the sounds like whey were originally made?\u00A0If someone can explain each parameter in a simple way, I would be very appreciative.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo clarify, I\u0027m talking about this section:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0AUDIO\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 {\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 channel = Ship\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 clip = foldername/sounds/filename\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 volume = 0.0 0.0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 volume = 0.0 0.0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 pitch = 0.0 0.0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 pitch = 0.0 0.0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 loop = true\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 }\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-14T06:08:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYep, a very \u0022default\u0022 way would be to configure it like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\t\t\tAUDIO\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tchannel = Ship\n\t\t\t\tclip = path/to/file\n\t\t\t\tvolume = 0.0 0.0\n\t\t\t\tvolume = 1.0 1.0\n\t\t\t\tpitch = 0.0 0.2\n\t\t\t\tpitch = 1.0 1.0\n\t\t\t\tloop = true\n\t\t\t}\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach of those volume and pitch settings work like this: The first number is the throttle setting, and the second is the volume or pitch on a scale from 0 to 1 that corresponds to that throttle setting.
