It (mostly) works, however the kerbals do not grab onto the ladder when exiting the hatch. They exit just fine and in the proper space, then just float there outside the hatch (unless on the surface of a planet, where they get a concussion from the fall). They are able to grab and use the ladder just fine when directed to, and to re-enter the hatch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my setup in unity:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img209/6149/nu12.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nu12.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe airlock and ladder use box colliders, and both transforms are in exactly the same place. The airlock collider slightly intersects the mesh of the hatch, and the ladder mesh is slightly outside it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, anyone see something wrong with my setup that would cause my poor kerbals to not grab the ladder on exiting the hatch?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anariaq","CreatedById":19400,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T01:47:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I think is wrong, is that the ladder dos not intersect the mesh.

I think then the center of the airlock box is to far out. When kerbals spawn when exit, is the center of the airlock box.
