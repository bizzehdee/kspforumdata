The solar panels for the Kubes normally get placed along its four sides facing outward. How do I go about getting solar to work on a single-model piece when the solar panels are multiple entities facing in different directions? Or, more generally, how do I make a working solar panel that has a collector area made of multiple parts? I\u0027ll most likely be modeling in Blender and importing into Unity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-12T04:28:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe one part is allowed to have multiple solar panel modules, as long as you give each of them uniquely named transforms and suncatchers; but you can only have one animation play at any time with stock modules. As such you could have an indefinite number of static solar panels, but you can only have one deployable solar panel; should be fine to have both though, any number of statics and one deployable. If someone has made a replacement solar panel module that allows for multiple deployables I am unaware of it, but solving that issue is literally a few letters change in code.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Patrick Suddeth","CreatedById":137730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-12T15:08:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that should help.

(Do I have to model and give it any name or they are just GameObjects with specific direction setup?
