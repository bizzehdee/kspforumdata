If the collider mesh is 24-gon this means that each face spans 360\u0027/24 = 15\u0027, The cross-section of a radially symmetrical polygon is actually one of the most basic trigonometrical problems, because each face represents the greco-semetic chord. And using the Pythagorean theorem if you know the cord lengths of 180 degrees (diameter) or 60 degrees (radius) you can calculate the length 90, 45, 22.5, 11.25, or the cords for 120, 30, 15, 7.5 degrees without knowing sin or cosine, all you need to know is that a circle is compose of points equidistant from the center and that c**^**2**^ **= b**^**2**^ **\u002B a**^**2**^\n\n    If Chord 60\u0027 = 1 therefore sin 30\u0027=0.5 and the cosine 30 = 0.866025 (definition of isosceles triangle, Pythagorean theorem)1-0.86602 = exterior radial at 30\u0027 =  0.133974; (0.133974[SUP]2[/SUP] \u002B .5[SUP]2[/SUP])1/2 = 0.51763 = chord 30\u0027 (Pythagorean theorem)Since the chord 30\u0027/2 = sin 15\u0027 then sin 15\u0027 = 0.51269/2 = 0.25882 and since the cos 75 = sin 15 = 0.25882\n\n**But I digress, The chord of 15 degrees/2 = sin 7.5 degrees. This solves one problem in that you can rotate your mesh in blender by 7.5 degrees. But in the equation above we see in the second line of code that there is an exterior radial. If your collider mesh is a de-gon version of the texture mesh which with smoothing is virtually circular cross-section with a radius, then the difference between the texture mesh cord r**\u003Csub\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Emin\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E **and collider mesh cord r**\u003Csub\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Emin\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E **= r**\u003Csub\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Emax\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E **(1 - cosine 7.5\u0027) = r**\u003Csub\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Emax \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E**0.0085.** \n\n**Have you ever noticed that, for instance, the strut connector starting mesh disappears into the structure you connected to, here is one reason.** \n\n**This is almost undetectable if the fuel tank is small (r**\u003Csub\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EF1\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E**=0.625), but if you rescale your tank to say 7.5 or 10 or 12.5 then r**\u003Csub\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Emax\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E **can expand to the point that you no longer are able to see maneuvering thrusters (as happens with scale mods of stock parts).

Another way to put this is that if tolerance is zero then we have to increase size by 0.0086 for each factor over 5.88 so if you want a tank that is F12 radius, then that tanks collider mesh needs to be increased to 1.0045X its original collider mesh radius. Off symmetry maxima part installations would no longer touch the texture unless surface attachment of those parts is designed to sink into the structure. IOW you can neccesarily solve the problem unless with you go for a denser collider mesh, but at least you know the tradeoffs, and you could design mods of strut connectors that are more visible, or thrusters that stand out further.**"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T17:57:37Z","Content":"I have to point out if you\u0027re making a cylinder to match stock parts, you might as well make the collider have the same number of sides given there\u0027s only 24(? or was it 28, I can\u0027t remember now )... there\u0027s no cylinder collider so you pretty much either have to use a mesh collider or 12-14 box colliders if you don\u0027t need to do anything on the inside."}]}
