Once on the pad it is fine, it is also fine in the preview image for the part, but on spawning it in the VAB it is displayed as deployed. Normally fixing this is as easy as unchecking the auto play animation check box in Unity, but I have already done that. It is very distracting to have the part deployed like this when trying to place the fairing over it, it sticks out so while once in the game it doesn\u0027t cause problems, in the VAB it is a problem.\n\nIt has a 2 part animation. The first animation is a standard solar panel deploy part module. The second is a generic animation module you can deploy afterwards that closes the front 2 panels. The animation in the VAB starts halfway between the 2 animations at frame 279. I\u0027m not sure how to go about fixing this but also keeping both animations.\n\n![kxjJhaV.png](http://i.imgur.com/kxjJhaV.png)\n\n![AH7Su5R.png](http://i.imgur.com/AH7Su5R.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-09T08:05:57Z","Content":"Not sure if you are still looking to resolve this problem.\n\n I had similar one recently.\n\nMake sure you have checked telescope clip (when setting animation clips), not tele\\_close. This is because Unity (upon exporting) takes the first frame from the clip that is checked (greyed out)."},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-10T14:31:22Z","Content":"I have found a workaround for this issue while making my parts: there are \u0022play \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u201C\u00C2\u00BA\u0022 and \u0022pause **II**\u0022 buttons above your viewport. \u0022Play\u0022 will start your main animation and \u0022Pause\u0022 will stop the frame. If you build your part in that paused state, your model in the game will start in that state as well."}]}
