I am an engineer by day and have extensive experience working with 3D CAD software, notably SolidWorks. I read an old post where a guy asked if it\u0027s possible to model parts in CAD, but he was referring to the AutoCAD, which is Autodesk\u0027s most basic 2D CAD software. So if I were so bold and brave as to undertake a project of making some custom parts, would I be able to model them in SW? SolidWorks has the capability to export 3D models in a variety of different file formats, but I\u0027m not sure which ones would be required to import into blender. Could an\u00A0experienced modder chime in and let me know\u00A0please? The ability to do this\u00A0would vastly soften my\u00A0learning curve for making a mod\u00A0(so long as I don\u0027t have to jump through too many hoops to make it work).
