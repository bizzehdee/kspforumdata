I\u0027m leaning towards \u0022probably not.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIIRC just about every shape in SW is procedural. According to \u0022Inside Solidworks 2003,\u0022 the closest export format might be stl, which would require another package to re-export for Unity import.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, texture mapping is going to be insanely difficult, because UV mapping is not really a feature (at least in 2k5, idk about 2k11). I can\u0027t imagine textures are a priority, as SolidWorks is a CADD/CAME product and not at all a graphics program. I think Catia may have some of those capabilities for presentational graphics. Solidworks is kind of like \u0022Catia Lite,\u0022 if you can call any $8000-$20000 software package a \u0022lite\u0022 version of a $25K-$50K one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI (personally and based on my own experience) would not spend any time attempting to create parts in SolidWorks. I also have Max 2.5R2, and really did not much care to use that either (mostly because I cannot find my parallel port dongle o_O). I sat down and learn Blender to make parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t be embarrassed to not know. You\u0027re one of very few people in the world who knows how to use SW or even has any reason to have heard of it. That\u0027s definitely something. How it would benefit you is by giving you a leg up in following tutorials and learning an actual graphics program, designed for \u0022digital art,\u0022 because that is what games ultimately are.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ALILOOOONG","CreatedById":33396,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-23T12:19:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethank you for you\u0027re help. guess I just need to learn how to use a different program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe problem with that is I\u0027ve become rather adept at using sw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Winter Man","CreatedById":11358,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-24T20:07:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can export to .obj from 2011 using a plugin, dunno what KSP uses but .obj\u0027s are pretty much convertible to anything.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Liarean","CreatedById":33431,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-26T19:57:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Winter Man\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Winter Man\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou can export to .obj from 2011 using a plugin, dunno what KSP uses but .obj\u0027s are pretty much convertible to anything.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP uses .dae files for the meshes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s compatible with most popular programs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example the free modelling program blender but also 3ds max.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3Ds max needs a plug-in to be able to export to .dae or to import it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI myself mostly use 3Ds max 2013 as I\u0027m a game design student and that program is the one we mostly use and in my opinion is the easiest.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TouhouTorpedo","CreatedById":30603,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-26T16:49:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ALILOOOONG\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ALILOOOONG\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI was wondering if anyone knows if I can use solidworks to make models for KSP? :-[ embarresed I don\\\u0027t know this but I really need help!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes you can.
