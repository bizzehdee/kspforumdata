Ever, especially with GIMP, last time I tried I got so angry I ended up writing multiple obscenities and doing what\u0027s probably my best drawing ever, a middle finger, before putting the program into a folder whose name was riddled with obscenities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I can\u0027t deal with the stress and rage of figuring this rubbish out, and don\u0027t even get me started on collision meshes, I have no clue where to start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I need some people to do some modelling and texturing for my mod, PM me and I\u0027ll give details, thank you, as I can\u0027t deal with this rubbish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for any offers to help, I appreciate it and am very grateful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beale","CreatedById":70533,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T20:42:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/3232-Part-Modding-Tutorial-1-4-Modeling\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETried Wings3D?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little plug to my own tutorial, but it\u0027s a bit of software a lot easier to use than Blender (mainly due to having a lot less features, though still more than you really ever need for KSP modding).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharkman Briton","CreatedById":148040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-14T08:10:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEh, I might give it a go, my main problem though is the texturing, modelling I\u0027m kind of okay with, but I cannot UV unwrap and am a terrible artist.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cxg2827","CreatedById":57380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-14T13:35:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sharkman Briton\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sharkman Briton\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEh, I might give it a go, my main problem though is the texturing, modelling I\u0027m kind of okay with, but I cannot UV unwrap and am a terrible artist.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was the same when I first started.

From there start messing around with a single piece of detail ( a screwhead, rivet, a seam for a panel) and just experiment with effects for those. I use Photoshop, but see if GIMP has options for adding layer styles in the stock program or via a plugin. I would say the majority of effects I have used and have seen in other textures are Outer Glow,Inner Glow, Bevel and Emboss, Drop Shadow, Inner Shadow, and Stroke.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-14T13:48:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cxg2827\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cxg2827\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI would say the majority of effects I have used and have seen in other textures are Outer Glow,Inner Glow, Bevel and Emboss, Drop Shadow, Inner Shadow, and Stroke.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery much, this.
