I have some ideas about what I\u0027d like to see if anyone is interested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething along these lines.

The wires, doodads and whatnots on the side aren\u0027t really important as much. It is going to be a smallish, surface attach part. About the size of a goo experiment. The big features I would like to see are the rotating tape and wiggling arm which will animate when the sensor is active.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as licensing, I would require that the modeling files be public with the rest of the kspi lite code on the repository and that the files be licensed cc by sa. This is to allow appropriate modifications to be made long after I and the modeler are gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor anyone who is interested, please contact me in this thread or by PM.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-09T04:23:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhat the heck, I\u0027ll make you one tomorrow \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-09T13:28:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDone (almost).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it animates \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MuM3atc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MuM3atc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eggman360","CreatedById":28064,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-15T13:29:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood god, you\u0027re like a wizard RoverDude O.o\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
