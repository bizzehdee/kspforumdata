I already have the models created, and I even imported the stock files into blender with the .mu plugin and followed that hierarchy (I believe). I\u0027m just not sure what I need to do because I\u0027ve never created these props before. Is it just as simple as writing the .mu with part tools and using the stock cfg modules? Do I need to create an animation for the throttle, or is it hardcoded? If I do need an animation, what does this animation need to be named?

So, I just need to export to .mu and try it out.

I have not caught up with all of the changes since I was last modding. I have been playing the game, just not modding. I really like the direction things have been heading; a little over a year ago modding was a lot more challenging (especially due to the lack of info then, lot more documentation now).
