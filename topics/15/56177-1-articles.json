The doors are closed in the VBA, making placing payloads inside difficult. I can reverse the animation, but then doors are open when first launching, which doesn\u0027t happen with some other cargo bays (B9 for example).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do others handle animations like this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/AKUur6g\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AKUur6g.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AKUur6g.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Porkjet","CreatedById":92433,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T00:15:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe easy way: Just wait till .23 is released.

I start with the the cargo bay open, then animate to it closing. Then, when it goes in game, it\u0027s started open by default - that\u0027s the simplest solution I can offer.
