more than just a solid color. \u00A0While the hubcap area could probably use a little bit of some edge wear, the teeth of the wheel don\u0027t really need all of that, it has a dark texture slapped on to it (not hand painted)....but it\u0027s not solid black, there are some random lighter areas. \u00A0One doesn\u0027t have to texture everything right down to every edge and pixel. \u00A0Funny thing too, it would actually take longer to texture these teeth and apply them to the surface, than it does to make them out of geometry and slap a\u00A0randomized uneven texture on them. \u00A0While they do add quite a bit of geometry to the model, I\u0027d say there would only be 4-6 instances of a wheel at a time anyways for the most part, meaning they may be a little more demanding, but lower instances of them keep it from being an issue while adding a lot visually. \u00A0This model can actually be reduced quite a bit since the inner faces between parts of the wheel are all still there, but those can also be removed. \u00A0Still, even with them, the model poly\u0027s are still well within reason. \u00A0 I\u0027ve seen a lot of people use several thousand polys or more as a base line

a care about the extra poly\u0027s, made even more futile by the fact that saving those polys might not make a lick of difference in the long run. \u00A0 \u00A0I\u0027ve also definitely seen worse

example.....traversing space. \u00A0 Will the kerbals actually be traversing around inside of the cockpit area, or will it just be a cosmetic feature that makes it seem like they could if they wanted, but don\u0027t actually do it?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsquads the one to talk to about implementing things that sound\u00A0good on paper but is useless in practice they\u0027re the ones that designed the existing cockpit interiors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022exBblIw.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022

into the vacuum of space you want to avoid haveing to go outside to reach another part of the ship and so the design of a stock-alike cockpit needs to reflect that even if there is no actual\u00A0mechanic that lets a kerbal stand up and walk around inside\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nas for design details (any one of these would do for me)...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor idea number 1\u00A0lets go with something similar to the existing mk1 nose cockpit with the recessed windows but shorter and blunter. like \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cifx7d9.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eboeing x37b\u003C/a\u003E sort of blunt, and drop the docking window and replace it\u00A0with a provision for the hatch to be in the ceiling like an \u003Ca

lighter than its stock counterpart because it is smaller but at the cost of aerodynamic efficiency, less resource storage and control wheels, and no convenient docking window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdea number 2 I\u0027d like to keep the .625m node centered but you don\u0027t need to make it look traversable. probably the best way to describe it would be a tapered conical shape with a bubble canopy on top like a tapered version of the stock inline or\u00A0the\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iV5BMJj.png?1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u00A0x24a \u003C/a\u003E(or b)\u00A0just without the flat lifting body belly. on my end\u00A0I\u0027d rig the ladder on the side just like the other cockpits and assuming it comes out 1.875m in length its stats would be roughly the same as the stock cockpits the only functional difference is the end cap size governing what looks good attached to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nidea number 3 is stat wise essentially the same as the stock inline bubble cockpit but swap out the bubble\u00A0canopy with a windowed cockpit in the style of the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YSlqQbQ.jpg?1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emk2 inline\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0and have a hatch in the roof. functionally the only difference is how I rig the kerbal to be oriented on the air lock ladder when they\u00A0go out on eva. (and maybe some users would prefer it over the bubble because of how real windows work in space)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
