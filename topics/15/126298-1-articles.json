You would put multiple empty game objects in your model, pointing out different directions, then copy this block over and over:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMODULE\u003Cbr\u003E\n{\u003Cbr\u003E\nname = ModuleGrappleNode\u003Cbr\u003E\nnodeTransformName = ArticulatedCap\u003Cbr\u003E\ndeployAnimationController = 1\u003Cbr\u003E\nnodeType = size1\u003Cbr\u003E\ncaptureRange = 0.05\u003Cbr\u003E\ncaptureMinFwdDot = 0.866\u003Cbr\u003E\ncaptureMaxRvel = 1\u003Cbr\u003E\n}\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nchanging \u0022nodeTransformName = \u0022 to point at your multiple transforms and tweaking the other parameters as required. Now... I think there\u0026#39;s a definite upward limit to the lag you want to induce with this method... Soooo you want to find the absolute minimum number of repetitions that gives you good results... maybe with upping the capture Range to make it more forgiving.... I personally would HOPE that pointing six directions was enough... but I\u0026#39;ve got no idea, really! \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPlease let us know what you find out when you try it!\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tygoo7","CreatedById":57345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T02:56:40Z","Content":"\nThanks!
