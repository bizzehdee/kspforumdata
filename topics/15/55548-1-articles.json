I have very little experience with Unity, so I guess I am not that terrible, BUT I needed a 3D modelling program, as it was suggested in a tutorial I found on YouTube, and they used Wings 3D. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I followed their tutorial, and they only made a basic tank, nothing more, so they didn\u0027t really show how to move stuff around etc. So I am wondering if any of you know how to move stuff around in Wings 3D, or is it possible to use the modelling software in Unity, or something easier to understand?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have made a basic fuel tank, textured correctly (need to adjust the width of the tank) but other than that, it is perfect. So it\u0027s not like I need help in the aspect of creating anything, I just want to make some things that look pretty \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if that made no sense, I am not good at explaining myself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks a lot\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Jordan\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"electronicfox","CreatedById":43373,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T14:46:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBlender has a tonne of tutorials on modelling, so you may be better off with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3DS Max and Maya both have free educational licences too, there are also a buttload to modelling tutorials for both of these.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never used Wings3D before so I cant say if these other tools might be better or worse, but they definitely have far superior supports.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T20:29:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022electronicfox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022electronicfox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E3DS Max and Maya both have free educational licences too, there are also a buttload to modelling tutorials for both of these.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Autodesk Education Program requires you to be an enrolled student in secondary school (high school) or taking part in a degree or certificate granting program at a higher education institution. (Or to be a faculty member of the same) If you qualify, you get a 36-month license to a lot of their products, but they will display a watermark or banner labeling them as from the student version when printed or exported, so that probably isn\u0027t going to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENever tried Wings3d myself, just a quick look shows that is should work since it has a Collada (dae) plugin, and there are a few tutorials out there on the Youtubes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI happen to use Blender and picked it up a couple of years ago starting from pretty much zero knowledge. If you\u0027re going to switch to Blender I\u0027d suggest you start off just watching intro tutorials for a few days to learn the tools and interface. And make sure you\u0027re viewing modern videos, there are lots out there for old versions which are totally different. Make sure they\u0027re at least for Blender 2.4 or higher.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T15:10:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe classic Wings3d tutorials are here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.wings3d.com/paulthepuzzles/aardvarks.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.wings3d.com/paulthepuzzles/aardvarks.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt works fine for basic KSP models, although of course it doesn\u0027t support advanced features like animations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
