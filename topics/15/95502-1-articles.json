Naturally, I\u0027ve gone off to make my own part somewhat blind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESO... what I did was take the same... object... if that\u0027s the right word, that I\u0027m using using for the part and made it a mesh collider in Unity. I do have convex selected and it looks like a mesh. But, once I connect to another part in the VAB, I can\u0027t select it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this me screwing up the mesh or is this something in the .cfg I don\u0027t get?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T12:39:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShow a screenshot of your unity scene with the collider selected.

The place of a collider is not significant as long as it\u0027s somewhere under the root game object (the one with parttools applied).

So it could be that the model loader loads the actual mesh fine, but the physics engine doesn\u0027t handle the names.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, to be sure, you should use programming-style names for objects; Alphanumeric characters only, and no spaces (you can probably get away with underscores)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso like 90degree1_25 or something similar.
