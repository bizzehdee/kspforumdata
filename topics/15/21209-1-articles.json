So you need Unity (free edition) and Partslab, and you use the 3d models and PNG textures you make in Blender and Photoshop (or whatever) and import them into unity and set them up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main difference with using Partslab is that you create the node colliders within Unity (you can convert a node_collider mesh to a unity-style node collider, so don\u0027t worry if you made one in Blender) There are a lot of advanced things you can do as well that you could not do with the old method, but those are not important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts fine to get comfortable with making DAE/PNG files work first though, and getting familiar with editing things in Blender. Rather than drawing shapes, in Blender you use prototype objects (cubes, cylinders, spheres) and sculpt your shapes out of them by selecting edges, faces or vertexes and moving them. So getting a hand on how to select specific pieces of an object and manipulating them is 90% of learning to model in Blender.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe circle-select mode you were talking about only works in Edit Mode (tab swaps between edit mode, where you can edit the faces, edges and vertex of an object) and Object mode where you apply changes to the object as a whole (like modifiers materials, etc) Right click only selects different modules (hitting A to select all objects works, as does shift\u002Bright click to add another object to your current selection)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight click (and circle select mode) are much more flexible in edit mode. On the edit bar (the bar across the bottom of the main 3d view, that swaps between Edit mode and Object mode) has 3 \u0022selection modes\u0022 where you can select either Faces (triangles, squares, though blender can handle N-sided polygons aka Ngons as well), edges, and vertices. They\u0027re the cube icons with the yellow highlights, should be pretty obvious) When in circle select mode, left-clicking adds anything in the circle to the selection, and middle-mouse removes anything in the selection from the selection. Scroll-wheel changes the size of the circle selection. Keep in mind its left click in circle select mode, where selecting is right-click everywhere else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also do special selections form the Select menu, like Ring or Loop selections, where you select one vertex or edge and then hit select Edge Loop and it selects the edges that form a loop/ring around the object (like a ring on a cylinder, for instance)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, if you mess with it a while it starts to make sense, and with experience you can do some pretty cool things just with selecting an edge loop and scaling it or moving it to morph the shape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso useful are the Transform shortcut keys. in edit mode while you have something selected, hit S to scale, R to rotate, G to Grab/Move - then use your mouse to drag the shape to the desired location. You can lock these to a single axis too, so hitting G then X causes the mouse to only drag the object along the X axis. You can also exclude an axis by using shift\u002BX or whatever (so you\u0027d hit S to scale, then Shift\u002BY to force the selection to only scale up or down on the X and Z axis, the Y scale will stay the same.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats a lot to absorb so I will stop rambling for now.

But importing the PNG, something around there went bad. Because prior, without importing it (ie: invisible parts, yay!) my part\u0027s .cfg text loaded into the game however there was no visible part to chose from and when dragged into play in VAB it was just a single green node.
