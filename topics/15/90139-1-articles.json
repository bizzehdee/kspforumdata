You\u0027ve got convex selected, and the layer is set to default which is all correct for that kind of part. Doesn\u0027t look like you\u0027ve gone over the 255 tri limit for mesh colliders, but try making a simpler object (less side, maybe 10 or 12) for the collider, or ditch the mesh and create an empty GO to apply a capsule collider to to see if that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlackFang","CreatedById":109194,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-12T22:49:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know why, but I erased the Unity project and started another blank one.

I\u0027ve had something like that happen before, but with something else entirely (not a collision mesh, but I can\u0027t remember the details now).

The \u0022normal\u0022 way for Squad-made fuel tanks, is to have 24 sides for the model, with vertices aligned to the cardinal axes, with a collision mesh that is 12-sided, with the \u003Cem\u003Esides\u003C/em\u003E (instead of the vertices) aligned to the cardinal directions. You don\u0027t have to adhere to this, of course, but doing it this way pretty much ensures that things work the way you expect in the VAB/SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CPU usage for physics goes up with each additional polygon in the collision meshes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
