Unless you really need the space on your texture its best to avoid it and leave at least 4-8 pixels distance between your polygons on the map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E You also have to take into account, that for banners or lettering, the overlapped co-ordinates are often mirrored on the other side. So things will be backwards. You actually have to mirror the UV co-ordinates of the overlapping points to prevent that. It also doesn\\\u0027t work well for non symmetrical surfaces. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E So, if you\\\u0027re going to do it.
