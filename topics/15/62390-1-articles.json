The texture for the part is just a green to white gradient. I believe that it has somethign to do with the normals, but I can not work out what.

Nice work then. As to your comment, I think both apply. I think lighting in the VAB/ SPH is restricted or limited to some extent, relative to the dynamic game state. I do encounter rendering differences between apps (Blender, Unity and KSP). I usually have to tweak my render settings to get what I want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
