I\u0027ve been able to make some great models, but whenever I use a [system dialog box](http://i.imgur.com/rS80FET.png) launched from Wings, the program freezes and becomes totally unresponsive. This happens whenever I Save As, Merge, Open, etc. Anything that prompts a file browser dialog box to appear. When I make my selection, and close the box, the program is frozen.\n\nI\u0027m running Wings3D 1.5.3. on OS X Yosemite (10.10.4). \n\nThis may be off topic, but the Wings3D forums aren\u0027t terribly active, and I know there\u0027s a good chance someone else here has had similar issues.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nFound a work around. Disabling \u0022Mac OS File Dialog\u0022 no longer causes freezing. For anyone having issues on OS X, don\u0027t use the OS X File Dialog."}]}
