That is incorrect, it\u0027s never been required. It is popular because a lot of KSP parts are animated and there aren\u0027t many free modellers that support animations. However, any other software that supports popular game file formats (Collada, FBX, Obj) etc. will work fine as well.

I have invested a lot of time using and working in Gmax only because it was affordable. I do realize it has been \u0022unsupported\u0022 for some time now, and that is a shame. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will take the advice of everyone above and (someday, perhaps soon), I will experiment with it and will update this thread. I really don\u0027t want to learn several other programs to accomplish a single task, (that being the creation of parts..). Seems I always tend to pick a program to get thouroughly immersed in to find out it\u0027s no longer used or supported. Bummer. I\u0027ve looked at Blender and Sketchup, but compared to Gmax, (in my humble opinion) they seemed \u0022cheezy\u0022.
