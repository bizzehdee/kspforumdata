Please note that this is based off engine heat. about half way through the animation is all you will see if you never get an overheat warning on your engine. after you get an over heat warning it will begin to play the rest of the animation. Keep this in mind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. You can add as many keys between the two as you want to adjust what you see in game.

Which is great if you\u0027re trying to follow the approximately 8 million tutorials that describe the old method. The procedure is pretty simple though. Set up your part and textures the same as described before. Once you have your emissive textures in place open the animation window. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where problems might arise. The animation window comes up blank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo fix this, first add an animation name by clicking somewhere in the animation window\u0027s toolbar. Then make sure the red record button is on. Physical objects can be added just by dragging them around the screen (click on one of the direction arrows), then the transform options will appear in the window. Imported animations should already display all of the objections with transforms applied to them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the other options you need to go to the \u0022Add Curve\u0022 button though. Click on that and it will give you a hierarchy arranged in the same order as in the main window. Open the tree down to the object you want to apply the emissive texture to, in this case the cone. Then open \u0022Mesh Renderer\u0022 and click the arrow to the right of the \u0022Material._Emissive Color\u0022 option, shown by the big red arrow below. That will give you the four emissive color options in the animation window and you can make key frames as described in the first post. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlay back the animation with the play button to check if it\u0027s working.

I put the mesh directly under the GameObject, though I don\u0027t think that\u0027s necessary. I put the animation component in the root mesh part. There is no animator component, I didn\u0027t add or remove one, and creating the animation in the animation window didn\u0027t add one. The only key frames I made were for the emissive color under the material for the mesh.
