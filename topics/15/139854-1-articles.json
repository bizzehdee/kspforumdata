Yesterday I left town and thus don\u0027t have my work files with me, but the question was eating at me so much I had to post. After going to see what I DID have in game so that I could share, apparently I managed to delete them off my cloud folder. So, I\u0027ll try my best to describe it so that next time I can get it done right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the lander can has two headlights, as well as windows. I want the windows to light up, as well as the two headlights, when the user hits the lights button. I was able to apply a color animation to the pod using the new Unity 5 method, and then added the two spotlights to the animation. It doesn\u0027t seem to work. In the VAB, the pod has the proper \u0022Lights On -\u0026gt; Lights Off\u0022 for the ModuleAnimateGeneric, but I also have two more sets of both \u0022Lights On\u0022 and \u0022Lights Off\u0022 buttons from the lights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere do I put the animation in Unity? I have no idea how those animation tools work. Do I have to merge the animations? Do I delete the animation line from the two ModuleLights?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Unity setup was:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWrapper GameObject\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 -\u0026gt; Lander Model (This has the animation on it..?)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 -\u0026gt; Collider\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 -\u0026gt; Spotlight1 (Does this need the animation on it?)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 -\u0026gt; Spotlight2 (Does this need the animation on it?)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 -\u0026gt; Hatch Collider\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 -\u0026gt; Airlock Collider\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-15T21:45:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif you want windows to light up at the same time as the spot lights combine them all into 1 anim, and drive with 1 ModuleLight.
