If you are indeed using the new .mu format, which means going through the new Unity3d Part Tools, you can do this;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Create your object in your modeling software, but \u003Cem\u003Edo not\u003C/em\u003E join the meshes together; for example you make an engine out of a cylinder and a cone, do not join those. Leave them as separate objects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. UV Unwrap your objects and export the maps as separate images. You may have to adjust it so it fits in the image.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Texture, (or not).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. In Unity, create a new Empty GameObject. Assign it a KSP Part Tools component.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Drag the model (Unity can read .blend files natively) onto the GameObject in the Scene Hierarchy; this will parent the model to the Part Tools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. In the Scene Hierarchy, drag your texture to the corresponding model object my expanding the Prefab. This way, each object in your model can have their own texture file, which will be converted and exported as those .mbm files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnything you don\\\u0027t know, ask.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CreationMe","CreatedById":10464,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-30T11:10:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks for the explanation but I\\\u0027m wondering how to make multiple node_colliders with this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kreuzung","CreatedById":21035,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-30T11:21:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that you don\\\u0027t even need collider meshes in Unity.

If your mesh is low poly enough you can use it as a Mesh Collider in Unity. If you want to make the collider yourself, it will show up in Unity: delete the Mesh Renderer component of your collider and replace it with a Mesh Collider. If you want multiple colliders, you can do the same for each of them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CreationMe","CreatedById":10464,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-30T11:47:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMmm I\\\u0027ll look into that.
