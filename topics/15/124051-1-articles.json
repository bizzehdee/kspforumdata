However, I have an issue with the wheels. After launching the game and going to the SPH, I can build with them, right click them, select them, etc. but after launching, the wheels move slightly \u0022inward\u0022 (of you look at the craft when looking down the runway) and the wheels become un-selectable for the rest of the time the game is running. No errors in the log either, but a warning of wheels needing to be attached to a rigidbody as usual. My wheels still work, but I just can\u0027t select them again. I have a sphere collider for \u0022collisionEnhancer\u0022, so I\u0027m not sure why I can select them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
