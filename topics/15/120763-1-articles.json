I can\u0027t make nozzles, I can\u0027t even comprehend how they make the lil\u0027 pipe details and all that...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo can anyone explain to me how to make more complex models in Blender? Mainly nozzles, maybe small pipes, but don\u0027t worry too much about those pipes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any help, I\u0027m getting very interested in this modding.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kartoffelkuchen","CreatedById":108501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T20:49:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s pretty easy. You just select the bottom face, of, for example, your cylinder and hit \u0022E\u0022. Then, you move your mouse up and down to choose the lenght of the nozzle. If you are happy, then hit enter. To make it have a conic shape, select s and rescale it to how big you want its exit diamter to be, and hit enter again to confirm. You also wanna have the inside of the nozzle, so press \u0022E\u0022 and right afterwards, hit enter. Then, you scale your extruded face a bit down, press e again, move it up, scale it down. It\u0027s as easy as that. I\u0027d recommend you to watch a few Blender tutorials, that\u0027s what I got started with. The learning curve is steep, but really, once you figured basic things out and try to make new things on your own, it starts to get really awesome! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps you a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharkman Briton","CreatedById":148040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T20:57:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, okay, theres a problem there I can\u0027t figure out though, how do I select individual face?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tristonwilson12","CreatedById":136353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T21:37:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sharkman Briton\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sharkman Briton\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOh, okay, theres a problem there I can\u0027t figure out though, how do I select individual face?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.4/Manual/Modeling/Meshes/Selecting/Faces\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.4/Manual/Modeling/Meshes/Selecting/Faces\u003C/a\u003E this might help.. good luck and cant wait to see what awesome things you can make in the future\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharkman Briton","CreatedById":148040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T08:39:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks!
