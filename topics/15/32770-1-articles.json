I have 5 separate segments, the main part, and 2 door sections on mirrored on either side. The first section needs to slide into the second, and simultaneously the second section needs to slide into the main hull. I have sketchup, blender, and unity at my disposal. Can someone either link me a tutorial, or give a quick and dirty KSP tailored walk-through?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Razchek","CreatedById":62645,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T14:57:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I did was make each door a seperate mesh and then rotate each one on the appropriate axis in the correct direction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I make doors, I usually scale the doors down by 0.01~ depending on the mesh to give it the \u0027receding\u0027 appearance before it slides to it\u0027s open position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you need a tutorial on animation?
