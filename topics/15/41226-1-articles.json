If a mod decides to consider this thread spam, just go ahead and remove it - but the reason I am creating a thread here, is because not everybody looks in all sub forums and Modelling and Texturing is relevant to my plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo first of all, this is the plugin\u0027s official thread: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/44135-0-21-x-Universe-Replacer\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/44135-0-21-x-Universe-Replacer\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, it allows you to create texture packs that replace the original stock textures of the game. The plugin is in active development, meaning more and more things will be added over time - see the \u0027Future Plans\u0027 section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently Rareden is the only one creating an actual texture pack - I know there are many people with different tastes in art and quality, so I hope to attract a couple more texture pack creators to bring some variety and more content to my plugin. If you decide to start one, PM me with a link to a public shared drop box folder or some other means of distribution and I can add it to the first post if you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apatheticjester","CreatedById":33113,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T19:15:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI figure this wouldn\u0027t be a bad place to post some resources and tips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you want to make a skybox. You need 3 things: The mod, a spheremap texture, and cubethesphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The mod, it\u0027s up there, above my post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

It\u0027s plenty large enough. You will know that it is a sphere map because details on the top and bottom will be stretched out horizontally. All sorts of spheremaps from dozens of games and science sources are available online, google image search is your friend. Make sure you limit your results to large images.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.
