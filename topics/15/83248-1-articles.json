The docking port works... but right clicking and selecting \u0027control from here\u0027 doesn\u0027t reorient the navball or the linear rcs controls to match up to the port. Is there an extra step for this I\u0027m missing? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd... to make matters even more complicated... I want to do this with a command pod next - adding an integrated inline docking port that ISN\u0027T along with the main control axis of the ship. Is there any way for one part to have the option to control from two different orientations? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArt\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-29T04:30:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes control from here work correctly for the stock linear port?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"artwhaley","CreatedById":118388,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-29T22:06:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood question.
