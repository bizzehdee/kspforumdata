The presence of the \u0022Bounds\u0022 collider helps with this sort of issue, as it gives KSP a clue where to place the vessel above the ground, which is helpful. The KF modules are built to deal with multiple wheel colldiers, suspension and wheel meshes (needed for tracks), so setting multiple legs up is not an issue. \u003Cp\u003ECheers \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two modules you need are KF ModuleWheel, which you\u0027ll want to configure with zero torque and steering curve values, along with a high rollingResistance value (using the wheel colliders for suspension simulation, not as wheels). This module handles setting up the colliders, destroying the Bounds object at start of flight, animations and just about everything control related. KFWheel handles reading suspension movement, steering, and wheel rotation, all of which you can turn off if you don\u0027t want to use it. In this case, just enable the suspension movement, set up a module for each of the feet and watch the fun. Animation might be the only area it could still do with some work, but that\u0027s not actually that hard to deal with - see nli2work\u0027s space tug and play with the variable engine retract module I built for it to see an example of funky ways you can drive an animation if needed (hint: build one and use the RCS translation keys with the engines extended and RCS turned off).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully that gives you a good overview, though I really need to document it properly!
