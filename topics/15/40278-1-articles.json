That could be the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, I\u0027m trying to make huge satellite dishes. I\u0027ve done this manually using the square 1x1 and 2x2 metal sheets. However, the part count comes to about 100 per dish. And when you are trying to attach an array of them to a space station ... FPS LAG MONSTER. So, my thought process was to take that flat, circular adapter plate and make it huge. Thus becomming the base of a sat dish. I took the larger of the two adapters, and set it to rescale=4.0. But, like I said, it never showed up. I played around with a few other settings, but didn\u0027t get it to work. I\u0027ll check the naming convention and make sure I didn\u0027t forget it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: Here\u0027s a pic of what I\u0027m trying to re-create using less parts. The single arm that contains the 3 dishes is just shy of 400 parts. I\u0027ve had to de-orbit it since then in order to try to get more things operational on and around the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lzyQy8c.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lzyQy8c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E((edit))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s the part.
