Simple stuff; just colourize certain bits and add the texture line to any MODEL configs to replace the stock texture with the edited one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0022Jet Engines.dds\u0022 texture is giving me trouble with the Goliath engine. First, the original\u00A0file name has a space in it, so I\u0027m surprised this even works at all: (Note: Module Manager syntax)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\n@MODEL\n{\n\t%texture = Jet Engines, [path]/JetEnginesOx\n}\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor all\u00A0Mk1 jet\u00A0engines in Squad/Parts/Engine/jetEngines, this seems to work. For the Goliath analogue, I\u0027m getting an NRE telling me it can\u0027t find any reference to an object. The game loads but the part fails to load because of the missing texture. That\u0027s interesting in itself because the\u00A0first time I saw a texture failure I could still get a translucent outline of a part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m editing the texture in GIMP, saving the images\u00A0with DXT5 compression and having it create mipmaps for me. When I go through the Module Manager database afterward, I can find the modded part and verify that the edits I made are correct. The resulting DDS files have the same size and apparent characteristics of the originals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of the parts in Squad/parts/engine/jetEngines use the same single \u0022Jet Engines.dds\u0022 texture file. All of my modded parts from there\u00A0should use the same edited texture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
