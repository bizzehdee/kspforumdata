The problem I\u0027m having is that I see most people using mbm. files to store their textures and I have no idea what mbm. files are.\n\nSo my questions are....\n\n1.) How do you make an mbm. file? \n\nAnswer: \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Assuming you have [Unity](http://unity3d.com/unity/download) and the [KSP PartTools 0.23 package](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65356) installed on your computer, PartTools will allow you to export textures from TGA/PNG formats to MBM.\n\n2.) Are they used to store more than one texture? \n\nAnswer: \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Each MBM file can only have one texture, but you can reference multiple MBM files per part (just as long as each mesh only uses one texture\n\nNext Question:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So what your saying is that if a part has 3 meshes that make up 1 model then I can use 3 MBM files (each holding 1 texture for each mesh) to give the 3 seperate meshes a texture? But then how do I tell the MBM file to work for that certain mesh?\n\nAnswer: \n\n\u003E \n\u003E You can, but don\u0027t have to - a small set of texture files can be shared amongst a larger number of meshes. Just remember that each mesh can only use one material at a time.\n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E But then how do I tell the MBM file to work for that certain mesh?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E You don\u0027t tell the MBM anything, because it\u0027s just an image file\\*.\n\u003E \n\u003E When exporting your part through Unity/KSP PartTools, the resulting .MU model file will already contain information defining which texture/material gets applied to which mesh.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\*In fact, the MBM texture format isn\u0027t compulsory, because KSP also supports PNG/TGA part textures. PNG is popular amongst add-on authors because they can be easily edited without having to go through the format conversion shenanigans. The reason MBM exists in the first place is because PNGs need to be uncompressed before loading, whereas MBM\u0027s don\u0027t.\n\n3.) How do you open the mbm. files or do you need a converter tool to change it from mbm. to JPEG? \n\nAnswer: \n\n\u003E \n\u003E The MBM file format is proprietary to SQUAD, and no third-party editor can directly open/edit them. \n\u003E \n\u003E That being said, there is a workaround using [taniwha\u0027s Blender .mu import/export add-on](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43513-Blender-mu-import-export-addon):\n\u003E \n\u003E - Import a KSP MU part model file in Blender using the aforementioned add-on\n\u003E \n\u003E - In the Image/UV Editor pane, you will find the texture images, which can be re-exported to PNG/TGA\n\u003E \n\u003E - Edit the PNG/TGA textures using a graphics program like Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Fireworks\n\u003E \n\u003E - Re-export them back to MBM using Unity and KSP PartTools\n\nOther questions will be asked when I can think of them.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-01T23:31:40Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2015 11:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Recognize-Me-**"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T21:13:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 1.)
