It even inspired me to try to fabricate some own parts, but as you all already guessed, my enthusiasm and work were soon confronted with problem I am unable to solve alone. And thus I turn to you with plea for help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMy vision is to create parts for construction of cargo (space)plane.\u003C/strong\u003E I don\u0027t want animated cargo bay like space shuttle had, just cargo deck like transportation planes have. I am absolute begginer with almost no knoledge. But thankfully this forum and youtube is full of very helpful guides. I managed to model and export part into KSP, everything to my liking. \u003Cstrong\u003EBut I don\u0027t know how to handle collider mesh for hollow object when it must be convex.\u003C/strong\u003E I\u0027ve tried three aproaches, but niether one works:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I made standard convex mesh collider and allowed collision in part.cfg. I still can\u0027t place stuff inside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I made U shaped mesh collider for floor and sides (so I can attach wings), but Unity makes it full (convex), so it takes more than half of my cargo bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I made mesh collider just for floor part. It sort of \u0022works\u0022 but I cant attach wings on side of plane, just on the lowest part where collider is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can find\u003Cstrong\u003E very illustrative images\u003C/strong\u003E of my problem in my dropbox \u003Cstrong\u003Ehere\u003C/strong\u003E: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6o7b4oquo0vgpqr/AAC9lK5V1NJGE2U67Q7m9j4Qa\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/6o7b4oquo0vgpqr/AAC9lK5V1NJGE2U67Q7m9j4Qa\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf someone of you would be so kind and explained me, how to make it functional and in correct way I would be very grateful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJenda \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.: Sorry for grammar and typos, English is not my native tongue.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-28T22:58:14Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2014 10:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Jenda\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T19:05:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere you go a wire frame of a cargo bay just finished, each color is a separate part, this allows you to create a space in the middle, it starts as one part then it is cut up to create what you see in the image, this is then imported into unity and has colliders fitted to all the parts, do note however that you should use simple primitive colliders as much as possible, it helps avoid kraken attacks, but its not really necessary, you can use convex colliders if you wish, in this case the doors floor, and center of the end panels are box colliders everything else would be a convex mesh collider\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ukksu1v.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Ukksu1v.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jenda","CreatedById":117041,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T22:55:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThank you, dear sir!\u003C/strong\u003E You saved my day.
