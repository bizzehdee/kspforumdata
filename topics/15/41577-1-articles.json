Go into unity and create an empty game object. Drag and drop your objects onto this empty game object and fix their rotation within it. When you parent objects in unity, their placement is relative to the parent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jdsutton","CreatedById":74265,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T21:32:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERead this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/319802/rotation-when-importing-from-blender.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://answers.unity3d.com/questions/319802/rotation-when-importing-from-blender.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"elind21","CreatedById":66283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T01:41:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei figured it out. you have to rotate -90, then APPLY the rotation and rotate it back\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T11:13:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, you\u0027ll need to freeze/reset/bake all transforms in modelling programs, KSP has issues with model-wide transforms and they need to be baked into the vertex co-ordinates instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sethnizzle","CreatedById":22985,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T11:18:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould someone please \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eexplain\u003C/span\u003E with a few more details on how to fix this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bluegobln","CreatedById":59640,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T23:50:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould you please explain how your problem differs from the above problem so we know where to start?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem seems very clearly explained, and the solution seems adequately if simply explained as well.
