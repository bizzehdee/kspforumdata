Note that to do this you\u0027ll need to re-import the model in the rotated state, as I\u0027ve found just applying the rotation in Unity itself doesn\u0027t actually have any effect once you get in-game (you may find it works though).\n\nI really should set some time aside to write a blog post about orienting parts to work with symmetries, as there\u0027s a specific way that is needed for both node and surface attach that not many modders get right first time."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T22:27:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E From those pictures it looks to me like you need to rotate your part to have its mounting plate be on the bottom in Unity rather than to the side.

Symmetry is just fine now. Thank you so much!\n\nThough just a small question. My part can store 2.0 units of \u003Cresource\u003E. I want it to only store 2 units of \u003Cresource\u003E. Why is the extra zero important? I can set it to store 1.5 units of \u003Cresource\u003E in the editor.
