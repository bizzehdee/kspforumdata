KSP 1.0 uses DDS files.\n\nHow do I get DDS files from Unity? Is there a Unity plugin?\n\nOr, do I convert TGA files to DDS? If so, will KSP know to use the DDS file via the part,cfg \u0022model=\u0022 statement?"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T02:07:10Z","Content":"The exported model files have texture names in their metadata, which KSP can read. However KSP only cares about the name before the file extension, not what the extension is or anything like that. So even if the model says \u0022myTexture.png is its texture file, KSP will load myTexture.dds if its in the same place.\n\nYou can also override textures via the MODEL {} node in the config of course if you need to reuse a texture from another folder or whatever.\n\nSo basically you can export it as TGA, PNG, MBM or whatever and then convert it to DDS. There\u0027s a KSP-specific tool to do this automatically: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98672-WIN-KSP-to-DDS-texture-converter](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98672-WIN-KSP-to-DDS-texture-converter)\n\nIts a very slick program. I converted several hundred textures from my mod in one batch using the program, it did any flipping or sizing needed and even deleted the old files.(its optiional)\n\nThat should be all you need."},{"CreatedByName":"Apollo13","CreatedById":74572,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T04:44:11Z","Content":"@Tiberion: thank you.
