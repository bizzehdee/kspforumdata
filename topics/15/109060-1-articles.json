For the stock radial decouplers, think of the little frame left on the tank; that\u0027s the anchor. Note that the anchor isn\u0027t persistent, if you save and load or swap far away, the debris will be despawned.\n\nThat is the basics of the decouplers. I\u0027ll make another reply with some for heatshields.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAgain there\u0027s nothing inside the model for heatshields, their function is all in the code and defined in the config.\n\n MODULE\n\n {\n\n name = ModuleAblator\n\n ablativeResource = Ablator\n\n lossExp = -9000\n\n lossConst = 20\n\n pyrolysisLossFactor = 10000\n\n reentryConductivity = 0.01\n\n ablationTempThresh = 500\n\n }\n\n RESOURCE\n\n {\n\n name = Ablator\n\n amount = 200\n\n maxAmount = 200\n\n }\n\nand this line somewhere in the config:\n\nthermalMassModifier = 0.001\n\nSomeone else can give you better details on the math here, but the short version is:\n\nthe MassModifer makes it easier for your shield to heat up, otherwise it heats too slowly to heat up thus reach the ablator threshold (500 degrees as set in the config above) - Once it reaches that it begins to use the Ablator resource and also begin dumping heat out of the part rather than to continue to heat up and pass it along up to whatever is being shielded.\n\nWhile the ablation is occurring, the game is using a \u0022shader\u0022 to darken the texture on your part to mimic the burn marks, you don\u0027t need a special texture or animation for it, though you might be able to tweak it some to get it to look right (for instance, high specularity looks a bit odd when burnt)\n\nThat should definitely get you started. Others can fill in more details.\n\nEdit: Fancy auto-merging of replies, its all one post now ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"JewelShisen","CreatedById":71737,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T16:42:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \\*snip\\*\n\nSo then if I made a part that radially decouples I don\u0027t need anything special in the model or Unity and it will just come off of the ship with nothing left on it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T19:12:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So then if I made a part that radially decouples I don\u0027t need anything special in the model or Unity and it will just come off of the ship with nothing left on it?\n\nYeah if you don\u0027t create an anchor part, it\u0027ll just come off without leaving debris behind.
