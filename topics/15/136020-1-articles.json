I need to snap a single surface of box collider to mesh vertex (on single axis ofcourse, as moving collider surface is already constrained to single axis).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know of press-and-hold V key to get into snapping mode, and using Shift key to display and manipulate collider surface handles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, snapping mode only \u0022wants\u0022 to do vertices of mesh, not the displayed handles of coliider surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[RESOLVED] : I apologise for my \u0022dumbness\u0022. I forgot that Unity 4.2.2 (the recommended version for setting up and exporting KSP part models) does not support multiple collider primitives per mesh. I arranged multiple mesh colliders for a hollow part i\u0027m designing. I was just trying to use as much box colliders to reduce strain on physics engine. Also, when i was just starting to learn about KSP part modeling, i used Unity 4.5.2 (not sure) that did allow multiple colliders per mesh but KSP would not load such models, afterwards i downgraded to 4.2.2 and figured out what was going on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-05T12:46:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2016 12:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by fatcargo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESOLVED\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
