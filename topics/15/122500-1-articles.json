Your window is 16 divisons around, basically in a 8x8 grid, and you are transitioning to 2x2 grid, by a factor of 4. You need at least a 4x4 grid (See LandeTLS\u0027s solution); mine examples transition from 12x12 or 6x6 to 5x5 grid base. All the above options still have artifacts around the corners, though much less noticeable. Ideally you want 1:1 flow of polygons while maintaining similar sized quads as much as possible, triangles sparingly and avoid nGons, they should be solved with quads and triangles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaven\u0027t used Wings3D for a long while, but from what I remember it\u0027s pretty skimpy on non-destructive modeling options... like Max\u0027s modifier stack or the Blender modifiers mentioned earlier. For something like this, hard surface modeling where you want precision, Wings3D may prove somewhat lacking. I\u0027d say the main take away is stick to quads wherever possible and maintain similar sized faces. Flowing from higher density to lower density geometry will give you artifacts unless it\u0027s on a perfectly flat surface... the greater the difference and curvature of the surface, the worse the artifacts. 1 to 1 is ideal; 2 to 1 can be acceptable (can still see the artifacts where triangles pinch), 3 or 4 to 1 (your initial example) is too much. What that means is if you plan to stick to low poly, 1 to 2k ish, you have to sacrifice roundness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe window pane itself is less problematic unless you want it to be a continuous mesh with the the pod\u0027s hull.

First the sides of the main part is increased to 48 sides. Then the window is decreased to 12 sides. Then the window is cut out from a section of a 96 sided base which is reduced to 48 around its sides. This gives that little bit extra curve tho doing it this way is a bit overkill. Then the top and bottom are completly seperate 24 sided pieces that are intersecting slightly with the 48 sided base (the important thing here is that the top is intersecting at an angle of 90 degrees otherwise it would be very apparent that they are not attached. I forgot to mention that i in addition to extruding that extra edge inwards on the 48 sided piece i also scaled the original edge outward a little bit and the outer edge of the 24 sided top down a bit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9yFzV-G4YPzN0l0bmVxU0dSLUU/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EObj is here\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethere will always be some minor artifacts in these types of topologies unless you perfectly match the cutout with the base topology(for 16 sides on that scale that would be in the order of 96 sides) or use detached geometry for the windows. i think most of the solutions posted in this thread would hold up ingame with textures and especcially with a diffuse shader. you can test it quickly out by using a autounwrap(like cylindrical\u002Bplanar for the top if your sw has those) applying a simple tiling texture and checking it out ingame\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: damnit... screwed up the window spacing again. But the workflow should be fine. I did try a few other types of flow. Some that where posted here and some i thought of myself. but this was the one that i found made the least artifacts. One problem as i found during expetimentation with blender and 3dsmax is that they both use by default polygon based objects (as opposed to mesh objects) and the shading interpolation is slightly better on those. But when you export to unity(atleast as obj) they get converted to mesh objects. The result is that inside max/blender the objects can look very good but once in unity they do not look quite as nice anymore. Luckily max can also handle mesh objects so what i did was convert a few different examples to meshes and check out how they looked in comparison to one another. Lets just say the difference was much more than i originally thought. Not sure if blender handles mesh objects internally or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-10T09:37:16Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2015 09:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by landeTLS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InsaneDruid","CreatedById":137849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T08:32:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Beale, try my Flow with the Trick mentioned above.
