Is there a way to rotate the entire animation so that I can have the part facing the (Blender) -X direction? I tried childing everything to an empty, and it works, but when I put the part in KSP it is not rotated the correct way in the part list and SPH, and the node is in a weird spot.."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T20:24:22Z","Content":"My understanding and experience is that Blender\u0027s animation keyframes record the *absolute* positions of your mesh(es), irrespective of any later reorientation of your model.\n\nIf your animation is relatively simple, you re-key (i.e. redo) the animation in Unity using the model\u0027s final orientation.\n\nIf your animation is complex, the best bet is to orient the model and animation in its final configuration in Blender."},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T20:26:35Z","Content":"Rotate it 90 degrees in Unity before writing?

The animation is relatively complex (contra-rotating disks all rotating to form a 90 degree angle) so I\u0027ll try what lo-fi suggested and see if that does it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Quiznos323","CreatedById":114900,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T05:29:47Z","Content":"So I got them to work and now they are in game and rotated properly, thanks! Some other issues I\u0027m having though: \n\n1. Is it possible to create an effect on engine shutdown where the thrust gradually decreases as opposed to instant 0 thrust? engineDecelerationSpeed does this when running, but when the engine is \u0022Shut Down\u0022 or \u0022Toggled\u0022 the thrust goes to 0.\n\n2. Neither the intake nor FSplanePropellerSpinner module are working on this part, and I can\u0027t figure out why.. the intake has it\u0027s \u002BZ facing out, and I believe that the propeller spinner object is supposed to be \u002BX facing out, which I have it set as.\n\nEdit: Fixed the intake.\n\n![rsw0h5Wh.png](http://i.imgur.com/rsw0h5Wh.png)\n\n3. Is there a way to have an animation start on engine activation and deactivation? Right now the forward fan part above has a separate button to open the doors, when I would like to open and close then based on the state of the engine.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-20T18:28:44Z\u0022 title=\u002202/20/2015 06:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Quiznos323**"}]}
