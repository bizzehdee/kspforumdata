I did that in the beginning until some pointed out (I forget who, apologies) that Unity, at least 5.4 anyway, will work straight from your .blend file. I work on the models directly from my Models folder in the Assets subfolder, double clicking them in unity opens them in blender. I\u0027ve been doing it a lot lately to retrospectively add lighting arrangements/meshes to existing parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA personal aside, I\u0027ve struggled to get \u0027thrustTransform\u0027 axes from blender to play nice (especially as blender doesn\u0027t like multiples with the same name but Unity is fine with it). I make all the model stuff in Blender, animations etc, but create and parent the GameObject in Unity\u00A0(in this case thrustTransform)\u00A0 to the relevant mesh afterward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
