That being said... I believe I have Unity set up correctly as well as Blender. I have played around with Blender enough to feel okay with the actual modeling portion of creating something. My problem is EVERYTHING else. The information in all the threads that I searched through seems to contradict each other or outdated. I need help getting my model from Blender into KSP. I\u0027ve got the model in Unity as well as what I thought was a UV map/texture. I copied a part.cfg file and edited it to fit my simple part. I can even see my part in the menu in KSP. The problem I\u0027m having is the part is invisible and won\u0027t attach anywhere. Is there anyone willing to walk me through the process of actually creating something from beginning to end. I can probably work it out on my own again after I can get through the process at least once.
