All is well until i get to start the effects portion of the set up and i find something amiss with the particle emitter component,\u00A0 although it can be applied correctly the directional values are missing the only functional direction being X. I\u0027m using the part tools as found in Porkjets part overhauls and everything else I\u0027ve checked is there and functional, so am i missing something or is this a problem known or unknown?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022AHfJoy4.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AHfJoy4.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kurld","CreatedById":79950,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-09T23:33:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may have figured this out already but the size of the text boxes in the inspector pane do weird things when you drag it way out like that. \u00A0I was seeing the same thing until I made that panel more narrow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-11T15:23:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222845115\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022150300\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221478734420\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002279950\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kurld\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 09/11/2016 at 11:33 PM, Kurld said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may have figured this out already but the size of the text boxes in the inspector pane do weird things when you drag it way out like that. \u00A0I was seeing the same thing until I made that panel more narrow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi yes figured it out, not too unhappy to use 5.2. instead of 5.4 though. and 5.2 does exactly the same, you have to have the inspector window sized just right for the value positions to display correctly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
