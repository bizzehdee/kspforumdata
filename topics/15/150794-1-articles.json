What else can I do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m trying to do an unwrapping/unrolling spiral - how could I get it without treating the spiral as dozens of objects and managing each of them across a lot of keyframes (whenever next segment begins unrolling and the angle of rotation of the whole changes)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steedcrugeon","CreatedById":168050,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-25T11:43:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have split them into segments (like a centipede) what worked for my 12 panel comms (it is stored in a small cubby and when\u00A0\u0027deployed\u0027\u00A0the 12 panels unfurl in a counter clockwise fashion, staggered apart from each other\u00A0to avoid fouling, before sliding back their respective amount\u00A0to create a smooth single dish) antenna might work for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use \u0027constraint\u0027 in blender along with plain axes and correctly \u0027parenting\u0027 parts, fixed a set pivot point (which is easier for my example as its a collective simply rotation) and then set the keyframes for only a few points such as when they start, then the final rotation position then their final translation position. I did have to set these keyframes on each of the individual pieces of\u00A0the part but I think that is unavoidable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously what you are trying to do is not quite as simple as all that. However I think (if using the segmented section approach) it could be achieved by using multiple constraints on each segment to get it to work, if you give\u00A0the first\u00A0segment a \u0027plain axis\u0027 at each end, say pivot A and pivot B, parent the segment to\u00A0Pivot A, parent pivot A to the main body of whatever you are attaching it to and then parent\u00A0pivot B to the segment. Each subsequent segment\u00A0gets a\u00A0pivot B\u00A0so each child segment get \u0027parented\u0027 to the pivot B of the segment before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m pretty sure (but can\u0027t test it on this machine) that if you setup each segment to the rotation you wanted it to be at when stowed and stored the keyframe, then put each segment at the rotation you would want it to be extended and recorded the keyframes there then blender would sort the rest out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAmendment\u003C/strong\u003E: \u003Cem\u003EI think I may have missed part of the original question, as to whether this could be done for a single part I am unsure (I would not know how to achieve it with a single spiralled mesh). Should you choose the multiple mesh route I hope that I may have been able to shed some light on a possible solution. I personally construct things in a mechanical fashion and try to think how a thing could be realised with current techniques.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-25T11:47:43Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2016 11:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by steedcrugeon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InsaneDruid","CreatedById":137849,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-25T12:32:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can use Armatures and Bones.
