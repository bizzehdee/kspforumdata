If you do open with mipmaps, edit the program \u0026 resave with the originals then you\u0027ve only edited one part of a multi-part image, so that\u0027s not what you\u0027re after. The \u0022Decode xxxxx\u0022 thing is probably fine.\n\nAs for saving, if you\u0027re modifying an existing file then load it into something that can give you info first like irfanview, and copy that. Generally I would expect simple images to be DXT1 and things with alpha channels to use DXT5."},{"CreatedByName":"SkyWest1218","CreatedById":139209,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T16:49:20Z","Content":"I\u0027ve gotten good results by exporting using DXT3 compression with mipmaps enabled."}]}
