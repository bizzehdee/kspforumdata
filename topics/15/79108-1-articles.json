When the player selects the part and \u0022turns on the light\u0022 the glass should glow and cast light in a cartoonish but realistic way. My inspiration is the bac9 aerospace pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got my parts and animations laid out in Unity and when I run the animation in Unity everything does what I expect it to do (this isn\u0027t my first part to behave this way). The problem comes when I load up KSP and try to test the part in game. One of two things happens:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The part has the \u0022enable light\u0022 option but nothing animates when I push it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The model fails to load entirely. The config loads but not the model. Deleting the animation fixes the load issue but, of course, I\u0027m left without an animation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe difference between this part and one I\u0027ve done in the past is this new one also includes a built in RCS module where the old part only had the light module. I\u0027m inclined to blame myself or Unity and not KSP. When I remove the animation the part loads fine even with the light module still intact in the config (it just points to nothing). Furthermore the lights are glowing okay in game; I simply can\u0027t turn them on and off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T02:41:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehard to say without looking at the logs. first place I\u0027d check is to make sure the module is calling the correct animation in your MU file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Echeck KSP_Data/output_log.txt and do a search for the part that fails to load, usually you\u0027ll see some error message that gives you a clue where to look.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
