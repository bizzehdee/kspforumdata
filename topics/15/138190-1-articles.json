I\u0027ve tried exporting the the texture as mbm, png and tga and needless to say reloaded all the modules after applying changes. Right now I have a cfg, an .mu and \u00A0an .mbm file in GameData/MyParts/parts/tank2 directory.

Your parts should be within reasonable scale to it. As said, if its to big or too small it will look like its invisible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
