I know there is also the wierd thing with those holes at the front of the MK2 cockpit and whatnot that should be monopropelient holes to help stop the craft. but they were not put on. Which is a shame. they should really go back and add all the stuff that was never put in the game that was supposed to. Most of them would be insanely useful. I\u0027m tired of having to create bidirectional stuff to slow my ship when most of my ship parts should already have a means to do it. There are alot of things that should be in the game already but aren\u0027t. It looks like they stopped halfway through with most of the objects in the game and never made stuff work. I bet they originally planned to have much more complicated and realistic software to stop the ship and control movement. Probably to act like real craft. How does every game start out that way then they never do it. It\u0027s not like in this game there is no realistic version to model after. they could probably even get a simplified code from nasa or the form of it. There alot less excuse with it being based on real life analogs. There should be tons more stuff in this game. We should get real \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E type stuff like the real shuttles and stuff had. Almost totally realistic docking procedures etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I think the existing parts need to be hashed out fully also. Isn\u0027t there alot of automation in real spacecraft. Add that stuff in then focus on making more realistic missions to do so there is something to do in the game. Model everything more after how real spacecraft and missions work and add in things reflecting real missions or planned missions. The games controls are all simple simply because there is nothing in the game to do. Which is pretty silly as we have a whole host of real world analogs to model. This game should be full of things to do. How about more realistic experiments. Put in walking in stations and have it where you actually grow plants and run experiments and get results etc. Same thing with more analysis of the environment on planets. Anything and everything that can be thought of. This game needs more dimensions added to it.
