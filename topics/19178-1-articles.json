I\u0027ve started tikering a bit, and realized just how difficult it is to build a proper rocket ship in the process. :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter being frustrated that I couldn\u0027t configure exact values for the position of, say, fins (much easier to take 360 degrees, divide by 3, and place fins at that exact spot than fiddle around with a track pad on a laptop trying to place things just right), I discovered the concept of mods, which are pretty cool. I was looking specifically at the Soyuz mod under \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspaceprogram.net/kerbal-space-program-mods#packs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere \u003C/a\u003E, when I realized that parts are just plaintext config files where you can set values, assuming you know the API.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there anywhere I could get access to the API for building out a ship? The mod I downloaded, for example, had pictoral instructions showing all of the parts necessary - but I can\u0027t just build one that tall in my vehicle assembly building using the mouse, so clearly I need to just describe it via a config file. Are there example config files I can download that describe entire ships, based on a specific parts configuration?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if this is obvious, it\u0027s just a rather broad forum to search, and Google wasn\u0027t being particularly helpful when I started looking for things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-13T11:24:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAfter being frustrated that I couldn\u0027t configure exact values for the position of, say, fins (much easier to take 360 degrees, divide by 3, and place fins at that exact spot than fiddle around with a track pad on a laptop trying to place things just right)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the top left of the viewport in the VAB are two circular buttons.
