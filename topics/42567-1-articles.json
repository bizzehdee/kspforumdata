Is this possible? Because normally when I try and launch another ship after that it will clear the launchpad...maybe the colony ship will have to be off the launch pad? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E Just confused\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-15T17:11:45Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2013 05:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Arwrock\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESOLVED!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T13:16:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Arwrock\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Arwrock\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBecause normally when I try and launch another ship after that it will clear the launchpad...maybe the colony ship will have to be off the launch pad? \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s exactly that, you have to drive/fly anything off the pad. What counts as \u0022launchpad\u0022 is the raised circular area that the actual pad is on. Once you get something outside of that you can go to space center and launch something else just fine. You can get to your craft/vehicle from your tracking station, as you would with any ship in space/elsewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T13:45:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJohnno beat me to it. Exactly correct...you have to have whatever structure you want to establish off the raised circular area. Same goes for the raised area for the runway. I\u0027ve used this trick to set down ground beacons around KSP before (the notion being to have a marker for precision landing attempts, which has yet to work. Eyeballing it only gets you so far...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve considered setting up a network of beacons around the runway...might make spaceplane landing simpler if I ever get around to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arwrock","CreatedById":66402,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T17:06:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for posting, I actually figured it out last night, but thanks for the quick response.
