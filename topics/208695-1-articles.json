I dont like the weird stuff RP-1 adds. But I was noticing something very weird, I recreated a rocket from a tutorial that I found on YouTube and my first stage engine had half the Delta-V of the YouTube guys rocket. I could get mine about 3/5 of the way to orbit. Idk why. please. someone help me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-23T20:49:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhow can we help you if we don\u0027t know how your rocket was made and what engine you used? post pictures and describe your problem more precisely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe simplest explanation, though, would be that the guy on youtube was seeing vacuum deltaV, and you was seeing sea level deltaV. vacuum deltaV is higher, especially with a vacuum optimized engine\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-24T16:13:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout any specifics it\u0027s very hard to give you any concrete answers. Screenshots of your rocket in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E with (MechJeb!) delta-V displayed and a link to said video would help the most.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere could be a number of reasons why you\u0027re getting less delta-V than the video:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nDifferent versions of KSP/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/related mods like RealFuels. Not so long ago some additional realism was added in the form of engine residuals- fuel in the tanks that the engines can\u0027t use- which means you\u0027ll lose a little bit of burn time when acceleration is greatest and so has a disproportionate impact on delta-V. Other variations exist between different versions of mods and even between versions of KSP.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nVacuum versus surface delta-V. Atmospheric delta-V is always lower because the air gets in the way of the rocket exhaust, reducing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E and thrust; you might be looking at surface delta-V whereas in the video it\u0027s showing vacuum delta-V.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDifferent engine configs. Most engines in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E have more than one available config to reflect upgrades and improvements to the engines made over time. If you\u0027re using the first available config for the engine but the video is using an upgraded one with better stats, that could explain the lack of delta-V.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDifferent fuel tanks. There\u0027s more than one type of fuel tank in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E and they can make a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ehuge\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0difference to delta-V: balloon tanks are the lightest and have the highest mass fraction (ratio of wet:dry mass) so give you the most delta-V, then integral structure tanks, then separate structure tanks, then service module tanks; this is further complicated by the different materials that can be used for each tank type -some of the best separate structure tanks will outperform early integral tanks- and by tank pressurisation for pressure-fed engines such as the AJ-10 which adds a lot of dry mass. Make sure you\u0027re using the proper tanks.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDifferent propellants and ratios. The RD-0105, RD-58, F-1, LR-89 and Merlin all use kerosene and liquid oxygen as propellants, but the proportions of kerosene and liquid oxygen\u00A0can vary considerably; the RD-107/108 run on kerosene, liquid oxygen and HTP but\u00A0they use slightly different propellant mixes even though they\u0027re almost identical. Make sure you\u0027ve got the right mix for your specific engine or you\u0027ll be carrying fuel (or oxidiser) that your engine can\u0027t use, adding to the \u0022dry\u0022 mass since it isn\u0027t burnt and so reducing delta-V.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"10_Points","CreatedById":220408,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-27T22:39:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh.
