However, after discovering @Nertea\u0027s equally \u003Cem\u003Ebeautiful\u003C/em\u003E, \u003Cem\u003Edrop-dead gorgeous\u003C/em\u003E ReStock mod for spacecraft parts, I couldn\u0027t help but want something a bit more artistically coherent, both with that and internally, and that led me to discover he\u0027d also made two other mods - Near Future and Far Future Technologies, with the latter providing some engines close to the highest-performing fusion engines in Interstellar Extended (one engine has an Isp of 1 050 000 s, while Interstellar has 1 500 000 s.).\u00A0 And I was instantly made a fan, too - the mechanics are much more realistic (especially the thermal mechanics) and less quirky/buggy as well as cleaner (e.g. everything is powered with, perhaps large, amounts of ElectricCharge, instead of having odd redundant types of electric power like \u0022Megajoules\u0022 and \u0022Kilowatt Hour\u0022 which are just ways to denominate larger amounts of energy), though unfortunately his seems to be missing a Persistent Thrust analogue for very long burns using the fusion engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis leads me to on the overall right now be using the following combination:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nKSP v1.12.3\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGalaxies Unbound and dependencies (i.e. Kopernicus)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nReStock and ReStock Plus (those 5 m parts are indispensable for building huge craft)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNear Future and Far Future Technologies\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSystem Heat\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTAC Life Support\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDeepFreeze\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E (to bolt the massive vessels together in orbit)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI included the last two because I also wanted \u003Cem\u003Eeven moar realism\u003C/em\u003E, and that gets me to the following interesting quandary. To keep things realistic, I wanted to throw a ship at a star system that will take 40 years or more to get there, and that means putting those Kerbals explicitly on ice (I always \u0022imagined\u0022 them to in my head when you use \u0022time warp\u0022 but this mod combo I like because it makes that more explicit) via the DeepFreeze for the duration. The trick, though, is that once you freeze them all, \u003Cem\u003Ethere is nothing left in control of the craft\u003C/em\u003E and so it is impossible to start the engines, particularly at the far end where you have to flip the craft around to brake, which at 413 000 Gm(!) is far beyond any communication antenna\u0027s range to even send a signal to thaw the crew, much less perform the braking maneuver, and \u0022daisy chaining\u0022 satellites into the void between the two stars would be intolerably lengthy, if even possible at all (even at 100 Gm intervals, which might be possible with some of the biggest antennas, that\u0027s 4130 satellites!). In Interstellar, this was handled via the \u0022IHAL\u0022, which I\u0027ve seen some challenged as an \u0022overpowered\u0022 piece of kit, but to me it seems its \u0022robotic crew member\u0022 functionality is just what you need to do this - you need \u0022someone\u0022 to wake the crew at least, much less begin the deceleration process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what I\u0027m wondering about is: how can one pull this off? It seems I\u0027d need an extra mod, but short of trying to rip the IHAL out of Interstellar, is there some other that might work, and perhaps be \u0022cleaner\u0022?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondarily, I wonder if there is a Persistent Thrust-type implementation for @Nertea\u0027s engines, because even with max physics warp I estimated it will take multiple real-life days to accelerate the large craft to the required 1 000 000 m/s cruising speed and I don\u0027t feel like having KSP running in the bkg of my computer for that long in case I wanna do something else that needs a reboot and might lead to loss of the game due to forgetting it was running.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Oh yeah and if you say \u0022warp drives\u0022 - I\u0027ve thought about them; I just wanna see if a \u0022slow boat\u0022 mission is possible. Also I\u0027m not sure what the most aesthetic and mechanically clean warp drive mod available is since there seem to be several competing ones.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(P.S.

I also was thinking of multiple vessels (esp. if one is trying to send more than just a crew, e.g. sending rovers and bases and the like - have a separate ship for each element). to minimize the per-vessel payload mass. I further just discovered that topping the stack with a regular probe core (RC-001S RGU) actually gives enough fully autonomous control to at least thaw and freeze a Kerbal; not sure if that\u0027s a bug or a feature but it seems logical enough so I\u0027ll take it. However, the thrust bit is a difficult one. Right now it\u0027s gonna take me what looks like about 1 Ms (~11.6 Days) \u003Cem\u003Ereal life time\u003C/em\u003E to thrust up to 1000 km/s and I can\u0027t physics warp much without the craft destabilizing due to lag. Really making me miss KSP IE\u0027s persistent thrust. I might fuss with the salt water engine; not sure. It looks like this set of mods requires a different play attitude; maybe less thinking about sending Kerbals back and more about one-way trips and base establishment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-02-03T04:12:13Z\u0022 title=\u002202/03/2022 04:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 3, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by shimmy00\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Axelord FTW","CreatedById":1896,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-03T09:43:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFFT\u0027s end-tier engines (like the frisbee AM-LH2 engine) really are badly matched to a game like KSP, where ships are a collection of independently calculated parts.
