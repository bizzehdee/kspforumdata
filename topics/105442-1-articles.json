If the craft cannot radiate all this away (very unlikely, you need high emissivity, while most parts have just average), then you will begin to heat up. The amount you heat up is dependant on the number of parts and their thermal mass. Once the drill\u0027s temperature has reached 500K, it ticks down to around 497K and increases the overheat percentage.

Apparently they both harvest energy AND dissipate heat. Roll out the large solar panels!\n\nSolar panels are actually terrible at this. They radiate pretty well in an atmosphere, but in a vacuum they are just awful. I have tried the small aero sections with minimal success. What you really need is a radiator of some sort. I picket up a nice alpha pack of stand alone radiators that seem to do the trick.\n\nWith the whole heat generation system being used right now there is no way you will ever radiate enough heat to get a workable resource program going. Even eight of these ridiculously large and effective radiator panels that I have, is not enough to keep the converter unit going for more than five minutes. That is with roughly 25000 units of thermal mass attached and 16000 units of dissipation provided by the radiators.\n\nThis is the mod I am using for now.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51395-WIP-Nert-s-Models-Current-HeatControl-heat-management-systems?p=1884792\u0026viewfull=1#post1884792](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51395-WIP-Nert-s-Models-Current-HeatControl-heat-management-systems?p=1884792\u0026viewfull=1#post1884792)"},{"CreatedByName":"supremeownage","CreatedById":142372,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T10:20:56Z","Content":"I\u0027ve never been able to get the ISRU converter working.
