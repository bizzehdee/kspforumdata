Planetary weighting could mean a lot of things. It\u0027s also important to consider that the devs don\u0027t have the luxury\u00A0to just write \u0022balance it somehow\u0022\u0027 they actually have to do it.\u00A0Things get a lot harder when you actually have to program something. Problems arise in practice that may not occur to people spitballing ideas and attacking the problem as a thought experiment.\u00A0Many of the issues I\u0027ve tried to point out could very well be game-breaking showstoppers in practice. I\u0027m not a programmer but I\u0027ve built several tabletop games and I\u0027ve learned how unexpected drawbacks and\u00A0innocuous seeming loopholes can tank a game. We\u0027ve talked a lot about this, but I\u0027ll be honest I haven\u0027t seen anything like a thorough,\u00A0clear set of rules and mechanics that a game designer could scoop up and implement. That\u0027s not to say suggestions and reasoning through this problem isn\u0027t helpful, I just wouldn\u0027t be surprised or disappointed at all if the devs went in a completely different direction.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the specific issue of time-based budgets and upgrades I\u0027ll do my very best to spell out the problem. There are definitely some issues with the basic function of KSP career as a game, but the lack of time-based mechanics \u003Cem\u003Eisnt actually one of them\u003C/em\u003E. The fact that you can start on day one and land on the Mun on day 4 isn\u0027t a game-mechanic problem, its a \u003Cem\u003Erole-playing problem\u003C/em\u003E. Its not that its negatively effecting players ability to complete goals or advance without grind, its that its hurting some\u00A0players\u0027 sense of immersion. I can sympathize with this, and genuinely believe that a cleverly crafted game could accommodate\u00A0both. I do not, however, believe that its worth sacrificing other more important components of\u00A0the game to fix a problem that can be solved by players just choosing to role-play the way they wish to roll-play.\u00A0You could, for instance, just time-warp forward 1 day for each science point spent in the tech tree. No one is stopping you from doing that right now.\u00A0But if your wish is to force all players to role-play the way you do you have to suggest a system that doesn\u0027t make an already complicated game vastly more complicated and difficult to predict\u00A0or simply add extraneous steps with no actual game-play implications. Certainly if you believe its worth scrapping the entirety of the current system, starting from scratch and enduring years (yes years)\u00A0of rebalancing and all of the player complaints and frustrations that come with it the pay-out had better be more than solving a roll-playing pet peeve. It has to add a genuinely\u00A0meaningful layer of incentives and trade-offs that remain stable and understandable throughout progression\u00A0for a broad array of play-styles.

The issue to me is, that time is an entirely curled up dimension in career. That you land on mun on day 4 is not the problem - that it doesnt matter wether you do it on day 4, 40 or 400 is. (Though i would like to see the early game getting stretched out a bit, while we are at it - but certainly not to realistic proportions, going 5 years or so instead of the aforementioned 4 days would be way too long, imho.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- To roll out time and thus give career mode another meaningfull dimension would be the purpose of the programs, and R\u0026amp;D-time. They are acting as sort of a atracting/repelling force dichotomy. You\u00B4ll want to proceed thorugh programs as fast as you can, but the faster you go, the more you\u00B4ll be held back by tech you havent researched, yet. Then, we have an environment where difficulty can be had for challange (Scott Manley doesnt need any technology to complete all the programs, i assume ;P, but even Hodor could run the same satelite mission for the umpteenth time), instead of repeatition, without punishing the player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- I wrote earlier, that i\u00B4d have crew wages be monthly and R\u0026amp;D-wages daily.

One particularly low-hanging piece of fruit at this point IMO would be for them to just put a little more stuff to see and do on the planets, and somehow link that to the exploration contracts. Here\u0027s one way it could work: You get a contract to orbit Mun and do temperature scans over some set of locations. When \u00A0you successfully complete that contract, you\u00A0may discover that there was some sort of interesting anomaly at one of these locations, receiving a small science bonus. If so,\u00A0the game\u00A0immediately generates a surface exploration contract for that location so you can investigate the anomaly. When you complete that mission, there is again a chance that you actually find some kind of an Easter egg. This Easter egg, like the goody huts in Civ, will also give you some kind of a bonus. The more common ones will give you small bonuses to money or science, but the rarer ones might unlock a new part or node of the tech tree\u00A0for you. Near the end of the game, perhaps the Easter eggs could even lead you to some otherwise inaccessible future techs that might ultimately lead you to developing interstellar flight, for example. OK, so that last part would probably be controversial, but truly, just introducing the possibility of finding something interesting and getting an unexpected bonus when conducting exploration missions would do a lot to take the grind out of it IMO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-01T15:32:23Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2016 03:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by herbal space program\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-01T16:21:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not just that you land on the Mun on Day 4, it\u0027s everything that goes with that fact.

If the primary goal is management of a space program, then other things need to happen for management to be a thing---including kerbals doing what they are told without the player literally taking every step for them. If my craft execute their programmed nodes on time, or they can fly routine resupply missions by themselves, because I have set that up (as an act of management), then it makes no difference if my time in the VAB designing a craft gets folded in such that when I hit launch, if the craft took 9 months to build, my time jumps forward 9 months.

I didn\u0027t want every patrol to feel the same, I wanted a sense of the hunt, and in a combat context, that\u0027s sort of \u0022exploration.\u0022 So in KSP the answer might be \u0022a real sense of exploration.\u0022 It also might be \u0022I want to have to solve interesting problems that I would not otherwise.

I know, this sounds paradox. Yet, by scripting it, each mission could be better tailored for this experience, with one following up on the other in a very logical way, without having to have actual mechanics in place to accomplish this. Certain aspects could still be random, or semi-random (set as a range or a list, instead of one specific value), though, as to provide better replayability.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example: Ideally, to know the exact mass of a body, you\u00B4d have to do a grav-experiment on or near it. One could either contruct a mechanic that blurs out exact data in this before you do, or you can simply have the mission to conduct that experiment somewhere early in the program. In either case, you end up doing the experiment. The later variant seems easier to code, to me, though. Another example: You could have \u00B4fog of war\u00B4 over unvisited bodies, or simply make bringing a camera part of any first mission of any program, so that you would get this data anyways, before it becomes relevant in follow-up missions. With scripted programs, you could also guide the player to finding an anomally in a \u003Cem\u003Eseemingly\u003C/em\u003E random way (and vary which anamoly that is between games - e.g. pick one at random at the start of each game).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, this way, looking stuff up on the nets wouldnt solve the mission for you. If the mass of a body would be hidden (the mechanical solution), you could look it up on the wiki and wouldnt actually have to do the experiment. Not so with scripted missions: Know the value all you want, the game would still ask you to do what would be needed, if you didnt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother point: If the game would guide you towards certain locations of a planet/moon, from a list, a focus could be laid on fleshing out these locations first and foremost. Instead of re-doing the entire body, the devs could just handcraft these locations with some extra-effort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: And another - and this is way out there for KSP: On manned missions, with scripted programs, you could even throw in meaningful radio-chatter, with a context to the place they are at and what missions are currently next on your to-do-list for that body, provided kerbals would learn human languages, of course.

The big four (Jeb, Bill, Bob, Val) could have their own unique situations and sentences, all others being all the same (except for gender specific voices), maybe (but also: the character traits could come into play here!). This would add some sort meta-layer on the exploration-theme: True fans will want to learn about everything any of the characters may say in any given speech-situation and try out stuff, only to find out what Jeb says when you bring him really close to the sun, for example. The bad-a** he is, he will probably say something special...

Maybe the text doesnt need to spelled out and just the tone of voice can suffice to successfully convey certain emotions, like enjoyment, excitement, a ponderous thought, panic, a milder fear, frustration, bewilderment, \u0022Eureka!\u0022 (we already have one for those in the \u00B4mission control\u00B4)... and then the player can fill in the words, in his/her mind.

The goal should be exploring the Kerbol\u00A0system foremost, but also creating new innovative designs and generally learning about how space travel works. It should as much as possible focus its energy on the core fun of the game: \u003Cu\u003Ebuilding and flying rockets\u003C/u\u003E. It should apply constraints on players, encouraging them to do more with less and find new solutions to complicated problems, but it should do so in the \u003Cem\u003Esimplest most straightforward way possible\u003C/em\u003E. The more time players are clicking through UI and fussing with calculators the less time they are thinking about mission design. Players should have a sense that at any moment, if they played their cards right, they could go anywhere and do anything. Unlocking is fine, its part of the process, but it should be absolutely crystal clear to a player what they must do to get what they want. Repetition, grind, and fuss should be kept to a bare minimum. If players wish to repeat tasks they may, \u003Cem\u003Ebut they shouldn\u0027t be required to\u003C/em\u003E. Tools should be provided at timely moments to help new and old players advance farther and more efficiently. Ideally there would also be things to find out there on those worlds, and scaled rewards for finding them. Thats a big part of what makes exploration work. If things like time-based mechanics can be proven to enhance the mission design process and make the game more challenging and fun then great! Add it as a toggle. If however they disrupt other more important functions of the game or distract from its core fun then we should consider other ways of making Career mode better.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-02T11:12:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2016 11:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-02T20:35:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222612182\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138448\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464825341\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 hours ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I mean is are you proposing that your program\u0027s income is doled out over time or that you would receive it all at once when accepting and completing missions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPreferably when programs are accepted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222612182\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138448\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464825341\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 hours ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne subtle but important thing aspect of the stock system is you always know how much money you have now and what you\u0027ll have in the future.

This is right on time to send a probe to Moho, or you could do an asteroid mission or 2 before transfer windows to the outer planets all open up between day 200 and 320. All of this could happen faster of course if you sacrificed some inclination burns to Minmus or sent some simultaneous missions, but in general the timing seems fine. At this point you could just pace your upgrade times to match this schedule and you\u0027d be getting close. The idea would be that no matter what landing anywhere would gain you the reward (just as it does now with world firsts), but if you accepted the advance you would also have to accept the deadline, which puts your reputation at risk.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb style=\u0022font-weight:normal;color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:19.32px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:13.3333px;font-family:Verdana;color:rgb(51,51,51);font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003EWhat I think would happen, however, is that players will accept a contract, complete it, use the science to start the upgrade, then immediately time-warp through the upgrade for the fancy new parts, because why not.

What might be more straightforward would be to set a series of \u0022World First\u0022 dates at the outset of a career open. They would be loosely based on the numbers above, and would be visible in the mission briefing. You could think of it as a rival space agency\u0027s schedule for discovery; beat those dates and you receive a bonus reward in reputation and funds on top of the normal reward you would receive just for getting there.

The back-pressure as Mr Scruffy rightly noted is to make upgrades take time. Since science pay-outs happen all at once I think its just as easy to pay the cost of the upgrade up-front rather than let it slowly tick away. Whats also nice about this setup is it actually doesn\u0027t bog down a Grand Tour style player because they still get the completion reward no matter what, and would probably be in a decent position to get world firsts if they were clever. There are lots of other things you could do as well, but again, to me the simplest solution is always best. Lump sums are just almost always easier to deal with because you can just look at one number and mentally add, rather than having to mentally guesstimate, multiply and then add. It doesn\u0027t sound like much, but with so many other things going on in this game sometimes it pays to just keep things absolutely as simple as possible.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#333333\u0022 face=\u0022Verdana\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:13.3333px;line-height:19.32px;white-space:pre-wrap;\u0022\u003E\u00A0Just as an additional note I still do really like the idea of eventually having a simple life support and habitation mechanic.

You get 50k to spend on tech (or something else if you\u0027d like but don\u0027t cry when the HQ isn\u0027t satisfied) and you still have your 11k to do whatever you want in the meantime.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither that or the program would simply give you 10k (each month) for 5 months instead of throwing a mountain of cash right at you.

Its not realistic at all that you would find giant gems in bushes, or that someone would carry around hundreds of them as currency, but that\u00A0doesn\u0027t matter in the slightest because Zelda is \u003Cem\u003Efun\u003C/em\u003E. I actually quite like that part of the goal besides money is gathering science. Its an abstraction, but there\u0027s something pleasing about it for me, like contributing to knowledge broadly and being rewarded for it.\u00A0If you removed science points entirely you also either get really wonky and proscriptive with your node unlocking procedure or you remove\u00A0the need for experiments entirely. This is one of those things where I think player autonomy is really important. Nobody feels like they have to take this one specific piece of equipment to one specific place to unlock a part they need.\u00A0There\u0027s all of this science value out there, and no matter where you go you collect \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E useful, but if you\u0027re clever and game things right there are opportunities to gain a great deal. That\u0027s why I\u0027ve always said its not that the points or the tech tree is broken, its that no one \u003Cem\u003Ereally enjoys the process of collecting science.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0If they did, if the process of doing science was\u003Cem\u003E fun\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0no one would care whether it was realistic or not. Thats the reason I think anomalies and biome multipliers should be a bigger deal, and why I think each experiment should require the player to do something besides click it to make it work. Minigames can be terrible, but if the mini-game was \u003Cem\u003Ein-game\u003C/em\u003E like\u00A0an impactor experiment I tend to think players would be much more excited about it than clicking on the seismometer for the umpteenth time. Whats cool is if time were a real factor in the game suddenly efficient\u00A0surface mapping becomes a thing. There are a lot of cool in-engine things you could do, drop-probes, clever sample return strategies, all kinds of stuff\u00A0that would really press your brain to maximize the effectiveness of your mission, rather than just cycling through right-clicking on the same 8 parts over and over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-04T01:55:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2016 01:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
