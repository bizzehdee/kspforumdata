Each of these contains a quark and an anti-quark, because that\u0027s the only way for 4/5 quarks to have color-neutrality. This guarantees decay in far less than 10^(-10) of a second. The only impact these particles have on anything is small corrections on intranuclear forces, as do pretty much all quark bound states.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
