You could select a group of tanks, set them as the first set of tanks to drain and also set them to drain in a balanced way if you like, then you could set the remaining tanks in a similar way to drain in a specific order and in specific groups. You could even set which engines are fed by which group of tanks allowing for \u0060interesting\u0060 designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems to be a natural thing to do while building the craft and would remove the need for external fuel lines which can explode on re entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen rocket builders get complete control over fuel flow and so do plane builders. No need to learn fuel flow rules, you set them yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat or, you know, just set fuel lines to have priority...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-16T11:17:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EControlling fuel flow in a 100 per cent stock install is easy but it uses a few parts to achieve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If you use the nodes between tanks twice (requires you to enable clipping in the console).
