That\u0027s crazy talk. \n\n**A Wing and a Prayer** is a KSP career mode video series using **only** the SPH to build craft, and **only** the runway to launch. It\u0027s really an experiment to see if it actually can be done. \n\nThe rules are simple, build an airplane, take off from the runway, get into orbit., staging is totally fine, not recovering most of the craft is fine. Explosions are a par or the course.\n\nI know that it has been done in older version of KSP but I started this in V1.2 and I will continue at least until I make it to the Mun and back. \n\n****\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLUxUvoMRhY_8840nRKHttHdOS7z5JwKs1\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-07T10:00:24Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2015 10:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Old\\_Gaming\\_Geezer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Old_Gaming_Geezer","CreatedById":74452,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T10:02:36Z","Content":"Hi all, \n\nJust to point out that A Wing and a Prayer is complete at 10 parts.
