And I can\u0027t figure out for the life of me how to use the custom axis groups. Iv set my helicopter engine torque % to custom01 in my axis groups. When I hover over the controll type (incremental control) the description mentions \u0022keyboard keys increase...\u0022 I have a keaybord \u0026amp; mouse plugged into my Xbox all the time. And no response from anny of the keys. Also using the usual radial menue to select my custom action groups doesn\u0027t do anything either. How am I supposed to use the custom axial groups?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikey117","CreatedById":169509,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-08T12:31:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo idea , still trying to figure this out.

I\u0027m in a Facebook group for KSP on Xbox (fan made) with about 800 members and we are all waiting impatiently fore some info on this subject.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m no programer but how hard can it be to take a game that was originally made fore PC, and make it work on Xbox with keaybord and mouse support? The game had it before annyone was considering porting it to console. All the new games coming out have K\u0026amp;M support natively. Even older games have been updated to work with K\u0026amp;M.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImplementing K\u0026amp;M controlls with key remapping would fix ALOT of issues. And would ultimately make the game more flexible and enjoyable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikey117","CreatedById":169509,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-09T15:40:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFigured it out\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E. You just use docking mode. The\u00A0linear and rotational controls relate to the Custom axis\u0027 listed in the action group window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill have to do some proper testing,but I\u0027m thinking this could make controlling propeller type craft a lot more viable. It\u0027s a bit clunky to switch docking mode back and forth. \u00A0So im thinking, if you remap normal flight controls to DM rotation and any additional robotic controls (like propeller pitch etc) to the DM linear then we should be able to just stay in DM and switch between lin/rot at the tap of a button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAtleast if you play on Cursor controls you just tap A button on xbox to switch. Not sure about other control schemes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for custom axis groups. I will need to test this, but might be that you have a secondary (axis )set of action groups when in DM\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Hope this helps, now go unleash your inner Robotnik\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-12-09T15:45:08Z\u0022 title=\u002212/09/2019 03:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 9, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by mikey117\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FrenchChris","CreatedById":188151,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-09T18:29:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll axes reverse in docking mode ?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve you see on Xbox a atmospheric bug in space ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
