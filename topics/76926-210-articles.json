Do you just create one, land, then create another, land, and so on until you have every unit created and ready for a fight, then you manually have to fly them away or something (in the case you want to have an Air to Air Medium altitude head-to-head combat)? That seems like a lot of work to do to create a simple mission, though I have no other idea on how to do it (May I also say that I have no idea on how to activate AI flying units?).\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027century gothic\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EAlso, does anyone know where can I download an already made mission (savegame)?
