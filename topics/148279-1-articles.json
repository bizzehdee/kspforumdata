Another colony ship was supposed to have arrived before you but was met with problems. You get to find this ship and find out what happened to it at some point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game uses multiple perspectives.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou would establish bases and do pretty much whatever you wanted. There was no hand holding but there was a clock running in the background for events to happen. I know I spent a lot of time flying around planets that all had grids and you would scan and look for stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was kind of like an old version in that sense of no mans sky but there was a lot more too the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou would build up industry and resources and all the details of colonies and whatnot and have to get the means to explore where your ship landed. Every game was unique I think...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was not 3d. It was 8 or 16 bit. and it was\u00A0 a late 80\u0027s to mid 90\u0027s game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was not master of orion or any economy game. You were stranded in a new area of space. Any sightings of living aliens was a major thing in the game. Although I think you could find artifacts...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could go to solar systems or something as you wished and explore a large are of space. there were lots of planets to visit. You could literally go down onto the planets surface and start colonies or explore it and look for things. The palnets were in grids. And you could also leave them at will. Each unique. In fact you had to leave during exploration a lot for various reasons. Especially at first as you tech was lower.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour colonize you could build up manually or automate as it became more advanced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously this describes a lot of games but..
