Keep it up! \u003Cp\u003E-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a suggestion: maybe the tandem cockpit could look a bit more \u0027practical\u0027 if the canopy were stretched back a bit. It kinda looks like a one-seat cockpit due to it\u0027s length. Here\u0027s what I mean by stretching back the canopy: The canopy on this KAI T-50 goes past the intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that these look great! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood suggestion, I\u0027m not gonna lie to you though; modifying the cockpit sounds like a nightmare I\u0027m not willing to undertake..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other news here\u0027s an updated pic of the \u0022Kerbin Hawk\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike always, texture is WIP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ry4YXlI.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022Ry4YXlI.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T03:13:09Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 03:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by martinezfg11\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EPics\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
