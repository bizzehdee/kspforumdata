To make things harder, you can not use the throttle. you must keep the ship at full throttle and use an action group to toggle the engines. Further more, you must be light. Lighter the craft, better the score. I did the maths, it\u0027s theoretically possible. But I have only just gotten to Duna for the first time, and not back yet, so I won\u0027t be doing the challenge.
