So a double size wing should give 4 times the lift. What might happen is that this factor is 1x or 16x instead. If you notice something that does not look right, try to boil it down to a simple case, like a small craft with only stock parts that behaves obviously wrong.

IOW, the more massive an object, the more energy it takes to heat it up. This means that when exposed to a heat source producing a given number of Joules, the more massive object will heat up slower than a less massive object. Everybody has seen this phenomenon in action. This is why it takes some time for the big logs in your campfire to get burning when you toss them onto a pile of burning kindling that you lit very quickly. It\u0027s also why heatsinks tend to be massive compared to what they\u0027re drawing heat from.\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this works hand-in-hand with the ratio of surface area to mass. The higher this number, the more of the mass is exposed on the object\u0027s surface to the heat source, so can absorb heat simultaneously. This is why it\u0027s easier to ignite a board vs. a cubic block of the same mass of wood. But when objects are roughly the same size, such as rocket engines, the one with the higher mass has the lower surface-to-mass ratio, so will heat up slower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if a scaled engine burns at the same temperatures, the thermal energy conducted to the part should go with scale^2, just like the thermal energy the part radiates. Then scaled engines should have the same asymptotic overheating behavior (small ones will converge faster because mass goes with scale^2.5). To achieve this I think I\u0027d need to scale heatProduction with an exponent of -0.5 (since it is normed to thrust and thrust goes with scale^2.5).
