Even coming in from Minmus you\u0027re only doing about mach 10 and you bleed off some of that in the upper atmosphere. At low Kerbin orbit reentry speeds you don\u0027t even need an ablative heat shield, those speeds can be easily handled by radiative cooling using RCC or hot metal TPS cooling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother way to give more deadly reentry is by using mods that increase the size of the planets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K3RBAL KOL4","CreatedById":140935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T23:40:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGo into your item .cfg files and lower ablator levels of heatshields and lower max-temp of all other items.

The problem is the size of the planets in KSP just don\u0027t allow for high enough orbital velocities that require long exposure to high temperatures. Beware space planes are vulnerable to re-entry heat for this reason.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T00:42:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could try real solar system mod. In that you will need something like 8000m/s\u002B for kerbin(earth) orbit. You will see the heat when you enter with 8000m/s believe me.
