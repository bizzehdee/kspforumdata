Right now, SAS works by trying to point the active \u0022command from here\u0022 part at a set attitude (determined by when you turn on SAS, or when it leaves damping mode). If you ship is rigid, that\u0027s fine, because everything is rotating the same way. When your ship is wobbly, like a big stack of docked modules, it doesn\u0027t account for the extra inertia and momentum of the other parts properly, so the other parts act like big, floppy arms that drag your command vessel\u0027s attitude around in ways that the SAS doesn\u0027t anticipate. The SAS then starts correcting in the opposite direction, but sometimes this causes the floppy arms to gain energy because of resonance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best solution (it seems to me) would be to have SAS work individually from each part that applies torque to try to keep it pointing in the right direction. This would make any torque modules on the floppy arms work to damp out the rotation in the arms, and by tuning the SAS controller properly, you can ensure that the structural rigidity of the vessel will dominate in the end to keep everything pointed straight. This is not going to happen anytime soon, but in that case you would probably just want to distribute torque modules in proportion to the size and mass (rotational inertia) of the various parts of your spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the current situation, I think that we can do some rigid body dynamics to determine the best strategy to place torque modules. I\u0027m working on it a little bit, but it is pretty complicated, and what\u0027s worse is we\u0027re not really guaranteed that we can help the wobbles by placing the torque modules properly. The wobbles may be an inherent consequence of the simplistic control scheme in use.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MockKnizzle","CreatedById":59616,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T23:17:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou wanna minimize floppy bits however possible.
