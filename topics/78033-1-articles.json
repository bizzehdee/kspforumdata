When I launched, the 5 boosters got to 100% overheat fairly quickly, and the outside ring of four boosters made a bang and disappeared. The fifth booster kept pushing me upward.

It has to do with the way the game models heat, if you connect a hot part to a cold part, it doesn\u0027t overheat as quickly, if you add a hot part (booster) directly to another hot part (booster), it\u0027ll heat up quite rapidly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeat for some reason also involves distance to COM of a part, thats why mainsail \u002B orange tank overheats, the orange tank is too tall and the game doesn\u0027t register it cooling down the mainsail.
