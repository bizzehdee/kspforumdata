Quickly.\n\nEarn much funding.\n\nThe kerbal time will be used as a tie breaker.\n\nLaunch your career in a positive direction.\n\nSet a stopwatch for forty two minutes and press start.\n\n![WqqmFac.png](http://i.imgur.com/WqqmFac.png)\n\nTake a stock KSP and start with a hard career with re-entry set to 120%, all rewards set to 10% and with 16 000 starting funds, 30 science and zero reputation. \n\nNow with forty two minutes of your time see how much you can earn. \n\nAny damages must be accounted for otherwise your career is facing the wrong direction.\n\n Time warp can help you and bite you so be advised. \n\nThis is a career speed run so all time taken from when you press start is considered so plan ahead but **you must be building your vessels at least once during the run.** \n\n Happy gathering science, clicking contracts, building vessels and launching kerbals. Remember to have fun exploding.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/rl3Fp)\n\nJust post pictures of KSC and your kerbals that are alive and all the contracts completed. If you did something remarkable post a video.\n\nMy first attempt of this challenge a total of three vessels were used and was just shy of earning 85k with 7.5 hours on the kerbal clock.\n\nIf you need some help just check out my practice run on an [extreme hard career](http://Just). Another tip is reduce graphic settings to help with any computer lag. My very old computer has little impact on how fast I can do this.\n\nLeader Board:\n\n* * *\n[TABLE=width: 500]\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Rank[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]Name[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]Score[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]Kerbal Time[/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]1[/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]2[/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]3[/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]4[/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]5[/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\nDifferent leagues could be opened up later on where ore production would be a factor.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T15:25:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 03:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MoeslyArmlis**"},{"CreatedByName":"MadChris48","CreatedById":112853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T01:39:00Z","Content":"Its going to be almost impossible to ensure everyone is playing exactly 42 minutes (i see what you did there). You\u0027re on the right track though. Since time is tracked in game and always starts at day 0, you should make this challenge in kerbal time, not real time, to make it precisely measurable. Say, 42 Kerbin days to see how far you can advance your program. I think that would be a better metric to run a challenge of this nature. Just my .02"},{"CreatedByName":"Moesly_Armlis","CreatedById":112247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T19:36:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Its going to be almost impossible to ensure everyone is playing exactly 42 minutes\n\nI was doing this in half an hour but decided to add some extra time to it.\n\nThis has to be done on the honour system or it is not worth doing. \n\nThe time for this speed run is about right and quite a lot can be done even it is just the world records. The kerbal time is the tie breaker so that does act as the measure.\n\n Getting a proper rhythm for building and launching helps. Proper use of time warp helps keeping under the limit; reduce time warp before changing direction.\n\nJust focus on completing the records during your practice runs. Do not try this without some practice so play with quick save and revert until you feel you can do it.\n\nSelecting the right contracts before launch and during the mission can add some extra gravy. An example is to do a launchpad test and follow up with a sub orbital test using the terrier engine, warning this has caused me so much fun."},{"CreatedByName":"herbal space program","CreatedById":112590,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T20:02:31Z","Content":"So are we playing for money, science, rep, or some kind of composite of all three?

You could spend your time unlocking science or gathering reputation but in the end it will boil down to how much funding is being generated per mission. \n\n Also to clarify if you lose a kerbal or a building than that is not going to be positive for your career. \n\nThis challenge is about funds generated in the shortest time."}]}
