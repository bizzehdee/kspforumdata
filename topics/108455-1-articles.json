The F-2 Talon Interceptor. It is a short range air defense jet. It can go out about 40km and come back and still fight. It is armed with 4 Aim-9 Sidewinder missiles and twin Vulcan cannons. It has a top speed of about 900m/s at sea level. (It can go faster, but I don\u0027t recommend it). It is also extremely maneuverable. Do not attempt a water ditching, during tests it was completely destroyed after hitting the water at 55m/s and 8-10m/s vertical speed. Use the ejectable cockpit if you run out of fuel over water. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
