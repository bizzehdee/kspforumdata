All ships over a certain length must have red and green lights to identify direction of travel (As do all aircraft). Also aircraft Carriers use Yellow, red, and blue lights for nighttime illumination.

Unless you want to put brake lights on your rover.....\n\nI truly only use the light settings to make them dimmer, or give them a more blue/yellow hue.\n\nEDIT: In correlation with *Taki117*, I have found that the skin of the light (where the light is emitted from the part) does not change when you change the colour, thus making them hard to see when the ship is flying....\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-18T02:50:56Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2015 02:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SpaceExplorer**\n  \nAdded information"},{"CreatedByName":"Othuyeg","CreatedById":105454,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T02:38:10Z","Content":"Yes, there is a benefit.
