The challenge and possibilities are awesome. On to the question. I built a Kerbal X\u00A0rocket as a lifter to the moon. 6 boosters with 2 X FLT 800s each and a LV-T30 as their engine. Main stage is the orange rocko max with a 16 rocko max tank utilizing the Mainsail. It is lifting my somewhat custom made Munar lander. All stages are correctly placed and to top it off, 1 hour before this launch I used the same exact setup to launch a previous Munar lander. The intent was to send two landers to the Mun, one would get science in high orbit the other in low orbit and some science from the surface provided I hadnt wasted my Delta V.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow to the interesting part, Boosters get jettisoned just fine, no change from the previous launch, I get into orbit and jettison the ferrings. Next\u00A0stage seperates \u00A0the main from the Munar and ignites the maneuver rocket attached too the Munar Lander. Here is where it got wierd, the main view stayed on the jettisoned main stage and my Munar Landar took off in a shot like a missile shot from a jet as I watched it leave,\u00A0\u00A0I\u00A0could not regain control by hitting the square bracket keys or right clicking or anything. Was too tired to fiddle with it last night so I just went to bed. Has this happened to anyone else? Hopefully this is just a weird glitch or maybe I hit a control button unaware that i had done so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-23T13:47:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it possible your root part is on the lifter not the payload? \u00A0Might be worth right clicking on the command module and selecting \u0022Control from here\u0022 before you launch it next time to see if that solves it. \u00A0Square bracket only works within a given range so it\u0027s possible you out of range by the time you hit the key.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr it might just be a weird random bug\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-23T13:48:42Z\u0022 title=\u002201/23/2016 01:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by RizzoTheRat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheOldDad","CreatedById":157489,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-23T13:55:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNever thought of that!
