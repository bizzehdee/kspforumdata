When running on a treadmill, you wouldn\u2019t feel air rushing over you. Wouldn\u2019t that be because relative to an outside observer/ground/air you are actually stationary?\n\u003E \n\nIt all depends on whether you\u0027re viewing the question as a linguistic challenge or an engineering one.\n\nShort answer is:  The airplane will take off just fine.  Because the conveyor belt won\u0027t affect it.  The conveyor belt moving (or accelerating) won\u0027t affect the airplane in any appreciable way.  When the conveyor belt accelerates, all it does is accelerate the spin rate of the plane\u0027s wheels; it won\u0027t make any difference to how the plane itself moves.\n\nBy way of illustration, let\u0027s take the simpler case of an airplane that *\u003Cu\u003Edoesn\u0027t have any engines\u003C/u\u003E*.  It\u0027s basically just a big heavy chunk of metal on roller skates.  Let\u0027s consider what happens:\n\n1. Imagine that the plane is sitting stationary on the conveyor belt.  And the conveyor belt is stationary, too.  Nothing moving.  Simple enough, right?\n2. Now, let\u0027s assume that the plane *\u003Cu\u003Edoesn\u0027t have its brakes set\u003C/u\u003E*-- there\u0027s nothing stopping it from rolling forward or backward other than the (very small) amount of rolling friction of its wheels.\n3. Okay. Now turn on the conveyor belt\u0027s motor so that the conveyor belt accelerates backwards (relative to the plane).  What happens?\n4. Answer:  The plane just sits there, nearly stationary!\n\nWhy is that?  It\u0027s because the wheels have a very tiny moment of inertia relative to the overall mass of the plane, and also have a very small amount of rolling friction.  So when you start pulling the conveyor belt backwards, there\u0027s very little \u0022friction coupling\u0022 with the airplane-- it\u0027s like that magic trick where you yank the tablecloth out from under a bunch of dishes and they all stay in place.  The plane would just sit there, nearly motionless, no matter how fast the conveyor belt goes.  All that happens is that every time the conveyor belt accelerates a bit faster, it causes the plane\u0027s wheels to spin that much faster.  But the plane itself basically just sits there.\n\nNow... the plane won\u0027t sit *\u003Cu\u003Ecompletely\u003C/u\u003E* still.  The rolling friction of the wheels is very very small, but it\u0027s not quite zero, so yes, the fact that the conveyor belt is accelerating the wheels and the wheels are fixed to their axles and the axles are attached to the plane will, indeed, cause the plane to start accelerating backwards.  But it will do so very, very slowly, with a very low acceleration, e.g. less than a hundredth of a gee.  So, pretty darn close to stationary.\n\n...Okay, now take the same exact situation, *\u003Cu\u003Ebut the plane has engines\u003C/u\u003E*.  In this case, the engines are using the (stationary) *\u003Cu\u003Eair\u003C/u\u003E* for thrust, not the conveyor belt, so the speed of the conveyor belt doesn\u0027t matter.  As long as the engines have enough oomph to overcome the tiny, less-than-hundredth-of-a-gee backwards acceleration due to rolling friction of the wheels, they\u0027ll easily accelerate the plane and it will take off just fine.\n\nOf course, all of the above discussion has been assuming that you\u0027re using plausible real-world physics and engineering.  If you want to posit something silly like \u0022the conveyor belt can move at half lightspeed!\u0022 or whatever, then the problem becomes a lot more hand-wavy.  One problem right at the core of this \u0022problem\u0022 is that it\u0027s using misleading linguistics.  You can\u0027t have an infinitely powerful motor on a conveyor belt.  Or rather, as soon as you say you have one, then all the math goes kablooie and you basically can say anything you want.  Saying \u0022I have a conveyor belt that accelerates as necessary to keep the plane stationary\u0022 is nonsensical.  It\u0027s not a thing.  It\u0027s like saying \u0022I have a car that runs fast enough to make *\u003Carbitrary thing=\u0022\u0022 unrelated=\u0022\u0022 to=\u0022\u0022 car\u0027s=\u0022\u0022 speed=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/arbitrary\u003E* happen.\u0022\n\nThe only way for this problem to be an actually well-defined problem and not just linguistic trolling, would be to specify the numbers involved.  Specifically, 1. what acceleration can the plane manage from its engines?  2. what speed can the wheels spin before they burst?  3.  what\u0027s the rolling friction of the wheels?  4.  what\u0027s the takeoff airspeed of the plane?  and 5. **what\u0027s the max acceleration that the conveyor belt can do?**\n\nThat last question is the kicker.  Unless you specify what acceleration the conveyor belt can manage, you\u0027re playing word games, not engineering games.\n\nThe plane *\u003Cu\u003Ewill\u003C/u\u003E* accelerate, and the conveyor belt can\u0027t stop that no matter how fast it goes.  All the conveyor belt can do is make the plane\u0027s wheels spin faster.  The wheels have a certain maximum speed they can tolerate before they explode.  So, it\u0027s basically a \u0022race\u0022.  One of two things will happen, based on how powerful the conveyor belt\u0027s acceleration is relative to the plane\u0027s.\n\n- Either the plane will reach takeoff speed and lift off before the wheels explode...\n- or it won\u0027t, and the wheels explode, and then bad things happen.\n\nKnowing \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ewhich one\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E happens would require knowing the numbers mentioned above."},{"CreatedByName":"DeltaDizzy","CreatedById":150755,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-14T23:58:43Z","Content":"I mean once the wheels give out, rip everyone in that plane, and the plane itself, so you cant really consider it a takeoff in any normal sense.

If that was the case, the bearings would quickly seize. At which point, the conveyor belt would hurl the aircraft backwards. The sudden acceleration would probably cause the plane to pitch forward, giving the wings a positive \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E with respect to the direction of travel. The aircraft would then take off backwards ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif \u0022:cool:\u0022). It would probably then crash back down as the engine slows the backwards velocity, assuming it didn\u0027t suffer a prop strike when pitching forward.\n\nNormal physics: yeah, the conveyor does nothing to the thrust accelerating the plane, which will take off normally.\n\nSpecial case: floatplanes fighting against the current will have difficulty taking off, as water offers much more resistance than wheels, until the floats start hydroplaning."}]}
