In real life, trim controls on an aircraft will move a tiny mini-aileron (or mini-rudder) at the trailing edge of the aileron (or rudder). This causes the airflow to push the main body of the control surface the other way, so if you let go of the stick (or rudder) it will settle naturally in a different position. Pilots should constantly re-trim the controls so that the plane maintains level flight with zero effort on the controls - and this changes with airspeed and (for monoprops) engine speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP approximates this, with much the same aim. I don\u0027t do planes much in KSP but whenever I do I use trim, mostly because SAS is so odd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroGav","CreatedById":152027,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T22:28:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you trim an airplane it will naturally tend to settle at a particular angle of attack - difference between prograde and where the nose is pointing. \u00A0 Eg. \u00A0you set trim for 5 degrees angle of attack in level flight at part throttle. \u00A0If you then shut the throttle, it will settle into a glide at 5 degrees angle of attack. \u00A0If you firewall the throttle, it will eventually settle into a nose angle that = \u00A0your climb angle based upon your excess power \u002B 5 degrees that was trimmed for (after a few oscillations).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually, it will cimb to an altitude where the air is so thin, the engines no longer have any excess power and you climb no higher. \u00A0The thin air means less drag but also less lift, and you will be in level flight at much higher speed than before. \u00A0 But you\u0027ll still have about the same angle of attack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI nearly always use pitch trim to fly my low thrust/weight ratio spaceplanes to orbit, \u00A0because optimum lift drag ratio occurs at a certain angle of attack and that\u0027s the easiest way to keep it constant while thrust , lift , drag and air density fluctuate all over the shop. \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYaw or Roll trim? \u00A0 \u00A0Never use these. \u00A0 I design my planes to be stable and fly straight, \u00A0if the plane won\u0027t fly straight by itself that means my joystick isn\u0027t centering properly/is generating phantom inputs or the physics have glitched, in which case it\u0027s best to restart. \u00A0Never had any success trimming out phantom forces ... \u00A0 always under or over corrected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-03T02:19:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222346139\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022129126\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221451762645\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022108982\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022davidpsummers\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, davidpsummers said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI read someone mentioning \u0022trim\u0022. \u00A0What is it? \u00A0When/Why do I need it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood question.\u00A0 I\u0027ve been playing since 0.20 and haven\u0027t ever used it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-03T03:23:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s also used for cruise control on long range rover trips.
