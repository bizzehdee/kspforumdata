But I made a heavy lifter. and it is completely stock. ( I haven\u0027t any mods ). It can lift about 36 tons into roughly 300,000 by 300,000 kerbin orbit. It was meant to get 3 kerbonaughts to orbit the mun and return. But when your rocket sience is: Bigger load, more engines and fuel! And you are always going \u0022Will it be enough?\u0022 you will always have over-engineered rockets. I adapted it to land on the mun, and later Minmus. I\u0027m not a great pilot and I think It could lift more, especially if MechJeb helped, so I think it could easily get 50-70 tons into Lunar Orbit. I would upload it, but I don\u0027t know how. But It is huge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jackvony","CreatedById":124289,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-15T20:54:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis by no means a heavy lifter.
