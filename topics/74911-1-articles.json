Did you actually animate the object using the animator window? If so i would have expected to see the animation curves and named transforms etc when you game object/model is selected. does the anmiation run properly in unity?.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there, a particular reason you chose this form of animation rather than the usual method? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Im guessing that the base would be fixed and the heatshield expands out from the fixed base, why couldn\u0027t you just scale the heatshield to simulate inflation/deployment?

I did open an animator window, and set keyframes with the blendshape value going from 100 to 0, and then it saved it as \u003Cstrong\u003EDeploy.animat\u003C/strong\u003E file. This is the \u0022Deploy\u0022 animation that I have loaded into the game object, and when I do the preview it works. But opening up the animator window again after closing out from unity just opens up a blank timeline.

The center section is rigid, and only the outer portion inflates from the base, so when I texture they will look a bit different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough, thinking about it, I may be able to make 2 separate meshes, and do the scaling animation to almost mimic the same animation as the keyshape (mesh 1: rigid base, mesh 2: inflatable outer perimeter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is an outdated save of the heatshield to better explain the animation. I read up that modifiers need to be applied \u003Cstrong\u003EBEFORE\u003C/strong\u003E you do the key shapes, otherwise unity will not recognize them (in the case of this save file). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/t2yvezgamni079q/3M%20Expanding%20Heatshield.blend\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/t2yvezgamni079q/3M%20Expanding%20Heatshield.blend\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
