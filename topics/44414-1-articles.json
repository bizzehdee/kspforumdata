It passes very close to Kerbin every few orbits. It is scheduled to crash into kerbin in say 100 years or so. It has the same physics as say a player made object. It is your job to land on the asteroid and divert it from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCanadianVendingMachine","CreatedById":59684,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T21:12:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, you see, the campaign isn\u0027t going to be scripted.
