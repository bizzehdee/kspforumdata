A magnet close enoguht to the Earth can be pulled around like the magnet on a compass, to orient and stabilize the vehicle. This provides no thrust, of course, but it is vaugley on the same lines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"architeuthis","CreatedById":57137,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T22:24:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nibb31\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nibb31\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo. To propell, they would need to repel something.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can use the magnetic field to repel charged particles from the sun (or if you have a really powerful static particle accelerator you can point that at the magnetic field to accelerate the spacecraft).
