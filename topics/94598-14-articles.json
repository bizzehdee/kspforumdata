In a new Sandbox campaign, everything works as it should. In a new Career campaign that I edited to have 100000 science, I unlocked KSPI nodes one by one, and then eventually the entire tech tree.

The only thing that puzzles me is how the isupgraded flag (which determines if it\u0027s upgraded or not) is never changed by an retrofit, only available fuelmodes is upgraded, but they should get lost after you switch vessels.
