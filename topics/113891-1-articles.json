Running at any level of time warp over the poles of the Mun in a polar orbit with this craft randomly (as best I can tell) causes every single part on the vessel to overheat instantly and explode simultaneously. I\u0027m pretty sure that\u0027s not the intended behavior...

The only way to safely cross the poles at orbital or near-orbital velocity for this craft is to be in the map. I almost wonder if it has something to do with the fact that the orbit really does go exactly over the south and north poles...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-24T00:26:12Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2015 12:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SkyRender\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T18:15:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHuh, there has been the same or similar (well, it does involve something making the entire ship to get improbably hot and exploding) problem with Dmagic Orbital Science\u002BSCANsat in 1.0.2.
