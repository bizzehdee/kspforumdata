Running at any level of time warp over the poles of the Mun in a polar orbit with this craft randomly (as best I can tell) causes every single part on the vessel to overheat instantly and explode simultaneously. I\u0027m pretty sure that\u0027s not the intended behavior... Mods in use: TAC Life Support, Kerbal Engineer Redux, Environmental Visual Enhancements, Kerbal Attachment System, Kerbal Inventory System, Hull Camera VDS, Kerbal Alarm Clock.\n\nUPDATE: It seems that this explosion happens even out of timewarp! The only way to safely cross the poles at orbital or near-orbital velocity for this craft is to be in the map. I almost wonder if it has something to do with the fact that the orbit really does go exactly over the south and north poles...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-24T00:26:12Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2015 12:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SkyRender**"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T18:15:30Z","Content":"Huh, there has been the same or similar (well, it does involve something making the entire ship to get improbably hot and exploding) problem with Dmagic Orbital Science\u002BSCANsat in 1.0.2.
