They all plan to stay with X11 until Wayland support is ready.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, [insert generic rant about Mir being a step into the wrong direction and that it would have been better for everyone if Canonical would have adhered to the Wayland protocol here].\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main reason why people want to get away from X11 is that its no longer being used in the way it was designed to be. Proper usage of X11 would require programs to use X11 draw commands to display their UI. While this can be extremely fast for simple UIs, it would be slow for features not supported in the original X11 protocol (for instance gradients). Therefore most modern GUI toolkits don\u0027t draw using X11 commands, but prepare their output as a bitmap which is then given to X11 to be displayed. Actually, nowadays X11 doesn\u0027t even do that any more, but instead forwards those bitmaps to a compositor, which then arranges them in a nice way, and then hands back a fullscreen \u0022bitmap\u0022 to X11. The new concept used by Wayland (and its ugly evil twin Mir) is to get rid of all unnecessary drawing commands, and to eliminate the middle-man between GUI toolkit and compositor. Another reason to go away from X11 is input handling, but I don\u0027t know enough about that topic to comment on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack on topic: I\u0027ve been running Linux since 12 or 13 years (sorry, I don\u0027t remember exactly), and since more than 4 years I don\u0027t have a Windows installation on my PC any more.
