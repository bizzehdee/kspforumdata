Even in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, at around 2km above sea level it reaches an ISP of 400, thus outperforming any other engine. If you ship has LV-Ns, you should consider igniting them at about that height. Best way to do this is action groups, as they tend to overheat in atmospheres and usually you do not want to throttle down during a launch. Just turn them off when the heat gets too high, they will cool down within seconds and can be fired again.
