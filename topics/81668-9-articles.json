The atmosphere scale heights are based on actual physics. I calculated the molar mass of the air based on what Ferram defined as the atmospheric composition in his mod. We calculate scale height = (boltzman constant * Temp in Kelvin) / (molar mass * gravity). Yes we use the default lapse formula which is not an accurate model. RSS uses values based on data collected from the real world. I have a paper that defines a more accurate model but that would require code modification to Kopernicus. At 118k there is a thin atmosphere. As for heat re-entry yes I noticed that too but I think that is more to do with deadly re-entry being watered down.

First I like to discuss the changes that were needed for the star kerbol. As we know the stock star is totally messed up to the point nothing like it could really exist. Before this research I made a guess at kerbol\u0027s radius. Now using the Stephan Boltzmann\u0027s law and knowing Kerbin receives 1360 W/m^2 and the temperature of the surface of the star (5860 K) I could calculate the real radius. Next using Stephan Boltzmann\u0027s law you can calculate the total output of the star. Using the total output you can calculate the power at any distance from the star. The relation is (power at distance D) = (power output of Star) * (radius of star / distance D) ^ 2 which means solar power curves could be calculated on the fly. Also other law of use is Wien\u0027s displacement law which can be used to obtain the peak frequency. In theory that frequency could be mapped to an RGB value for the color of the star. The last nice calculation you can do is calculate the temperature at the surface of a body without a atmosphere using the albedo.

Since I should release a fix version I will just use the default earth values. Now I have done some reading on the topic of exoplanets atmospheres and made some interesting discoveries. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst yes the barometric formula assume a isothermal atmosphere which is not accurate as you pointed out. From from my reading ideal gases polytropic index range is from zero to the adiabatic index for stable atmospheres. Okay it can be greater than the adiabatic but usually that is for cases like a combustion engine. For a planet if the polytropic index is greater than the adiabatic index then the atmosphere is leaking into space. So we can calculate the lowest parts of the atmosphere using dry adiabatic gas laws. Above a certain barrier an isothermal model is used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow this model only holds when convection is the primary driver of heat over radiant emission.

Planets such as Mars lacks the atmospheric pressure to exhibit the stratospheric inversion we see with other worlds. So it does look like we can simulate atmospheres on \u0022created\u0022 worlds.
