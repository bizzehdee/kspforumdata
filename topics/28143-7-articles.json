Shoot, the cupola alone came directly from a mod! The game doesn\u0027t behave any differently based on how it found the part at load-time, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad own the engine. I say let them focus on making it run better and adding new internal features like GUI enhancements and physics/graphical updates. Since they\u0027re actively encouraging a modding community, there\u0027s no reason in the world to look down on having extra stuff extend the game being provided by external (and unpaid, I might add) people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to the modding support, the Squad dev team is unofficially much larger than their payroll would indicate, and that\u0027s actually a really awesome thing, because it means there will be new stuff to see and do in this game for quite some time to come.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, bear in mind: they didn\u0027t just hire on \u0022part makers\u0022. They hired on full modders, who know how to code additional functionality into the game itself, beyond just adding custom parts. That\u0027s important, because they\u0027ve increased the number of people on the team who understand how the game itself works, which means they can develop much more than additional parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I guess what I\u0027m saying is that since they\u0027re so openly supporting modding right from the get-go, there\u0027s no reason we should feel Squad is obligated to add piles of new parts with every update when so many others are already doing just that. How many of the stock parts do you actually use, as opposed to ones added by mods?
