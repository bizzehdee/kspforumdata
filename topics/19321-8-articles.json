This causes lift to increase until it overpowers gravity, lifting the plane higher; then the cycle works in reverse. As long as you have a vehicle being acted on by gravity and aerodynamic forces, phugoid motion will result. It will oscillate a few hundred meters one way or another, but unless you\u0027re flying right near the flameout point that shouldn\u0027t be a problem.

I believe that in real life, the Space Shuttle used fuel pumping kung-fu to keep it\u0027s CoM Directly over it\u0027s CoL, minimizing the effort of the RCS. Unfortunately, we cannot view our CoM\u0027s and CoL\u0027s in real time in-game nor predict what they will be when the tanks are almost depleted. As such, there\u0027s no way to figure out how to pump your fuel, so you must revert to trial and error reentry for this task. Once you reach orbit, quicksave, then reenter your craft over and over, changing our fuel distribution each time until you find a setting that works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Climberfx","CreatedById":57126,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T04:18:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m in.
