I\u0027m serious, TweakScale can do a lot of damage, and it should not be lightly ported to a new platform without understanding how the new platform works internally, well beyound an hastily published API.\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDo you think the wobbling in KSP2 is bad?

Damn, even the Mod Loader was hacked by 3rd parties, no one have the slightest idea on how Mods will be loaded on the final KSP version.\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDoing anything now will risk throwing away a lot of development efforts, that right now is being better used on improving TweakScale itself, what will allow us to have a better TweakScale tomorrow for KSP2 too.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere\u0027re some legal constraints in the legislation I live in\u00A0(and, to tell you the true, the citizens of a few other countries too) that may harm me, unless we have formal permission from PD or IG. Extracting and API by Reflection and publishing it without permission is not allowed on some Countries (like mine), and until the KSP2 API is published by the owners (as the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/ksp/api/index.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSP\u00B9 is nowadays\u003C/a\u003E), it will not be wise for me doing anything on KSP2 yet.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI\u0027m not playing KSP myself, the thing doesn\u0027t run on any machine I own presently, so even if all the reasons above would not exist, there\u0027s still the hardware problem to tackle down.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
