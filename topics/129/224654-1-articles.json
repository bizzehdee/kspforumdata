I was thinking of attempting it but I realized that 1) I don\u0027t know where to start and 2) I wouldn\u0027t know how to code it or which things to look for to make it ever come close to functioning properly.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven for simple things like basic pilot wings for successfully taking off and landing in an aircraft without crashing/dying 5 times; or getting advanced wings when you do it 10, 15, 20 times. Not counting wings or rocket badges for successfully launching/riding a rocket up and returning from the launch. Landing on the various objects out there or even better making orbits or ribbons for fast times to orbit...seems like it would be easier for someone with a little more code ability in their brain than mine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"woeller","CreatedById":174556,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-02T07:56:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee here.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022206655\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed5046374215\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/223457-wayfarers-wings-rank-ribbons-v040-for-ksp2-v021/?do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:195px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
