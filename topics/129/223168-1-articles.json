I used to be a huge fan of adding a big of flavour to rockets, kinda akin to how something like Atlas V launches with the mission emblem, ULA, NASA, and so on decals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, along the same line I\u0027d love to see a method of adding different patterns to fuel tanks and such, rather than just the same generic look. The recolour tool would be much better with that, where one can cycle through a list of different patterns and colour them accordingly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would have the faintest idea how to go about doing that though!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ShadowDev","CreatedById":227178,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-21T15:58:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnot heard of anyone working on anything like that but it sounds like a good idea.
