Moreover, we even have a custom collection of mod project templates to automatically generate the type of mod project you want to build, including some example code etc, and I have more project templates coming soon - for example a full part mod template including the Unity project with all the necessary setup for you to basically just drop in your own assets and press \u0022build\u0022, or a template with a full setup for a mod using Unity UI Toolkit, for much easier creation of UIs.

For background I\u0027m a new modder to KSP1, and I\u0027ve been learning a LOT about part modding by studying both Nertea\u0027s legacy work (and trying to match his style) as well as from prolific folks like Poodmund, Beale, Zorg, etc. I\u0027ve not formally published any of it yet, but here\u0027s the lineup of engines for my first mod, CryoEngines Extensions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KSP_x64_zaId4TvRvQ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002266.25\u0022 height=\u0022795\u0022 style=\u0022width:640px;height:auto;\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/206472058228572162/1122418857211076658/KSP_x64_zaId4TvRvQ.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll also take the time to point out my background, which is to say that I am a modder of an artist background, \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E of a programming background. This, I think, will be important for this discussion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI only learned how to mod about a month ago. At the time, like now, I harbour no ill will towards the developers (and I banter with them even on the official IG server) nor towards any of the active player KSP2 community, despite (or perhaps because of) its admittedly smaller size. Despite this and the eagerness of folks like ShadowDev and Munix, and even contributing to some UI specs for various KSP2 mods, I ended up deciding to commit my efforts to learning KSP1 modding first instead. The word \u0022commit\u0022 is important, I feel, because learning how to make an engine is a large undertaking and a big timesink, and I do not want my efforts to go to waste. At the risk of repeating previous points, the reasons I decided to commit to KSP1 modding are as follows:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAs an artist, the development pipeline feels much less intrusive for KSP1\u003C/strong\u003E. Reading this thread and elsewhere I understand what folks like Lux and ShadowDev say regarding the benefits of packaging assets into bundles, for the sake of performance and load times for players\u2014but if I\u0027m honest, during the actual asset development cycle load times of the game are not actually the biggest time sink. Rather, when I\u0027m making my assets I much prefer having to jump through as hoops as possible when I make changes to textures, models, or config settings.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs an example, a common occurrence is for me to load a WIP engine into the game and finding out the visual appearance of some of the textures feels off. Since I work in KSP1, though, all I need to do is scribble the edit of the texture in Photoshop, re-export as the DDS, and then slap that into the GameData folder and launch the game again. Again I understand folks\u0027 criticisms of the inefficiency of the GameData folder, but what it represents to non-technical modders like myself is a very familiar and intuitive workflow that feels very automatic: just drag and drop the new texture, model, or config into the folder and see if it works. There\u0027s also the assurance of how it\u0027s all exposed to me and very understandable: I know for a fact that if I don\u0027t touch the config file in GameData, none of the stats will change because I\u0027ve thrown in a new texture. Having to first bundle and package a mod using what is ultimately a black box to me adds a fair amount of friction and is much less reassuring, especially if something goes wrong with the new asset.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you want to get a better sense of the preferences of artist/asset modders like myself, consider how tools like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/40056-12-17-blender-283-mu-importexport-addon/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Etaniwah\u0027s Blender exporter\u003C/a\u003E are the real game changer, meaning many of us can cut out Unity \u003Cem\u003Eentirely\u003C/em\u003E out of our pipeline: things go straight from the art program we use to model our assets directly into the game with no middleman. The fewer steps between the program I use to make my assets and seeing them in-game, the better. An attempt at an analogy: imagine if every time you wanted to compile your code you wrote in VSCode you had to, for whatever reason, open it in Adobe Dreamweaver first and then export it from there. Sure, it\u0027s just \u0022one step\u0022, and you\u0027re not making a whole thing in DW, but I think you can imagine why it would be so off-putting for asset artists who have a similar relationship with Unity, hence why the new asset creation paradigm in KSP1 is to not use Unity at all.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPerhaps an in-between solution is to have a \u0022dropbox\u0022 modding folder akin to GameData specifically for asset modders to quickly drop in new edits when developing. An \u003Cem\u003Eupgrade\u003C/em\u003E over the KSP1 system could possibly be an in-game asset editor that allowed me to just import edited textures and new models on the fly, similar to Cities Skylines\u0027 editor, cutting out the need to reload the game repeatedly and allowing me to directly view what the asset will look like with the in-game render engine on the fly. In that regard, I don\u0027t think anyone would be opposed to being asked to still bundle their mods for publication at the \u003Cem\u003Eend \u003C/em\u003Eof development.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EI am turned off by the competing standards of the modding tools of KSP2. \u003C/strong\u003EA lot of this can be chalked up to the fact that KSP2 is still early in development and so many of the standards or solutions haven\u0027t yet crystallised. Nonetheless, if you are asking us what is stopping us from picking up modding \u003Cem\u003Enow\u003C/em\u003E, this is still worth emphasising. I\u0027ll go one step further and actually disagree with what ShadowDev said: I \u003Cem\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E want to have to choose between three different methods of accomplishing the same thing, because that means I\u0027m making a commitment to that method/tool. As a beginner I inherently do not have the knowledge or background to confidently choose which avenue would work best for me.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHaving multiple competing standards itself too becomes a barrier to community as well. Much of the modding effort in KSP1 is still very collaborative, and often spontaneously so: in the last week, Atomic, LinuxGuruGamer, and a few others patched themselves together into a team of like four people to work on a new mod in the span of a few hours and have already produced some concepts and assets. This is only possible because for a given type of asset there is a single unified approach to making it in KSP1, and so everyone merely needs to find which part of the assembly line they need to drop in. It\u0027s not the best pipeline, of course, but the fact that it is a single standard and that I can approach anyone and know they can slot into a project gives me a lot of confidence both when making mods and requesting help as a beginner. With many of the biggest mods in KSP1 being highly collaborative efforts (even one-man army Nertea didn\u0027t work alone), the fact that KSP2 modding still has not honed in on a singular standard of how to make a basic part config makes me hesitate.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EI don\u0027t actually know what I\u0027d want to, or should, mod for KSP2.\u003C/strong\u003E This one I don\u0027t think has been mentioned but I think it\u0027s what a lot of people feel wrt to the fact that KSP2 is still very early in development. I don\u0027t actually do modding for its own sake; I got into modding because I identified a gap in the game that I think should be addressed. I\u0027d argue many of the biggest projects in KSP1 stemmed from this motivation of identifying a gap and then building a mod to address it: Nertea\u0027s entire suite is about extending the stockalike experience; ReStock was about refurbishing and standardising the appearance of the stock parts; Beale\u0027s new WaterDrinker was made following dissatisfaction with the aging Firespitter framework; my own WIP mod was itself spurred from a desire for more Nertea-like parts. With the current development state of KSP2 being so early, the approach of \u0022identify gap, make mod to address gap\u0022 doesn\u0027t work because there aren\u0027t gaps so much as enormous voids where work hasn\u0027t even started. This is not to disparage the efforts of the KSP2 dev team and I have confidence they will follow through on the roadmap, but the reality is is that getting us to mod a game so early in development is akin to asking an interior designer to have a go at re-arranging the dining room furniture for a house that has barely completed building its foundations.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPlus, with the competing standards and ambiguity of the exact features of the roadmap going forward, there is an inherit gamble in spending effort in something that may be folded into the core experience or otherwise rendered irrelevant. None of us want to accidentally recreate a RemoteTech-CommNet or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E-Stock Inventory situation; the thought of a lot of monumental (unpaid and often thankless) work going into modding a game only for it to be rendered mostly null in six months does not motivate. I think many of us are indeed just waiting to see a clearer picture of what \u0022stock\u0022 KSP2 will look like in order to inform the direction of our modding.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know that\u0027s a lot of text and I appreciate y\u0027alls effort in starting early and getting the modding framework for KSP2 correct. That said, I\u0027ll leave off with how, while I think they could word it better, I ultimately agree with Lisias: I feel as though much of the effort and design of modding tools for KSP2 have been engineered by and for programmers and coders, with little input or consideration for those who do not come from that background\u2014and there are a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of us of that background. To repeat their point, the tools feel like they are being made solely to make programming and optimisation of the game easier at the expense of asset developers. While I understand that programming foundations need to be laid out first, the truth is if you\u0027re asking us why, right \u003Cem\u003Enow\u003C/em\u003E, we don\u0027t take an interest in KSP2 modding, it\u0027s because none of the tools nor any of the communication suggest to me a concerted or directed effort in improving the pipeline, flow, tools, and communication for asset artists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am happy to continue to lend help with UX matters, but something like this needs more than just making sure the UI elements are pretty. It will require concerted and active effort to garner feedback and to ensure tools are being designed around all kinds of modders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(as a disclaimer too: these are all my own thoughts and I do not speak for everyone in the KSP1 modding community, of course)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-07-08T17:06:43Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2023 05:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Kavaeric\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ShadowDev","CreatedById":227178,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-08T16:56:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwould like to add that when official modding support is added it will be virtually the same as the current unofficial system.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nonly differences will be\u003Cbr\u003E\nSWinfo will become modinfo\u003Cbr\u003E\n\\BepInEx\\plugins will become\u00A0\\GameData\\Mods\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nyou will still need to use unity for part modding since they use\u00A0addressables bundles\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nas an example heres a working mod using the current official mod loader\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022yunQZxsJ6j.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002225.64\u0022 height=\u0022242\u0022 width=\u0022944\u0022 src=\u0022https://linuxbad.com/yunQZxsJ6j.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224300761\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217495\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221688835287\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107109\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kavaeric\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 minutes ago, Kavaeric said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndisagree with what ShadowDev said: I \u003Cem\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E want to have to choose between three different methods of accomplishing the same thing, because that means I\u0027m making a commitment to that method/tool.

Reading this thread and elsewhere I understand what folks like Lux and ShadowDev say regarding the benefits of packaging assets into bundles, for the sake of performance and load times for players\u2014but if I\u0027m honest, during the actual asset development cycle load times of the game are not actually the biggest time sink. Rather, when I\u0027m making my assets I much prefer having to jump through as hoops as possible when I make changes to textures, models, or config settings.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[...]\u003Cbr\u003E\nPerhaps an in-between solution is to have a \u0022dropbox\u0022 modding folder akin to GameData specifically for asset modders to quickly drop in new edits when developing. An \u003Cem\u003Eupgrade\u003C/em\u003E over the KSP1 system could possibly be an in-game asset editor that allowed me to just import edited textures and new models on the fly, similar to Cities Skylines\u0027 editor, cutting out the need to reload the game repeatedly and allowing me to directly view what the asset will look like with the in-game render engine on the fly. In that regard, I don\u0027t think anyone would be opposed to being asked to still bundle their mods for publication at the \u003Cem\u003Eend \u003C/em\u003Eof development.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 style=\u0022font-size:11pt;\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003E\nWe have already had some discussions on this topic at one point, but nothing really became of it, maybe exactly because we didn\u0027t really have any constructive KSP 1 modder feedback and the people modding KSP 2 were at this point already used to the Unity bundling process, so it seemed unnecessary to go through the strenuous effort of making this possible, since the game was simply not built in a way to support anything like this. So thank you for bringing it back up, because I think it\u0027s a very important discussion to have, and we should definitely reopen it, especially with a new perspective being brought into the mix. Most of us KSP 2 modders never did work on KSP 1 modding, so that\u0027s exactly why we want to hear what the community considers important, what we should be focusing on, and how we can make the transition as smooth as possible!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022font-size:11pt;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EOne thing I\u0027ll say now about this specific point is that it\u0027s very important it be discussed very thoroughly\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan lang=\u0022cs\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022cs\u0022\u003E, because it\u0027s very much a double-edged sword. While I can see how much value it could add by making the process of iterative development and testing of for example part mods, I can also imagine it could be abused in mods releases to the point where the situation would devolve into a KSP 1 no-optimization-whatsover 30-minute-loading-times situation. For that reason my proposal would be to *somehow* only make this tool/system available in \u0022developer installs\u0022 of SpaceWarp, and still enforce the actual mod releases to use the Unity bundling pipeline for the best of both worlds.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224300761\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217495\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221688835287\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107109\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kavaeric\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Kavaeric said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EI am turned off by the competing standards of the modding tools of KSP2. \u003C/strong\u003EA lot of this can be chalked up to the fact that KSP2 is still early in development and so many of the standards or solutions haven\u0027t yet crystallised. Nonetheless, if you are asking us what is stopping us from picking up modding \u003Cem\u003Enow\u003C/em\u003E, this is still worth emphasising. I\u0027ll go one step further and actually disagree with what ShadowDev said: I \u003Cem\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E want to have to choose between three different methods of accomplishing the same thing, because that means I\u0027m making a commitment to that method/tool. As a beginner I inherently do not have the knowledge or background to confidently choose which avenue would work best for me.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHaving multiple competing standards itself too becomes a barrier to community as well. Much of the modding effort in KSP1 is still very collaborative, and often spontaneously so: in the last week, Atomic, LinuxGuruGamer, and a few others patched themselves together into a team of like four people to work on a new mod in the span of a few hours and have already produced some concepts and assets. This is only possible because for a given type of asset there is a single unified approach to making it in KSP1, and so everyone merely needs to find which part of the assembly line they need to drop in. It\u0027s not the best pipeline, of course, but the fact that it is a single standard and that I can approach anyone and know they can slot into a project gives me a lot of confidence both when making mods and requesting help as a beginner. With many of the biggest mods in KSP1 being highly collaborative efforts (even one-man army Nertea didn\u0027t work alone), the fact that KSP2 modding still has not honed in on a singular standard of how to make a basic part config makes me hesitate.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022font-size:11pt;\u0022\u003E\nAs for competing standards, that\u0027s actually a very rare situation so far in the KSP 2 modding community - the absolute majority of people modding KSP 2 are all in one Discord server, where they all discuss their mods and libraries, and we\u0027ve had many discussions about how to best go about certain decisions that affect the community as a whole - for example deciding to strictly use BepInEx as a mod loader and make SpaceWarp only an API which uses BepInEx as a backend, and many other similar situations. Actually the singular case I can think of where there were two sort of \u0022competing\u0022 mods/libraries is exactly what Shadow mentioned, that being Patch Manager and his Konfig. However, even though you can achieve similar results using Patch Manager as you can with Konfig, the target audiences and even the scope and purpose of the two mods is very different. While Konfig is a simplified C# syntax tool for the runtime patching of some select game objects such as parts or celestial bodies, Patch Manager is trying to be a spiritual successor to Module Manager - it is a comprehensive tool which allows you to patch any and all JSON files in the game (the equivalent of KSP 1\u0027s .cfg files), it has a full custom syntax based on SCSS, a superset of CSS, which many people are already familiar with - even non-programmers, which we chose exactly for the reason that it\u0027s familiar, easy to understand and the language it\u0027s based on already has a lot of learning materials available. The goal is also for modders to be able to create their own Patch Manager \u0022modules\u0022, through which they can provide a patching system for their own mods, similarly to how you can for example configure Waterfall plumes with Module Manager in KSP 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022font-size:11pt;\u0022\u003E\nAnd when it comes to collaborative efforts, I also think that the KSP 2 modding community is also very much full of team players - we have modders working together every day to help each other create and improve our mods, or joining forces to make mods together, such as me and \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/226483-cheese3660/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022226483\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/226483-cheese3660/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@cheese3660\u003C/a\u003E working on the aforementioned Patch Manager (which I\u0027m very grateful for, because my knowledge of language parsing is nothing next to hers).

I don\u0027t actually do modding for its own sake; I got into modding because I identified a gap in the game that I think should be addressed. I\u0027d argue many of the biggest projects in KSP1 stemmed from this motivation of identifying a gap and then building a mod to address it: Nertea\u0027s entire suite is about extending the stockalike experience; ReStock was about refurbishing and standardising the appearance of the stock parts; Beale\u0027s new WaterDrinker was made following dissatisfaction with the aging Firespitter framework; my own WIP mod was itself spurred from a desire for more Nertea-like parts. With the current development state of KSP2 being so early, the approach of \u0022identify gap, make mod to address gap\u0022 doesn\u0027t work because there aren\u0027t gaps so much as enormous voids where work hasn\u0027t even started. This is not to disparage the efforts of the KSP2 dev team and I have confidence they will follow through on the roadmap, but the reality is is that getting us to mod a game so early in development is akin to asking an interior designer to have a go at re-arranging the dining room furniture for a house that has barely completed building its foundations.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPlus, with the competing standards and ambiguity of the exact features of the roadmap going forward, there is an inherit gamble in spending effort in something that may be folded into the core experience or otherwise rendered irrelevant.

And I don\u0027t even really disagree, I\u0027m well aware that a lot of our mods will either get broken sooner or later, or won\u0027t be needed at all with future updates. I cannot really speak for anyone else here, but what I will say for myself is that the reason I got into KSP 2 modding in the first place was because despite how much I love KSP 1, I never managed to really get into developing mods for the game myself, it always seemed like pretty much anything I could imagine myself wanting in the game was already made by someone else. KSP 2 is a new frontier, a place where we can learn from the mistakes made in KSP 1 modding, and improve on it, and even if some of our current mods will be deprecated at some point, to me it\u0027s still worth the effort knowing that there will be some people who otherwise might not have even kept playing the game, but did because we helped improve the experience for them. It probably won\u0027t be worth the time investment to a large number of people, and that\u0027s totally ok \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0We just want to know if there are perhaps some people who *do* want to get into KSP 2 modding but are hesitating, and we want to make the experience as nice as possible for them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022font-size:11pt;\u0022\u003E\nOnce again, thank you for all your feedback and I hope we can continue this discussion to make KSP 2 modding better for everyone!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-07-08T19:01:48Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2023 07:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by munix\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GGG-GoodGuyGreg","CreatedById":226561,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-08T18:25:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry but I think this is the best place to ask this with so many Moders here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan someone ELI5 for normies like me how much easier would official mod support make it when modding the game and what would official mod support look like?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, is there any type of mod that can\u2019t be done or is much harder to do because of this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022;p\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/971609041_P.png\u0022 title=\u0022;p\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-07-08T18:26:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2023 06:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by GGG-GoodGuyGreg\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LuxStice","CreatedById":149802,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-08T18:34:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224300775\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217495\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221688840728\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022226561\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GGG-GoodGuyGreg\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 minutes ago, GGG-GoodGuyGreg said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan someone ELI5 for normies like me how much easier would official mod support make it when modding the game and what would official mod support look like?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, is there any type of mod that can\u2019t be done or is much harder to do because of this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure!\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat most devs mean by \u0022Official mod support\u0022 is mostly just a publicized API for modders to work with, along with some tools inside the engine (or even inside the game) for modders to play with.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe API would be something like a set of classes that players can extend from to create their own mods, modules and more.

If we showed up to any kind of meeting with work in hand where we wanted to show colleges, customers, our boss, or anyone something and we used KSP as the means to do it we\u0027d be laughed out of the room.

I\u0027d personally love to see them release those today, but I doubt we\u0027ll see them until v 1.0 at the earliest. In the meantime, I think we\u0027ve got a pretty good set of documentation that is in fact easily extensible by our community. Perhaps the state of KSP2 documentation is not so bad relative to what was on hand when KSP\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C/sup\u003E modding began? So, clearly, having the dev\u0027s own XML files would be ideal, but is that really the point at which KSP2 modding should begin?

My hunch is we\u0027re not likely to see that during EA. The devs have more important things to focus on than this, plus they may view their own code as being too volatile - which would make a task like this something that\u0027s just not worth doing at this stage.
