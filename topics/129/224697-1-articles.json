The player agency flag can act as the sponsor, and decals could vary depending on the part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRacetrack parts could also be nice, and could possibly be created similarly to colonies in the future. A unique way of spawning players that doesn\u0027t involve runways or launchpads, but rather something more like a garage or pit area could also be useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
