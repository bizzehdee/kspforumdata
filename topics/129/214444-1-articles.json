You have made KSP1 one so much better for years, and KSP 2 more playable from almost day 1. Yall are amazing =)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow hard is UI scaling? I see there is a mod already out for scaling the games default UI, but havent used it yet, the default scale is ok for now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am having some big issues with mod UIs however. I am currently only running a few mods, IT calculator, Stage Info, and Maneuver Node Controller. All 3 are just this side of unusable for me as they are WAY to small. Would it be possible to add UI scaling to a mod at this point without messing with the game UI? I have never modded a UI so no clue what goes into it. I do play in 4k(16:9), not sure if thats important or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InterstellarDrifter","CreatedById":223181,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-10T03:26:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003Einterested in this ^^^\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
