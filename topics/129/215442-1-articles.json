It would be helpful to have for Debugging issues in game. To help determine if it is an issue with the Mod or the Base Game. Instead of having to delete/move the plugin folder in the install drive. I know that some Mod Devs include, mod configuration menu to enable/disable some options of their mod. But I am looking for a enable/disable of the whole mod. Any thoughts on this?

For some context, this functionality was already present in SpaceWarp 0.3 when it still was its own modloader, but was removed in 0.4\u002B with the switch to BepInEx as a modloader, since it doesn\u0027t have that capability.
