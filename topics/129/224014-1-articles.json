They can also be used as improvised rocket pods or guns.\u00A0Even if someone makes a firework part (for instance, an XS \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E with a nose and fins, and timed detonation for beautiful explosion) that doesn\u0027t rely on a launcher for storage or use, the same basic principles apply. you don\u0027t need to use it peacefully, you don\u0027t need to use it humanly. you could even make a part that is an aerodynamic shroud with a launcher, and use it in space for either a show with no gravity or a round of target practice in space. a mouse-following turreted launcher can be useful if the player doesn\u0027t want to shoot fireworks at the same latitude and longitude constantly, and can also be used for an unguided surface-to-air launcher or MLRS. A turreted launcher primarily designed for horizontal motion could be used for the same thing, but more ideally suited for radial attachment, or it could be used as a firearm on a dune buggy or something similar. in vice-versa, a turret with more vertical motion could be useful for the same purpose as other turreted firework launchers, but designed for mounting on the top of a craft, and the part could also be used for artillery.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDrop tanks can be used as tools to extend the range of an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E or aircraft ejected once safely away from a surface base or rover, and they can be used as improvised bombs, which can be ejected once depleted or when there is still fuel inside. IIRC, the B-58s external tank, (at least the pylon for it), was also used for a nuclear bomb. similar concept here, but not as deadly.
