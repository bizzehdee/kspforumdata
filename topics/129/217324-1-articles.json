It should be unlocked through a progression system, full on manual being the first step. Then progressing to a limited autopilot system before progressing to full on hands-off docking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I absolutely think learning to dock is one of the fundamental skills that needs to be encouraged rather than \u0027modded around\u0027. It\u0027s how we did it in the real world, the guys on Gemini and what no didn\u0027t have the same automation as Crew Dragon for example.\u00A0 The game needs progression in that respect to reward players for learning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cfloutier","CreatedById":227493,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-07T10:01:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m currently creating a docker autopilot.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI totally agree with you. the game needs progression. i\u0027ll try, like mechjeb did, to forbid some pilot in campain mode at the beginning. it should be available only after success in manually doing maneuver and docking.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni\u0027ll try to add this in the tech tree\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
