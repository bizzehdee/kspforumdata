Here are a few points for you to consider:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDecide for yourself what you want for your gameplay the most, whether the soonest or you will use the most in the long term. Use this for the priority of the parts you ultimately want to make.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStart small. Make a tank, a nose, a wing, a structural adapter or a utility with simple shape for the crafts that you like to build the most (like a better \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E for a nuclear ship or a heatshield with an odd shape or a 1.25m resource converter of some kind).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nExpect to spend a lot of time on these parts. Iterating, revising and redoing is a thing you\u0027ll have to deal with and you might actually enjoy.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGet good at these then make something a little flashier and more challenging like a wing and elevon, a better looking resource converter or a wheel. Or you can jump right into making crewed parts and their IVAs like some other part makers.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSince you really like SolidFuel for some reason, make simple shaped engines. They\u0027re not scary like you may think but you can get sucked into how much detail they might demand, and making engines for every occasion.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nParts don\u0027t need you to learn Python or other real programming languages... unless you want them to have some behavior that doesn\u0027t exist in the stock modules such as tanks visibly changing according to how full they are.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEither learn to make your own textures or divide your models into meshes per surface color with multiple procedural materials. This latter bit can be a tax on KSP\u0027s performance but it\u0027s better than ending up leaning on and finding someone to texture your parts for you. You won\u0027t enjoy being in that place.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SilverCrown","CreatedById":230789,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-03T16:52:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou know how they say Rome wasn\u0027t built in a day? The same principle applies to modding things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo one can tell you what you should do; that decision is entirely up to you. However, starting small and building up piece by piece may be better than jumping in the deep end. Or for a more contemporary simile:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure, you\u00A0can try to learn calculus without knowing algebra, but it\u0027s like building a house on sand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
