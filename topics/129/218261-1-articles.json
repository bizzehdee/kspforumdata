We fully understand that your priorities lie elsewhere at the moment and that although you\u0027ve certainly supported us in spirit, you\u0027ve necessarily and wisely focused your energy on making EA a better game day by day, and patch by patch. We would not ask you to divert your focus away from this as it\u0027s clearly well-placed and the time will come soon enough when you\u0027ll be able to return to the groundwork you\u0027ve laid for modding support and complete that part of your mission. Thank you! Thank you for your focus on making the game better, and for not diverting from that focus no matter how much your hearts may be with us as we work on modding KSP2 to do our part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETo the KSP1 modding community we would also like to extend heartfelt thanks!\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ve inspired us in so many ways, and have done so much to pave the way proving what is possible. We\u0027re challenged every day to achieve things like the great contributions you\u0027ve made to KSP1 before us. That said, we also respect your choice to wait for official support. We do know that we\u0027re proceeding at risk in that when that support does arrive we\u0027ll have a bit of work transitioning over to that, but we respectfully disagree with this position. We believe there are important contributions and investments to be made now, and that for all the headache that the transition to a future official mod loader may be, there\u0027s more to gain by jumping in now than there could ever be by waiting. The choice to jump in is a personal one, of course, and we respect each of your personal decisions just as we respect the enormous contributions you\u0027ve made to KSP1. If you\u0027ll bear with me, I hope to try to sway you on your position - or at least to offer a perspective from someone who is new to modding but not to KSP or this community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should note here that I refer to these communities as being distinct only because the previous open letter self-identified as being from \u0022the KSP1 mod developer community\u0022 and it seems there are very few (possibly no) active KSP2 modders who are or were KSP1 modders. We wish this weren\u0027t the case and there was more of a common KSP Modding Community, but it seems as if this is how things are today. Perhaps we can work together to change this and enjoy an even larger common modding community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETo the KSP2 players, if you\u0027ve been hesitant to try out KSP2\u0027s mods for \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0reason we want to encourage you to take another look!\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2 modding rapidly converged on a single open-source mod loader, and today there are already lots of great mods available for KSP2.

Some fix bugs, some improve the UI/QoL, some add new parts, and some new features and capabilities. Sadly, the E in EA stands for Early, not Easy. That\u0027s OK, mods are here today to help make things easier and more fun for you!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you say \u0022I don\u0027t want to use mods because they\u0027re not officially supported yet\u0022, then I can happily point you to comments IG has made indicating they \u003Cem\u003Edo \u003C/em\u003Esupport modding even if they don\u0027t have an official mod loader yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you say \u0022I don\u0027t want to use mods because they make the game too easy - I play at the Val level and not below\u0022, well then, my hat\u0027s off to you! But, OTOH, even playing a Val-level game wouldn\u0027t you kinda like a few bugs fixed or maybe some new parts to play with? I mean there\u0027s hard. and then there\u0027s just hurting yourself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you say \u0022I don\u0027t play with mods \u0027cause installing them is too complicated\u0022, then I\u0027ll ask you - have you heard of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E? \u0027Cause \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s heard of KSP2 mods!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you say \u0022I don\u0027t use mods yet because my poor potato can barely play the game and I don\u0027t want to give it even more to do which would make the game slower\u0022, then you might want to take a fresh look at that. With patch 0.1.3 the devs have delivered a significant performance boost for lower and mid-range systems. Also, the KSP2 modding society has been working on transitioning mods to use UITK for their GUI which is more performant than IMGUI.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally, in closing...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDear KSP1 modders,\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI promised I\u0027d try to sway you, so here\u0027s my pitch. There\u0027s a lot of value in making mods now, and the field is still wide open for contributions. Players need fixes! Players need new parts! Making mods now helps sustain the energy and keep people playing. Making mods now adds fun to the game and moreover gives you the opportunity to help shape the future of mods and modding in KSP2. Don\u0027t you want to be a part of that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe know things seem uncertain, and your time is very valuable, but I can tell you from personal first-hand experience that the KSP2 modding community is alive and well, and they will welcome you with open arms! There\u0027s a ton of good work that goes on in the background, much of it geared toward making libraries and templates that accelerate modding. The KSP2 modding community is a vibrant and positive thing full of people who will happily help you get your feet on the ground while your eyes are focused on the stars above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCome on in! The water\u0027s fine!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you feel similarly and would like to add your signature to this please post in the comments below and I\u0027ll do my best to keep this up to

KSP2\u00A0 was a way to have a fresh start and restart from basics to build my skill up. And it\u0027s been a fun ride so far! I\u0027d like to add that, coming from KSP1 modding, biggest difference are the load times. When it takes mere seconds to load the game (on average 7-10 seconds for me), then it becomes much more enjoyable to itterate through your design and removes the frustration you have when you forget to do some simple thing and now you have to wait additional 10-15 minutes for the game to load again. That\u0027s especially important when doing UI as that\u0027s something for which you have to load the game in order to see how it looks. Also, having a\u00A0WYSIWYG principle when working with UITK in Unity Editor\u0027s UI Builder is another enjoyment. And it\u0027s only going to get better as more tools for modding are being introduced, from IG and from KSP modders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt saddens me to see stuff being written as \u0022we, the KSP1 modders\u0022 and \u0022we, the KSP2 modders\u0022 indicating that those are 2 separate \u0022tribes\u0022.

KSP2 will continue to improve enabling more players and modders to fully enjoy it, and our modding infrastructure will continue to improve lowering the barrier to entry for those who want to try it out or make the jump from KSP1. Even now there are active discussions on the KSP2 Modding Society discord focused specifically on how we can apply lessons learned from KSP1 and how we can minimize the impact of the eventual official mod loader. I want people to know that we\u0027re not a bunch of hacking hooligans, but in fact, are quite dedicated to making the game better now and doing things in smart ways to lay the groundwork for more modding. In the nearer term, I would really like to put to rest the goofy notion that modding KSP2 is not a good idea or that KSP2\u0027s mods should not be used for some reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the landscape for modding has changed significantly in positive ways since the KSP1 modders wrote and signed their open letter.

That is a significant thing and its impact should not be underestimated. There are numerous ways in which lessons learned from KSP1 modding have been brought to bear on how we do things in KSP2, although there are still very few KSP1 modders who\u0027ve taken the plunge to develop anything in KSP2. \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/89536-halban/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002289536\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/89536-halban/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Halban\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0is one notable exception, and he made one of the most used mods for KSP2 very early on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-09T13:51:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224300490\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218261\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221688743466\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022228285\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Falki\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/7/2023 at 11:24 AM, Falki said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsaddens me to see stuff being written as \u0022we, the KSP1 modders\u0022 and \u0022we, the KSP2 modders\u0022 indicating that those are 2 separate \u0022tribes\u0022.

As KSP1 came out, a decade-or-so ago, we were all much younger.

There\u0027s no arguing with either of those - facts are facts, whether we like \u0027em or not. As KPS2 develops, bugs are driven out, and features driven in, well, I think the player base will gradually migrate. I believe this is inevitable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see two things from this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, even if KSP1 modders are disinclined to jump in now and begin modding KSP2, there\u0027s a lot of collected wisdom and perspective in that camp that we (KSP2 modders) need to tap into. Hopefully, even if they\u0027re not yet interested in modding KSP2 they may nevertheless be willing to offer some of their hard-earned wisdom and perspective. We would be very wise to listen to them!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, we may be able to very slightly hasten this process, or at least give it a boost once the player migration begins to take hold. If we (KSP2 modders) can pave the road with some good mods that help to fill gaps players know they\u0027d miss if they were to leave KSP1, then as the bugs are driven out and features are driven in we may just succeed in helping this migration to take place. I think we\u0027re doing exactly that, and from what I\u0027ve seen I think we\u0027re succeeding. Let\u0027s not neglect Point One above, but let\u0027s press on with Point Two.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA corollary to point two would be we should also be listening to KSP1 modders to help make sure we\u0027re paving the road for them as well. Again, I think (or certainly hope) that we are. With a potentially viable Patch Manager in the works and with templates and API docs, etc., I think we\u0027ll not only make our own work easier but may also help pave the road for KSP1 modders to have an easier transition themselves once they\u0027re inclined to do so. We may not be able to motivate them to come over, but we can listen to them and learn and try to make things easier for everyone down the road.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VITAS","CreatedById":124625,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-18T16:58:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second Album is the hardest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GGG-GoodGuyGreg","CreatedById":226561,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-18T20:07:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224303821\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218261\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221689699485\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022124625\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022VITAS\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, VITAS said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second Album is the hardest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEspecially when it\u2019s attempted by a cover band.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
