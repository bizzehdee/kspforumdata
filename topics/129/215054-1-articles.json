I just came over from the dark side (xbox console) to PC for KSP2. Never applied mods on a PC game yet. Can someone give a brief explanation on why there are two Mod Install managers (BepInEx and SpaceWarp). And why some modS are now saying that you need BepInEx as part of SpaceWarp. Before I dive into installing mods, I\u0027d like to understand this. Before I blow something up by making a mistake. Though that is the Kerbin way.... Thanks in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"munix","CreatedById":212686,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-15T00:23:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEarlier versions of SpaceWarp worked as a mod loader, which is what BepInEx also is. Since SpaceWarp 0.4, it instead became itself just a mod for BepInEx which serves as a common library for modders to make their work easier. So, there\u0027s just one mod loader in use now - BepInEx - and all mods are loaded through it. Most mods also require SpaceWarp to be installed because they use it as a library. For convenience, there is a package containing both BepInEx and SpaceWarp in one .zip file to make installation easier for users:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://spacedock.info/mod/3277/Space%20Warp%20\u002B%20BepInEx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESpace Warp \u002B BepInEx on SpaceDock\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-15T00:28:59Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2023 12:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by munix\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LeroyJenkins","CreatedById":227115,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-15T00:29:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n@munix.
