Let me try to explain with these wonderful MS Paint diagrams I whipped up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first is pretty simple to visualize; take a cross-section of the wing and look at it from the side, it would look something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Xsthdx9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Xsthdx9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere the green dot is where the location of the wing\u0027s AC at subsonic speeds while the red dot is the location of the wing\u0027s AC at supersonic speeds, assuming the airflow comes from the left. This effect happens to some extent with all aerodynamic shapes, causing objects to become slightly more statically stable at supersonic speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second effect can be explained this way; for a wing, lift is determined as a contribution of camber effects and angle of attack effects; camber is just how \u0022curved\u0022 the wing is compared to the airflow, while the angle of attack is the angle between the airfoil reference line and the incoming air; more camber and more angle of attack cause greater lift if stalling doesn\u0027t occur. The image below draws the reference lines and profiles for an airfoil with and without flaps deflected:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jg3FwjW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jg3FwjW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat the image shows is that an increase in control surface deflection increases the camber \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E the effective angle of attack of the wing, both which increase lift. However, camber only produces lift at subsonic speeds; it is entirely dependent on the airflow at the trailing edge of the wing being able to affect the airflow at the leading edge of the wing. Once in supersonic flow the only way changes in lift can be achieved is through increases in the angle of attack of the wing; camber will only increase drag. This would be the result of any roll controls feeling sluggish at high speeds, since they\u0027re less effective at Mach \u0026gt; 1 than at Mach \u0026lt; 1. This is also why supersonic planes fare better with all-moving tailplanes / canards than tails with separate elevators.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing to take away from this is that your plane is becoming more statically stable in both pitch and yaw and that your wings and control surfaces stop being effective at lifting when you switch from subsonic to supersonic flight. You will have to either make your plane less statically stable to handle this and/or you will have to use more control surfaces to give you greater control authority. If you want to learn more, just try searching for \u0022supersonic flow\u0022 or \u0022transonic flow\u0022 on Google and you should find a bunch of relevant stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*I dislike the term \u0022Center of Lift\u0022 because it seems to imply that the only aerodynamic force that needs to be accounted for in determining stability is lift; it also seems to imply that there is a separate \u0022Center of Drag\u0022 that would be located somewhere else on the craft, confusing otherwise intelligent people by giving them something else to worry about / try to calculate when there is no need to do so. Aerodynamic center lacks those implications / problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galacticruler","CreatedById":58398,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-16T12:51:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile that is true for real life, that is incorrect in KSP, the aerodynamic model does not work that way AFAIK.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-16T19:25:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou entirely didn\u0027t read that he is using FAR ( how? it\u0027s in big letters in the thread title ), and the author of FAR made the post above yours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerocentre is unfortunately not a KSP term yet; ferram, maybe FAR ought to rename the button? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ( thanks for clarifying the thing I saw in my head and couldn\u0027t get the words to explain, btw ).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rakutenshi","CreatedById":40086,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-16T22:54:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve dealt with this problem partially by using Infernal Robotics/Pwings to make full moving canards to function as pitch trim, it doesn\u0027t quite override the mach tuck entirely, but it does help a lot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWays to help deal with mach tuck also include making the wings more delta than swept (a thicker chord with a swept leading edge reduces the effects of mach tuck on the control surfaces of the trailing edge), building some trim into the horizontal stabilizer/canards (i.e. set trim before takeoff), or simply having more thrust to punch through the trans-sonic envelope before it\u0027s much of an issue. as for the loss of pitch authority, try using B9\u0027s stabilators instead of normal control surfaces. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the VAB, I make extensive use of the Static Mach Sweep displays.
