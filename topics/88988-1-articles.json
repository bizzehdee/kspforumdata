I usually make landers with three radially-decoupled fuel tanks and small engines around the return module. I place the lander legs on the decoupled fuel tanks so that the lander has a wide stance which can safely tolerate shallow slopes. It also helps to keep your lander short so that it has a low center of gravity, and that\u0027s easier to do when the spare fuel is kept to the sides rather than vertically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPlanning:\u003C/strong\u003E It\u0027s usually a good idea to establish a low orbit and swing around once or twice to scope out possible landing sites. It\u0027s also generally best to attempt landings on the current daytime side so that you\u0027ll have good illumination to help you spot slopes and avoid them early on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPiloting:\u003C/strong\u003E If you\u0027ve picked out a landing site that seemed okay, but looks sloped when you get closer to it, then it\u0027s best to fire up the engines and move a little bit so you can get a safer landing site. Apollo 11 had to do exactly this when Neil Armstrong noticed that their intended landing site actually had a lot of boulders strewn about, so he was forced to make the landing a short distance away from the original target. As always, make sure to get rid of horizontal velocity before trying to go down to the surface. Have SAS on (and RCS if available) in the last few seconds before you touch down so that rotation induced by the landing can be minimized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERecovery:\u003C/strong\u003E If you\u0027ve done your very best to avoid tipping on the landing but you still find that you\u0027re about to tip over, you should immediately go to full throttle to bounce yourself away from the surface. You\u0027ll most likely need to correct a tumble, and you\u0027ll often have less than 30 seconds to do it. If you don\u0027t maintain full control during the bounce, you should kill the throttle as soon as the lander is aimed more down than up, then stabilize your lander, give yourself a short burn upwards to buy some extra time, correct any horizontal velocity you might have picked up and try again. When in doubt, just remember that it\u0027s always safer and less expensive to retrieve kerbals from orbit than it is to retrieve them from the surface of a planet or moon. As such, don\u0027t worry too much about wasting a little fuel on the landing - it\u0027s better to err on the side of caution and get the landing right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-31T05:11:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, hitting the ground with horizontal velocity can tip over even a wide flat lander.

Sometimes I don\u0027t even make a \u0022lander\u0022 - I just put a couple SAS modules on my rocket and lay it down wherever I happen to end up. When it\u0027s time to leave I use the torque to lever the thing straight up and fire the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe others are right, though. Wide landers with a low center of gravity are the way to go. Make sure you kill all your horizontal velocity, and the steeper the slope the slower you need to touch down. SAS helps too, since it means you can put all the weight on the up-slope legs and gently lower the others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a basic Mun lander, instead of having one tall tank I\u0027ll split my fuel into four tanks and attach three radially from the center. The legs go on the outside, so the thing ends up looking more like a spider than a tower. Also, you don\u0027t need to attach the legs flush against your ship - if you have the clearance you should angle them outward to increase your footprint even further.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RexKramer","CreatedById":76862,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-31T06:01:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would add to the previously stated is I rarely put landing legs on landers. Almost never, actually. Generally, if you get your velocity to less than 5 m/s, you won\u0027t damage engines or whatever is on the bottom. The impact tolerance of parts is listed in the VAB menu. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, the above suggestions all work well. Build wide and low landers. Radial mounted tanks help keep your center of mass low.

Instead, plan enough fuel to skim the surface maybe 1000m up, at a modest horizontal speed. When you find a flat(ish) landing spot, stop your horizontal motion and drift down. This takes more fuel than a suicide-burn drop, but leaves you more options.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-31T07:15:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe same way RL landers do it: carrying enough fuel to land somewhere flat \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing SAS is cheating IMHO.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-31T07:18:01Z\u0022 title=\u002210/31/2014 07:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by steve_v\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrMonte","CreatedById":90841,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-31T07:21:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMake your lander untippable (if such word exist).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith no intention I made one so wide that a Kerbal was not able to stand near it.
