E.g. a group of 4 who want different combinations of Kerbin, Mun, and Minimus. I do a single trip with all 4 in a hitchhiker can, and it doesn\u0027t matter that some get an unrequested visit to an extra place. All that matters is expiry time for the contract, and getting all of the tourists safely round their preferred places then back to Kerbin, as far as I know.\n\nI\u0027d bet on one of the following:\n\n- Time expired.\n- The message was actually about a different contract.\n- Some mod is interfering with the contract.\n\nCould be something else though, could even be an obscure stock bug.\n\nDo you have any mods installed?"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T14:50:05Z","Content":"Did you get an actual \u0022Failed\u0022 message (like you do when contracts are completed)? And is the contract no longer listed in the \u0022active contracts\u0022 tab? If so, then that sounds like a bug. Otherwise, if it\u0027s just a red x next to \u0022Landed on Minmus\u0022 or something like that in the in-flight contract window, then that\u0027s probably just indicating that the person is currently on the wrong planetary body currently and when you take them to the correct one I imagine it will still work (after all, the contract is still active, meaning you haven\u0027t failed it).
