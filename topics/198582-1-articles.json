We were able to solve this on the arduino side however.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help/advice is greately appreciated. Is there some kind of check we need to make before toggling a group within the mod? or somekind of method to override?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
