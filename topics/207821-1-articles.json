An Arcjet thruster is a type of electrical thruster, however unlike an ion engine it does not rely on ionizing the gas to create thrust, and it is also able to generate much more thrust with much less power input, however the specific impulse is significantly lower.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe secret is that they\u0027re an electro\u003Cem\u003ETHERMAL\u003C/em\u003E thruster.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat that means is that they take the reaction mass and use electricity to heat it to high temperatures before shooting it out of a rocket nozzle to create thrust. Just like a nuclear thermal rocket, except in this case the heat comes from electricity and not nuclear reactions.\u003Cbr\u003E\nArcjets use an electrical arc as the heating element.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLess sophisticated electrothermal thrusters are Resistojets, which basically run the reaction mass thru a chamber containing a higher power version of the heating element out of a blow dryer.\u003Cbr\u003E\nArcjets have higher performance than Resistojets because they can heat the propellant to a higher temperature, due to the temperature of the propellant not not being limited by the melting temperature of the heating element, instead the maximum amount of power used is limited by the melting point of the material the arc electrodes are made of (both Carbon and Tungsten are good choices for this, due to high melting points and acceptable electrical characteristics).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow to the incredibly great thing about Arcjet thrusters: They don\u0027t emit any ionizing radiation, which means they can be placed ANYWHERE that can withstand the loads imposed by the thrust they produce, and that has access to a sufficient source of electrical power.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis means that you could design a craft with a high-power nuclear reactor (perhaps the drive itself operating to generate electricity instead of thrust, perhaps an entirely separate reactor generating ONLY power), way out on a long truss (with a shadow shield) to keep the radiation down in the habitation sections of the craft, and yet still have the ability to place large, high performance high thrust \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters practically wherever you want to put the \u003Cabbr

At the same time, Vernors can be overkill, say on a orbital fuel transfer vessel built around a Rockomax Jumbo-64 fuel tank (the longest 2.5m tank). You might end up having a hard time docking that craft if the fuel is nearly depleted.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(END EDIT)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow this next thing will improve the responsiveness of any craft, but it really becomes mandatory with these large craft:\u003Cbr\u003E\nPrimarily, the vessel should be designed so that the \u0022heavy bits are in the middle\u0022, meaning that only the things that are radioactive (power reactor if any, as well as likely the drive) should go on one end, and just the habitation on the other end (to maximize distance between the two), with both propellant reserves, other accessory equipment like batteries and reaction wheels, and non-crew-containing payloads (such as yet-to-be-landed colony modules) located as close to the center of mass as practical, followed by placing the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E clusters as far apart on the craft as possible (so the ideal locations would be near the drive/reactor section and near the habitation section, but balanced around the average \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe suggested placement of the most massive parts of the craft close to the center of mass minimizes rotational moment-of-inertia, which makes it easier to rotate the craft in the pitch/yaw axes. (as well as minimizing the distance by which the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E shifts as

System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E as distant from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E as possible (but balanced around it) still allows the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E to be used in translation just as it would be if placed anywhere else on the vessel (so long as it\u0027s balanced) , but placing it distant from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E means that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction

\u0022lever arm\u0022 to do so with, thereby increasing the effective torque available to rotate the craft, which again makes it easier to rotate in the pitch/yaw axes.\u003Cbr\u003E\nRoll attitude control is generally not an issue with \u0022long and skinny\u0022 craft, however if it does become an issue the solution is to simply put the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters on girders to space them away from the long-axis of the craft (again, just like with pitch/yaw, this gives the thrusters a longer \u0022lever arm\u0022 to act on when attempting to turn the craft in roll).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI already apply these principles in my craft design, and I\u0027ve never really had any issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike I believe I\u0027ve stated before, the primary blocking issue is availability of high thrust \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, and large docking ports capable of withstanding the force of a large ship\u0027s drive being used to push around another large ship (or being able to construct a large ship in parts and connect drive, truss, payload, propellant, and habitation sections with docking ports, without it wobbling excessively, but it\u0027s fine if you have to reinforce the connection after initial docking with EVA-attached struts or something like that, so long as they actually reinforce the joint unlike what most of the KSP 1 addons that add such things end up doing when designing such gigantic vessels).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(EDIT 2:)\u003Cbr\u003E\nAdditionally, you don\u0027t end up needing forward-facing braking engines if you limit your approach velocity to something reasonable (depending on distance, I limit my docking approach velocity to between 2.5 and 5 meters per second), and fine-tune your rendezvous encounter to be \u0022far enough away to not hit anything but close enough that you don\u0027t need to travel 2km just to target the docking port\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor optimal results this second factor will require planning and adjustment based on how large the vessels you are docking together end up being, with larger vessels resulting in a need to tune the rendezvous for a more distant encounter for orbital velocity matching.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAdditionally, it may be advantageous to further tune the encounter to account for where on the two vessels the docking ports physically are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022
