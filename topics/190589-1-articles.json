Your launch clamps provide a constant supply of electricity but as soon as you decouple them your batteries will drain without some other way of generating power like solar panels, RTGs or fuel cells.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-12-25T20:23:18Z\u0022 title=\u002212/25/2019 08:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 25, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
