HLA shouldn\u0027t be touching IVAs at all as the plugin code for it doesn\u0027t have anything to do with them. Also the failure to leave flight is not a bug if the ship is not landed. If it is airborn then that is a stock KSP thing and is not something I am willing (yet) to have this mod override. If it is, however, refusing do so even when landed then that is a bug.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Biker Joe","CreatedById":82495,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-27T12:35:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo I need to download a seperate thing for the aaa_toolbar or what do I need to do?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TaranisElsu","CreatedById":57742,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T09:06:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFYI: Ferram (creator of FAR and NEAR) made a new mod: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105094\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBetter Bouyancy\u003C/a\u003E!

The second bug I think was being caused by an outdated plugin somewhere, as I saw it once I uninstalled your mod.

I will give it another go and see if I can get it working, if not I will take more details of the problem / mod list and send you a PM.
