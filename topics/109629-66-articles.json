I suspect the kraken-like behavior is because you are using a mod for 1.0.4 on an older version like 0.90 that had the old aerodynamics. Also, you ***REALLY*** should start your gravity turn before you hit 100 m/s. And, please try to make your posts at least understandable (i.e. making sure that you don\u0027t omit any letters and specifiy the units you are talking about, as I have no idea whether 5 means kilometers or meters; and read over it once before you post).
