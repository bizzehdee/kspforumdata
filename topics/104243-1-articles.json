Where is %TMP ? Use any Disk activity monitor to determine what software is accessing HDD during building a thumbnail.\n\nTemp files are on C.\n\nSeems previewing an image file is prompting explorer to execute a bunch of readfiles, and even a couple of write files to the master data table $Directory on the D drive. (desktop is on C with the system files). Even more odd, it\u0027s reading and writing to a couple of game directories that have nothing to with that. This glitch is repeatable. And a quick reminder, this ONLY happens if I preview an image in the desktop folder. Anywhere else on C, this doesn\u0027t happen.\n\nWill probably just try another fresh install and see if it goes away. Seems like somehow it thinks the desktop is on D, even though the file loads properly. Or somehow it wrote the data table for JUST the desktop folder, to D. I can\u0027t imagine that being possible, and if it is, I\u0027d think the system would be terribly unstable.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-16T15:24:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2015 03:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by vger**"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T16:23:00Z","Content":"Is the Indexing Service running?"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T17:10:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is the Indexing Service running?\n\nYes, though I switched it off for the drive it keeps mysteriously accessing.
