I would imagine just one engine, one or two sizes of fuel tanks and the small command module with the smallest parachute, perhaps and the simplest decoupler. Then a science part or two for doing orbital science or something. That would be a pretty okay starting point, I think.

Maybe current engines would start out slightly less powerful/heavier than they are now, and at the end of R\u0026amp;D they\u0027d be slightly more powerful/lighter than they are now. It would solve the whole \u0022IRL rockets are way more powerful than ours!\u0022 thing. I haven\u0027t actually seen the PAX video so I don\u0027t know, but I think it\u0027d make sense to have prop engines instead of jets for planes, but since we have rockets we\u0027d of course have jets too. They just might not be as efficient or useful as props are in the beginning, and as we advance, our jets would get better until they\u0027re around what we have now (they certainly don\u0027t need a buff, IMO)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Animal Mother","CreatedById":2477,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T22:27:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Paul Kingtiger\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Paul Kingtiger\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESomething I noticed in the PAX video was new technologies improving existing parts.
