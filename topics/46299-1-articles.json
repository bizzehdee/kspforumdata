For example, a panel the works best in Laythe\u0027s distance from the sun, but as you get closer to the sun, it is less effecient.

Whether or not electrons are liberated by an incident photon is completely dependent on the frequency of the light, but the volume of electrons liberated is dependent on the magnitude of photon flux on the surface. That is to say, if the light source is going to generate current at all, then it will generate significantly more current closer to the source than away. We don\u0027s really see the effects of that in a lab here on Earth because the distances we can manage in a lab are practically 0 for all intensive purposes. But in space, it is an inverse square law. That is to say if you are at 2 AU, you have 1/4 the intensity of light, so your power generation from the same sized solar cell will be accordingly really small.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"seanth","CreatedById":79989,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-25T00:56:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know I said \u0022solar panel\u0022, but the underlying idea is how to model photosynthetic life that evolved around the orbit of Jool.
