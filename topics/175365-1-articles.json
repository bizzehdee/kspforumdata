I first started building an underwater base, got some ideas on what works underwater (Like what\u00A0sinks what don\u0027t). Then I added drilling capabilities and refueling. The plan was to have Refueling Stations for a Submarine to have the ability to refuel for longer underwater adventures. I was going to set these up so that a Submarine could make trips around the near by Islands. As the project went on Versions changed and plans were changing. The DeepCore7 Rig works well but the Submarines where not cooperating. I plan to complete a small sub that will dock in the Rig\u0027s Docking Bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis has been a really fun project for us and I would like to thank\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/38787-klond/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E@klond\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0for his time and work on this one.

Reduce speed to 1/3 throttle, when 40 m/s is reached kill engines and allow the Rig to coast giving speed as needed to maintain speed between 30 - 40 m/s. You will need to steer tapping D to keep the craft straight. Also Action Keys 0 and 9 can be used for steering onland or in the water. Enter the water near 30 m/s or less. After the craft is fully in the water give full throttle and use 0 and 9 to steer. Warp x2 is ok on the water and allow the Rig to come to a complete stop before releasing the Pontoons. After dive has begun you can use Full Warp to dive near the Ocean Floor. Damage could occur if you land on the bottom at Full Warp. When Rig has settled on the Floor apply brakes if needed to stop all motion then raise the Landing Gear. At this point press Action Groups 1-10 and the Rig will begin Drilling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlans are to release Submarines at a later date which will be able to dock in the Bay Area.\u003Cbr\u003E\nGood Luck have fun and thanks for downloading and enjoying my craft builds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECraft File\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/Castille7/DeepCore7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDEEPCORE-7\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-27T14:38:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2018 02:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Castille7\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-27T16:09:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crane!
