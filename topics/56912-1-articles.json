When I first started and first began achieving orbit, the next problem I had was trying to get to the Mun, but always had funky encounters because my plane was always jacked up... So that being said, work on achieving an equatorial orbit. It\u0027s the next step to success after being able to just achieve orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kilmeister","CreatedById":65062,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T20:39:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome aboard.

You are absolutely right about this game - it is highly enjoyable and extremely addictive. It has replaced (at least for now) a two year addiction to World of Tanks, and when faced with a little gaming time I\u0027m always choosing KSP lately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETips? Don\u0027t be afraid of using some mods. The game is incomplete yet, and the mod community has made some great tools to help out in the meantime. In particular, I find Mechjeb to be invaluable. I don\u0027t use the autopilot features much, but the ability to have the delta-v\u0027s (read: capability) of your rockets calculated for you makes you feel like you\u0027re actually designing intelligently instead of straight trial-and-error. Another useful mod is RCS Build Aid; this lets you place RCS ports accurately to allow for RCS translation maneuvers that don\u0027t induce rotation in your ship. Not a big deal until you try your hand at docking, and then almost a necessity. Lastly, I always have the wiki open on my second monitor, usually to the fantastic delta-v map on the Kerbin page.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JumpsterG","CreatedById":63396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T21:05:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi!
