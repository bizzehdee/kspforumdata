And for Havok I actually have an answer from one of their engineers, back when I interviewed with them nearly a decade ago. The answer is still relevant. Games sell on visuals. Nobody wants to cut their graphics budget to increase physics performance. KSP might be one of the very few games where it\u0027d actually make sense, but overall, there isn\u0027t a market for this sort of thing. And nVidia\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0actually try to make PhysX on GPU a feature, and that didn\u0027t take off for likely much the same reason. Unity never even added support for GPU acceleration in their implementation of PhysX.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, if you are a studio that decides that this is absolutely worth pursuing, because your game is all about the physics, you do have GPU budget to spare, and you want to make your own solver that runs on the GPU, it\u0027s a lot of work. I know exactly what needs to be done, I\u0027ve worked on every relevant component in several studios, and I don\u0027t know if I\u0027d have the time to do it all and come up with something that results in better overall performance than just having Havok run on the CPU. And this is my niche - there\u0027s a handful of engineers in this industry more qualified, and we\u0027re all very expensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf Intercept seriously considered going with GPU physics, we\u0027d see several physics engineers working on this project at the same time, and I\u0027d recognize at least one of these names. The physics engineers who have been working, instead, have very good academic backgrounds, but very little experience in the games industry. These are the kind of people who can take Unity\u0027s physics and make it work with a space game, and I\u0027m sure that\u0027s exactly what they\u0027ve been doing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat genuinely makes me a bit sad. Not for this game specifically, but just as a fan of gaming. I remember being excited when PhysX cards were coming out and imagining a similar climb in the development for game physics would happen as graphics had in the early 10\u0027s and thought since nVidia bought them out that they would be implemented on GPUs similar to how ray tracing is implemented along side rasterization now. I\u0027m guessing there\u0027s just been a great lack of need overall for such a thing though in gaming so far and that\u0027s why there would be such a need for such a specialized group to implement anything of the sort. Were it to be done, what extra potential do you think is there in such a kind of implementation over running on a CPU?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
