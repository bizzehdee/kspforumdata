Then at twenty-five kilometers, she triumphantly hit \u003Cstrong\u003E[1]\u003C/strong\u003E, quickly draining all the oxidant in the tanks... but not before the apoapsis touched space.

Val expertly throttled down to keep the Halberd floating at under 5m/s, and - realising that there was no oxidant for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E - asked Bill to override the cargo\u0027s closed fuel valves.

Val pulled out a Kerbal Space Program flag with a flourish, stabbing it into the ground. As Jeb, Bill and Bob made their way back into the cabin, muttering about the pros and cons of a manoeuvre called \u0027barratry\u0027, optimal chemical compositions and the presence of olivine in the surface compositon respectively, Val stretched her legs for the first time in the six days since she had embarked, jetpacking over to an interesting rock formation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00224ykS7bA.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002253.39\u0022 height=\u0022546\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/4ykS7bA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile it was rather larger and further away than Val had anticipated, she had a very nice ten minutes without Jeb\u0027s bad jokes, Bob\u0027s technobabble and Bill\u0027s eternal keyboard-tapping. Having checked out the rock formation, and how steep the hill was - potentially useable as a runway - she turned around and returned home. When she got there, she went to the cabin, because Bill was distilling his famous dimethyl hydrazine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JkLSFSb.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002253.39\u0022 height=\u0022546\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/JkLSFSb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt sunrise, a couple of Minmus-days later, Val\u0027s headache had finally worn off, and incidentally the liquid fuel tanks were all full and the oxidant was all drained. Val, finally stone cold sober, attempted to open the door connecting the cabin to the cockpit. It was locked, as was (ten minutes later, having found the keys in her suit pocket) the outside door. However, from her pocket kPad, she could still access the speaker systems, which she did. \u0022JEB,\u0022 she screamed, \u0022WHY ARE YOU IN THE COCKPIT?\u0022 \u0022Well,\u0022 Jeb smiled, not picking up on her anger in any way, \u0022Bill says that we don\u0027t have the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E to land on the Mun.

Unfortunately, Jeb had deleted that program. The Vernors began to lift the nose off the ground, and she managed to immediately shut them off. Then Jeb closed the landing gear, to try and rotate while they fell down. Val hit \u003Cstrong\u003E[G]\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 just in time to cause the Halberd to bounce up in the air.

I like Ike! I should land there!\u0022 Gene, who agreed that it was better than landing on Duna without parachutes or landing gear, told him to go ahead and land somewhere with ore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KSMV2JI.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002258.68\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/KSMV2JI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe gigantic fuel tanks easily put him into orbit around Ike, and Adhat began to land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022m9deZPz.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002258.68\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/m9deZPz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuna set over the horizon as he began the suicide burn.

It was quite nice, so he went walking around Ike. Eventually, nearly a year later, a bleep in his helmet told him that the Pike was full of fuel and ore, having dredged it up from somewhere with barely any. Having had a look at Duna\u0027s clouds, he decided to go and look at them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022EFmzD52.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002258.68\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/EFmzD52.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe circularised at about five hundred kilometres, and pointed the ship towards an interesting cloud pattern.

But having no idea where it was, he did not order ships to every single planet. He merely sat and steamed gently in the breeze.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
