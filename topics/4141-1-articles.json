And I wanted to be able to return that habitation module to Kerbin too. This extra weight and length influenced the design from the start. It would need a lot of delta-V and one heck of a lot of parachutes for a safe landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrying a conventional stack of parts quickly made for a dangerously tall and thus unstable lander and trials (oh gods the trials.... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E ) revealed that any mission was likely to end with the lander falling over. So a squatter, lower design was needed and with fuel tanks bolted on the sides the height issue was solved. The \u003Cem\u003EAquarius\u003C/em\u003E is the result of surprisingly few changes to that initial concept, mostly fine tuning the RCS position so it can kill horizontal speed as easily as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I learnt during Kerbin trials was that the RCS tank does not like anything on top of it when landing, it was a point of repeated failures, hence it\\\u0027s position at the bottom of the lander. A second issue was the sudden \\\u0027yank\\\u0027 opening the \\\u0027chutes would give \u003Cem\u003EAquarius\u003C/em\u003E, so the \\\u0027chute on the nose of the lander is opened first to stablise it and then the rest of chutes are deployed. The yank is still there but reduced, and a modification to the staging now deploys the remaining \\\u0027chutes in pairs so the maximum g-force\\\u0027s the lander experiences is below 3.5g.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith careful control enough fuel will remain in the lander to enter orbit over Kerbin and de-orbit close to the KSC (though using RCS to help is often required).
