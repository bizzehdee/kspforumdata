However, it should be noted the dates in the article are not realistic; Lavochkin does not have the staff to have more than one mission in full development at a time, and Exomars has priority. Take into account that there\u0027s a good chance Exomars 2018 will actually end up being Exomars 2020, and this could get shunted well into the 2030s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-16T23:25:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, the russians do have the most experience in landing automatic probes on the moon - and especially with the proposed name of the mission, luna 27, they will be prominent in creating the lander.
