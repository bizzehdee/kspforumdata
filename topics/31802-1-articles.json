I\u0027ve recently begun to use the Kerbal Space Program and I am liking it very much. I have decided to specialize in aircraft, both atmospheric and spacey...ic. Here are my designs (I currently have one):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA2Mk2 \u0022Interceptor\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/swfhfD6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022swfhfD6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesigned in 2013 to be the ultimate solution to strike class aircraft. After 16 failed flight tests, a prototype was achieved that could fly (and land; although an extremely skilled pilot is necessary), and was put into production the same day. Nicknamed \u0022The Deadliest Plane on Kerbal\u0022, as only 4 pilots have ever gotten to the ground with their bodies intact, their craft were less fortunate. The \u0022Interceptor\u0022 can fly about a quarter around Kerbal to deal with domestic engagements. \u003Cem\u003ENote from project leader: Please note that the interceptor is an \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eatmospheric\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E vehicle. A maverick primadonna once tried to take her up to space and her air-dependent turbines failed before the 3/4 mark. He fell into an incredible spin and was only saved by the two outermost engines ripping off, allowing him to correct. He was able to make it back to the station before crashing and burning to death during the landing sequence.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecs: \u003Cem\u003Estill calculating\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrdnance: None\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe A1 \u0022Devil\u0022 and the A2 \u0022Interceptor\u0022 were both lost due to an unfortunate bug I am experiencing with saving craft. Like, they don\u0027t save. At all. If anyone could help me with that, that\u0027d be great. I currently have a workaround by actually taking the autosaves, copying and renaming them, then opening them in a text editor and editing the ship name on the first line. But this is extremely tedious, and I am lazy. A save function should actually work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027m having an issue with her wanting to return to the ground as her center of lift is off. If someone could help me fix it that would be awesome because I know like all of my aircraft will have center of lift issues.
