Here\u0027s a proper explanation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere were already airplanes when the KSC was built. But the KSP didn\u0027t need airplanes yet, because they weren\u0027t powerful enough, being merely propeller planes. Hardly space material. Spinning wings generating thrust was hardly the way of the future. Then advances in propulsion were made by C7 Aeronautics, when the Jet engine was invented. the KSP invested in this technology, and when it was developed, used this for planes. The jet engines were more useful to them than propellers. Aero-Space was born.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is evidence of planes coming before the space program: the old island airfield.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I could have sworn I put this in General KSP discussion. Also I forgot about the part where Maxmaps said on Squadcast that Mk1 Aircraft Parts might be earlier in the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-15T13:35:35Z\u0022 title=\u002201/15/2015 01:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T21:36:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure anyone was looking for a \u0022logical\u0022 explanation. I\u0027ve cracked jokes about landing on the Mun and then someone invented the wheel but those are just jokes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest issue is if I want to make a program that focuses on airplanes, why should I have to build a rocket to start it? There is no good reason even in career that I should be forced into starting with rockets first. Some will argue one way or the other based on realism and what we did on Earth, but this is Kerbin, not Earth, so none of that matter. The tech tree should allow for either option. Start with planes and build more and more powerful planes as the game progresses. Or start with rockets and do the same. Or mix and match.
