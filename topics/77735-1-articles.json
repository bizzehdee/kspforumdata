While unlikely to be flown on the first launch, I feel that laying the groundwork, the mission profile, and the vehical design will not only be useful for this mission, but give the LEO cubesat team something to practice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission has several requirements, most of which are financial bariers. For the purpose of this topic, however, we are ignoring financial concerns. (within reason- no dedicated GTO flight, no RTGs, must fit the u3 cubesat profile, ect)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe the order of discussion should be: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbital Profile- the mission as plotted by K2 calls for a GTO launch, moon flyby, an earth flyby, a mars aerobreak, and phobos landing. But it\u0027s unlikely that we can find a \u0022perfect\u0022 GTO carrier, so figuring out how to loiter to get the best launch angles will tell us D/v requirements and mission duration, which in turn will inform us on how much rad shielding, heat shielding, fuel, and TWR the cubesat will need. It will also inform what science is possible, how powerful the radio will need to be, and other concerns. (For instance, the difference in orbital period between GTO and LTO can fine tune our lunar flyby based on the launch profile without costing us any D/v we wernt already spending)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVehical design- knowing what the craft needs to do, fitting it into a u3 chassis is the next task. Off the shelf components are nice but not nesssary- for the purposes of this thread an eager university student can hand-coil whatever ion drive specs we decide we need, as long as we can give them a solid blueprint. While preliminary studies say 1500 m/s Dv and a 2 year flight plan, that\u0027s assuming a best case launch- we should probably allow for some leeway to line up a proper orbit from whatever GTO ride we get on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience payload- This is what grant money is provided by. The weight and size will be limited by the u3, and by the other essental systems of the craft, but some science can be done by repurposing those essential systems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-16T18:30:33Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2014 06:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Rakaydos\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T18:42:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Within reason\u0022 - that would include Mars aerobraking and landing on Phobos.

You need a way to precisely control trajectory and orientation over months of successive orbits, so you need a way to communicate with the spacecraft and determine its orientation in space.

Aerocapture is using the atmosphere to go from hyperbolic escape orbits to elliptical orbits, and has never been done with interplanetary craft (skip re-entry has been done on Earth, which is sort of similar, but that was from a lunar return and not an interplanetary trajectory). To do an aerocapture, you not only need a very good heatshield system that probably needs to provide a lot of lift as well (to control g-forces), you also need to be able to do it within extremely precise tolerances, and you only have one shot to do so (during which you effectively cannot control what the satellite is doing; the onboard control system needs to be independently able to control the capture maneuver).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-15T20:02:52Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2014 08:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by cpast\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T20:03:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m telling you. \u003Cem\u003EMODEL ROCKET MOTOR\u003C/em\u003E In LEO/GTO\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T20:19:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPrice within reason, not nessesarally objectives within reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if aerocapture is off the table, how much would that add to the required Dv? 1000ms or so?
