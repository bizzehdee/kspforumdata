What a thread\u0027s \u0022star rating\u0022 is doesn\u0027t affect whether or not I\u0027ll read it or post in it. Furthermore, it\u0027s highly subjective and isn\u0027t an efficient method of conveying opinion. (You can rate something highly, which can already be accomplished with rep, or you can rate it lowly, which leads to unwanted negativity like that of the Green Iron Crown disaster.) So, tell me, what do you think of the star ratings? Do you use them? Does a topic\u0027s rating affect how you view the discussion thereof? I think they should be removed for the reasons stated above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-03T02:52:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI never remember it\u0027s there.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frybert","CreatedById":97766,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-03T02:54:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t even see it on mobile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-03T07:49:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah it doesn\u0027t affect anything and (almost) nobody even sees it.
