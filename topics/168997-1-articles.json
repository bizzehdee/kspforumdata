Black holes are black because any light\u00A0that falls in doesn\u0027t have enough velocity to come out again. They (the black part at least) are not made of matter, but are a region of spacetime where the escape velocity is greater than the speed of light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mysterious additional mass of galaxies is problematic not only because of how much there is, but how it affects the movement of stars. We see stars in the outer edges of galaxies moving a lot faster than they should be if there was only normal matter, while stars in the core move more like we\u0027d expect. This doesn\u0027t work out if the mass is concentrated in a central black hole as you (and traditional physics) predict. There seems to be extra mass in the outer regions of galaxies, which we call dark matter. Dark matter also seems to exist way out in intergalactic space in great quantities, so it must not be highly concentrated.

Theory requires rigorous testing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut more importantly and on point, your hypothesis is thoroughly disproven by available data. While black holes accounting for dark matter is an idea that has been put forward, the problem is that we know only about super-massive black holes at the centers of galaxies that have a chance to contribute enough. Gravitational lensing experiments, however, show that dark matter is distributed throughout the galaxy. Distribution is believed to be slightly different than that of luminous matter, but mostly along the same lines. Which means that a few super-massive black holes can\u0027t account for it. And regular sized-black holes we\u0027ve observed can\u0027t account for all the necessary mass - they\u0027d have to be far more common than we observe them to be. Finally, there has been proposals that there are tons and tons of tiny, undetectably small black holes buzzing about the galaxy.
