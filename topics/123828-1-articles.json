I\u0027m late to the game, but downloaded the demo about a month ago and couldn\u0027t put it down. After making (and crashing) several ships in the demo I knew it was time to move on to the real thing. Now I\u0027ve got my kids designing rockets and thinking about orbital transfers. My oldest was so proud to get his space station into orbit around Kerbin that he made me come and see his creation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still trying to figure this thing out, but thus far I have been successful at getting to the Mun, even in Career mode. However -- I\u0027m still having trouble getting my Kerbals back home from the short jumps around the Kerbal system. Oh well, time to dig in an try to get more efficient with my ascents, transfers and mid-course correction burns!

I have Kerbal Engineer installed, but the biggest problem I have is building rockets that don\u0027t lose so much Delta-V when adding more stages. As an example, I had a rocket with a 4.7t payload (space station). I added the first stage with the Rockomax X200-32 and the \u0022Skipper\u0022 engine. I think that had around 3100 dV. I added a second stage with the only difference being the engine -- the \u0022Mainsail\u0022 -- and the total dV was just around 4000 dv. The more I played with it, the less productive the rocket was. I was able to get a rocket with around 6000 dV, but I hit my weight limit of 140t. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still working it out -- perhaps I\u0027m just taking too much \u0022junk\u0022 to the Mun on each trip.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Speadge","CreatedById":145302,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T20:01:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WestDCCS\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WestDCCS\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESpeadge,\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still working it out -- perhaps I\u0027m just taking too much \u0022junk\u0022 to the Mun on each trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, sounds like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas beatz mentioned, check the Manley videos on Youtube. they give really good hints for the startup. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd: always build rockets beginning with the last stage (which needs to come back).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Kerbal engineer you have to be aware of the two different dV scenarios that are displayed: Atmospheric / space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebuild all your stages that are for transfer, orbiting and else with the best ISP(Vac)-Engine you have available.
