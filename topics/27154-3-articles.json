Ultimately, a software programmer at SpaceX already has this worked out and it\u0027ll be implemented on their real rockets eeventually. Too many people here are anti-automation when in reality all modern rockets are automated. Automation is not a cheat, it\u0027s a way to use computer assistance to get more done and not spend time fluttering over basic crap the space industry got over in the 1960s. If I have to write the automation myself then so be it, I\u0027m not going to sit here and whine until someone impliments it.

Secondly, I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s got a powerful scripting backend called \u0027autom8\u0027 that is either capable of doing it or could be capable with some additional parameter monitoring. This might require working with several people. Great. Team efforts are awesome and make stuff happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t consider it insane. I consider it a challenge. I\u0027m willing to invest time in it, not just sit and wait for it to happen.
