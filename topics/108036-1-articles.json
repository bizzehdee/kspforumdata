Anything that reacts has an ideal ratio of reactants, this ratio is called the stoichiometric ratio... and it\u0027s based on an understanding of the reacting molecules and the reaction istelf. For example, Hydrogen and Oxygen can combine and combust. The stable product is water, so each reaction would ideally require two hydrogens and one oxygen. So in terms of mols, it\u0027s a simple 1:2 ratio. Due to different masses, the mass ratio is much different. In terms of atomic mass it\u0027s approximately 88.89% by mass oxygen and about 11.12% by mass hydrogen. About a 1:8 ratio. There are tons of different ratios... one for every reaction that could possibly happen. HHO requires an oxidizer-to-fuel ratio of about 8:1, while RP-1 (kerosene-based rocket propellant) only requires a ratio of about 2.56:1. There\u0027s no innate benefit of any given ratio by itself. The real advantages of different types of fuels depends on energy density (how much energy is released by reacting a given mass of reactants) and exhaust velocity (which affects ISP). Also, toxicity is a commonly looked-at factor... RP-1 is quite safe compared to hydrazine. There\u0027s not much point in simulating any given ratio... the fact that they did it at all just adds some \u0022flavor\u0022 to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T01:50:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlmost nothing runs stoich, though; US engines usually run fuel-rich, both open and closed-cycle (the famous kerolox engines were about 2.25:1, hydrolox at ~5.5 or 6 to 1), whereas the Russians run ox-rich for their open-cycle engines and \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E ox-rich for closed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
