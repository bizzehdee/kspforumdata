I\u0027ve had a lunar can up to 50 g\u0027s for awhile and then it overheated and blew up or spun out and blew up or just got into some horrendous never ending oscillations. I\u0027ve been using empty sepratons and recently I\u0027ve mounted them on I beams that are mounted on a fuselage radially. I can see where the sepratrons lined up on the beam might not all be angled exactly the same way or the correct way. How do I do it the right way? I\u0027ve been using the rotate tool. It appears to have spots where it clicks in. Its not like you can have infinite degrees to choose from.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf radially mounted fuselages and I beams are a bad idea, I didn\u0027t have great luck with mounting on vertical fuselage parts either. Is there some trick I\u0027m missing to get this sort of thing mounted with the perfect angle even though I\u0027m using multiple engines? do I have to choose rigid attachment or whatever? I\u0027ve tried struts. I thought I knew all about struts, but they aren\u0027t working either.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also can\u0027t make any sense of the way rockets or the camera behaves these days on the ascent through the atmosphere. The rocket just decides to flip at some point and become uncontrollable. Sometimes you can blame this on air resistance but other times it happens in the vacuum of space and it just doesn\u0027t make any sense.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VoidSquid","CreatedById":196199,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-11T22:37:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith all due respect, but I truly do not understand your questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe title of your question refers Scott Manley, but in the question itself, nothing regarding him is mentioned, nor an URL is provided.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re talking about high speed or high g-values, where is the question?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is it about \u0022empty separatrons\u0022?

Are you talking about planes, space planes, rockets?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat exactly is your issue with the camera? The camera has nothing to do with a rocket flipping. If a rocket flips in the atmosphere during ascend, first check the aerodynamic forces (F12), probably the center of mass is too close to the center of thrust, and/or the angle of attack is too big. A rocket flipping in space is often caused be a wrongly oriented pod/command module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chik Sneadlov","CreatedById":68474,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-12T00:24:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFunny you should mention the closeness of the thrust to the mass. At one point it looked like they inhabited the exact same spot on my ship. First time ever. I\u0027m trying to build a squat ship. I\u0027ll probably have to stretch it a little.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI saw a Manley video called \u0022your gravity has no power over me\u0022.

Top speed can be almost anything as long as you\u0027re willing to wait, but the ship under constant full thrust will melt in space if you don\u0027t put on radiators. I\u0027ve had it happen after hours of flight sometimes. Also, you can\u0027t thrust while warping in time so it takes forever in real time even at high speeds.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is the best configuration of thrust to center of mass for descents? I\u0027d like to make a powered descent. I am using cheats and empty fuel tanks so I\u0027m very light, but I want a nice stable descent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEmpty separatrons and unlimited fuel cheat on = incredible acceleration. You pull 50 g\u0027s but you can\u0027t slow down or turn them off unless you eject them somehow and then you won\u0027t have any power. If you bring along some other type of engine and fuel, you probably won\u0027t get to\u00A0 pull 50 g\u0027s. Unlimited Fuel cheat alt \u002B f12\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m talking about a rocket. I\u0027ve also been using those radiators that expand in the vacuum of space. They work, but I don\u0027t know how to make a sleek ship with them. They tend to make the ship look pretty lumpy.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dire","CreatedById":12239,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-12T03:34:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe video you mentioned is five years old.
