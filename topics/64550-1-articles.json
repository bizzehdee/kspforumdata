I have a suggestion that Squad should try and put into the game. In career mode, you can finish the tech tree and not even leave the Kerbin SOI, Which bothers me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd a tech tree component for every planet/SOI area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you go to Duna you can get science for the Duna system and planet that might give you [iNSERT PARTS HERE]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will make Science collection make you spread out of the Kerbin\u0027s SOI and into the other amazing planets/moons that KSP has to offer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you like this idea and it gets put into the game!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SofusRud","CreatedById":59276,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-28T22:48:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile I agree that there should be some impetus in career mode to travelling to other planets, I don\u0027t think this is gonna be the way it should/is gonna happen. The way I understand it, the contracts and reputation systems that are being added will be what forces the player out of Kerbins SOI. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Would be good IMO however, if the cost of tech increases faster as you fill out the tree.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
