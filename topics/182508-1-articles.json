I would look at the contents of the .cfg files in that, and then poke around the .cfgs in your GameData, specifically the /Mechjeb folder, for one that has the same or similar contents. Once you find it, move it out of the main KSP folder, and if that fixes your problem, you are good to go... if not, I guess put the file back and keep looking. vOv\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cruesoe","CreatedById":189638,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-27T23:08:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this was a MechJeb added feature in its recent 1.6.1 update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tonka Crash","CreatedById":189552,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-28T00:42:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDelete or change the extension on\u00A0GameData\\MechJeb2\\Parts\\MechJebNoCommandPod.cfg.
