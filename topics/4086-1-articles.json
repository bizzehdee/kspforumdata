You still have to get your rocket nearly perfectly vertical. To do that, follow these easy steps:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Get into a fairly stable orbit around the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt cannot be stressed enough. It\\\u0027s easiest to land from an orbit of about 10k meters. It makes landing predictable and it lets you choose the moment of descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. When you\\\u0027re approaching your designated landing area, aim your rocket at the negative direction marker (that green thingie on your artificial horizon with the X inside). And PUSH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis marker should, since you\\\u0027re in an orbit, point pretty much at the horizon. Meaning, you\\\u0027re getting slower, horizontally. Watch out that you don\\\u0027t go too low vertically or else... well, crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. When the direction marker moves up to the top of the artificial horizon ball, slow down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour goal is to get that direction marker RIGHT onto the top of your AH ball. If it\\\u0027s the crossed out version, you\\\u0027re going down. If it\\\u0027s the empty version, you\\\u0027re going up. Either\\\u0027s fine for now as long as you have fuel and height, but this is where you want that marker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Get your rocket vertical\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is critical. Put your rocket into a PERFECT (ok, as perfect as you can) vertical position, with your artificial horizon only showing its blue side and your aim dead centered at the top.

Note that your vertical speed affects how much the marker moves if you change the lateral speed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\\\u0027re sinking or climbing fast, your marker won\\\u0027t move a lot if you move left/right.

RCS helps centering\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS is your friend to get your aim marker to its center.
