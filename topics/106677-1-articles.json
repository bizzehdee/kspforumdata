If you\u0027re struggling to get early science and have enough tech to reach kerbin\u0027s moons you can get some easy science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick is \u0022in flight low over x\u0022 where x is a biome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Launch to the Mun or Minmus with enough deltaV for orbital maneuvers (about 1500 should do for Mun and 1000 for minmus if even that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I use the mun for the directions. the same works for Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Setup a polar orbit before you reach your periapsis. Burn toward anti-normal till your trajectory is inside the Mun, then burn north on the navball till the trajectory is outside of it. Repeat this till your trajectory passes over the Mun\u0027s poles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Raise or lower your periapsis with normal and anti-normal nodes (blue nodes) until it is lower than 50,000 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Warp to the periapsis and burn retrograde to circularize your orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that you\u0027re in the Low flight zone you can do EVAs whenever you see a feature that looks like a biome. As you pass over the feature, have your pilot EVA, then while sitting on the ladder do an EVA report. re-board your ship to store it. You get about 20 science per report for mun and 40 per report for Minmus. Mun has about 12 biomes for 100 or so science. If you brought a scientist along you can use the Goo and Material experiments as well during this. Make sure your report said \u0022in space low over (biome)\u0022 and not \u0022in space high over Mun\u0022. If it said \u0022high\u0022 your orbit needs to be lower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMun\u0027s biomes are fairly obvious. Pretty much every large crater is a biome. Some of the small craters are biomes and the smaller ones combined into \u0022midlands craters\u0022 or similar. There should be at least 15 biomes you can tag in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus\u0027s biomes are a bit weird compared to normal biomes. All of the mountain slopes are in the slopes biome. Plateaus and flatlands fall into 3 biomes: Lowlands, midlands, highlands. This mostly depends on the altitude of the land. Each lake is its own biome and the poles are combined into a single biome. There should be about 12 you can hit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetween the two moons you should be able to get somewhere around 600 science. Be sure to get the High flight biome eva report and the crew report for high and low before you go home. If you have access to the thermometer and pressure sensor experiments these both work in space now so make sure to run those as well.

Probe core, parachute, Science Jr, goo pods, battery, small thrust-limited SRB, tailfins. If you don\u0027t have probe cores yet, just use a Mk1 capsule instead (and add a decoupler above the SRB for a safe abort).

Let\u0027s call \u0027em \u0022active\u0022 and \u0022storage\u0022. When you first do a crew report, it goes into the \u0022active\u0022 bit.

The Science Laboratory (which is further down the tech tree than you are now, I think) can hold an infinite amount of science, duplicates included.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight clicking on any instrument while an EVAing Kerbal is nearby will give you the option to remove its data, which you can then place into the capsule storage. Doing this will disable Science Jrs and Goo Pods, but it can be done repeatedly on thermometers etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first few episodes of Scott\u0027s latest tutorial series cover this in some detail; back when career mode was first introduced, he did a show-off video demonstrating how to finish the tech tree in only two launches.

Once you can reliably do that, science pretty much looks after itself. Munlandings are doable with only 1.25m parts; it doesn\u0027t require a huge rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[1] OTOH, my initial Mun missions were preceded by many fatalities and strandings. My first \u0022successful\u0022 landing saw the legs flex just enough on touchdown to tap the engine into the ground hard enough to break it. The follow-up mission landed perfectly...then fell over sideways thanks to a sloped landing spot.
