These waypoints are being continually added (as in I delete them and htey come back) and I\u0027m not sure by what. Whatever it is is obviously broken given that the names its adding make no sense, nor do the location of most waypoints. Some are tied to to the stock DSN stations, but most are like the one I hovered over.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
