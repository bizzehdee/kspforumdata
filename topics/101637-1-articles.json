I was just wondering what the best way of achieving this orbit is? Is it to get an orbit around Kerbol and then just burn retro to get to Ap or is there a better way as this would surely need a large amount of Dv?\n\nThanks."},{"CreatedByName":"Greenfire32","CreatedById":36705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T22:07:45Z","Content":"Get into a stable orbit first.
