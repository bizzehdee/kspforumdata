Is it to get an orbit around Kerbol and then just burn retro to get to Ap or is there a better way as this would surely need a large amount of Dv?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greenfire32","CreatedById":36705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T22:07:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGet into a stable orbit first.
