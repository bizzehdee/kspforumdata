If anyone could guide me as to how I would go about this I would greatly appreciate it. I\u0027m currently working on initial research and how the cubesat itself would be constructed, electronically powered and how it would be programmed. Finding this much harder than I anticipated. This project was partly inspired by KSP so I thought I would post here. I thought this is not an easy task but it could prove to be a fantastic learning tool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
