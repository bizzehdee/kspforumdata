Is everyone just driving their rover straight off the ramp or is sas control involved during the jumpoff portion?\n\nI know what you\u0027re thinking, it was what I tried first. However, there is a large problem unless your design compensates. If you are only using onboard SAS and your wheels, rotating on the ramp will push you in the ***opposite direction of the ramp surface.*** For every action, an equal and opposite reaction. And you don\u0027t want to do this, because you will slow down.\n\nIf your \u0022arm\u0022 went around the ramp and pushed on the very top edge or the bottom, you might have a shot.

Have a large arm. Get good velocity, up the ramp and hit the back/top edge of the ramp with the arm via SAS for extra force. There is no criteria to how the rover jumps off the ramp.\n\nLast thought, how strong are clamp magnetics? Could we build a tug that pulls the rover on small gear bays via mag force (not docked) while the tug is powered via ion/other?

I assumed 45\u00C3\u2039\u00C5\u00A1 angle was the most efficient for launch, so I start building from the top down instead of from the bottom up. That way I\u0027m absolutely positively sure my last structural panel is at 45\u00C3\u2039\u00C5\u00A1. I also used only 1m panels offset 5\u00C3\u2039\u00C5\u00A1each, instead of 2m panels. That way, my launch happen more quickly and I hope I don\u0027t lose as much speed while climbing the ramp.\n\nI also recalled Jeb from the space station so he can be my driver!!! I\u0027m sure this is the most important factor.\n\nFinally, I changed my wheels for the faster TR-2L instead of the M1. I do prefer the M1 personally, it\u0027s more forgiving when you drift a little bit... but I need to do like everyone else if I want to beat the 1km magic mark! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nSo... a little over 5km acceleration with the TR-2L gives me 1067.9m or 1068.5m... (video frames before touchdown and after touchdown) Top speed was 23.1m/s about 50m before the ramp (I removed the UI to take a screenshot after that!!!)\n\nI will assume since I didn\u0027t win the championship a simple screenshot will be enough.
