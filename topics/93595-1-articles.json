I\u0027ve seen a couple of mods try to fix this (the most complete fix I saw was BTSM) and I liked the idea but the actual implementation was a bit too hardcore for my tastes and some of the parts were rebalanced such that they became obsolete and useless later in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow much interest is there in some kind of stock overhaul mod?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking something along the lines of what RSS does where the mod itself is basically a giant collection of module manager scripts and a few required mods to be installed separately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome basic ideas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERebalance parts so every part has a purpose ( similar to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75272-0-24-x-Stock-ReBalance-v1-4-11-09-14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75272-0-24-x-Stock-ReBalance-v1-4-11-09-14\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERebalance contracts and part costs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERebalance tech tree (maybe switch to the community tech tree as well) to fix the strange part placement\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESelectively add a few mods to improve the gameplay (FAR/NEAR, DRE, basic life support, small parts packs to fill in the holes, more science options, optionally MechJeb) and balance the parts against the rebalanced stock parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ultimate goal would be a full stock overhaul primarily oriented around career mode that plays nice with the stock difficulty sliders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShare your thoughts on this, I\u0027ve been looking around for a good fix for these issues for awhile now and nothing quite does what I\u0027m looking for and I\u0027m curious how many of you are in this same situation. To be clear: I\u0027m not currently developing anything (or even volunteering to take the lead on this), I just would like to see a modpack along these lines and would be willing to help out if there was enough interest.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-18T22:25:07Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2014 10:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T21:55:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo sorry.
