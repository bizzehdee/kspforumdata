If so, symmetry will *always* be radial, and all you can change is the number of copies. To get bilateral symmetry, your only option is to build the rover in the SPH. You can either build a rocket for it there (kind of awkward without radial symmetry) or copy the rover\u0027s craft file to the VAB (which can cause weirdnesses such as misplaced or disappearing struts, phantom part copies, etc.).
