The special thing about this orbit is that as soon as you load the craft, it will begin deorbiting due to atmospheric drag. Good luck.\n\nThis was originally created in the Kerbal Multiplayer Collaboration.\n\nYou can try this challenge on a separate **save file** here: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/pijwfch2lxuej2c/persistent.sfs?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pijwfch2lxuej2c/persistent.sfs?dl=0)\n\nRules\n\nYou can rescue What\u0027s-his-name in any way, but the winner is the user of the most impressive technique.\n\n**A new craft must be launched and used.** No EVA bounce glitches or exploding the command pod to slow What\u0027s-his-name down!\n\nLeaderboard\n\n1)\n\n2)\n\n3)\n\n5)\n\n14)\n\n127)\n\netc."},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T19:11:36Z","Content":"Badge?

(I did have a look at the save file, and did two try: that poor kerman is going really fast)"}]}
