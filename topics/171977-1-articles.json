the money for HPR, and I also built the rocket in part to prove a point I\u0027d made at a launch a while before -- that with correct construction, you didn\u0027t need the weight of epoxy on rockets in the H-I-J power range.\u00A0 I selected a kit with plywood fins that went through the body tube to the motor mount tube, sandwiched them between the centering rings (i.e. wood to wood geometric construction), then applied the same techniques for fillets and paint that I\u0027d been using on smaller rockets: double glue joints with yellow carpenter\u0027s glue, aerodynamic fillets built up with lightweight wood filler (non-structural), and multiple layers of wet-sanded primer before applying color.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also had a car to transport the rocket...\u00A0

stabilizing lift (likely 10 m/s or faster) before the model leaves the launch guide (rod, rail, or tower).\u00A0 Since the guide is usually much less than 5 m long (the distance traveled to accelerate to 10 m/s at 1 G), the rocket needs to accelerate \u003Cem\u003Esignificantly\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cem\u003Efaster\u003C/em\u003E than 1 G to reach the needed speed in the available distance.\u00A0 Once off the launch guide, the gravity turn is less pronounced the faster the rocket accelerates, which both reduces the walk to retrieve the rocket after landing, and reduces the likelihood of damage due to high speed at the time of recovery system deployment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFWIW, I\u0027ve flow a rocket weighing every gram of a pound (the NAR limit for non-HPR models) on a \u003Cem\u003ED12-3\u003C/em\u003E (did it for a movie camera, the launch appeared in a PBS special on rocketry back in 1998).\u00A0 That seems like a roughly 3 G launch, but the Estes black powder D12 is a semi-cored grain, with a pronounced thrust spike just after ignition, then around a 1 second sustain at slightly less than half the average thrust.\u00A0 It gets the rocket going fast enough to be stable on a three foot (1 m) rod, but there\u0027s no margin -- if your guides have excess friction, or your ignition leads don\u0027t separate cleanly, you can wind up with a tip-off, where the rocket veers at an angle as soon as it loses the launch guidance -- still with 4/5 of the engine burn to run.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, even when the rocket weighs a few tens of grams, this stuff \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eis\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E rocket science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
