I didn\u0027t have to pay for my clothes or even the nicer things like hats or computers, or a new bike every year(long story). I lived it up and enjoyed my youth, and I look back on those days and wish I could relieve them. That is, between thoughts of throttling my younger self for being a idiot or being stupid. Sad fact?

I have things to do. Meetings. Tea parties. Buying clothes(and a new laptop). Enjoying a stiff drink with my family. Gazing longingly into my rum and coke. Building Space Planes and trying to get KSP to not crash. Possibly looking at porn, or reading Homestuck. Sometimes both at the same time. Or looking at fanart for Homestuck and wondering why the Homestuck fandom is always making porn of their ships. Or maybe, if things go well, sitting in a comfy chair with my family enjoying a Irish Coffee whist looking at porn and thinking up new Space Plane layouts after getting caught up in Homestuck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELife is still enjoyable. But I miss knowing people who don\u0027t hate me and the stable lunches.
