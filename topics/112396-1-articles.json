Explosive bolts hold the two halves of the fairings together, it is springs that push the halves apart and away. To quote the document you linked;\n\n*\u00224.10.1 Lateral Release Mechanism*\n\n*For all types of fairing, the base ring of the fairing is connected to the forward skirt of the*\n\n*third stage with explosive bolts. The lateral explosive bolts are simultaneously detonated to*\n\n*release the lateral connection for fairing separation.*\n\n*4.10.2 Longitudinal Release Mechanism*\n\n*For the 3350 fairing, the longitudinal separation system comprises twelve explosive bolts,*\n\n*which are simultaneously released with the lateral explosive bolts at fairing separation.*\n\n*For 3700Z, 4000F, 4200F and 4200Z fairings, the longitudinal release mechanism uses*\n\n*notched bolts, explosive cord, expanding hose, and two explosive bolts. All these parts*\n\n*jointly take their actions to perform the release functions.*\n\n*4.10.3 Fairing Separation Mechanism*\n\n*The fairing separation mechanism comprises hinges and springs, with each half of the*\n\n*fairing being supported by two hinges. There are six separation springs on each half of the*\n\n*fairing, and after the lateral and longitudinal release mechanisms have been activated, each*\n\n*half of the fairing turns around the hinge under the spring force to accomplish the fairing*\n\n*jettisoning.\u0022*"},{"CreatedByName":"GeneCash","CreatedById":81605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T23:18:28Z","Content":"And also, SpaceX uses reusable pneumatic latches, for both the fairings and stage separation.
