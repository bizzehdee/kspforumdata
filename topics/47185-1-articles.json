You can either have a higher thrust to weight ratio which effectively \u0027pushes\u0027 your nose hard enough that it keeps going the way you want it to go, or, the better option, is to start your gravity turn later so that the impact of being top heavy is less pronounced as you are in a microgravity environment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, start it much earlier, but start it much shallower, so that you don\u0027t deviate away from your prograde vector much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legion1202","CreatedById":78116,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T15:28:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks..

Start your gravity turn at 10k, when they still have effect. Do it slowly, try 5 degrees per kilometer you go up. Also make sure your engine gimbal (effectively a form of thrust vectoring) is on. Also, theres a single engine, i think its the LV-30, that doesnt have gimbal. Try replacing it with LV-45s. Check the tooltip of both to see which one has thrust vectoring and use that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anton P.
