In this way you can allow the target to catch up to you or otherwise.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eyou have to be at the same inclination. Therefore you mark in map mode the CSM as target (visually his orbit will be highlighted in yellow). There will be two points marked in green colour: AN (Ascending Node) and DN (Descending Node). In the vincinety of these points you orient you craft to the southern pole - 180 degree on the navball - (with horizontal alignment) at the AN or to the nothern pole - zero degree on the navball - at the DN. Hovering with your mouse over one of this points reveals the deviation. Burn - but only if you are in the vincinety of these nodes - until the readout is zero.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Enow the next step: You should have a perfect orbit by now a slightly higher or lower than the target. Create an manouver-node and manipulate him in that way, that your orbit at the AP (Apoapsis, the highest point of your orbit) or PE (Perapsis, lowest point of your orbit) \u0022touches\u0022 the orbit of the target. Two new markers in orange are appearing: They represent you and the target at the point of that orbit with the lowest distance to each other. Now you have several options:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003Emove the manouver-node to see where you get the shortest distance to the target\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ewait one orbit an see how mutch the distance gets shorter\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eor manipulate the manouver-node in that way, that you \u0022overshoot\u0022 the orbit of the target. In that way you get a second pair of orange markers. These can tell you the the \u0022speed\u0022 of closing in to the target. The last markers you have passed will be purple, the active orange\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [*]when you have an distance of 2km to the target - better shorter of course - wait for the interception point. Reaching this you:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ecancel out all movement relative to the target. There are purple markers for this on the navball, and the speed is mesured relative to the target. If you are closing up to the target use the circle marker. If the target catches up youse the triangle-marker until the readout is zero. Important: The markers for the target have to be lined up with these for your movement indicators (Pro-/Retrograde).Therefore you have to point beside the target marker go get your movement marker on the spot.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe nearer you come to the target the more you should reduce you closing speed.\u003Cbr\u003EAt about 500m you should engage your RCS for finer controls, make yourself familar with the translational controls (h/n-keys for forward/back;j/k-keys for left/right and i/k-keys for up/down). \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAaand, switch your view to chase view for the docking, it is easyer to see in witch direction you have to burn.
