I docked the spacecraft, then timewarped for a while to get duna into the right position for a transfer. After the timewarp I clicked on my spacecraft, but noticed something odd, it was shown above kerbins surface, but with no orbit. I figured it was a visual bug and clicked \u0022Fly\u0022. The spacecraft had all its RCS firing and I couldn\u0027t do ANYTHING with it other than activate lights, landing gear, and brakes. It shows that it has an orbital speed of 199ms and that it is moving at 0ms over the surface. I tried restarting the game, restarting my computer going to a save when I first docked, nothing worked. I can even recover the vessel if I want to as the game is convinced that it is landed on the pad at 84,000km. I also accidentally destroyed the launch pad but now I cannot repair it because the game says the vessel is landed on it..... Does anyone know how to fix this glitch or should I just re-do my mission?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am using stock KSP and I am not sure how to get the game file, any help with that would be much appreciated!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPictures:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.flickr.com/photos/119891277@N06/25788680346/in/dateposted-public/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KSP BUG 3\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1592/25788680346_6da89604be_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.flickr.com/photos/119891277@N06/25788680346/in/dateposted-public/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENote the RCS firing constantly \u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.flickr.com/photos/119891277@N06/25188153663/in/dateposted-public/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KSP BUG 2\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1469/25188153663_15022924d1_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote the orbital speed...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.flickr.com/photos/119891277@N06/25719663011/in/dateposted-public/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KSP BUG 1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1606/25719663011_9c58cee370_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNote that I can recover the vehicle \u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-15T22:55:22Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2016 10:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by 4d4Garrison\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain_Miffles","CreatedById":181423,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-16T14:12:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know this question is kinda ancient, But i just had the same problem with a buoyant\u00A0offshore rig.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022uR3ru9x.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022575\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/uR3ru9x.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI flew it out there with jeb in the cockpit and a very low framerate, got in in place, then took jeb on EVA so i could recover him but leave the rig in place.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe instant i hit \u0022recover\u0022 on jeb, my game crashed and i had to reload it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt didn\u0027t seem like anything was wrong at first, i was able to ship a few kerbals out to it and it was fully controllable (though not sure if it was frozen in place because it\u0027s so heavy i wouldn\u0027t expect anything i did at the time to move it)\u003Cbr\u003E\nI realized there was a problem when i tried to launch a different mission\u00A0and my game told me the rig was on the launchpad...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am extremely reluctant to actually recover it because it was a monumental pain in the cheeks to get it out there in the first place.\u003Cbr\u003E\nCurrently looking for ways to edit the .craft file to tell the game it\u0027s splashed down rather than at the launch pad, but if anyone already has a solution i, and i\u0027m sure \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
