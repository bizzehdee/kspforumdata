If you can, splurge a bit on a 700 or 900 series Nvidia. I am running a 650Ti and getting low frames when recording with ACTION! But if you stream via Shadowplay to Twitch you should be ok, but the 600 series take a hit when capturing. If you are going to capture locally, look to a bigger storage drive also. I have some videos over 1GB with MP4 and over 3ish GB when AVI. Other than that you should be good. Like I mentioned, it\u0027s almost the same specs I am using. But now with other games coming out I need to upgrade my 650Ti to capture with better frames. Good news is I think the 960s are coming out soon. But I am leaning to the 970s.
