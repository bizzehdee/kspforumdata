I havent chosen a military vehicle as I dont know how to drive or maintain one and they arent fuel efficient so without a logistics devision to help out they are a bit of a no no. I would consider going back for a small apc as a safehouse to park next to my land rover. Again simpler stuff is better in an apocolypse situation, you wont have access to special manufacturers and repair companies if your stuff goes wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a while or so, again depending on infected to human ratios, its time to make our way to small towns as my vehicle of choice will no doubt need some spare parts and as my defender is a pretty common vehicle i wont have to go to the more built up areas to find one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext order of the day is to make contact with other un infected through radio or visual.
