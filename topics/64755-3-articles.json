You may well quickload a few times during not-quite-routine missions, but usually you don\u0027t need that unless you\u0027re trying to get an absolutely perfect maneuver done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERank 1: Grand Master Player\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotes: Not much about KSP still flummoxes you. Orbital maneuvers are easy, getting to orbit is easy, missions almost always go off without a hitch, etc. Maybe some reliance on quicksaving and quickloading, but it\u0027s not really necessary for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERank A: Legendary Player\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotes: Absolutely nothing is challenging to you about Kerbal Space Program. Getting to orbit is an afterthought. Planning missions is relatively quick and painless, and always works out right. Quicksave and quickload are completely unnecessary outside of bug avoidance. You are one with the Kerbal Space Program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERank S: Ultimate Player\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotes: You\u0027re taking things above and beyond the norm.

It\u0027s more how elegantly and easily you can do it than it is if you can the higher your rank is, by that point. I would like to reiterate that I came up with that scale in frustration, as well, and it shouldn\u0027t really be taken as any sort of proper way to gauge other players\u0027 abilities. Skill or lack thereof is constantly in flux: highly talented people can fail just as easily as someone who\u0027s never attempted something before can succeed on their first try. Even if neither is statistically likely, neither is impossible either.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"XxDaSTaRXx","CreatedById":57462,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T01:35:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m proud to say I\u0027ve sent a probe to Duna and crashed it into the surface at 1190 mp/s. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T01:37:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022XxDaSTaRXx\u0022 data-cite=\u0022XxDaSTaRXx\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m proud to say I\u0027ve sent a probe to Duna and crashed it into the surface at 1190 mp/s. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat actually is harder to do than you might expect!
