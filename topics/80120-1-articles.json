Here\u0027s my opinion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor very heavy lifters, liquid fuel wins out every time due to the sheer lifting power. But for light-medium launchers, surprisingly, solid rocket motors take the cake. They don\u0027t cost as much as equivalent liquid fuel boosters 90% of the time and are quite controllable with winglets and/or torque. Several of my crew transporters use SRMs to lift them into a suborbital trajectory, then use a liquid fuel second stage to boost into orbit. Usually, my SRM first stages are one \u0022core\u0022 booster, with 2, 4, 6 or 8 side boosters strapped on. For lighter payloads, I ignite the side boosters first, then the main booster 5-10 seconds later so it can act as a \u0022sustainer\u0022 engine to boost apoapsis a bit more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Strainborm","CreatedById":116277,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T16:02:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe fact that SRB\u0027s are ridiculously cheap is their main benefit, in KSP career and in real life.
