You know, figure out what\u0027s wrong with it and then make some changes that get it working as it should. For example, the Kerbal X rocket is supposed to be a Munar lander with an asparagus booster - it\u0027s a lousy Mun lander and the asparagus is about as rotten as it gets, but it can be tweaked to a working craft pretty easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wiki states the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It is recommended to tweak the thrust of the orbiter\u0027s main engines to 60% and tweak down the thrust of the Kerbodyne KR-2L engine at the bottom of the large fuel tank during the flight as fuel is being drawn from the tank.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI imagine you could also just not run the thing full blast all the way up, but I don\u0027t know if that would be easier or not...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-12T17:58:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022michaelsteele3\u0022 data-cite=\u0022michaelsteele3\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...Any tips on getting the craft into orbit, if even possible?
