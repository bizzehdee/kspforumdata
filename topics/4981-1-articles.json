In reality I\\\u0027ve only released one part, but I am currently planning and modeling a mega-release. The Olympia Series will consist of 7 sections, 8 parts per section. So there will be 56 parts, and all of them need textures. Up to this point, I had been using Paint.NET, but that hasn\\\u0027t turned out well, as some know. And so I ask of those with experience in texture creation, what program do you use?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ask this in all seriousness.
