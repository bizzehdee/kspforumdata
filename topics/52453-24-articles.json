Not sure yet. In any case were it not for Balancer I probably would not even know it existed. \u003Cp\u003EBasically I\u0027m getting a phantom fuel tank in my rocket builds... it\u0027s always the same Stretchy Tank with 720 units of liquid fuel. It shows up in Balancer but not in the resource panel. It has no weight but the fuel can be used... once it is used or dumped and you switch to another ship and back it disappears altogether. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s definitely not a tank that is clipped inside the rest of the vehicle.

If the tank is drained and you session change away from the craft and back it is refilled (whether on the launchpad or not). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy highlighting the tank I\u0027ve identified that it is associated with a Stretchy Tank of smaller size that contains monopropellant. Checking the persistence file however the part only contains monopropellant. The default size and content of that tank is 720 liquid fuel, so what appears to be happening is the script is somehow applying that amount of rocket fuel to the part in addition to the monopropellant (while not adding anything to the persistence file or applying any weight). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll very perplexing and obviously I cannot fix it by editing the persistence file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd later still... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Senior Slaphead\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Senior Slaphead\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUPDATE: \u003Cp\u003EOkay I\u0027ve done even more testing and now I\u0027m unsure whether it might be Fuel Balancer that is causing the issue or just not playing nice in combination with Stretchy Tanks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoving all other mods I tested using just Stretchy Tanks and Fuel Balancer. Same issue was replicated. Interestingly if I reverted to launch the extra tank disappeared from the FB list, but if I then session changed and came back to the launchpad it was there again. Then I removed Balancer and had the offending monoprop tank sat above a normal rocket fuel tank and motor... it just burned that fuel and no extra fuel flowed from the bugged tank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs previously mentioned the phantom tank does not add any weight in the VAB or once spawned (this double checked with Flight Engineer). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... even if this is just an issue with Stretchy Tanks in practice it is only an issue if Fuel Balancer is balancing the tanks, since I otherwise wouldn\u0027t even know the problem existed (as the phantom fuel produces no weight). For now therefore I have removed Fuel Balancer... which makes me a sad panda because it\u0027s otherwise fantastic. Hope someone can shed some light on this as I don\u0027t have any hair left to pull out! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-19T22:29:22Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2014 10:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Senior Slaphead\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T18:40:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you post your output_log.txt from after running KSP and having that tank appear?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Senior Slaphead","CreatedById":108597,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T19:52:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo worries and thanks for helping!
