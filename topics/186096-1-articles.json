Instead it arbitrarily limits the torque based on RPM and RPM limit setting, but does not actually care for what the end effect of that adjustment is. If there is literally anything draggy attached to a rotor the RPM limiter will limit the RPM way further than it should. E.g. after modifying smallest rotor to have a ridiculous max torque (750kNm) in order to remove that part from the consideration and attaching a pair of I beams to two of the rotor nodes, I noticed that the max RPM was actually roughly\u003Cstrong\u003E half\u003C/strong\u003E of what I set the RPM limit slider too. I think it\u0027s quite obvious why this is a problem: Not only is the rotor (and probably servo as well) output unnecessarily limited significantly reducing its usefulness, but any changes in loading will change the RPM with no regard for the RPM setting. Timing rotations is impossible in this case as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe need a proper RPM governor that will actively control the torque based on feedback, or at least change the current one so that the external torque applied to the rotor is measured and then added to the calculated torque limit, the current solution is downright broken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRB","CreatedById":197002,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-06T06:28:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u2019t know if it uses a\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0like\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/SAS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0does, or if that would be an improvement, or how to code this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4ti140","CreatedById":67296,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-12T14:13:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDisregard, the rotors seem to hold set RPM rigorously in the new version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
