The main character managed to evade it and get close using office tables as a cover and slash the minigun with a katana that cuts it\u0027s barrel assembly. The antagonist respond it with ditching the minigun and draw the knife for a melee combat. The minigun is only cut (cleanly) at barrel assembly, it\u0027s basically halves the barrel length (all 6 barrels cut). In theory, this still allows the minigun to be used right?

Some of the notable inaccuracies/ mistakes about ejection seats that\u0027s often depicted in movies:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E1.I was once an ace pilot, but then I took a missile to the wing, now I\u0027m gonna get a revenge:\u003C/strong\u003E A common way to progress the plot about fighter pilots is having a main character being shot down by enemy ace before he ejected to save his life and taking off to the skies on another day to take a revenge against that ace pilot. In real life, 20% of aircraft ejections result in the pilot sustaining career-ending injuries (including death). Also, 100% of aircraft ejections result in the pilot losing several inches of height, due to the sudden compression of being flung out of plane at anywhere from 12 to 22 Gs (depending on what ejection seat your plane was equipped with). Most air forces impose a career limit on the number of ejections permissible (and that limit is usually one) before it\u0027s desk job city for you. Pilots don\u0027t eject at the first hint of trouble, either. Considerable effort is first put into \u003Cem\u003Eslowing the aircraft\u003C/em\u003E because at supersonic or just plain fast speeds the wind the pilot is slamming into could possibly rip the mask off of a pilot\u0027s face, tear his helmet off and ram high-speed air down his esophagus, which makes simply impacting the ground sans parachute sound like a better option. Slowing down to a more reasonable speed to eject into is a good idea, if you can do it. A 200 mph wind is about the fastest nature throws at us. 600 mph is \u003Cem\u003Eunnatural\u003C/em\u003E. The conventional wisdom among pilots is to eject only if not ejecting \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E kill you\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2.Eject-i3n:\u003C/strong\u003E On military aircraft with more than one seat the commanding officer will yell \u0022eject\u0022 thrice to the other crew member(s) to order them to bail out. This ensures that no single utterance of the order - possibly spoken completely out of context - will result in unnecessary (and expensive) ejections, as well as to ensure the rest of the crew \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E eject, no matter what, if they do hear the repeated order. Somehow this is rarely seen on movies, especially on large military aircraft with more than one crew that\u0027s indeed have an ejection seat, because in movies, only fighters have ejection seats (Since usually the stories about bomber crew is often less interesting/ thrilling than fighter pilots)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E3.Bailing (Out of seat):\u003C/strong\u003E Before ejection seats were invented, escaping an aircraft by \u0022bailing out\u0022 was even more dangerous. If you were lucky, there was a control that would blast off the canopy with explosive charges. If not, you had to open the canopy yourself, either climb out or roll the aircraft over and \u003Cem\u003Efall\u003C/em\u003E out, and essentially perform an impromptu skydive. Unlike a normal skydive however, the aircraft is likely to be violently spinning and rapidly losing altitude due to loss of engines, control surfaces, entire wings, or all of the above. If the plane was flying low enough or couldn\u0027t be controlled at all, many pilots chose to stay in their planes and die instantly in the crash instead of risk bailing out and dying a slower, more horrible death. At least 50% died on the way out (not counting the ones who didn\u0027t make it out at all), and only around a quarter made it back home safely, the rest of the survivors either being taken prisoner or horribly wounded. Some of the pre-ejection seat era aircraft are notorious for this. For example, early-model Messerschmitt Bf 109s and Bell P-39 Airacobras were notoriously difficult to bail out of because the wind would literally hold the side-folding canopy shut, making it almost impossible to escape the plane. Production Airacobras didn\u0027t have sliding canopies, they had \u003Cem\u003Edoors\u003C/em\u003E, but that didn\u0027t make them easier to bail out, for a different reason. The relative positions of the cockpit door and the stabilizer effectively made sure that if any pilot taller than a midget would forget to take a fetal position after bailing out, his legs will be broken by a stabilizer, this usually being a career ending injury even if the pilot managed to land on his own territory and was saved by the ground troops. Another example has the Lockheed P-38 Lightning, which had a nasty habit of killing or permanently injuring anybody attempting to bail out of it. The plane basically had 2 fuselages, with a boom-like horizontal stabilizer stretching the entire width between them. Bailing out of the cockpit (located in the middle between the 2 fuselages) would likely slam you into the boom, whether you curled into a fetal position or not. In an example about bomber planes, The B-24 Liberator heavy bomber was virtually impossible to bail out. It had only one door, at the tail, and the catwalk was too narrow to even walk through while wearing a parachute, much less run while the plane is going down. It also had a tendency to break up on hitting water due to the design of the wing. On the other hand... spare a thought for the early Soviet VDV, who, lacking cargo aircraft with such bourgeois luxuries as enclosed fuselages, had to deploy like this all the time: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Paratroopers_jumping_from_Tupolev_TB-3.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E(See for yourself)\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E4.My plane killed me after I\u0027ve ejected: \u003C/strong\u003EWe get it, the movie isn\u0027t particularly good when it comes to a practical design as long as it looks cool (emphasis on practical). Aerodynamic, functionality and ergonomics ar often thrown out of the window for rule of cool. This often extends to a supposedly high-tech super secret prototype aircraft which is going down and the pilot needs to eject, which due to the design of the aircraft (purely for cool factor), ejecting will severely injure/ kill the pilot if it\u0027s attempted in real life. in fact, the first generation of fighter jets such as the F-80 Shooting Star and F-84 Thunderjet made ejection seats indispensable. Pilots attempting to bail out now had a very significant chance of being unable to get out of the way before the plane would catch up with them. In fact, on faster airplanes, the slipstream, the layer of air traveling around the plane\u0027s body, could actually pull the pilot up against the plane once he left the cockpit (the same problem also applies to things like missiles or bombs, requiring a bit of engineering on how to get them to \u003Cem\u003Eleave\u003C/em\u003E the plane once you dropped them). While ejection seat designs had been experimented with since 1916, the first practical designs were developed by Heinkel in Germany (1940, while working on a jet fighter prototype) and Saab in Sweden (1941, while developing the Saab 21 twin boom pushing propeller fighter). The Germans employed ejection seats on their experimental jet types (first emergency use, January 1942) and were the earliest to install them on production models. The first aircraft built with ejection seats was the Heinkel He 219, a nightfighter, which had its engines so close to the fuselage that the propeller tips reached within a foot of the cockpit, just aft of the pilot\u0027s seat (first combat ejection, April 1944). Another German type needing bangseats, although it never entered production, The was the Dornier Do335, which had two propellers, one pulling in the front, the other pushing in the rear, just in the right place to mince a pilot (although the ejection sequence had this propeller jettisoned as well). On the other hand, the KA-50 Alligator/Black Shark (NATO Reporting Name: Hokum) is probably the first combat helicopter to be fitted with ejection seats. Obviously, with two rotors on top of it, it is very easy to get blended into meat chunks when ejecting, so the design also detonates charges built into the helicopter rotors axles just before the ejection seat activates. Aircraft design isn\u0027t only about designing a plane and then slapping the ejection seat onboard and call it a day. Considerable effort must be done to ensure that the pilots ejected \u003Cem\u003Esafely\u003C/em\u003E and make sure that the plane does not pose a hazard by having it flying away from ejecting pilot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E5.He killed my wingmen! I\u0027m not done yet until I shoot him to death with my plane!:\u003C/strong\u003E On shooting an airman after he or she\u0027s ejected or otherwise left a stricken aircraft being a war crime. In real life, this was generally respected in WW2 by all sides, even (most of the time) on the Eastern Front. But Polish pilots in the Royal Air Force had to be frequently brought to book for seeking to kill German aircrew who had bailed out - they generally loathed the Germans so much that they considered the fight was not over till the pilot was dead. Some British pilots justified shooting at a bailed-out Luftwaffe pilot with the simple cold calculation that the Germans could quickly replace an aircraft - it took time, money and experience to make a good pilot, and to make sure he was dead would \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E harm the German war effort, especially if he bailed out where his own side could recover him. This attitude was rare, however, and besides, it is difficult and expends too much ammo to make sure of getting a man hanging under a parachute. Although during the Battle of Britain, some British pilots thought nothing of shooting down seaplanes tasked with recovering German pilots who came down in the Channel\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E6.Ejection in space: \u003C/strong\u003EThankfully the movies about space battles (very) rarely depict the ejection of a space fighter pilot \u003Cem\u003Ein space\u003C/em\u003E (This could lead to a much slower, horrible death since space is so empty, he could end up drifting forever, burn up inside atmosphere or slam into enemy ship at high speed or just plain blasted to dust by enemy ship\u0027s weapons) since the rules dictates that, in movieverse, space fighters have no ejection seat whatsoever (I\u0027m looking at you, TIE fighter) and only bigger ship have a way to save their crew by using escape pod (Which is still bad in practice since the probability of you being rescued while drifting IN SPACE inside the cramped escape pod is amost zero since as explained above, the space is so dang empty). In real life, though, there\u0027s indeed an ejection seat fitted on space craft (Though they never used in space, they\u0027re intended to save the pilot when there\u0027s a catastrophic failure during launch sequence). The American Gemini spacecraft had extra-strong ejection seats that were designed not only to blast the astronaut clear of the spacecraft, but outside the danger zone of a potential launcher fire, \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E high enough for a parachute to work. They were never used, and would probably have permanently crippled the user. This design was unusual: most manned spacecraft have used a Launch Escape System consisting of a solid fuel rocket in a tower connected to the crew capsule. If the launcher is about to explode or otherwise fail catastrophically, the crew capsule is detached and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E activated to put it at a safe distance. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E is typically jettisoned when the spacecraft nears orbit. This has only ever been used once for real, when the two-man crew of Soyuz T-10-1, waiting for a trip to Salyut 7 in 1983, were ejected clear of their launcher just before a fire destroyed it. (In 1975, another Soyuz mission had its capsule ejected while heading for orbit as the third stage was deviating too much, but by then they had already jettisoned the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E and the crew capsule was sent clear by the explosive bolts detaching it from the launcher.) In a case of ejection by design, Yuri Gagarin, on the world\u0027s first manned space flight, actually ejected from his Vostok capsule and landed separately by parachute. This was covered up for many years, as the FAI rules of the time required a pilot to land with his capsule for the flight to count. Gagarin, dressed in a bright orange spacesuit, landed next to a man and his daughter, having to explain he wasn\u0027t an alien, he was a fellow Soviet and needed to find a telephone. The soviets kept it a secret that they hadn\u0027t figured out how to make the Vostok capsules land survivably and pretended that the cosmonauts usually, with a few exceptions, landed with their spacecraft, when in reality the only way to survive was to eject. The next generation of Soviet spacecraft, the Voskhods, had an improved combination of parachutes and braking rockets that made a soft landing possible. This made the ejection seat unnecessary and a two- or three-man crew could be fitted in the capsule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E7.I can\u0027t eject!

Also, an ace is a term given to fighter pilots who achieved around 5 kills (IIRC), which, back then, due to the aircraft technology mainly dominated by piston engines and straightforward machineguns (no jets until late in the war, and missile is still very primitive, no high speed AA homing missiles yet), a dogfight is often determined by pilot\u0027s skills, not his aircraft. Thus, those who survived the battle with enough kills becomes experienced pilots, and hailed as ace. There\u0027s even a term of \u0022ace in a day\u0022 where rookie fighter pilots becomes an ace in just a day due to the massive scale of the air battle they participated into, allowing them to kill many enemies in a single engagement.

The main character managed to evade it and get close using office tables as a cover and slash the minigun with a katana that cuts it\u0027s barrel assembly. The antagonist respond it with ditching the minigun and draw the knife for a melee combat. The minigun is only cut (cleanly) at barrel assembly, it\u0027s basically halves the barrel length (all 6 barrels cut). In theory, this still allows the minigun to be used right?
