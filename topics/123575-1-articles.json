The look, feel, and performance of the kw engines and fuel tanks is much better than the stock counterparts. But my PC is on the lower end and I don\u0027t have enough ram to have so many parts. Is it possible to delete most of the stock engines and fuel tanks? If so what are steps to do so?

Effect varies from user to user, to some it\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s unusable, to other it saves RAM and boost FPS ingame. Definitelly worth trying.
