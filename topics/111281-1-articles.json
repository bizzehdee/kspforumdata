However I tried but I have no luck being well off-mark so I start to think that my launchpad should actually align with pe/ap if I want to \u0022remake\u0022 the same orbit just smaller yet. I don\u0027t need to nail it 100%, but I want at least for my efforts to account to something and right now I think I would do better just heading east and doing 2 burns to finish the job, but it pokes at me being unable to launch roughly how I want to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is also really hard to align the launchpad with those nodes for satellite contracts because I have no target, I can\u0027t aim for it and if the desired orbit is huge aligning those points becomes hard for me. I know I could just slap more engines and fuel to the thing, but that wouldn\u0027t teach me anything so this is the situation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI already aligned the thing as best as I could with the AN and tried launching 135\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, but the result weren\u0027t that great. At first the ascending node was decreasing and then increasing massively and since I don\u0027t understand the whole concept it was like magic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/WESql#3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/WESql#3\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T18:45:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf your problem is the inclination, when you are launching, switch to orbit mode momentarily and get your prograde to desired heading (you may revert to surface mode for gravity turn but I wouldnt change heading). Your surface velocity messes up the orbit you have when you plan to make a non equatorial orbit, when launching with orbit mode, it should get a lot more accurate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rofltehcat","CreatedById":145224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T18:46:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is how I do it: Mind that this isn\u0027t very accurate and I still need to correct 5-10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. Mods make it infinitely easier but this is without them. I start the mission and go to the map while still parked at the launch pad. Then I move the camera so that the target orbit is displayed as a single line that intersects with Kerbin\u0027s core, kinda like your third picture, just even flatter. Then I activate warp until my ship is basically directly on the intersection between the orbit and the core. Once this is met, I launch and aim in the direction I want to go (note which way the target orbit is rotating). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I have some height and some speed and maybe a little time during staging I switch the navball from surface to orbit to check if the prograde is pointing in the correct direction because you already start with some velocity from Kerbin\u0027s rotation so you\u0027ll have to aim a little further west than what you are aiming for until the orbit\u0027s inclination points roughly where you want to go. If I have time I also check the general direction of the flight path with the orbit (overlap them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, just eyeballing it but it works \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T19:02:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou definitely want to launch when you\u0027re directly under the ascending/descending node. If visually identifying that point is tricky, here\u0027s a handy technique:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Before launch, switch to map view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. By default, it\u0027s centered on your \u003Cem\u003Eship\u003C/em\u003E. Double-click on the planet, this will switch to be centered on Kerbin itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. If you pull back on the camera a bit, the map view will draw a little gray dot right in the center of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Rotate the camera view so that you\u0027re looking perfectly edge-on to the desired orbit (i.e. so that the orbit looks like a straight line passing through the center of Kerbin, rather than an ellipse).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Now timewarp until your ship moves to be right there on that spot (i.e. your ship shows as being directly under the orbit line, directly on top of the dot at Kerbin\u0027s center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Launch. Immediately upon launch, use Q/E to roll your ship so that the desired orbital direction is directly down (or up) from the center of your nav-ball (this makes the next step easier, since you can adjust your gravity turn just by pitching up/down).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7.
