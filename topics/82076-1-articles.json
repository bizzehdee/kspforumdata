Maybe someone already had the idea, but I didnt find it in the forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically it would be a warehouse, looking from the inside like the ship design building with a different background, more \u0022warehousy\u0022 (yeah I know, I am not a native english speaker \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverytime you recover something, the exact object is registered in the warehouse (you can imagine on a left window the differents objects listed as \u0022recovered 1\u0022, \u0022recovered 2\u0022 etc...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo by clicking on the name you can see the object appear. If the object has tanks, you can choose there to refill it (for money) or to sell it (lets say at 25% value)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs long as you decide to keep it, you can access it as an item in the ship design building to construct a new ship around it (in this case of course, those parts are free, but you would not be allowed to separe the differents parts of the said object)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn other possible thing to do with it would be that you could use the ship design building to actually make blueprints (instead of real ships), and when you save the said blueprint, you only pay a small amount of the cost of the ship, but then you can produce the exact ship in serie for a decreased cost (depending on the number of production iterations, with an absolute minimum of 25% of real price, as it would be the price for reselling ships/parts in the warehouse)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose premade ships (or parts) would be kept in the warehouse for future use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only abuse would be to send to the warehouse parts designs made of only one or very few parts made in big amount (to profit of the decreased production cost) and ending up making completely new ships with a low price, so a possibility would be to be only able to make a blueprint out of a ship made out of at least 10 parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose ideas would promote:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1/ intelligent reuse of parts (less expensive to reuse it in a new ship than sell it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2/ design of \u0022model\u0022 launchers, as it works in real life (it is way less expensive to R\u0026amp;D one model and produce it many times than making a new concept everytime)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this kind of building would not be interresting at all in the free mode, but only in career\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"weeble","CreatedById":117348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T23:59:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm that would be interesting. I kind of understand where you\u0027re going with it. So instead of recovering your craft and it disappearing into thin air, you want it stored in some type of building where you can choose what you want to do with it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would be kind of cool. I don\u0027t know if I\u0027d necessarily use that over one of the mods but it sounds like a great addition to the hardcore realism players out there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hannu","CreatedById":60596,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-25T17:58:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI disagree. Complex ground buildings take time and resources to develop and gives very small amount of fun in game. Maybe this warehouse could be added in last update before official release, if many people want it, but I hope that Squad would use now all possible resources to develop planets and physics to the release condition. I know that there are countless mods, and I use many of them, but they are always third party stuff, they are more or less unstable, have unpredictable interactions between each other, and it can take long time before mod makers update their mods after new version of KSP. Therefore, it would be better that KSP would have as many properties in itself, especially those needed in game. Funny museum and administration buildings etc. beautiful stuff could be in mods instead of the most essential functions of flight, technology and physics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"colmo","CreatedById":25950,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-25T18:01:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAllista\u0027s Ground Hangar does craft storing and refuelling pretty much as described in the OP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt Snuggler","CreatedById":65092,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-25T22:23:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would prefer if recovered parts were put in a \u0022ware house\u0022 but instead it is represented by a number in the corner of the part icon in the VAB. the number would indicate how many of that part you have in storage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif you use a recovered part you pay a small \u0022refit fee\u0022 rather than the total cost of a new part. this would also allow reusable SSTOs to be refitted also.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
