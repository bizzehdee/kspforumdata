This is weird though. The problem doesn\u0027t happen the first time around. Instead it happens the second time around. I\u0027m using the clampotrons in a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003Evtol\u003C/abbr\u003E engine and have two sets. First set holds the engine horizontal (I\u0027ll call these\u00A0the h-ports) and the second holds it vertically (call these v-ports). The first time I decouple the engine module it connects to the vports perfectly fine. When I decouple it and move it back to the hports\u00A0though, it refuses to dock despite having a near perfect alignment, and it no longer docks to the vports\u00A0either despite just undocking from it a moment ago. So you\u0027d think the problem was that something was blocking its path? Nope. \u00A0While I do clip in landing gear to make the transition back and forth automatic neither have caused an issue, and I rerooted the module to start in the vertical position\u00A0and got the problem in reverse. Decouple from the vports, able to couple to the hports flawlessly, cannot couple to either position after. So it definitely isn\u0027t that. As far as I can tell the docks won\u0027t attract each other after they connect the first time. I thought they might just do this on their own but the craft I drew inspiration from does something very similar and can switch indefinitely with very few hitches. They simply stop attracting each other after the first time they do. Any sort of advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Up to this point I\u0027ve been very happy with how this engine seems to work and it\u0027d be a waste to have to trash it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVport docked after decoupling from hport:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00226Y1Dc4i.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6Y1Dc4i.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHport NOT docked after decoupling a second time from vport:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00225tqH40Z.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5tqH40Z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVport not docked after trying to redock when the Hport failed to dock:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Rq2EOeU.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Rq2EOeU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, should probably mention this is in ksp 1.1.3.
