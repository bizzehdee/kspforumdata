You cannot set sail for jool until you\u0027ve managed your first orbit; and even if you want your first ship to reach jool, you\u0027re STILL going to need to manage your first orbit. You\u0027ll have more fun working up to a problem and find only a learning slump, than putting the hardest problem on your plate. Heck, my launcher was a learning problem in stabilization; the design was based off of the Saturn V; (mass ratios, thrust ratios, length ratios, fuel, etc); I only had the small goal to get it to launch; I later adjusted it a bit to get it to go to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the point is, the experience I gained over a small goal; mimic the Saturn V launcher, has given me experience that I can use to explore the universe.

Even my initial attempts weren\u0027t just falling down and exploding (well... it was complicated. First I had to prevent it from exploding when physics initialized, then I had to prevent it from exploding as physics propagated to the top; and some in between. ); I didn\u0027t go into this blind...
