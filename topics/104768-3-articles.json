Right now, most of the stuff seems trivial and natural - rockets, spaceplanes, SSTOs, rendezvous, docking, transfers, gravity assists\\*, precision landings, you name it.

I\u0027m pretty sure there wasn\u0027t a learning wall, there were several of them - it was more like learning stairs. The game itself is not hard to play once you know what you are doing, but figuring out exactly what to do for a complete newbie to the field is *very* hard. I feel no shame in admitting that most of my KSP journey was babysitted by various tutorials from people who have figured the stuff out before me.\n\nAnd I have no doubt that there is going to be a lot to learn in the future (especially new aerodynamics and re entry shock heating with 1.0, I have very little experience with FAR/NEAR and DR).\n\n\\*I still need a calculator when going for multiple slingshots, and that is probably never going to change"},{"CreatedByName":"wolfedg","CreatedById":58442,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T20:38:52Z","Content":"Spaceplanes that make it to orbit, spaceplanes that can re-enter without tumbling to death, spaceplanes that make it to orbit with a payload or enough fuel to do anything, and docking without using up all my rcs or accidentally activating my main engine.

The problem was something about stabalizing a launcher I had designed, I think the launcher was 1000T designed to bring 90T to LKO but whatever. I didn\u0027t want people telling me how to redesign my launcher, I didn\u0027t want people telling me to turn it into asparagus because that\u0027s what all the cool people do... I just wanted hints at what I could do to stop it from blowing up before I even launch it.\n\nMost people complained, it isn\u0027t the type of request that is common and I knew it wouldn\u0027t be. But there were those who gave advice that proved very useful and I took my rocket apart, redesigned, cut down the part count and spacetape... and managed to get it to launch. The cargo? A fuel tank I edited to weigh 90T. I hadn\u0027t even left the system yet, I hadn\u0027t even set up a moonbase, an orbiting space station... I just wanted to challenge myself and work through a problem.\n\nNow, I think the problem is that people don\u0027t work through small problems before going out to bigger ones... the \u0022boring stuff\u0022 isn\u0027t boring. You cannot set sail for jool until you\u0027ve managed your first orbit; and even if you want your first ship to reach jool, you\u0027re STILL going to need to manage your first orbit. You\u0027ll have more fun working up to a problem and find only a learning slump, than putting the hardest problem on your plate. Heck, my launcher was a learning problem in stabilization; the design was based off of the Saturn V; (mass ratios, thrust ratios, length ratios, fuel, etc); I only had the small goal to get it to launch; I later adjusted it a bit to get it to go to orbit.\n\nBut the point is, the experience I gained over a small goal; mimic the Saturn V launcher, has given me experience that I can use to explore the universe. People who haven\u0027t even attempted the problem before hit \u0022the wall\u0022 instead of \u0022the hump\u0022. Even my initial attempts weren\u0027t just falling down and exploding (well... it was complicated. First I had to prevent it from exploding when physics initialized, then I had to prevent it from exploding as physics propagated to the top; and some in between. ); I didn\u0027t go into this blind... I just had a problem that a small nudge made better.\n\nIn short, going slow = learning slump not learning wall.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-23T21:23:45Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2015 09:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fel**"},{"CreatedByName":"Threadsinger","CreatedById":100886,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T21:21:07Z","Content":"While everything was a new experience, the three challenges I remember requiring a lot more effort were:\n\n1.

Designing and landing a craft onto Mun (even one way - often did not have enough fuel to make a safe landing, and I didn\u0027t use a dV calculator back then, and I had a hard time estimating braking times versus distance remaining... clipped many a mountain on the way down)\n\n3. Docking. \u0027Nuff said. \n\nThere\u0027s certainly some things I haven\u0027t done yet, like landing and taking off from Eve (using stock parts), building a grand tour ship, or rescuing Bob from a polar, solar orbit, but I\u0027ll get there."},{"CreatedByName":"Yakky","CreatedById":94432,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T21:21:08Z","Content":"My learning wall, which I still haven\u0027t fully overcome, is to learn how to design spacecraft with enough margin for error to allow them to survive imperfectly executed missions.
