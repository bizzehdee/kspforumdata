My own attempts so far usually stall at around 5 m/s in the Great Kerbal Seas. Is there any guide or advice on how to make things float in KSP?\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T19:35:17Z","Content":"Here\u0027s the first successful boat I\u0027ve built:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![L7JNkxo.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/L7JNkxo.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![1t1jzJN.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1t1jzJN.jpg)\n\nThe way I went about it was to mainly put structural panels and girders along the bottom (I hear air intakes work just as well, if not better), which, due to their high damage resistance, aren\u0027t likely to give in while under way.\n\nGenerally, you want to keep all your vital bits (parts with low crash tolerance) above the Center of Mass: as this will usually keep them out of the water.\n\nAlso, here\u0027s an amphibious rover that I made for a circumnavigation challenge. It uses an Infernal Robotics part (telecoping piston) to extend a monofoil below the rover. This pulls the CoM down and lifts the rover out of the water. It was capable of 40m/s in 0.90... the aero overhaul in 1.0 may have slowed it quite a bit.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E [Javascript is disabled.

You can get these pretty fast but they won\u0027t turn unless you\u0027re nearly sitting still. Control surfaces are useless---only torque and RCS seems to work.\n\nThere are a number of mods that solve this but most of them make big changes to the buoyancy of other parts (and EVA Kerbals), plus I don\u0027t thinky they\u0027ve been updated to 1.x yet. So that leaves Firespitter, which has pontoons. The pontoons not only float but have rudders that work in water and the option of retractable, powered wheels so you can be amphibious. With them, you can make excellent boats (essentially wingless airplanes) but if you go much over 200m/s, the pontoons explode."}]}
