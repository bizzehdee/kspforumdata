Science lab was unmanned at that point, and even if it was, I forgot SAS. Oh, yeah, forgot RCS on the tug. Docking those two was... Fun. Figured I wouldn\u0027t waste the fuel spent putting the tug up there, so I used one of my small passenger rockets and got Bob up there... Only to run into difficulties from having only 1 Kerbal and no probe core... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Next was the refit mission. Sent up a rocket with Bill and Jeb so I could use KAS/KIS to lop off the appropriate bits and tack on the other things that came to mind once it was up there: SAS, a service module, three new batteries, and a probe core. 30 nail-biting, frustrating minutes later, task complete. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Send up v2 of the orbital tug while v1 shifts science module to minmus so I can work up the tech tree.

Now I have this crappy v1 tug floating 500m away. Ditch it into Minmus? Nah, keep it! I can refuel it and bring it back to Kerbin to get my $30k back. Go to dock sans RCS. Frustration... Frustration... Really missing RCS for these non-centerline docking maneuvers... And... And... Woot! Docked! Yay! *BOOOOOM* Wait, what the?! Noooooo! *RAGE*! The whole station comes apart spectacularly. $500,000\u002B down the hole, Bob\u0027s dead, oh and because I was vehicle swapping, no revert... And last quicksave was two hours realtime earlier...
