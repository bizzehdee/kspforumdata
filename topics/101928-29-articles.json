We have many many ways of attaching things without having to use tools.\n\nThis, lots of service can be done without tools, good computer cases let you swap drives and even fans without tools. However guns go overboard on this as they require frequent cleaning, infantry guns more so as they are more complex and always jam then the enemy attacks. \n\nOther stuff like cars and apple products require special tools. \n\nI assume the no tools== no skill so also scientists and pilots can do this. \n\nKIS has already saved me twice, first was to rearange solar pannels, second was an stranded kerbal using an life support hexcan to survive on Mun until rescued. \n\n---\n\nOne minor issue, chairs do not show up in the containers, think the icon is missing.

Sometimes I was doing the right thing but failing, and other times I was, e.g., trying to stick the round-8 onto the side of the ship for a minute, and I hadn\u0027t figured out that there were multiple problems.\n\nSo finally, I was able to land and recover a pod from a rescue mission. I stuck two Oscar-B\u0027s (unlike ROUND-8\u0027s, they fit in the inventory) onto the back of the defunct Mk1, put a Terrier and a couple of batteries on the back, and a couple of parachutes on the front. Hopped in and fired it up. Screens come to life (KIS/KAS and RPM are my favorite mods at the moment), the engine ignites, and Bill rides a cherry-red horse all the way home.\n\nFive hours of screwing around with this. In-game rewards? Like a few hundred funds. IRL? Priceless.\n\nThat said...\n\nThat five hours could have been three if there were a way of attaching the ships together. Maybe if I had brought pipes, but I never realized you can\u0027t strut two different ships together. If I could strut them such that a Kerbal holding onto one could place parts on or grab them from both, that could have been 30 minutes. Hmm. I\u0027ll bet you the claw would have come in handy...\n\nThanks again for your guidance and taking the time to make that picture.
