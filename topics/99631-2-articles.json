In practice, a lot. A momentum wheel needs relatively large mass and high speed, with speed variance not being very important. A reaction wheel needs high precision control of the wheel at much lower speeds, to control how much torque is being added. It is extremely difficult to build a device that satisfies the requirements for both, so we don\u0027t, generally speaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ea wheel will be reactionwheel if we use them like that and can be momentum wheel if we spin them up... thats it, no other differences, except that as i already wrote many posts ago, the sideway effect is smaller than the active effect and this should be modeled if we want to change something as i agree that a pod shouldnt keep a craft on one leg, while a separate reaction wheel module can hold a light craft easily on one leg especially on low gravity...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s an interesting perspective.
