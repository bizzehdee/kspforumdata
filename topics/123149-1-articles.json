The dust storm which caused all that - is it really possible for a storm to be so violent with so thin an atmosphere?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Mark burns hydrazine to make water but isn\u0027t it highly toxic? Yet, he wears no protection when breathing near it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. He punches a hole in his space suit glove to make the outgoing air act as a reaction mass for him to fly towards Hermes - although it may sound theoretically possible I doubt it can be done IRL. Most probably this action would make him spin uncontrollably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Gravity - as I understand the makers didn\u0027t focus on simulating of lesser gravity on Mars to cut the expenses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Apparent lack of radiation protection - Mark spends much time outdoors but seems not to suffer from much higher radiation level. Of course I give the benefit of doubt to his suit, perhaps it offers at least some protection from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far this is the only things I find inaccurate in this great movie.
