The missile quickly starts to aim at the target instead of arc upward over hills and other stuff. How hard would it be to set up a time delay before it starts to seek out the target to allow the missile to soar skyward before crashing down onto the target? Was testing shooting at something 20-30km from KSC and it slammed into the side of the hill just outside of the flatland of KSC. I was thinking a work around for now would to adjust the turn rate so it would take time to adjust to arc nicely but once it gets closer it would most likely miss the target unless it was the cluster load-out, or had a huge explosion range.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AntiMatter001","CreatedById":100129,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T14:27:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ejust tested out a theory with BD armoury and burn together and B9 HL parts... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elet\u0027s just say i have a plane with 32 (yes 32) cluster bombs on it and it\u0027s a pig to turn in atmo but it flys (ish) and check out how much damage two did\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejust a fyi i had 0.2 fps when the clusterbombs finally hit the KSC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/ubb27\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

When they load, their velocity suddenly jumps to whatever velocity your vessel is. For example, I was in a suborbital trajectory on an intersect course with a stranded kerbal in orbit, and when we came within loading distance, the kerbal was suddenly in a suborbital trajectory as well. This most likely has to do with the physics range extension feature of BDArmory.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, that\u0027s where this bug is coming from.
