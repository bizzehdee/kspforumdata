I also play the piano and the marimba in my spare time. Much of my day is dedicated to what I call \u0022Planned wastes of time,\u0022 so I always have something to do, even though it looks like I don\u0027t.\n\nWell, there is a little bit of what I like to do, and with that, I say a bright \u0022Hello!\u0022 to all of the people on this forum! ![:kiss:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T00:39:08Z","Content":"Hi!
