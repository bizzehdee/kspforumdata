I\u0027ve recently started getting into the modding business, and I can\u0027t help but wonder, what will 1.1 mean for mods? Will a new PartTools version be needed? Maybe parts mods won\u0027t be so greatly affected, after all some of the particle effects used by KSP are from unity 3 even, and I doubt the .mu format will change. Probably mods like FAR will need some major overhaul, but anyway, what are your thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrHappyFace","CreatedById":76365,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T06:02:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI dont think much will change at all.
