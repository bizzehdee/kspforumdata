You can also just surface mount the tanks inside of the saddle if you don\u0027t want decouplers.  Using docking ports is also possible, but tricky due to KSPs tree-based hierarchy (you have to use the re-root tool a couple of times to get it working with surface-attached docking ports)."},{"CreatedByName":"Pipwup","CreatedById":188152,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-18T03:03:56Z","Content":"Welp when the game launches...
