Nate likes KSP, but he is not that experienced at it. KSP is my favourite game, and has been pretty much since I picked it up over a decade ago. My opinion of the game has remained relatively constant for this time period, however, my skill level has not. If you had\u0027ve asked me at 1000 hours \u0022what would you do to the game to improve it?\u0022 you would get a wildly different answer than if you asked me at 5000 or 10000 hours. This is evidenced in the whole \u0022no maneuvers in a different \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022 problem. Anyone wanna bet that Nate waits til he gets within the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E before he changes inclination? At 1000 hours, I did too. The thing was, at 1000 hours, I was being inspired by players who were way better than me, I wasn\u0027t in charge of the sequel.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Izny","CreatedById":137814,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-27T12:56:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid nate ever rendevous and dock in orbit without mechjeb?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTHAT\u0027s the question\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-27T13:44:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry, I posted this in the wrong thread but its kind relevant here too.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks SZ, great video and I really appreciate all the digging you and Matt Lowne have done. A lot of the fixation on Nate seems like wanting to yell at the manager of a \u00A0restaurant because the food isn\u2019t great, without realizing \u00A0you\u2019re at a chain restaurant and the foods not great because of bad ingredients and bad policy dictated by corporate. You should be yelling at upper management, but they aren\u2019t there or visible to you so you take it all out on the highest up person you\u2019re aware of. I think K^2 is one of the few people here with the relevant experience to understand the dynamics here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts pretty obvious T2 surely did want to make money on KSP but never really understood the product because no one apparently paid any attention to the existing community. It was widely understood that KSP1 while incredibly compelling as an idea was a bit of a cobbled together mess with a lot of fundamental flaws and tech debt in the base code and really couldn\u2019t be brought forward without major re-writes. I know issues with axial tilt, acceleration under warp, and multiplayer were widely known to be practical dealbreakers on this forum going back to 2017. Im actually really happy Nate by force of his shear enthusiasm was able to convince them that for KSP to succeed it needed a bigger budget really big changes. Had KSP2 been released in 2020 as a half-baked reskin I think the result would have been just as disastrous as what happened in 2023.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I personally am not as convinced that multiplayer KSP would be as enduringly fun as folks think. I think the version of multiplayer KSP that might be fun is basically kithack model club\u2014making cars and planes and other vehicles and racing and smashing them about with friends in real time. For reasons that have been discussed many times on this forum this doesn\u2019t really work in space because of time-warp. Its not that there aren\u2019t solutions to how people move through time, its that inevitably you are for the most part not existing in a real-time experience with your friends. You\u2019re talking about a much slower, much less interactive cooperative game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat leads me to believe that if KSP2 was actually to work T2 aught to have brought on the KSP1 team much earlier and started with a ground up rewrite, understanding it was going to take 5-6 years and 40-60 million. Its not just the code though. KSP was always a fun sim but its a terrible \u003Cem\u003Egame\u003C/em\u003E. If they really wanted to compete with Minecraft and roblox they needed the fundamentals of science, progression, colonies, and most importantly resources. \u00A0Thats what creates the fundamental loop of fly-gather-build-fly and a dynamic set of non-proscriptive, player driven goals. If all you could do is fly around and build the Taj Mahal minecraft would been forgotten in 2009. Its the free and open crafting system that makes it the slightest bit interesting. With one generic ore and the inability to build off-world KSP would never be the kind of open and expansive free-flowing building game it needed to be. I think multiplayer and interstellar should have been considered as they re-wrote the code but the initial release really needed to include that fundamental core game loop to be something new and compelling enough to warrant a sequel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-05-28T02:45:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2024 02:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022May 28\u0022\u003EMay 28\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LameLefty","CreatedById":57336,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-27T14:16:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224393286\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224740\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221716814585\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022137814\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Izny\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Izny said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid nate ever rendevous and dock in orbit without mechjeb?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTHAT\u0027s the question\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMechjeb is great at planning the plane matching and rendezvous maneuvers and in automating the burns (after you\u0027ve done it all by hand and eyeball a few dozen times, it gets old) but Docking Port Alignment Indicator and flying the prox ops and docking manually is where it\u0027s at if you want a sense of accomplishment and if you really want to minimize monoprop usage.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Meecrob","CreatedById":104543,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-27T16:44:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224393286\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224740\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221716814585\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022137814\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Izny\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Izny said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid nate ever rendevous and dock in orbit without mechjeb?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTHAT\u0027s the question\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI bet he did once or twice to say he did, then used mechjeb because docking is the opposite of instant gratification.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224393300\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224740\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221716819364\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257336\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LameLefty\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, LameLefty said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMechjeb is great at planning the plane matching and rendezvous maneuvers and in automating the burns (after you\u0027ve done it all by hand and eyeball a few dozen times, it gets old) but Docking Port Alignment Indicator and flying the prox ops and docking manually is where it\u0027s at if you want a sense of accomplishment and if you really want to minimize monoprop usage.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsee, this is what I\u0027m getting at when I say people are inexperienced*.

Maybe you\u0027re saying you like to do \u0022docking challenge runs\u0022 and do things the hard way just to spice things up?\u00A0 I get that, though I prefer my pointless self-imposed challenge elsewhere in the game, and letting docking be quick and easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyhow, my point is that doing things the vanilla-game easy way is the default mode of mastery, and changing where the game\u0027s challenge lies is a subjective, personal thing and not a requirement of being an expert.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Meecrob","CreatedById":104543,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-27T23:25:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224393357\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224740\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221716840167\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257336\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LameLefty\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, LameLefty said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLOL, read again.
