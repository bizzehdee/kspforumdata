It\u0027s extraordinary to think that a complex organism like this can just happen to have all the capabilities to survive in space, just by pure evolutionary luck. I mean, there is no real advantage of a bug being able to survive in space if it just lives in water/dirt/mud/rock, so it is incredibly unlikely to have happened... yet it has. There are explanations of course, for example, sometimes the bugs don\u0027t have an open-air space to live in so they need another way to collect or store oxygen, or sometimes the bugs live in volcanic areas or glaciers that require lots of thermal shielding. But to have all the qualities in one bug, that is incredible."},{"CreatedByName":"Pipcard","CreatedById":2541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T06:34:07Z","Content":"They\u0027re also known as \u0022water bears.\u0022 Yeah, an eight-legged bear."},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T06:43:02Z","Content":"Its not luck, and it wouldn\u0027t survive on mars in the long term.\n\nIt can survive being completely dried out\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trehalose#Biological_properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trehalose#Biological_properties)\n\n\u0022When tardigrades (water bears) dry out, the glucose in their bodies changes to trehalose when they enter a state called cryptobiosis \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC a state wherein they appear dead. However, when they receive water, they revive and return to their metabolic state.

We found some in a meteorite fragment ?\n\nTardigrades have been taken to space several times by NASA and ESA. Before that they had been pumped down to a hard vacuum in the lab on Earth. Aside from their ability to switch to spore mode to survive dessication, tardigrades\u0027 main survival advantage is that they have very simple bodies. Each species has a fixed number of cells that is the same for every individual in that species. This makes them more resistant to radiation because damaged cells can be replaced without turning into runaway tumours for example."},{"CreatedByName":"RAINCRAFTER","CreatedById":127524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T12:04:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E They\u0027re also known as \u0022water bears.\u0022 Yeah, an eight-legged bear.\n\nYeah, I call them that a lot more.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E How was it discovered Tardigrades have survived space ?

For example, about how they can live in space. No, they can not.\n\nOr how they can survive indefinitively in space and be brought to life. No, they can not.\n\nOr how they can be exposed to massive doses of ionizing radiation and all of them are still crawling around happy. No, they can not.\n\nThey are very tough, but by no means will they survive, let alone live in harsh environments.
