It\u0027s extraordinary to think that a complex organism like this can just happen to have all the capabilities to survive in space, just by pure evolutionary luck. I mean, there is no real advantage of a bug being able to survive in space if it just lives in water/dirt/mud/rock, so it is incredibly unlikely to have happened... yet it has. There are explanations of course, for example, sometimes the bugs don\u0027t have an open-air space to live in so they need another way to collect or store oxygen, or sometimes the bugs live in volcanic areas or glaciers that require lots of thermal shielding.
