What method do you use to work out the best launch window to match a polar orbit? I know you need to account for the planets rotation pushing your orbit Eastwards, but I\u0027m having trouble working out how to adjust the map view so I can see when KSC is under the target orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny tips gratefully received.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-27T11:02:02Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2015 11:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Clipperride\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-26T23:39:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis works well:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Zoom out enough that you can see the target orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Rotate the map view until you\u0027re looking at the target orbit edge-on (i.e. when it collapses down to a vertical line across the screen that passes through Kerbin\u0027s center, instead of a long oval)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Time warp until your ship is located right on that line (in front of Kerbin or behind, either one works)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Your ship is now directly under the target orbit.

The planet\u0027s rotation does affect your heading - to launch into a 90 degree inclination you actually need to aim slightly west of north during the ascent. But it doesn\u0027t affect the timing much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Retread","CreatedById":89946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T02:35:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo more tips:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. If you need to make a plane change to match your target orbit, do it when you are as far from Kerbin as possible to minimize the required deltaV. In other words, raise your periapsis out to the ascending/descending node of the target orbit, and do a combined maneuver to raise your apoapsis and match planes at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Double check the direction of the target orbit before you launch, it\u0027s easy (for me, at least) to launch in the exact opposite direction you need to go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clipperride","CreatedById":149816,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T11:01:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the tips.
