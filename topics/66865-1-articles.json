W = F * D This is an equation, Yes I\u0027m going faster so there is work being done but that doesn\u0027t make sense because if I am in a rocket it is not different. For example propellant is expelled at 500m/s while on the ground that is -500 m/s. Well what if I\u0027m in space going 20,000m/s? Well I am obviously someone on earth will look and see rocket going 20,000m/s but in my mind on the rocket i am not moving the earth is just going around me. When my rocket burns since I\u0027m going 0m/s (from my reference frame) the propellant is also being expelled at 500m/s so -500m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.If it is simply a trade off kinetic energy and potential energy where does my energy go if i burn at the apoapsis of my inclined orbit and make my orbit a circle.

That is simply not true. Energy is only conserved in an \u003Cem\u003Einertial\u003C/em\u003E frame of reference. If you consider everything from perspective of the rocket, you are in an accelerated frame of reference, and energy is not conserved. So your analysis is faulty. If you want to analyze it from perspective of energy, you should be considering motion relative to the star/planet, as that\u0027s, effectively the relevant inertial system. In that system, you are moving faster when you are closer to star/planet, and therefore, you get more work out of the same amount of fuel due to traveling a longer distance while burning it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-27T00:55:58Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2014 12:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by K^2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T00:13:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOberth is rather hard to explain without indulging in some math. So please bear with me here, I\u0027ll try to keep it simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, when you move your kinetic energy is equivalent to your velocity squared. So if you go 10 times as fast you contain 100 times as much kinetic energy. This is where the Oberth effect gets important, since the rocket always has the same amount of delta V regardless of velocity. As you say, the rocket doesn\u0027t care how fast it goes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay your rocket has 10m/s of delta V. If start out stationary you start with 0 m/s and end with 10 m/s.

Normally this is just a matter of reference frames, from the perspective of a train moving at 100m/s along your rocket you still only gained 100 units of energy. But when you include a gravitational field things get interesting because an orbit is a constant exchange of potential energy and kinetic energy. As you fall closer to the planet you lose potential energy and gain kinetic energy and vica versa. Your orbital energy is always constant and equal to your kinetic energy relative to the planet and your potential energy. So if you want the maximum bang for your buck you need to fire your engines when you go fastest since this increases your kinetic energy the most.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/wF6pBViU6ws?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E would be the old party trick with a tennisball and a basketball that drop at the same time. When the basketball hits the ground it bounces up and hits the tennisball causing it to fly much higher than your initial drop height. When you go down (Fall to periapsis) your spacecraft consists of both the basketball (fuel) and the cargo (tennis ball). When it goes back up it leaves behind the basketball meaning that all the kinetic energy ends up in the tennis ball, causing it to move much higher.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"travis575757","CreatedById":83941,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T00:23:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ralathon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ralathon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay your rocket has 10m/s of delta V.
