It was a very specific one and I was wondering if anyone knew the model number. It is an older drive and I was told by someone it was an introduction/low end 250gb Raptor, although not labeled as a raptor, I believe when the raptors first came out. Anyone have any clue. I\u0027m not certain what else there is to describe them. They were on sale for like 25 buck a piece from new egg a while back and I was trying to refind the model number to compare them to newer drives for performance comparisons. Anyone know what drive I\u0027m talking about. They said they were a little noisy too. That was their basic downside. Sadly the thread I originally asked about it on a different forum has been lost. I\u0027ve now forgotten which model it was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if anyone does know the drive do you know how it is compared to modern drives in a raid. I\u0027m trying to figure out which normal SATA drives now if any are comparable for raids(non SSDs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Actually, it may not have been a Black drive afterall. It may have been an RE3 or RE4. Anyone know how those hold up compared to other newer SATA drive. Wether they are made for Raids or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-29T04:41:36Z\u0022 title=\u002209/29/2015 04:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
