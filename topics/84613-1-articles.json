I\u0027ve done seperate installs for mods in the past, and it worked fine. Today, I attempted to use the launcher in the game files (as opposed to Steam) to launch KSP. I was greeted with \u003Ca href=\u0022http://gyazo.com/1d41b3c50575216d537ff70dc2e62236\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E. Is this some new 0.24 DRM, or did I just mess something up? My KSP was heavily modded, but I wiped the Gamedata folder (I kept Squad and NASA of course) and the problem persists. Any help would be appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-14T23:57:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had that happen a couple of weeks ago so I just used the KSP .exe shortcut instead for a while.
