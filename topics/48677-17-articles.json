Since it doesnt make a difference in the sums of both approaches, it would be up to player preference (more payload for taking samples home -\u0026gt; less time\u0026amp;energy for experiments and transmissions needed), just like it is now. The basic change i am suggesting then amounts to: Instead of having a sample taken home be worth x times the experiment conducted in space with the data getting transmitted, it should be worth x mbit of it, and the mbits should accumulate in an analogous (but not neccessarily linear) fashion as time passes while the experiment is being conducted and its conditions persist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, i know, time-warp and all that - but how is that any different from, or worse than, clicking the same buttons over and over (even - or even moreso - if it\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s just one key)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ShadyAct","CreatedById":72459,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T10:33:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rizendell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rizendell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKerbal explosion program SRS BUSINESS \u0026gt;\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E GRRR T_T\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could deal with it, play sandbox, wait until the game is actually done, fix it yourself, use a tech tree mod, or play a different game.

The second is the amount of gathered data on this EVA (in this case). Both would rise as time passes during EVA, with a speed depending on the first (if its low, increase will be faster - and vice versa).
