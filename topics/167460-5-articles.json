First of all, it gives me a standard reference frame when discussing the game and also means I only have to learn one set of rules and learn them well. Secondly, a number of mods basically are their own game within a game (KSP Interstellar is one of these) so in those cases, I feel the mod takes over the game and I\u0027ll neglect the stock game because I nearly compulsively have to use everything somehow in these situations. Thirdly, I like simplicity so dealing with just stock keeps it simple and more resistant to upgrades as well as being lighter on the system (something I obsess over for some reason). Finally however, I just don\u0027t want to repeat my experience with Orbiter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor context, before I discovered KSP, I was really into Orbiter, however, as the simulator itself was so basic, add-ons were pretty much a necessity. As a result, I spent a lot of time searching for mods and, went a bit ... overboard. I spent almost all my Orbiter related time collecting add-ons (and I had quite the collection) and planning installations fitting with a specific theme and what scenarios to custom build and I think you get the picture. Basically, I barely spent any time playing as I spent all my time obsessing over getting the interconnected dependencies for the mods and trying to blend them into one consistent set for use, something that turned me off mods for the most part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said however, I don\u0027t look down on people who use mods (my favourite mission reports are rather heavily modded) I just personally prefer stock (or something functionally the same) for myself. For other people, they aren\u0027t me and what works for me won\u0027t necessarily work for them, everyone has different experiences and preferences. The main reason I may be more interested in a report or the like in full stock is because it is more relevant to my playstyle and ideas on display are more directly applicable to my gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, in short (can I ever write a short explanation of anything?) I personally prefer the stock parts and mechanics but I fully recognise and accept that other people have different preferences and use more significant mods or none at all. As long as the differences are kept civil, I can hardly see a problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSincerely\u003Cbr\u003E\nAviosAdku\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-12T01:44:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223238605\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022167460\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221512755285\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022177745\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022harrisjosh2711\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 12/8/2017 at 12:48 PM, harrisjosh2711 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really don\u0027t get the whole thing about making rockets out of junk found on the side of the road.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223238678\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022167460\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221512761812\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022170602\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerbital\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 12/8/2017 at 2:36 PM, Kerbital said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d also would prefer the game to be more serious.
