If you see a real rocket failure the explosions are not only more massive but they have a fireball and smoke cloud aftermath that lasts minutes. I\u0027ve looked in the game files to see if I can slow down the default explosions but I haven\u0027t been able to find where they are located. Does anyone know if it is possible to slow down or otherwise modify the default explosions so we get better explosion effects?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s what I\u0027m talking about (this looks the most like a kerbal rocket failure IMO) - Caution: Keep volume low, or you might be deafened\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ycRVAcZC5R4?start=16\u0026amp;feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-22T05:53:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi all the stock explosion FX\u00A0 you see in game are all\u00A0 packaged in an uneditable asset bundle , along with 90% of the non part textures .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a snag with explosions in general,\u00A0 realistic explosions take a lot of particles to pull off nicely, and the more particles the more it will take of the game to create them \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 Cartoon FX you can have easily and it\u0027s fairly low resource use .
