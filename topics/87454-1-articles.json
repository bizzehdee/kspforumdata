Fun in that I was able to figure out what most of the things did and a chore in that at a certain point there was nothing more to figure out from the configs provided.

Those two really define what can be done with strategies, so it\u0027d be great if this could be explained in detail.

I knew it was going to be dancing on the edge of allowed/not allowed, but it\u0027s been maybe the first update which I have ever seen, where zero information was provided on an update\u0027s features modding. I just wanted a more visible channel to Squad. I\u0027ll just leave it for what it is now. If they don\u0027t respond, they don\u0027t respond.
