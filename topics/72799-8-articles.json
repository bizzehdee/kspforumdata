Second, it\u0027s two parts - only one if you are also a TAC-LS user (or one of several mods) wanting water. And folks will mess that up.

Understand that from an opposite angle, some of the bits we include are designed to reduce ship part count, not catalog part count. We do this when possible (like the fuel hatches that use FireSpitter, or TweakScale for some of the MKS modules). But in other cases, this isn\u0027t practicle. In those cases, we reuse textures where possible and keep the bits together.
