Although when I am making an interplanetary craft, base, or anything that needs to be assembled in orbit, I usually build it as one big station in the VAB then break it into components to be launched up separately."},{"CreatedByName":"Warhawk","CreatedById":137412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T22:39:04Z","Content":"Everything I do is part of a larger system, which means various creations have tasks that all work together to get somewhere. Individual design is secondary to the program as a whole. Naturally compatibility between ships could be a problem, but thanks to the wonderful world of standardized docking points and the Kerbal Attachment System mod, I can avoid the worst of real life\u0027s problems in that regard.\n\nThe system is governed by three tenets: The Mission, the Means, and the Future. Mission is straightforward: the short to medium range goal, be it landing on the Mun or orbiting Duna. The Means is determined by what parts I have available; I refuse to speed-tech in career so I have identifiable eras and limitations in technology are always foremost on my mind. And lastly I say the Future because I don\u0027t want to send up half a million credits of space junk once the job is over.\n\nFrom that point on, each ship/station/device has a given role and is produced and launched in the order that is needed. I have an unwritten checklist for each kind of vehicle, drawing directly on real-life principles such as redundant systems, emergency abort modes, generous life support requirements, radiation shielding, and so on. Various mods make these things pertinent, like life support and random system failures, but even when there aren\u0027t mods I do it for the sake of the experience.\n\nBut the intention of designing for the future is important, which is why I give all of my designs more than they ought to have for the Mission they\u0027re meant for. A fuel station will have extra docking ports for more tankage. A space tug will have mounting points for different docking port sizes and claws to carry different payloads. Landers will be rated for the most demanding planet in a system, such that they can be used on any other moon or planet nearby, assuming complete recovery. Some consider this wasteful, but I have the last laugh when my 20 year old station is feeding argon gas to nuclear-electric spacecraft en route to Eeloo, at a fraction of the cost of their expendable ships.\n\nAs for specific ships themselves, I already have a good idea of what each part is capable of. It helps to stay as stock as possible, since this is experience gleaned from repeated use. Likewise, I have \u0022families\u0022 of designs rather than custom launchers/spacecraft/landers for each and every sortie, further improving both reliability (incremental improvements) and flight crew experience (my own). Starting with an objective within a mission, and knowing what each part is capable of, I build vessels all in one go, and then test them as separate parts: A rocket or station designed part by part will not show you the overall mass distribution and/or performance until it\u0027s assembled, whereas building the whole thing in one shot and then fine tuning it in chunks avoids that problem. Kerbal Construction Time gives you a \u0022Simulation\u0022 mode that costs money but doesn\u0027t actually blow things up and get astronauts killed. I use it to test each segment in sequence. \n\nOther than that, there aren\u0027t any hard and fast rules I follow. The order that I build and test segments of ships, which are segments of systems, is arbitrary until things really get moving in space. From then on time is a factor due to crew and part endurance."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T22:43:56Z","Content":"I\u0027ve played around with the stock parts for so long that I can envision stuff just clicking together, kinda like in the Lego Movie with the holographic parts.
