By definition, abduction is not likely to be pleasant.

Sometimes as harmless tongue-in-cheek fun, sometimes as an excuse for some nasty thing (\u0022Aliens made me lose my job! It wasn\u0027t the alcohol, but aliens, honest!\u0022), and sometimes because something weird happened and people decided to drop it in the \u0022aliens\u0022 slot due to some form of laziness or wishful thinking.
