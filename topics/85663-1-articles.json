Inside the MODEL node, \u0022scale = blahX, blahY, blahZ\u0022 determines the scaling of the model and its transforms. Default is 1.0, 1.0, 1.0. It does not affect node positions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Outside the MODEL node, \u0022scale = foo\u0022 works as above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Outside the MODEL node, rescaleFactor works as above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHOWEVER, there is a bug in scaling. For parts with MODEL nodes, rescaleFactor is applied twice to the mu, *unless* (a) the part is the root part of the vessel and (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E you\u0027ve reverted to launch (or perhaps switched in flight? Don\u0027t recall). All other times, it is applied twice. What this means is that if you have scale = 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 in the MODEL node (or no scale at all), and rescaleFactor = 1.25, then your mesh will actually be 1.5625 as big, but your nodes will be scaled outwards 1.25.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this reason, when scaling parts using MODEL nodes, it is suggested to leave scale (outside the MODEL node) and rescaleFactor both at 1.0, and instead both change the scale = x, y, z inside the MODEL node and manually scale the positions of the attach nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RuralTowner","CreatedById":90543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-30T03:56:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay I see.
