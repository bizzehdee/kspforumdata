As far as the gamesave is concerned however, it\u0027s probably gone. If your computer is set to do regular backups, and if KSP is in a directory that is backed up regularly, then that\u0027s the first place I would look to try and get back some of what you\u0027ve done. After that, I think maybe you can right click on the persistent.sfs and look for an option that says \u0022restore previous versions\u0022, but that is also going to be dependent on your window\u0027s system restore settings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Novocastrian","CreatedById":129582,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T02:49:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help, I managed to restore a version from earlier this year.
