I cannot utilize them at all for fear of ripping my shuttle to pieces. Any time I move anything remotely out of the cargo bay, oscillation starts up and builds to the point of destruction.

Physics like that in KSP never seemed to work correctly. Although BobCat and Romfarer have mentioned that when you do use the arms make sure that CAPSLOCK is on, and pre plan your movements with the arm going for as long as you can, instead of abruptly stopping and starting again. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LawnDartLeo","CreatedById":61230,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T14:11:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESAS on and off on the shuttle.

My shuttle has a reaction wheel and mechjeb and I usually set it to track prograde. There is some momentum changing along the arm with payloads, but this is to be expected. Using the fine movements tends to eliminate the rebound effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBiggest thing though, is that the craft with the arm needs to have sufficient mass to serve as a solid base for the arm.
