Hmm, female Kerbals. There goes my hypothesis that Kerbals are fungi. Or OTOH, maybe they\u0027re still fungi, just different species? Who knows. Either way, they\u0027re not getting special treatment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOTOH, there\u0027s now stock refueling. So, that\u0027s what I\u0027ll be doing this go-round, largely making it up as I go along. However, because the ore-related parts are way down the tech tree, I had to do a lot of stuff before I could even get there. Plus there\u0027s Kerbals to level up and all. So as with every career mode game, there\u0027s all the early grinding before getting to the fun stuff. So I\u0027ll try to keep this brief and just hit some of the highlights. After all, the new tech tree, combined with the removal of nearly all science rewards from contracts, has turned even Easy Mode into a serious grind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe story picks up as the end of the tech tree is becoming visible. The minimum kit required for ore exploitation has finally been unlocked and the window for Duna is only a few weeks away. Time to brainwash a batch of pressganged slaves---er, I mean train a class of eager new recruits, in the basics of their jobs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPhase I Indoctrination\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few supernovas ago, the radiation altered Kerbal genetics, giving them all learning disabilities. No longer could they be trained merely by a \u003Cem\u003EClockwork Orange\u003C/em\u003E-style video barrage and drug regimen while en route to their destinations. Now they actually had to have some hands-on training as well, although the old methods remain in use to drum the lessons home. The upshot was that before sending Kerbals off to pump gas on Vall for all eternity, they had to go on training missions as well. So the boffins designed a mission and a special ship for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/soKJK8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7798/17322772485_22c4044e78_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002217322772485_22c4044e78_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 1st feature of note is the use of a Hitchhiker instead of a capsule, to hold more Kerbals for less mass. Given that none of the occupants know anything about actually flying rockets, the lack of a command pod is no problem. That\u0027s why we have probe cores. The other main feature is the very large transfer stage, needed to fit the requirements of the mission.

For some obscure reason, such a trip is required to reach the 3rd and final level of indoctrination. The vehicle consists of the Mk3 cockpit and passenger bay, an orbital maneuvering stage, a transfer stage, and then the big 5m Space-Y lifter. The upper stages have rather more dV than they really need, but this is as small as the fuel tanks come. Also, there\u0027s a time crunch. A round trip takes 9 days and some of these Kerbals have to catch rides to Duna in 19 days. So rather than a leisurely return using multiple aerobraking passes, this beast has the macho to bring its post-aerocapture Ap down with fuel to spare. Besides, the entire mission relies on exploiting KSP\u0027s 2-body physics, which sometimes can be glitchy and invoke the Kraken, so the fuel is also there to make sure the ship can get home at all if things go haywire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo all available Kerbals, 16 in all, were prodded aboard and locked inside.

Everybody knew that they had to pay the pressgang $100K to catch a new Kerbal, but everybody was bored with nobody to perform fiendish experiments on, so pretty soon the pressgang dragged in Sigke. She was sent to Mun in the Minmus lander just to see if it would work. To calm her fears, she was given an extra dose of Kerbal Joy Juice in her chemical indoctrination regimen. This appeared to have the desired effect as Sigke had a huge, rictus grin and a blank stare throughout the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/s8AroM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7668/17151210669_3fc11c5c1e_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002217151210669_3fc11c5c1e_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting down worked but that and taking off again used up pretty much all the fuel, so Sigke had an eventul return involving dead-stick aerobraking for about 3/4 of an orbit straight in from Mun.

The Indoctrination Cruiser was now in Kerbol orbit, at a slightly larger radius than Kerbin. Thus, it was now going slower than Kerbin, despite having just burned a heap of fuel to be going significantly faster than Kerbin. So Kerbin was catching up from behind, and the slight inward hook of the Iindoctrination Cruiser\u0027s path helped put it more in the way. Things were a bit dicey, with the map view rapidly flickering between showing the Indoctrination Cruiser in Kerbol orbit, in Kerbin orbit, or some Kraken-spawned place all by itself. However, a small burn half-way between retrograde and radial inwards solved all that and got a solid fix from Kerbol\u0027s SOI back into Kerbin\u0027s. Time in Kerbol\u0027s SOI = about 1 day. During which time, nobody dared open the hatch or even send a crew report due to the presence nearby of the Kraken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/sq1WKa\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7775/17337056031_931be4d34f_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002217337056031_931be4d34f_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so the Indoctrination Cruiser reentered the Kerbin system with all hands properly baptised by the Kraken and now ready to explore other planets.
