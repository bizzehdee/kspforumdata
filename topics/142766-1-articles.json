Read the \u0022how to get support\u0022 sticky posts at the top of both the modded and unmodded support forums. In addition to those guidelines, support for hardware related items like you describe can be improved by posting the settings.cfg file from your KSP install along with a dxdiag report of you system. And, I\u0027ll warn you straight up, while it is possible to get the game to run on cheaper and older systems, it ain\u0027t easy. It\u0027s gonna take time and patience and persistence. It\u0027s often just better to use that same amount of time to earn some cash and buy better hardware.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
