If dark matter does not exist, geocentrism must be true. If something odd happens in the CMB, geocentrism must be true. Anything that cannot be currently explained by mainstream science, geocentrism must be true. If I fail to brush my teeth this morning, that can only mean geocentrism is true.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother common pattern: If an established scientists says something against Geocentrism or simply talks about the mainstream model, he is either blinded by ideology or pursuing a hidden agenda, trying to pull wool over your eyes, making you complacent with the status quo, etc.. If an established scientists says that it cannot be ruled out Earth is at a special place in the universe, BAM! There is your proof! They all know it! They are hiding the truth!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENowhere is this more obnoxious than with Einstein\u0027s equivalence principle. We have been there before. Yes, Einstein says an Earth centered frame is just as valid as any other reference frame. Sungenis concludes from that that Einstein (Einstein! And NASA, too!) confirmed the Geocentric model as valid. And therefore, Sungenis is right. And therefore, mainstream science is wrong (this is implied in the material I reviewed, not spoken out, and the whole argument I have not seen written out, but issued on the podcast).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo. That leap of logic does not work. Einstein speaks of General Relativity here, or more specifically, one of the Equivalence Principles. If you use that to argue for your case, you have to accept it with all consequences. You have to accept that other coordinate systems are, a priori, just as valid as an earth centric one. And you have to accept GR or a similar theory, or you will not get equivalence to rotating frames.

I am a little unclear on which equations of motion he accepts; the site at one point says neither GR nor Newton don\u0027t explain the observed universe, but in the Podcast, he explicitly references Newton.

The center of mass of a system is an abstract position, not necessarily tied to an object. And it can move.

Sungenis: Yes, this would be the most likely scenario.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question uses the correct formulation; in a Newtonian universe, the Earth could be at the center of mass. But: No, it does not work like that. Just because an object is at the center of mass now and in rest relative to it does not automatically make it stay there. Take this simple fictional arrangement (units do not matter):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Earth\u0022 at x = 0, mass 1; \u0022Moon\u0022 at x = -4, mass 1/2; \u0022Sun\u0022 at x = \u002B1, mass 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe center of mass in this case is at \u0022Earth\u0022. But because gravity drops with distance squared, the \u0022Sun\u0022 pulls it twice as hard as the \u0022Moon\u0022 and it will drift towards the \u0022Sun\u0022. In the real world, even if you take his massive ether into account, we\u0027d still have the Sun tugging us around, after all, its disturbance would need to be strong enough to catch the other planets in its orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd in GR, the barycenter of a system is not definable.

That could at least fit observations. Problem is, nature breaks symmetries in certain orders. And isotropy goes down before homogeneity. Water vapour is, on average, homogeneous and isotropic. Ice is still homogenous, but the crystal structure breaks isotropy. (Liquid water is weird, already partially breaking isotropy.)

So it\u0027s easy there: the objects are accelerated relative to absolute space. In GR, it\u0027s complicated. You need to define \u0022isolated from the universe\u0022. Do you mean \u0022sufficiently far away from all other matter so that no interaction has ever happened\u0022, or somewhat equivalently \u0022In an otherwise matterless universe\u0022? In that case, GR cowardly refules to give an answer that would satisfy you. The predictions of GR do not only depend on the matter distribution and movement, but also on initial and boundary conditions on the metric (boundary conditions do not imply that there is a boundary; they can be and usually are asymptotic). The Thierring paper mentions that. For universes with not much mass in them, those conditions determine pretty much alone which reference frames are inertial and which are not. Non-inertial frames will show the \u0027imaginary\u0027 coriolis, centrifugal and gravitational forces. In the non-rotating and non-accelerating ones, Newton\u0027s laws apply in good approximation for slow movements. So you\u0027re back at Newton with absolute space replaced by inertial reference frames determined by the boundary conditions.\u003Cp\u003EPut differently: GR is not fully Machian.

Early in their life, they start out with high intrinsic redshift and low brightness, and as they age, the redshift decreases and brightness increases. I suppose that intrinsic redshift would be quantized. How that would lead to an overall effect on the total redshift distribution, I don\u0027t know.

I\u0027m not here defending geocentrism. My main interest isn\u0027t Physics. My interest is Philosophy, and as I said before, I have a particular interest in scientific imposture because I figured in many cases they happen due to bad philosophy, not necessarily dishonesty. I recommended the book because it\u0027s easier for you to read it and figure out your objections, than we debate it indirectly here, since you know the physics much better than I do, and my main interest isn\u0027t the physics anyway.

Scientifically, I don\u0027t agree with geocentrists any more than I agree with mainstream. I\u0027d even accept your sarcastic remark that anything that fails in mainstream science is taken by them to mean that geocentrism is true, because I see no difference between that and how scientists use all sort of tricks to workaround ideologically unacceptable observations. The issue for me, which is how this relates to the QM topic, is whether someone is taking their metaphysical and epistemological assumptions as reality itself. As far as I\u0027m concerned, both sides of the issue do that, but only mainstream scientists do it and at the same time claim that philosophy is dead, or that only science can give an accurate description of reality, or even that modern science is solely evidence-based and lacks any ideological motivation in its assumptions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, all your objections related to the 2010 conference and the review on it are answered by the book, and this is no hyperbole.

Back in 2011, after some crackpots claimed we were given warning of the 2010 Haiti earthquake by the alignment of a recently discovered approaching comet, just for the fun of it I crossed data from the US Geological Survey database with the orbits of many known comets in the JPL Horizons system, accounting for their distance and angle of alignment with the Earth and the Sun. I found many similar alignments correlated with earthquakes and took note, but the comet they were talking about really nailed it. The earthquake happened almost in the same day when the angle of alignment was closest to 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA. As scaring as that can be, this method predicted the 2011 Japan earthquake within less than a week, on the next alignment. Coincidence, probably. I had even forgot it by the time it happened, but after it happened, I realized many people found a similar correlation, and that was fueling all kinds of catastrophisms and conspiracy theories, turbo-charged by the whole 2012 mayan calendary thing. If the correlation had any truth to it, on the next alignment the effects indeed would be catastrophic, much more than what happened in Japan. An old physics colleague who actually knew about geocentrism told me that would make some sense in the geocentric model, since it basically follows the machian principle on these matters, and that\u0027s how I got interested in it. As I said, I have an interest in scientific imposture, and heard about geocentrists claims before, but up to that point I never investigated it more seriously because I imagined they were claiming there was some conspiracy hiding everything, like flat-earthers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo matter how much my rational side kept saying that was just a funny coincidence, I can\u0027t tell you how relieved my lizard brain was when I read on the news that the comet was disintegrated by a coronal mass ejection months before the predicted next alignment. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf the assumption that Earth is not balanced on top of a hairpin and kept there in spite of being in a gravity whirlpool is an ideology for you, I happily plead guilty as charged.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, the ideological issue at the root of the problem is the oldest there is: purpose vs. chance.

If you don\u0027t want to read the book, it\u0027s also answered by Martin Selbrede in the article below. Basically, not only Earth is not moving besides all those forces, they are precisely the reason why it doesn\u0027t move.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIt is often objected that if geocentricity were true, and the rotating heavens were dragging Foucault pendula and weather systems around, why doesn\u0027t that force pull on the earth itself and drag it along, causing it to eventually rotate in sync with the heavens? It appears that this straightforward application of torque to the earth should cause it to rotate in sum, but this turns out to be an oversimplification. As the heavens rotate, and the firmament rotates on an axis through the earth\u0027s poles, each firmament Al particle (the ones comprising the ultradense lattice) also rotates with the same angular velocity. Ironically, this is precisely the reason the earth can\u0027t be moved. In MT\u0026amp;W\u0027s Gravitation, pg. 1119- 1120, we are invited to ponder the following scenario: \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CConsider a rotating, solid sphere immersed in a viscous fluid. As it rotates, the sphere will drag the fluid along with it. At various points in the fluid, set down little rods, and watch how the fluid rotates as it flows past. Near the poles the fluid will clearly rotate the rods in the same direction as the sphere rotates. But near the equator, because the fluid is dragged more rapidly at small radii than at large, the end of a rod closest to the sphere is dragged by the fluid more rapidly than the far end of the rod. Consequently, the rod rotates in the direction opposite to the rotation of the sphere. This analogy can be made mathematically rigorous.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Now reverse the situation. If we want to cause the sphere to rotate clockwise, we would need to turn the rods at the poles clockwise, and the ones at the equators counterclockwise. (Consider the equator as a big gear, and the firmament Al particles as small gears that engage it. It is intuitively obvious that the small gears must always turn in contrary motion to the large one at the equator.) This picture is clear then: to turn the sphere, the rotation of the particles (MT\u0026amp;W\u0027s \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Crods\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and this author\u0027s \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cgears\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2) at the poles must be the opposite of that at the equator.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EHowever, in the case of a rotating firmament, all the particles are rotating in the same direction, with the angular velocity common to the entire firmament. The equatorial inertial drag is in the opposite direction as that acting near the poles. Using calculus, one integrates the effect from the center of the Earth outward in infinitesimal shells, showing that the Earth is in fact locked in place, the resulting inertial shear being distributed throughout the Earth\u0027s internal volume. It could be demonstrated that were the Earth to be pushed out of its \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cstation keeping\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 position, the uneven force distribution would return it to its equilibrium state. Intriguingly, the significance of these internal forces on seismic stress, plate tectonics, and the earth\u0027s magnetic field may prove central, if so be that these postulates survive the inevitable peer review to come.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.geocentricity.com/ba1/no071/selbrede.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.geocentricity.com/ba1/no071/selbrede.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUgh.

They need to sync the clocks when the ship is already moving. Or live with the complication of separately accelerated clocks. Which is hard!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell.. I didn\u0027t quote the article for that, I quote it for their statement that the JPL software was using a Solar Barycentric corrected with the ECI and c constant to the ECI for navigation and signal transit time. That is not a thought experiment. That\u0027s a fact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, how can that be a mistake if that\u0027s precisely the point of the experiment? How is that a mistake if GPS works fine with pre-launch synchronization and no further adjustment, as long as the master clock is in the ECI? As a matter of fact, when they use the satellite inter-tracking for syncing in orbit they have to take the Sagnac Effect into account, and that shouldn\u0027t be necessary if SR is valid. Ashby\u0027s original article goes through a lot of wordplay to circumvent that fact. Curiously, when we do what you say is a mistake, everything just works and for some strange coincidence, works with the ECI. When we do what you say it should be done to correct the mistake, it only works if we add a further correction that wasn\u0027t supposed to be needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking about this, there\u0027s one MM experiment in a moving frame, the GPS satellite network itself. I realized Howard Hayden already pointed that, and Robert Bennett considers this on the Galileo Was Wrong book. Unfortunately, I can\u0027t find Hayden\u0027s article in full, and you won\u0027t read Galileo Was Wrong, so... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, he says the latest satellites with inter-tracking are a pretty good implementation of the hypothetical huge interferometer floating around the whole Earth proposed by Michelson himself. As I said above, they can be synchronized with respect to each other using the inter-tracking, assuming each pair would be in its own frame, but you shouldn\u0027t have any Sagnac effect in that. We actually do have, which is consistent with the Sagnac effect being due to any motion relative to the ECI. Second, if you take the whole network to be a huge interferometer detecting the Earth\u0027s motion around the Sun, we should have to correct the clocks for the gradient of the Sun\u0027s gravitational potential, but we don\u0027t. It just works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne interesting fact I just noticed is that GPS raw pseudo-ranges show an \u0027unexplained\u0027 12-hour sidereal period correlated with the Sun direction, and that reminded me of a 1983 experiment that recorded \u0027unexplained\u0027 ground pulsations also with the same 12-hour sidereal period.
