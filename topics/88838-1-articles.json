I\u0027ve already tried requesting it as an official change, but others seem to think I\u0027m nuts. So maybe one of you would be kind enough to give this a shot?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) I want all of the data collection devices (thermometer, gravioli, etc.) to appear within the first few nodes on the tech tree. Having them available right at the start is fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) This might be harder, so feel free to skip it - but I want the data collection devices to have reduced effectiveness initially, and would become able to collect their full amount of science once their original positions in the tech tree have been unlocked. That way, I can have an existing probe already out at a distant location go check the biomes nearby it, rather than having to make a new mission from scratch just because I didn\u0027t have the devices when I launched the first one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone can figure out how to accomplish the second one, let me know. That\u0027s what I want the most. If I got the second one, I might just go and download that mod for re-arranging the tech tree and try to figure out how to do the first part myself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gh7531","CreatedById":117757,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T10:15:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if the second one is possible but I kind of like the idea.
