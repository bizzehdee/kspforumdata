Sorry but the general public are the crappiest testers you can get.

Of course that\u0027s why production departments need to be strict, as most QA would love to test their product way longer than is feasible financially. Unfortunately QA is usually who bares the brunt of blame and ridicule if something seemed so obviously a bug... and all I can say is if you ended up being able to read our Bugs and track our builds, I would bet 10 Million bucks that the bug was in and was even being passed around for fixes but there is this wonderful little option in the Bug reporting software that gets overused near ship date....
