In the cfg file, the drag coefficient of the parachute is set to 750 and the mass to 0.1. This means that the parachute will be very light and will have a lot of drag applied. However, you could make the parachute just as effective at slowing down pods and less likely to pull parts off of spacecraft by simply increasing the mass to 0.2 and reducing the drag coefficient to 375. However, as the Gemini tends to land a bit hard (around 6 m/s), I\u0027d say that mass: 0.2 and drag: 500-600 would be good values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key point here is that drag is dependent on both drag coefficient and mass, so something that has a drag of 50 and a mass of 2 will provide ten times as much drag as something that that has a drag of 50 and a mass of 0.2.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-29T17:59:45Z\u0022 title=\u002210/29/2013 05:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by wasmic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EForgot a period.
