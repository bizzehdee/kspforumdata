The planets and thier textures are in compiled asset bundles, which exist for the express purpose of making things load faster and making it difficult for people to move those assets outside of the game as a form of content protection, and that makes things difficult. i have seen a lot of people argue that so-and-so doesnt own or cant protech the thing they made and it makes me sick some times.
