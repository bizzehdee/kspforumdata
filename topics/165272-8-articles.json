off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point, the Circus performed its first maneuver in interplanetary space.\u00A0 The Laythe Relay Mk 3-1 (as it was now called since there as an identical Mk 3-2 in its former location\u00A0at Laythe) had been ejected from the Jool system by the tempest and now had an orbit with an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E essentially at Jool and a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E down between Moho and Eve.\u00A0 But it had 2 mid-sized relay antennae that still worked and about 1500m/s of fuel left, so could still serve a useful purpose.\u00A0 The Circus decided to spend most of that fuel right now, at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E, to give the relay\u00A0as much inclination relative to the ecliptic as possible (which turned out to be about 30^), then use the rest in 153 days at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E to pull the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E in a bit from from Jool, so that hopefully the relay would never encounter Jool again.\u00A0 The result will be an interplanetary relay that should, most of the time, be far enough off the ecliptic to provide a bank shot around the sun.\u00A0 At least if the ranges are within the capabilities of its

the song to life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==============================================\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving decided to send a mission to make contact with the Laytheans, the Emperor took the unusual step of specifying some of the\u00A0mission parameters. \u00A0These were that the mission be small and have no means of returning to Kerbin. \u00A0Small so as A) to appear weak and harmless, and B) to risk as few of the Emperor\u0027s taxpayers as possible. \u00A0And one-way to A) prevent any possibility of bringing some Laythe plague back to Kerbin, and B) to give away to the Laytheans as little as possible of Kerbal technology. \u00A0If things went\u00A0well, eventually the Circus could develop a means of retrieving the embassy staff and perhaps bring one or more Laytheans to Kerbin.\u00A0\u00A0OTOH, if things went bad, the harm would be minimized. \u00A0With these specifications in hand, the Boffins set to work designing a\u00A0suitable ship, a story for another day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, the Imperial Bureaucracy slowly ground its wheels trying to decide on who would represent the Glorious Kerbal Empire to the Laytheans and\u00A0hopefully get something positive out of this epoch-making venture. \u00A0It having been over a millennium since the Wars of Unification\u00A0had finally ended, the Glorious Kerbal Empire had long since disbanded its diplomatic corps. \u00A0Still, the empire was composed of\u00A0numerous entities that had long ago been independent kingdoms and city-states. \u00A0While many centuries of cultural assimilation had\u00A0largely homogenized the populations, the old joints in the imperial skeleton were preserved somewhat in the structure of the\u00A0regional and local governments. \u00A0As the Glorious Kerbal Empire had absorbed its rivals, it had usually left their existing\u00A0administrations largely in place. \u00A0Thus, there were many differences in regional government throughout the empire, the rights and\u00A0powers pertaining to each of which were set down in dozens of ancient peace treaties, which kept alive faint echos of former\u00A0nationalism. \u00A0Furthermore, the many treaties, having been drawn up under a wide variety of circumstances over a period of several\u00A0millennia, frequently conflicted. \u00A0As the Kerbal economy became more globalized, these conflicting terms increasingly created\u00A0problems that had to be negotiated. \u00A0This led to the creation of BUNGLE, the Bureau of Unifying Nationalistic GoaLs under the Empire. \u00A0BUNGLE was the obvious (and only real) choice as the source of an ambassador.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBUNGLE\u0027s staff were Lawyers, members of the same general bureaucrat caste as the Boffins and Scientists of the Circus, the lowest\u00A0literate stratum of the social hierarchy. \u00A0The BUNGLErs were highly trained in the constitutional and contract laws of the empire\u00A0itself and some of its component parts. \u00A0They were also the only Kerbals still able to read the many non-Kerbish languages of the\u00A0ancient treaties, those languages all having died out (except for the odd loan word) through cultural assimilation. \u00A0If the\u00A0Laytheans could speak, then perhaps a BUNGLEr could learn to understand them. \u00A0And if the Laytheans wanted to trade, perhaps a\u00A0BUNGLEr could work out a deal. \u00A0After all, \u0022Travelling Circus\u0022 was just a nickname for \u0022Trading Company\u0022, and it would be nice if it\u00A0could actually do some real trading as opposed to merely paving the way for domestic exploitation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese considerations led to the expansion of Mission Control to allow a team from BUNGLE to monitor events on Laythe and assist\u00A0their stranded colleague. \u00A0After all, none of them alone could master the intricacies of all the ancient treaties, nor speak all\u00A0their dead languages, but a collection of the most senior BUNGLErs would make a vast library of knowledge immediately available. \u00A0Of\u00A0course, getting a quick answer out of them might not be easy, as they\u0027d likely start arguing amongst themselves, but it was the best\u00A0the Glorious Kerbal Empire could do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was then a matter of picking the specific BUNGLEr to maroon on Laythe. \u00A0This would obviously have to be a relatively junior and\u00A0expendable functionary, but still reasonably skilled. \u00A0Given that the mission involved spaceflight and an alien planet, it was\u00A0considered advantageous that the chosen BUNGLEr have a technical background. \u00A0Thus, attention fell on BUNGLE\u0027s small and obscure\u00A0Patents and Licensing Division, the members of which had previously failed in careers as Scientists or Boffins.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMembers of the bureaucrat caste enjoy slightly better treatment than the general laborers of the worker castes. \u00A0As a result, rather\u00A0than simply knocking a random victim on the head and locking him into a capsule, choosing which Patent Lawyer to send to Laythe\u00A0involved an actual selection process. \u00A0First, BUNGLE\u0027s middle management reviewed the files of their subordinates, looking for just\u00A0the right combination of talent and expendability with the latter weighing more heavily in the decision as the middle-managers\u00A0sought to cull their herds of undesirables. \u00A0This ultimately resulted in a pool of 8 potential ambassadors, who were immediately\u00A0summoned to BUNGLE HQ, where their historic meeting was recorded for posterity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n**************************************************\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Fated Eight were herded into seats around a large conference table, at the head of which sat the Lord High BUNGLEr in person. \u00A0The Lord High BUNGLEr held up their dossiers and announced, \u0022Gentlekerbs, you all have been deemed the most worthy to undertake a\u00A0very special new assignment, but only one of you will actually get the job. \u00A0For the first time in centuries, the Glorious Kerbal\u00A0Empire...\u0022 (here all paused to raise their whiskey glasses and toast \u0022Glory to the Empire!\u0022) \u0022...finds itself in need of an actual\u00A0ambassador. \u00A0This ambassador will depart for Laythe forthwith for a tour of indefinite duration---Yes, what is it?\u0022 \u00A0The LHB paused\u00A0to look at the eight confused faces before him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Excuse me, Your Excellency, but what is \u0027Laythe\u0027?\u0022 asked the one who had raised his hand. \u00A0The others murmured their equal\u00A0ignorance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Laythe is the 2nd moon of Jool. \u00A0Anyway, this---Now what?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Your Excellency, what is a \u0027moon\u0027?\u0022 asked one, and \u0022And what\u0027s \u0027Jool\u0027?\u0022 asked another.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Lord High BUNGLEr dropped the dossiers, buried his face in his hands for a moment, then pushed the intercom button on the arm of\u00A0his chair. \u00A0\u0022Get the Assistant Director of Patents and Licensing in here now!\u00A0 Oh, and purge the Middle Managers who recommended this\u00A0lot.\u0022 \u00A0Turning back to the Fated Eight, the LHB smiled and said, \u0022Well, good news all around. \u00A0Not only does one of you get to be\u00A0First Ambassador to Laythe, the rest will now be moving up in the world.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a moment, the door opened and a nob of a junior lineage entered. \u00A0\u0022Your Excellency wanted to see me?\u0022 he asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, AD. \u00A0Nobody\u0027s briefed these functionaries on the whole \u0027space\u0027 thingy. \u00A0You\u0027re more in touch with the goings on up there than\u00A0I am, so please fill them in on what Laythe is and why it needs an ambassador.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, Your Excellency! \u00A0If I may use the projection equipment? \u00A0Thank you, Your Excellency.\u0022 \u00A0The Assistant Director fiddled with a\u00A0small control panel on the wall and a holographic display appeared over the center of the table. \u00A0\u0022This is the Emperor\u0027s...\u0022 (all\u00A0paused to raise their whiskey glasses and chant \u0022Glory to the Emperor!\u0022) \u0022...latest infomercial on the Kerbal Space Program. \u00A0It\u0027s\u00A0been airing every hour on the hour on every channel for the last 3 days. \u00A0Why haven\u0027t you all seen it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a mumble of uncomfortable excuse-making featuring things like \u0022that\u0027s when I de-snack/re-snack\u0022 and the like, but one of\u00A0the Fated Eight said \u0022I\u0027ve been working too hard to watch TV.\u0022 \u00A0The other Seven gave him dirty looks. \u00A0But neither of the higher-ups\u00A0had noticed because the infomercial began running at high volume just at that moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe infomercial began by informing its viewers, by means of cunning CGI which zoomed out and upwards from the main street of Kerbin\u00A0City through Kerbin\u0027s crust to the surface and a view of the space beyond, that Kerbin was in fact a vast sphere floating in space. \u00A0Then it showed a clip of the Jool system as seen from the Tracking Station, showing Kerbin, Laythe, and the other Joolian moons all\u00A0in their orbits, putting Kerbin into local context. \u00A0Next came an aerial view of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E with a rocket launching, explaining how this\u00A0\u0022space\u0022 was being explored, then back to the map to follow the rocket\u0027s progress to Laythe. \u00A0The infomercial concluded with actual\u00A0footage from the SLOPs, culminating in the grainy footage of the Laytheans themselves and stating how the Glorious Kerbal Empire\u00A0would soon be making contact with these beings on another world. \u00A0However, due to the numerous obligatory toasts triggered\u00A0throughout the narration, nobody in the room got the full story. \u00A0Still, the Fated Eight got enough of it to have their confused\u00A0expressions replaced by utter shock tinged with mild inebriation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Lord High BUNGLEr refilled his glass and said, \u0022My my, AD, this space thingy gets more astounding every day. \u00A0Such times we live\u00A0in, eh? \u00A0Thank you, AD, that will be all, lovely video BTW.\u0022 \u00A0The AD bowed, shut off the projection equipment, and left the room. \u00A0Then the LHB looked back at his audience, smiled, and asked, \u0022So, who wants to volunteer to be the First Laythe Ambassador?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only sound heard was muffled meeping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Come lads, don\u0027t be shy. \u00A0Besides, if nobody steps up, you\u0027ll all have to fight to the death to see who gets the honor. \u00A0Then\u00A0others will be moving up in the world instead of yourselves. \u00A0Think of the impact on your careers, such as they are.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, this mention of careers connected the dots in the dazed brains of the Seven, reminding them who\u0027d made the comment about\u00A0\u0022working too hard to watch TV\u0022. \u00A0Suddenly one of the Seven tossed back the rest of his whiskey, pointed across the table, and said\u00A0in a trembling voice, \u0022Your Excellency, I nominate Geoflan. \u00A0He\u0027s obviously the hardest-working one of us all.\u0022 \u00A0Immediately, the\u00A0other Seven joined in with predatory glee. \u00A0\u0022I second the nomination!\u0022 \u00A0\u0022I third it!\u0022 \u00A0Soon they were all chanting, \u0022GE - O -FLAN!,\u00A0GE - O - FLAN!\u0022 \u00A0Meanwhile, Geoflan looked around in terror, seeking an escape route, but none was available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Lord High BUNGLEr held up his hands for silence. \u00A0\u0022Nomination accepted. \u00A0Let\u0027s put it to a vote. \u00A0All in favor?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Aye.\u0022 \u00A0\u0022Aye.\u0022 \u00A0\u0022Aye.\u0022 \u00A0\u0022Aye.\u0022 \u00A0\u0022Aye.\u0022 \u00A0\u0022Aye.\u0022 \u00A0\u0022Aye.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022All opposed?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022meep\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The \u0027ayes\u0027 have it. \u00A0Congratulations, Geoflan! \u00A0You are Kerbalkind\u0027s first ambassador to an alien species. \u00A0You\u0027ll be famous even\u00A0if they eat you. \u00A0And in the unlikely event that you return alive, I\u0027m sure the Emperor...\u0022 (another obligatory toast) \u0022...will be\u00A0quite pleased with you. \u00A0That\u0027s always good for one\u0027s career! \u00A0Ah, if only I was younger, with fewer responsibilities, I\u0027d have\u00A0fought you for the job! \u00A0HAH! \u00A0Just kidding, heheh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright, Gentlekerbs, meeting adjourned. \u00A0Geoflan, you are now seconded to the Alternis Kerbol Trading Company as the Emperor\u0027s...\u0022\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0(\u0022Glory to the Emperor!\u0022) \u0022...personal representative to the beings of Laythe. \u00A0You\u0027ll be taken up to the surface where they launch\u00A0those rocket thingies, receive the necessary training about this whole space thingy and a briefing on the Emperor\u0027s...\u0022 \u00A0(\u0022Glory to\u00A0the Emperor!\u0022) \u0022...instructions, and then be on your way. \u00A0May Kerbin and all the Saints protect you and grant you success in

The first he\u00A0came to, closest to the Astronaut Complex door, said:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022SM3 Shepgard, Y2 D358: \u00A0Went on unscheduled vactation to Malaclypse Resorts and had too much of a good time.\u0022 \u00A0Hmm, curious.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next flag said:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022BM1 Adaid, Y2 D336: \u00A0Lost with Bill, Bob, and Jack in LE-1 CLOD when everything in Laythe orbit suddenly ceased to exist.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere was he going again? \u00A0Laythe, wasn\u0027t it? \u00A0This didn\u0027t sound good. \u00A0As Geoflan continued around the crescent of memorial flags\u00A0reading them in reverse chronological order, the next 3 all referred to the same disaster at Laythe, \u00A0\u0022Hmm, Y2 D358, a bit less than\u00A02 years of operations, then\u0022. \u00A0Geoflan counted the flags. \u00A017 of them. \u00A0Suddenly Geoflan realized that being eaten by the Laytheans\u00A0or never escaping from Laythe were the least of his worries. \u00A0In morbid fascination, he continued reading the flag plaques from last\u00A0to first, \u00A0After reading the fates that had befallen the most recent 9 fatalities, he came to the 2 levitating flags. \u00A0These struck\u00A0him as particularly morbidly fascinating. \u00A0However, they were floating too high for him to read their plaques. \u00A0And by now having\u00A0walked farther than he had in years, Geoflan sat down on the flagpole plinth next to the lower floating flag, pulled out his flask,\u00A0and took a swig. \u00A0He asked himself out loud what horrible fate could have befallen these particular astronauts that caused their\u00A0flags to hanging, obviously, on wires.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s not wires, its poltergeist activity\u0022 moaned the wind as it blew Kerbin\u0027s oily clouds, which looked more oily than usual in the\u00A0eclipse light, overhead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeoflan felt a chill and looked around. \u00A0Nothing had changed, nobody else was around. \u00A0Oh well, maybe he wasn\u0027t drunk enough. \u00A0Yeah,\u00A0that was it. \u00A0Too much stress since his interview with the Lord High BUNGLEr, not enough time to drink. \u00A0He took another swig and\u00A0raised his flask to the closest levitating flag. \u00A0\u0022Here\u0027s to you, ya poor bastid.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thankee mos\u0027 kindly, Sir...\u0022 whispered a dry, rattlintg voice from nowhere, yet still sounding like it was just behind him. \u00A0\u0022Me\u00A0an\u0027 Melfurt \u0027ere, we been feelin\u0027 a bit ignored since even afore we died. \u00A0Pour us a wee dram, if ya can spare it, good Sir.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeoflan jumped up and looked all around. \u00A0The weird eclipse lighitng, with Alternis Kerbol somehow visible through the disk of Jool,\u00A0made it hard to see very far but he was definitely sure there was nobody but himself in the immediate area of the flagpole. \u00A0And\u00A0Geoflan was bureaucrat caste, after all. \u00A0Workers were of no concern to him, not even their ghosts. \u00A0So he quickly recovered his\u00A0composure, sat back down on the edge of the flagpole plinth, and held up his flask. \u00A0\u0022You want some of this?\u0022 he asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022YYYYYEEEEEEEESSSSSSSS!\u0022 hissed 17 ghostly whispers, but 2 stood out as sounding particularly thirsty. \u00A0The floating flags suddenly\u00A0starting flailing around the area, accompanied by spetral shrieks and wails from all directions. \u00A0Eventually, deathly silence\u00A0prevailed and the floating flags returned to their former places. \u00A0Geoflan filled the cap of his flask with whiskey and poured it on\u00A0the ground below the floating flags, then took another swig himself. \u0022OK, ghosts of the floating flags, what\u0027s your story?\u0022 \u00A0The\u00A0spilled whiskey disappeared much sooner than it would have naturally evaporated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Cor, the good stuff! \u00A0So much better\u0027n spacer grog, innit?\u0022 croaked a voice that might have been just in Geoflan\u0027s mind. \u00A0Another\u00A0distinct yet equally disembodied voice, agreed. \u00A0\u0022Tha\u0027 hit is!

suspect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my other games, the Kerbals have been pretty atheistic but this time around, they\u0027re religious.\u00A0 They have a pantheon of Uncaring Gods, the names of which they\u0027re applying to the other planets they\u0027ve recently discovered.\u00A0 These gods are Uncaring because they have bigger issues to deal with than Kerbals, who regard themselves as an unintended byproduct of Creation.\u00A0 The chief of the Uncaring Gods is Kerbin, embodying the planet itself, not surprising for a species of troglodytes.\u00A0 However, because Kerbals are asexual, the whole concept of \u0022Mother Earth\u0022 just doesn\u0027t occur to them.\u00A0 Instead, the Kerbals view it as more of a host-parasite relationship. so spend most of their time in church praying they never aggravate Kerbin\u0027s immune system.\u00A0 They feel rather guilty for existing at all, you see \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022

spirits of most Kerbals are viewed as amalgamating into generic \u0022Ancestors\u0022 that go into the Below World, mirroring how their spores swap genetic material in the ground and eventually sprout as unique individuals with no family ties or knowledge of whose DNA they ended up with.\u00A0 But some spirits hang around as ghosts for a while (this happens more often in the Circus because these spirits often don\u0027t know how to get from space or the surface to the Below World).\u00A0 And a few others take\u00A0a wrong turn and end up heading towards the Above World, although they don\u0027t get very far without help.\u00A0 These latter sometimes make helpful interventions with the living, so the Church of Kerbin recognizes them as saints and prays them the rest of the way to the Above World.\u00A0 There, it\u0027s hoped they can better get the attention of the Uncaring Gods to swing things for the benefit of Kerbals.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSainthood is thus the only form of individual immortality available to Kerbals.\u00A0 The rest lose their individuality in the Below World, although opinions differ as to whether they become part of a vast \u0022hive mind\u0022 or simply fade into the background spiritual radiation, from\u00A0which bits and pieces of numerous former spirits are reassembled when a new Kerbal sprouts.\u00A0 Therefore, if a spirit is strong enough to linger as a ghost for a while, it definitely wants to become a saint.\u00A0 But most have no chance because they\u0027re not on the path to the Above World, although they try to fake it as best they can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeedless to say, a degree of madness and despair permeates all Kerbals, living and dead.\u00A0 In both cases, they\u0027re all about the present and looking out for #1.\u00A0 Thus, it was nothing short of amazing that the Glorious Kerbal Empire even happened, let alone that it has benevolent intentions \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022

documents were just the dossiers of his 2 \u003Cs\u003Ecell mates\u003C/s\u003E crew members, AM3 Alice and SM3 Lizeny.\u00A0 Lizeny was the more experienced, having done a month-long ground-based MOLE mission and then been aboard the MOLE 2 station for all 200 days.\u00A0 Alice, in contrast, had only been to MOLE 2 for the last 100 days, relieving the late Bill so he could go die aboard LE-1 CLOD, but that was still rather impressive from Geoflan\u0027s POV.\u00A0 He was glad to be travelling with experienced hands who could certainly handle the daily routine.\u00A0 Besides, they were living proof that spaceflight wasn\u0027t always fatal.\u00A0 That thought made him feel slightly better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis feeling went away quickly the next morning when the lessons switched from general spacer skills to the specifics of Geoflan\u0027s ride, the LE-2 FORLORN HOPE (Finding Out the Reality of Laytheans Or Returning Not, Heavy On-Planet Embassy).\u00A0 Simulations had shown that it was next to impossible to hit a specific spot\u00A0on Laythe with a conventional rocket lander.\u00A0 Various other ideas had then been tried but the only one that could reliably get the necessary\u00A0mission equipment (which included a portable embassy suite) to the desired spot was a glider-delivered rover.\u00A0 Only problem was, there was\u00A0no pilot\u00A0to fly it down.\u00A0 The only surviving bosunsmate at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E had not yet recovered from her debriefing / dissection following the Pol mission.\u00A0 Geoflan was told not to worry, however.\u00A0 Mission Control had already been quite successful flying the SLOPs around Laythe via remote control, and autonomous drone brains had improved markedly since then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, no actual landing site had yet been selected.\u00A0 It wouldn\u0027t be right on top of the Laytheans by the Monolith--that would be rude.\u00A0 But finding a good landing site for the \u003Cs\u003Eflying\u003C/s\u003E gliding embassy would require more close-in recon.\u00A0 With SLOP-4 now being part of Jool, the Circus had to send out another and decided to send 2 just in case.\u00A0 Thus was born the LE-1.5 Replacement SLOP Carrier with SLOPs 5 and 6 aboard.\u00A0 It was in fact departing for Laythe that very day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/22mg9Hb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u002238954335212_ecd489de37_b.jpg\u0022

Alice\u00A0and Lizeny for the first time (Alice and Lizeny were old shipmates) as they were being herded into LE-2 FORLORN HOPE.\u00A0 The presence of a member of a higher caste forced Alice and Lizeny\u00A0to switch to their 2nd language, \u0022Deferential Worker-speak\u0022, an archaic dialect retained due to tradition.\u00A0 Geoflan, of course, must himself switch to \u0022Superior Caste-speak\u0022 for the same reason.\u00A0 Alice and Lizeny,, having ended up in the Circus for being ne\u0027er-do-wells and only dealing with other workers since, were badly out of practice.\u00A0 And Geoflan had also only dealt with his peers all his life.\u00A0 Thus, none of them did a very good job of following society\u0027s norms.\u00A0 Still they gave it the effort, at least for this episode.\u00A0 Maybe they\u0027ll get more relaxed under the bonding influence of shared hardship?\u00A0 Your humble narrator, at least, certainly hopes so.\u00A0 They all speak the same language amongst their own kinds, after all, which would make his job a lot easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, LE-2 FORLORN HOPE was, in typical Circus fashion for lifting large winged vehicles, a

the lot.\u00A0 Then the rover would glide down to a currently undetermined location, shed its wings, and go see the Laytheans.\u00A0 Once the center of Laythean authority had been located, the crew would erect an inflatable embassy, leaving the rover free to explore more of Laythe if circumstances permitted.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd as usual with Circus bass-ackwards \u003Cabbr

worried about how one imperial\u00A0province was pirating the inventions of another.\u00A0 Now here he was rocketing away from all that on what was probably a 1-way trip to another planet, moon, or whatever, that he hadn\u0027t even known existed until 3 days ago.\u00A0 He briefly felt sorry for himself\u00A0which was necessary\u00A0because, with the gods being Uncaring and most\u00A0 Kerbals not having families, only competitors, there was nobody else to do it for him.\u00A0 Thinking the others might be feeling the same way, he said something silly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca
