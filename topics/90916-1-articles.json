I want to have 2 per wing, with one above the wing and one below. I want them to line up neatly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make this work, I build one whole wing, with the nacelles, as a sub assembly:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, I add at single wing to the top of the craft, pointing straight up. Then I use symmetry to add both nacelles to the \u0027left\u0027 and \u0027right\u0027 of the wing, which will soon actually become the top and bottom. Because the wing is aligned on the \u0027x-y plane\u0027 of the fuselage, symmetry works perfectly, and I end up with the nacelles looking very precisely aligned to each other (note in this context plane refers to a 3d plane and not an aeroplane).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that I have one wing, I can move it and use symmetry to duplicate the whole thing on the other side of the aeroplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis ^^ is where it goes bug-y.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor some reason, this \u0022symmetry of symmetry\u0022 sometimes confuses the game. This results in not two but THREE versions of my wing being stuck to my aircraft. One is fine and normal, where I wanted to put it, but both of the other two are perfectly clipping each other, making it hard to notice at first that anything has happened. The result is that I now have twice as much lift on one side of my aeroplane as on the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this, or something similar, might be what accounts for your misaligned CoL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother symptom of this happening is that when you want to radially attach single parts elsewhere on the craft, you may sometimes find yourself stuck in symmetry mode. The only way to get out of this is to try to add an in-line part to a single attachment node, which glitches the game back into single-part mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only surefire way to avoid this glitch is to make sure you don\u0027t use double-symmetry in the SPH. Another source could be using sub assemblies that take advantage of VAB symmetries which you then combine with SPH symmetry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may be worth noting that the VAB also has a similar bug that only seems to manifest when you try to add double-symmetrical parts to action groups. Then you find that only 3/4 parts, and not all 4 mirrored parts, have been assigned to the action group, and you have to add the fourth manually.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-22T16:30:35Z\u0022 title=\u002211/22/2014 04:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by The_Rocketeer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"El wonso","CreatedById":37011,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T22:46:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing Mk2 Bicoupler causes CoL shift every time for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T23:11:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The_Rocketeer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The_Rocketeer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor some reason, this \u0022symmetry of symmetry\u0022 sometimes confuses the game.
