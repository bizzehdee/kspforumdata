This would remove the engineering difficulty, technicality and challenge from the game, in a considerable way. I never gave that much thought until recently since I do not really submit challenges, but thinking about it, procedural parts would destroy the challenge submissions. Hence why challenges often state to only use stock parts as certain mods would give to much freedom at the cost of engineering skill.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIntroducing this will ignore many submitted challenges in the challenges that are posted. Because it is often the engineering challenge with the given amount of parts, shapes, sizes of tank X and part Z that make building something a actual achievement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do agree about texturing though.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat I would like to see is the standard parts, exactly as they are now, with a \u00A8tweakscale\u0027 function that allows you to make 1.25meter parts into 2.50meter parts, and arguably with smaller increment dimensions in between 1.25, 2,50 and 3,75meter parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis still allows challenge rules to state to only use the stock part size of a FL-T800 for maintaining a universal construction challenge. Making it fully procedural will allow a user to cheat size a FL-T800 tank for instance with 5% more fuel capacity to score higher in a challenge. Make it fully procedural and you can make any engine into the most powerfull engine. If you want it that way, then why even have multiple engines in the game?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy have a mammoth engine if you can procedurally increase the specifications of a LV-T30 to the same thrust without gimbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving fewer large parts would fit in nicely cleaning up the vast amount of parts in the part select menu. But make sure that part resizing is done by preset increments. So that you may make a 1.25meter part into a 1.75meter part, but not into a 1,35meter part. Because then it would be impossible to see how a user has resized any of his components when he/she shares a picture. And as stated (being rhetorical here) that would impose problem in the challenges subforum, and we wouldn\u0027t want that I think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end, I don\u0027t really understand all the \u0022stock\u00A8 requests. What\u0027s the problem with installing a mod. What is the need to want all those things in stock, when KSP is clearly a barebone sandbox game supplying necessary functions that allows full acces to anything available in the game. You want to go somewhere faster, with less parts, with nicer spacecraft armour and lasers. Then download the mod that gives it to you.\u003Cbr\u003E\nImho anything requested for stock KSP, should be things that expand what\u0027s already in it, or to make the game easier and more fun. Procedural parts would give extra complexity to construction options, making it harder for new players to get there head around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis^ just my opinion, yours may vary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-05T11:14:31Z\u0022 title=\u002207/05/2016 11:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Vaporized Steel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VITAS","CreatedById":124625,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-08T11:31:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfor me the wing editor would be the nicest thing of all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-08T11:32:59Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2016 11:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by VITAS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-08T12:43:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d be 100% behind procedural wings for stock.

And when we realize we actually need an FL-T400 in that center of our asparagus-staged stack, we don\u0027t have to dismantle our entire vessel to change that one part. We just drag it up to the next size. But don\u0027t worry, one-part-per-size people, you\u0027ll still be able to uncheck that option and force yourself to rebuild your ship to change one fuel tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as \u0022removing a challenge\u0022 I don\u0027t buy it. If you really want that challenge (in your forum challenge thread), just say no fuel tanks greater than the largest snap-to size of each tank. Or even specify that you have to use the snap-to sizes of each tank if you think someone using what would effectively be an FL-T600 is getting a massive advantage over you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-09T10:29:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222668034\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022143142\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221468057610\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022124625\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022VITAS\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 minutes ago, VITAS said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfor me its exactly what squad has to acomplish (and did so in the past) making seemingly complex things simple to use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do get your point, but 3D modelling is a whole different ball game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo include what would effectively be a trimmed down version of say Blender or Rhino would add a lot\u00A0of extra complexity with very little game play benefit other than a few sleeker looking ships. \u00A0Not that sleek looking ships are a bad thing by any means, but I\u00A0think the effort and added complexity would outweigh any\u00A0benefits by a large margin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP does a great job of simplifying space flight and rocket building. \u00A0It\u0027s not, and should not become, an entry level 3D modelling package, which it would need to be to include the (admittedly cool) features you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow,\u00A0a standalone KSP ship design modelling package could be interesting though.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VITAS","CreatedById":124625,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-09T11:38:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif you take away all the extra stuff a 3d editor contains you end up with a way to manipulate poligons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni dont want it to be a full blown 3d editor. take wings: you draw the outline in a top down view and it extrudes it into a wing model. you then simply define the root and tip thickness and profile (see tanks) and youre done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni wouldnt want to or need to edit more complex shapes like landing gears. for thos i would say simply scaling it with a set of parameters is enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nin terms of tanks it would be enough to define certain params like some mods do allready: texture, diameter / part system to conform to (bottom \u0026amp; top), sheer , profile ( the way the top and bottom connect ( curve, straight etc.)).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nin essence i imagine \u0022afdvanced\u0022 ship design to be something like drawing a blueprint with predefined parts that you can alter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
