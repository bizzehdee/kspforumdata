I built this mod whilst having Karbonite and Interstellar (both the old version originally, and then WaveP\u0027s Lite) installed together, so they seem to work together in my game. I remember reading Roverdude saying him and Wave even messaged each other i think to help with compatibility. I also read that creating multiple versions of the OpenResourceSystem folder or its files might cause problems, so to make sure to just copy one of them over from one or the other.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kertz","CreatedById":116400,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-06T17:37:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA truly amazing mod that\u0027s easily up there with all the other truly amazing mods.

Glad you like it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yeah, the Stock KSP version is obviously less tested than the Interstellar version, Cpt. So any feedback is welcome and ill take on board. As you can imagine, i was wary of making it too powerful and people screaming \u0022OP!\u0022 So i erred on the side of caution. Dialling it up slightly is always better than dialling it back and annoying folks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E So ill most likely update the Stock KSP to 1.1 first with the tweaks based on all your feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
