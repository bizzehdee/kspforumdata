I wanted to take advantage of the XP for my kerbals, so I put a Mk1-2 on it with a separater in between. Specifics aren\u0027t very important, but I landed the entire craft on the Mun with 5 kerbals, collected science, transferred that data to the lab, then detached the command module and flew 3 kerbals back into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lab I left behind is kerballed by scientists, has power, battery, antenna... but doesn\u0027t process the data into science because it has no probe core or command module. Why do I need a steering wheel to do science? Radios can play music without being attached to a car. I\u0027m fine with it not being able to opperate the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters, engines, reaction wheels, even landing gear. It just seems to me that it should do its own self contained job provided it has input, power and staff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAt the very least, it should be clear that it won\u0027t work without a command module. The in game description says nothing about that,\u003C/strong\u003E and while the wiki says it is not a command module, it does not state that it requires one to function. The solar panels charge the battery without a command module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA little miffed at the wasted time and money...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-29T13:46:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think a nice way to solve this would be having a surface attachable probe part. Just a simple computer/chip part with some sort of indication where the front is.
