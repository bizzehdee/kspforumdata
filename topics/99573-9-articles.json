For instance sending the miner out and storing fuel long before the crew/return probe gets there, having to dock to transfer stages in orbit, etc... granted that can all be done in the stock game, but it can just as easily be done with one launch on that very massive rocket because of the small dV requirements. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever like i said earlier the scaling of the planets issue has been talked about in great depth in the past.

Thats why there is a tech tree, to introduce players to parts slowly. The have stated that this is the intention.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tech tree is absolutely the \u003Cem\u003Ede facto\u003C/em\u003E end game in career. Most of us play on for other reasons, but game design comes with some psychological baggage that the designers and players need to be aware of. Players \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E play to the reward system unconsciously. It\u0027s well established, and it\u0027s why some cheap little app games are in fact so addicting. The notion that the tech tree introduces parts in some meaningful, instructive way is clearly false, one only need look at the tech tree arrangement. Where are aircraft parts relative to the landing gear? The fact is that most of the tech tree in RL is concurrent, and the arrangement currently makes the game EASIER later in the game, not harder. It would be possible to arrange it so that the first nodes would force the player to learn stuff, but I just don\u0027t think this is the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA \u003Cem\u003Egoal\u003C/em\u003E is what all the gameplay design decisions should drive. If the goal is \u0022tycoon,\u0022 then they should add features that make management, not piloting, more of a thing, instead of a tacked-on afterthought. If the goal is \u0022Science!\u0022 then make the game push/incentivize that behavior, and make science useful in actual gameplay. I don\u0027t expect a \u0022game over, you won!\u0022 moment, I just want the design goals to actually be coherent. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic question is still up in the air, IMO: \u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the point of KSP career mode?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApparently Squad once said \u0022like Tycoon, but with a space program.\u0022 (my paraphrase, not a real quote) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that is the goal, it fails---badly, IMHO. Does anyone want to play that game? Some might, particularly if Science mode was like career, but with science play rather than business play as the design goal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, if it was a \u003Cem\u003Emanagement\u003C/em\u003E game, the kerbals should be capable of acting autonomously. Not \u0022mechjeb,\u0022 but functionally similar, except the actual astronauts doing missions you design without your input. Develop a resupply craft, and task part of your program (and astronauts) to keep your space facilities in supply. Could the player do it themselves? Sure, but the game should allow you to play as designer/manager if \u0022Tycoon\u0022 is really the goal. I never played any, frankly. If there was a railroad tycoon game, would people here expect the player to manually hook up every piece of rolling stock, then act as engineer for EVERY trip made by every train in their entire, national rail system? I think not. Imagine if in some \u0022RTS\u0022 (which are neither real time, nor strategy, but I digress) required that you have to swing a hammer for XX minutes to upgrade each facility---that is entirely analogous to KSP right now. So Tycoon is not even a remote model to look at minus AI kerbals. Or of course TIME mattering\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe player as the sole pilot is a fundamental problem of KSP as a management game. Personally, I play for the spaceflight and design elements, but I\u0027d love having kerbals that could do, well, anything, by themselves, but particularly routine missions later in the game (LS resupply, etc). Heck, even just having the astronauts or probes execute planned maneuver nodes would make \u0022management\u0022 more of a real thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs the design goal of end game pre-colonization?

Better take some contracts that focus on Duna and see what missions I can incorporate into my original mission. Some people may like just building rockets and launching them into space. Career forces me to think more about how to make my missions cost effective and how to complete contracts more efficiently, and then rewards me for it. And I enjoy that. Some may not, but that\u0027s why there is multiple game settings. I don\u0027t think career is perfect, but it also doesn\u0027t need some huge overhaul.
