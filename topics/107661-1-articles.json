It also tracks science you have gathered which is held on vehicles and kerbals.\n\nNo matter what game scene you are in, what you current vehicle is, **[x] Science!** always reports on all science held anywhere.\n\nNow with in-flight status window.  No more searching around in service bays - run experiments at the click of a button.\n\n* * *\n![x-science-1.jpg](http://themoose.co.uk/ksp/x-science/x-science-1.jpg)![x-science-2.jpg](http://themoose.co.uk/ksp/x-science/x-science-2.jpg)![x-science-3.jpg](http://themoose.co.uk/ksp/x-science/x-science-3.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n**Why use [x] Science! ?**\n\n- In flight status window kind of like Science Alert\n- With a simple list and a textbox filter it is really easy to use.\n- Available from anywhere. No need to leave your craft and switch to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E Lab.\n- It reports on all science, not just the stuff you have recovered to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n- It reports on all vehicles, great for multi-craft missions. (Option to check debris for science.)\n- Report on anywhere from anywhere else. Where should you go next?\n- Wondering what to do next? Give your Kerbals a purpose.\n\n**Features**\n\n- Automatically updates when you retrieve or transmit new science experiments\n- Filter to only show experiments that are currently on your spacecraft; have been unlocked in the tech tree; or all experiments\n- Keyword search to let you find experiments quickly\n- View amount of science any experiment has left for you to find\n- Should be compatible with any science-generating mods\n- Uses stock toolbar. [Blizzy\u0027s toolbar](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60863-0-90-0-Toolbar-1-7-8-Common-API-for-draggable-resizable-buttons-toolbar) support\n- Current biome detection\n- OrbitalScience support\n- Solar Science support\n- CustomBiomes support\n- Displays amount of science you\u0027d get if you retrieved all outstanding experiments\n- Only available in Science or Career modes. It will automatically disable itself in Sandbox mode.\n- In flight status window -  click buttons to run experiments.\n- No more searching around in service bays - run experiments at the click of a button\n\n**Downloads**\n\n**Latest Version** 5.17 for KSP V1.4.5 - [http://themoose.co.uk/ksp/x-science-v5.17.zip](http://themoose.co.uk/ksp/x-science-v5.17.zip)\n\n[Older versions on the downloads page](http://themoose.co.uk/ksp/downloads.html)\n\n[**KSP-AVC Support**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745-1-0-2-KSP-AVC-Add-on-Version-Checker-Plugin-1-1-5-MiniAVC-KSP-AVC-Online) - *\u0022This mod includes version checking using MiniAVC.

I\u0027m not releasing it just yet because I\u0027ve had to change **a lot** of stuff.\n\nI was amazed by the sort of hoops Bodrick was having to jump through in order to make this mod work. KSP unloads ships that you can\u0027t see. In order to get all the science in all ships Bodrick was walking the list of loaded ships, then saving the game, then walking the saved game looking for all the other ships. It must have taken him ages just to learn how to do all this stuff.\n\nMany of the speed increases I was thinking of were already being done. I have made two changes and they really speed things up.\n\nFirstly I am getting the list of \u0022Science Subjects\u0022 from KSP only once, I then turn it into an indexed list. This takes time but if you are doing the right sort of queries on the list then it is worth it. When I was getting new science it took 3.2 seconds to refresh the list. Now it takes 0.9 seconds which is a lot more bearable. (I have a 8gigs and a nice i3 but also a lot of mods running)\n\nAlso I decided to limit the ability of a mature game getting bogged down. I no longer look for science on debris. If you, or KSP itself, renames a ship with the \u0022debris\u0022 icon then it will not be included in the next science refresh. The down side of this is that if you crash it will look like all your science is gone, you should recover your spaceship bits \u0027cos some of the science may have survived.\n\nI\u0027m gonna sit on this version for a bit longer I don\u0027t want the thread full of irate gamers. The current version works. I was using [x] Science! to find a biome to visit and then keeping it closed until I thought I had everything, then opening it for anything I had forgotten. Testing the new version it is quite hard to make myself keep it open! I\u0027ve only had the new version since Saturday but I\u0027m not closing it at all now.\n\nOK, I need to go through my log files and I want to try doing some daft things like actually crashing something full of science or dumping a stage full of science but I\u0027ll try and release this next weekend. Also I now have three new websites to build so I actually have some proper work to do. If I don\u0027t make myself release it then I won\u0027t for ages.\n\nIn the future - I think I can save another .5 seconds per refresh. Then it will be really quick (but remember the further you get in the game the more [x] Science! slows down.) I want to try and do something with the list of ship-parts-with-science that the mod builds as part of its refresh. I also want to optimise the routine that decides if an experiment is enabled or not. A lot of that routine involves walking KSP\u0027s PartsDatabase but it actually boils down to \u0022Do we have a goo container? Do we have a thermometer?\u0022 I mean if we know we have goo then we don\u0027t really need to walk the PartsDatabase again. Another half second looks possible. It might have gone into this version but I have 3 websites to build.\n\nEnjoy the slow down for a few more days, OK?\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This mod is great!\n\u003E It also makes me frustrated with all the science that doesn\u0027t seem very well thought out or creative. There is a stupid amount as KSC when you consider that other reasonable tests don\u0027t exist.\n\nI actually quite like the KSC science. It is the only reason to build a rover.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Also, a minor feature request: can you have the window \u0022remember\u0022 whether it\u0027s open or closed independently on the different game screens? For example, when I go from flight to KSC, I\u0027d like the [x] Science! window to be visible only if I had it open the last time I was at KSC, not just if I happened to have it open in flight. It might also be nice for it to remember its compact/expanded state and position independently, but that\u0027s less important.\n\nSo I have a couple of issues that people complain about. One is that the Kerbal based science (crew reports, eva, soil samples) don\u0027t get activated/deactivated in career mode. The other is that the window stays open in the main menus.\n\n- I want to optimise the routine that checks if experiments are enabled. I hoped I could work the Kerbal based science into that, and of courses it would also speed things up.\n- I thought that if I remembered which games scenes the window was open in then it would never be open in the main menus. I often use [x] Science! on the KSC over-view and get annoyed when it is still open in the VAB.\n\nThere **are** other bugs but those are the only two that people have complained about.\n\nBy the was has anyone noticed that if you have [x] Science open in the VAB or SPH then the list of experiments changes as you add science parts to your vessel? I only realised that as I edited the code on Saturday. I think you need the second filter button at the bottom of the window.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T10:22:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 10:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Z-Key Aerospace**"},{"CreatedByName":"thegreatgonz","CreatedById":135977,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T03:49:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Enjoy the slow down for a few more days, OK?\n\nNo problem.
