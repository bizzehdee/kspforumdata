In fact I would say a basic understanding of conservation of energy and thermodynamics is key to scifi spaceship design, since it means limitations are no longer totally arbitrary, since you KNOW how much energy a ship is packing, and you have to decide just how that would be regulated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn scifi we can view\u00A0a\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E fly into space and warp/hyperdrive somewhere , then fly to land and take off again without refueling at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStar Wars is a prime example.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou know how much energy that would cost? I am not even considering the hyperdrive as that is total make-believe, but the energy to reach outer space is well known...we do it often. The energy to stay in space (orbit) is a somewhat more, but we know that too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd it looks like massive tanks of propellant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously SW does not use massive tanks of propellant. Leading to not one but two conclusions if conservation of energy and thermodynamics are even remotely applied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Most of the thrust must come from some exotic reaction propulsive force, not the propellant. Since if the engine were shooting out an exhaust plume at the requisite exhaust velocities required for such high efficiencies the Millenium Falcon would glass every stretch of land behind it every time it takes off. It clearly does not. Also, no matter if the propulsion is an exotic force or super high efficiency rockets, the energy requirements remain ludicrously high. We are talking a spaceship that has enough stored energy to casually burn through the energy equivalent of a two stage orbital rocket on a whim and twice on Sundays! Without refueling! That\u0027s conservation of energy talking. This ship would explode like a tactical nuke or perhaps a full scale one if it crashed. TIES trying to dogfight\u00A0it would be be incinerated\u00A0if they actually blew it up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Either the ship\u0027s engine innards are resistant to the high waste heat energies such ludicrous performance requires or they are not. If they are resistant, that raises a whole can of worms, like why not armor the outer hull with it? Blaster bolts surely don\u0027t have near as much energy based on what we see TIES threaten with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the ship\u0027s engine is not able to take high heat loads on par with it\u0027s performance that thermodynamics would require, then there is only one conclusion. The ship\u0027s engine is 100% efficient or very,\u00A0 very nearly so, so that the waste heat actually produced is miniscule in comparision and radiator fins are not required. So perhaps that breaks both conservation of energy and thermodynamics as we know them, but that does not change the fact that the ship is a potential\u00A0bomb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny spaceship that can do a lot without even refueling is a high yield potential bomb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow how safe do you even feel in such a scifi setting LOL?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: The safest way to regulate this is a number of ways.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.\u00A0 Limiting the energy levels so not every John Doe has access to a tactical nuke of a spaceship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.
