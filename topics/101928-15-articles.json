I see several possible ways to make it work: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) Provide the volume as a kspField in a part module, and TweakScale scales it with a config like the above. The field is scaled onLoad, or whenever parts are rescaled in the editor. I\u0027m not sure how practical this is for values that do not come from the part config. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E When putting a part in a container, look for a TweakScale module and read the kspFields currentScale and defaultScale.
