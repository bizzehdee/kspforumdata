Here are the problems I found, and some ideas for solving them. \n\n**Inventory Volume**\n\nThe available volume in the inventory can be scaled in the usual way. I tested the following config, and can include it in the next TweakScale version if you are fine with it. The slot size is a guess so far, I did not test that yet. \n\n    @PART[KIS_Container1]:FOR[TweakScale]{\tMODULE\t{\t\tname = TweakScale\t\ttype = free\t}}TWEAKSCALEEXPONENTS{    name = ModuleKISInventory    maxVolume = 3    slotSize = 3}\n\n**Part volumeOverride**\n\nCan not be scaled like above because it is read from the part prefab. It might work if it is read from the part, and KIS expects it to change in the editor (so it would be read when the part is put into a container). \n\n**Part Volume**\n\nScaling the volume of a part does not work out of the box. I see several possible ways to make it work: \n\nA) Provide the volume as a kspField in a part module, and TweakScale scales it with a config like the above. The field is scaled onLoad, or whenever parts are rescaled in the editor. I\u0027m not sure how practical this is for values that do not come from the part config. \n\n![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) When putting a part in a container, look for a TweakScale module and read the kspFields currentScale and defaultScale. Then the volume becomes (volume of the prefab)\\* (currentScale/defaultScale)^3. \n\nC) Use the TweakScale API to be notified on rescale, then update the volume accordingly.\n\nD) As far as I understand the TweakScale code, it scales the visual model by scaling\n\n    part.transform.GetChild(0).localScale\n\nMaybe KIS can get the boundary box from the part instead of the prefab, in a way that is based on the 3d-model as it appears in the scene. \n\n**Hologram Sizes**\n\nThe holograms are always the original size."},{"CreatedByName":"sharpspoonful","CreatedById":83734,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T22:26:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hello, guys!
