In the end it is likely close enough though; you end up with two extra modules on the part that might not be used at all, and two extra FixedUpdate calls (which end up being essentially NOOP), and it is likely more \u0027robust\u0027 with this method (e.g. harder to break the config or part setup).\n\nSo you guys will likely see this functionality with the next release.  It won\u0027t be fully implemented on a few parts yet as I don\u0027t have solar panels ready for them (HAB).  I\u0027m -debating- on whether I should include optional built-in panels on the COS modules (default=disabled).\n\nAlso, first pass on COS module texturing (and a silver texture for adapters) (will be at least one more texture set for these parts):\n\n![ekkycbt.png](http://i.imgur.com/ekkycbt.png)\n\nShould I add ladders/hand-grips on the COS modules?\n\nStation Trusses, different sizes -- those present a bit of a problem.\n\nFirst and foremost, I don\u0027t want to design a new truss form factor.  I like the Near-Future truss shape and size.  I have always intended to use those trusses with my station parts.  Second, I don\u0027t want to step on Nertea\u0027s toes or obsolete his parts.  This means that I really -shouldn\u0027t- make my own trusses unless they are vastly different than those already offered, which I\u0027m not interested in doing as I actually like the NF trusses.  Third -- NF trusses don\u0027t include any capacity for rescaling; so it is simply not an option to have different sizes.  Fourth -- its difficult enough to make adapters for simple round tanks at different sizes/ratios; trying to do the same for multiple sizes of trusses *and* including cylinder-truss adapters for each ratio/size would be prohibitive from a time perspective.\n\nCould I make my own trusses, let them rescale, and make a ton of different adapters for them? Sure.  Do I think it is a good idea or something I want to undertake?  Not really.\n\nOn that note, I\u0027ve considered making the truss bits on the MST-ISS be part of the end-caps/adapters.  So the core part would be the central rotating cylinder and a short cylinder cap on each end; the adapters would be selectable and would include the trusses, straight cylinders, and potentially other existing adapters.\n\n(as a side note; if someone were truly interested they could make MFT-style tanks out of the Near-Future trusses at which point they -could- include rescaling...however adapters still present a few problems)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 minutes ago, RedParadize said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) I think I mentioned this before, but would it be possible to switch off SSTUAirstreamShield.

More polys to render = lower FPS.  Also more trigger-colliders for the ladder handling would impact performance.\n\nWill any of those be noticeable in-game?  Probably not really;  a few hundred or even a few thousand triangles is nothing to modern GPUs.  The trigger-colliders I\u0027m less sure on -- those are all dependent on how well optimized Unity\u0027s trigger-collider handling is -- they will be at least as expensive as regular colliders \u002B whatever additional logic is used for the triggering.\n\nI\u0027ll put together a test-case or two and see how many extra polys the hand-rails would add.  I think it is ~100 tris per hand-rail (though can probably get that down to ~60).

I would guess the two sided fairing just can\u0027t decouple properly and colide with the fairing mount.\n\u003E \n\n[@StickyScissors](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/144204-stickyscissors/), [@RedParadize](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129285-redparadize/)\n\nI had this problem with the Stock 3.75m Fairing If I had the SSTU Heat shield with HEAVY set, directly under the part for the fairings.   The base would explode right when I decoupled.   When I used the stock 3.75m heat sheild, the Fairing was mounted higher up (there was a noticeable space between the heat shield and the fairing base.   No issue.\n\nI have not done any real testing other than to swap the Heat shield.  I don\u0027t know if either of you had the same setup so I thought I would mention it.   I DO have KJR installed (do you both?) If either of you are willing to try a rocket without KJR and see what happens?   My work week is crazy this week and I can\u0027t test it further before Sunday likely."},{"CreatedByName":"Duski","CreatedById":164162,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-07T10:50:09Z","Content":"Hey all,\n\nJust a quick question. I\u0027m making a shuttle with the Space shuttle parts in this mod. I chose the no engines version as I had to make adjustments to the engines. But I don\u0027t know what to use for OMS engines. I was using the AJ10 engine (which is the one that is on the engines variant) but I could get very little delta-v out of it and it had very little thrust. So out of the engines that come with this mod, what would be the best for OMS? Also, where\u0027s a good place on the shuttle to hide your fuel tanks while still having fuel actually go to the engine?"},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-07T14:07:07Z","Content":"[@Duski](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/164162-duski/) In real life OMS was just doing orbital insertion and manoeuvring. Loaded with maximum payload the shuttle didn\u0027t had much \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E. Not i with a mass fraction that high. About the engine, I used a custom AJ10 variant indeed. Oh, quick tip to balance weight. If you change the engines high, the center of mass remain on top. Its a cheat but you can actually push your center of mass closer to the center lift doing this. About the extra fuel, you can do as in real life and place a fuel tank at the rear of the bay. I personally prefer to place it in the front, so I can use the remaining fuel to balance center of weight and lift, but thats before I also added a SSTU container to the SC-E-FSX.\n\n[@Pappystein](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/85755-pappystein/) The issue I had is caused by collision problem. I had narrow down the issue. A two sided clamshell fairing will not be be eable to decouple properly. It will turn pink and make the colliding part explode. In my setup only the SSTU fairing base would explode. I don\u0027t know if the same would happen to stock fairing trough. If you want to avoid this make a 4 sided fairing and everything should be fine. I would suggest to also raise the decoupling force as fairing sometimes fall into the rocket after decoupling if under acceleration.\n\nAbout your boiling problem. H2 is almost impossible to contain in real life, it will always leak. This will not happen with the other fuel and thats why H2/Lox is limited to lunch. There is however the zero boil of tank, as its name say it won\u0027t boil off but require constant power to work properly. You could indeed make a water to *gas* H2/OX converter and then compress it to liquid H2/OX, in real life it would drain allot of energy and be relatively dangerous in space."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-07T14:44:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 12 hours ago, Pappystein said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Ok so I have a fuel tank with ZBO set in orbit for 6 weeks.  At the end of 6 Weeks I need to top of H2 but LOX is still mostly their.   I am looking for a way to have ZERO LOSS.  That is why I asked if there was a way to have a WATER tank and a converter to convert the water into LOX and LH2.  Obviously not really part of this mod but I thought I should ask since your mod is one of the few that has boil off and ways to combat it.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E RE \u0022Easy to crush\u0022    I will do some detailed testing before I comment further.

Was the time spent during time-warp with the vessel focused, or at the space/another vessel?\n\nFuel tanks -- they should, by default, have the same impact tolerance and heat stats as stock fuel tanks.  Note that some of the tank modifiers reduce these values; such as the \u0027lightweight\u0027 tank which reduces both impact tolerance and max heat stats.\n\nThere might however be some bugs with either the thermal values for the part or with the drag cubes that are causing incorrect thermal calcs (will need to dig back in on how stock calculates thermal mass/skin mass)"},{"CreatedByName":"_Krieger_","CreatedById":160353,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-07T14:48:38Z","Content":"Will the ability to switch textures in the upper stage tanks be added in the future?"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-07T14:51:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 minutes ago, \\_Krieger\\_ said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Will the ability to switch textures in the upper stage tanks be added in the future?\n\u003E \n\nIt is already in-place/already exists, but you need to install the texture-sets download ( [https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/releases/download/0.5.32.124/SSTU-0.5.32.124-TextureSets.zip](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/releases/download/0.5.32.124/SSTU-0.5.32.124-TextureSets.zip) )."},{"CreatedByName":"_Krieger_","CreatedById":160353,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-07T14:57:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 minute ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It is already in-place/already exists, but you need to install the texture-sets download ( [https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/releases/download/0.5.32.124/SSTU-0.5.32.124-TextureSets.zip](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/releases/download/0.5.32.124/SSTU-0.5.32.124-TextureSets.zip) ).\n\u003E \n\nOh okay, I\u0027m sorry for bothering you, should have tried that in the first place."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-07T15:15:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 minutes ago, \\_Krieger\\_ said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Oh okay, I\u0027m sorry for bothering you, should have tried that in the first place.\n\u003E \n\nNo worries; not everyone is aware of the texture-sets download, especially if you downloaded the mod from Curse (where I don\u0027t even upload the textures).

So... yeah...  apparently I get the fun task of writing up some custom shaders.  Not surprising, as they\u0027de been extremely tight-lipped about it.  Still are... haven\u0027t even heard any confirmation that it is still being worked on for a future update... only vague statements that don\u0027t exclude the possibility of it being worked on in the future.\n\nOn the note of updates and updating -- I will be jumping on the 1.2 pre-releases as soon as they become available for testing.  I fully expect SSTU to be massively broken by this update, both in raw code and in actual function of the code.  Likely will be a few weeks to get it working and compatible."}]}
