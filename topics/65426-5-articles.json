Not impossible if you\u0027re optimistic about plasma control technology development, but requires quite a few assumptions and probably about 100 or so years. Oh, and the payload? 30 tons. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E The dV of such a mission is about 1.5 \u003Cem\u003Emillion \u003C/em\u003Em/s.

Landable on both Earth and Mars, without a dedicated launchpad (though requiring an extra dual-purpose LOX/H2 tank and on-orbit refuelling). It was a military rapid response vessel, completely uneconomic (not that it had to be) and using cutting-edge technology. 2 weeks to Mars seems more plausible, but would still take either a fusion engine or a gas-core nuke. It\u0027d be a 0.1G brahistochrone, for about half a million m/s. Now, an \u0022impulse\u0022 (not a Hohmann, but it\u0027s a similar kind of transfer) trajectory with 2 months flight time? About 15 000m/s, and you would have fuel left over (I was using a table for a ascent\u002Btransfer\u002Blanding mission. I subtracted the ascent based on my RSS experience, but not the landing). So, unless you\u0027ve got a very good reason for such a fast travel, you\u0027re better off with a slow cruise.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecha Pants","CreatedById":58006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-20T00:12:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it hasn\u0027t been pointed out already, this could probably be done with 1960\u0027s era tech.
