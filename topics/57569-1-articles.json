I mean yes NASA is developing better technologies all the time, However I think KSP deserves Science that actually means something. Like a surface sample should be used to analyze the Mun not unlock a new rock ya know? It would just be cool to get a sense of \u0022Discovery\u0022 from the game. Agree or no?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...because NASA discovered the Space Shuttle on the moon?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResearch is in the end driven by funding.

The only issue is that it is not long enough and i have worked out i can complete the whole thing in 4-5 launches. I have completed the tech tree so many times that it no longer holds much sense of achievement. Now with the extra biome\u0027s at Minmus i dont even have to visit another planet to top the tree out, that to me is a failing of the science unlocking system. But it is not really tailored to people of my experience level, so i can understand why it is the way it is. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lack of ladders is not a problem in the earlier stages because unless you are leaving Kerbins SOI there is no moon you need to use them on, Jetpacks are enough for the Mun and Minmus. Only if you are leaving Kerbins SOI are they needed, and if you are at that stage so early on in the tech tree, it is an much needed added challenge. The lights being unlocked so late are the strangest thing that i dont understand.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
