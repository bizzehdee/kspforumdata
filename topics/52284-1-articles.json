Basically, I create all of my rovers in the SPH first and test them on the runway. Since I have a lot of parts attached to the rover body that I started the thing with, I can\u0027t detach the rest of it and save it as a subassembly. I also can\u0027t put the entire object into the subassemblies area because it\u0027s not an attachable part. I want to get the rover into the VAB so I can put it on a rocket and build a transfer vehicle for it. So what I did is, I copied the .craft file from the SPH folder and pasted it into the VAB folder. It put the craft in the VAB in the game and I could manipulate it and do everything I wanted to it, but when I launch it and revert back, it sends me to the SPH first, so any changes that I made that aren\u0027t saved yet aren\u0027t on the save for the VAB file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to transfer these craft easier?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to make the craft load and save only in the VAB when I move the file there?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso sometimes the symmetry thinks that it\u0027s in the SPH when it\u0027s in the VAB, any way to fix that too?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have workarounds for these issues?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-07T22:41:46Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2013 10:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by 700NitroXpress\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T22:20:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re missing one simple step, open the craft file and change type=SPH to type=VAB \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"700NitroXpress","CreatedById":90322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T22:24:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do I open a craft file?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T22:26:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just text, almost any text editor can do it fine, the only one I know will damage the file is wordpad, so don\u0027t use that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bandit6789","CreatedById":84174,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T22:27:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERight click on the file, then click open with Notepad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jananton","CreatedById":83920,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T22:28:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENotepad probably, it\u0027s just an ascii file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw, had the same problem too, but I assume this answer is it. ;-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreets,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJan\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"700NitroXpress","CreatedById":90322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T22:29:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I have Office Word 2003 and Notepad left then, either of those?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T22:30:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah either of those will be fine \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they save the file as whatever.craft.txt just change the name back to whatever.craft\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"700NitroXpress","CreatedById":90322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T22:41:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBingo, so word got angry with me because it doesn\u0027t recognize the format, but it said click \u0022No\u0022 to preserve formatting and that worked.
