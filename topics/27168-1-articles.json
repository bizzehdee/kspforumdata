My experience of my own challenge is that I have found that it has caused me to make different design choices in order to bend the limited parts list to my will, Having no mainsails to work with for example has forced me towards engine bundles using the radial attachment point to attach several engines to 2m tanks, The lack of the Mk 1-2 Command pod created a radical shift in how I make my escape towers and in my attempt to make my own heat-shield with the rockomax short adapter has altered my service module design and the reduction in crew has had an impact on mission planning as well \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the lack of ASAS it has actually made it such that there is a very important reason to have a Launch Escape System\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have also discovered a trick where you can use parts clipping in order to embed a stackable parachute in the top of a CM with a docking port, this has been the first time that I have used parts clipping to reduce part count \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T03:36:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny no ASAS?
