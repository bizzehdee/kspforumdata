When you\u0027re ready, you create proper rocket and launch it. Then you gain money to build it even bigger. Ends when you hit your first 10km altitude\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEra II - Similar to Era I, just with many more possible fuel ingredients (not only kno3 \u002B sugar). Later you can create simple staging. Ends when you hit 100km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEra III - You build small sounding rockets.

I guess I\u0027ll try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdea 1: Give us access to more fuel sources and rocket construction materials at the beginning. I would personally find the game more engaging if I have more choices to how to design the rockets. Maybe give a few options other than PVC pipe, and maybe allow gunpowder-based engines and pre-made model rocket engines. Also, if alternatives to sugar and KNO3 exist, add them in. Don\u0027t necessarily make them less expensive than other fuels, for a reason I\u0027ll state below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdea 2: More sources to purchase parts from. Add in a hobby shop and online shopping. Make online shopping take time to deliver the parts or resources (and make them more expensive). Also, give items limited stock in the stores (Not the online store though). This is why having alternatives to sugar and KNO3 would be a good idea, as it may get the player to improvise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdea 3: Contracts and competitions: Have the player get money through accepting contracts (like attaching a downwards facing camera to a rocket and shooting it past a certain altitude, then recovering it) and by participating in competitions (by winning prize money with following a set of regulations). I feel like this would be a better system than just getting awarded money for either every launch or for every record broken. It may also force the player to test out their rocket designs several times before actually trying to complete their mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdea 4: Give the player a job. Make the player gain money through a job they have as well, so there isn\u0027t really a way to lose the game. I would think this would also be realistic, and imply that the player is doing model rocketry as a hobby (Gives the player\u0027s character more character).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdea 5: Put time limits on contracts and specify dates for competitions. This should make the game have a bit of challenge to it; to put pressure on the player and make them likely not have the perfect rocket for the task. This could make the game quite interesting and maybe a bit challenging, especially when combined with the next idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdea 6: Make building rockets, launching rockets, and driving to and from stores take time. This should make the game feel more challenging and realistic, and hopefully immerse the player much more. Also, make sleeping and the job take up time from the day, though allow the player to skip or decrease the amount of time they spend on said activities, at a consequence. For example, skimping out on sleep will decrease your job performance and your rocket building performance for the next day. Skimping out on your job will decrease your pay and may get you fired. Being fired means you have to spend time looking for a new job while not getting a paycheck to spend on your rocket building activities. These ideas should make time a very precious resource to the player, which will hopefully make for more interesting and challenging gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdea 7: Rather than simply leveling up to unlock new stuff, make your player have to research how to use new, more advanced items. This should make progressing through the game a bit more fluid, and could put the computer in the game to good use. I was thinking the system could work where the player gains experience by launching (or attempting to launch) rockets, and the higher the player\u0027s experience is the faster he/she can perform research on his/her computer. This again makes time an important resource, but still forces the player to launch rockets to progress further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdea 8: Go with a different resource storage system. Rather than having a system where you have a limited amount of inventory slots for each item, maybe just allow yourself to pick up and place items anywhere around your garage (To balance this, make it so the player starts to feel overcrowded the more items he/she puts in the garage, with some negative effect in terms of rocket building (Likely making it take a little more time to build the rockets). Also make rockets stored this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdea 9: Custom PVC pipes have to be ordered from online (and thus take time to arrive), but you can by PVC pipes in standard sizes and lengths from one of the stores in the game. Should give the game a little more challenge and force the player to improvise more often.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdea 10: Cutting PVC pipes and cardboard: I assume this will likely be added to the game anyways. Just making sure you\u0027ll do this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now, that is really all I have (I swear I had a couple more ideas in this brain of mine). Yes, this would be a lot of coding, I\u0027m just suggesting this as a developmental path to take. Making time precious I feel would be a good aspect for a game like this, and force a bit more managing and compromising. Anyways, that is what I have for now. Good luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PatPL","CreatedById":115556,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T09:30:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou poined out most ideas i would use in Era II:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Online shopping\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- More casing materials: PVC, Cardboard tube, Copper pipe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- More fuel possibilities: Fuel better than KNO3 \u002B Sucrose with better Isp and thrust. For example fuel with KNO3 \u002B Glucose mix would have little smaller Isp, but better thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- About research: Test site will be used for it. It\u0027s most likely used for players, that never created real rockets to find out proper mix. Later, if you buy needed hardware you will gather informations like: Exhaust velocity, pressure inside rocket, thrust, Isp. There will be fuel tests with same pipe, and rocket tests with rocket motor and nozzle if you have one. All the garthered info about fuel will stay on corkboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In Era I and II player will have to go to some job to earn money, but in Era III and further he will gain money from launching rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Nice idea with competitions! I really liked that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Premade rocket engines - Not really what I want. I\u0027d want to have full control on motors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Cooking will be challenging - If you don\u0027t cook fuel enough, it won\u0027t mix properly, and will be unstable. It\u0027s internal pressure will vary very much, and may make rocket explode. Cook it too much and it will carbonize lowering thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In late Era II you will have possibility to build your own liquid fuel engines, and THIS will be the best thing about creating rockets. You will shape combustion chamber, set ratios of fuel and oxidiser, create nozzles. Hard to describe, but trust me, It\u0027s going to be awesome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now I created almost everything in Era I. What\u0027s left is cooking, assembly, testing and launch - the most important part of game, that\u0027s almost only coding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for support!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PatPL","CreatedById":115556,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T12:17:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECheck out this new video!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/nf7tnzxOis8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESneak peek - Cooking\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIf you have any ideas about any change i could make, tell me.
