In a time limited emergency, astronauts can abort home, otherwise we know the risks and they are acceptable until the next resupply mission. The same processes can be designed for Mars, with much greater redundancy (enabled by Starship\u0027s down mass capabilities). Mars colonists could abort home (early on), abort to another settlement, or sit tight for resupply.

It will get into every single joint in machinery, contaminate lubricants, and absolutely wreck any bearings. Not to mention power and cooling requirements.

An electric rotorcraft built for operations on Earth just needs some protective polymer coating in the motor coils and it can be used on Venus as is.

The moment they indicated they\u0027d be open to spending on Lunar mission, suddenly Starship is a perfect fit for that as well. But in reality, it\u0027s just a convenient reusable rocket. It works great with direct landing on Mars because there is an opportunity to refuel there. Well, in theory. Infrastructure for it is another matter, and money to donuts that idea will get shelved for a LONG while. But that\u0027s an aside. You simply wouldn\u0027t use Starship for trips to and from Venus atmosphere. You would use a modified Starship or something similar for trips to and from Venusian orbit. It\u0027s a perfect craft for doing round trips between orbit of Earth and orbits of Mars OR Venus, and that\u0027s by design. It\u0027s meant to be versatile.

A Falcon 9 delivered to Venus can easily lift half a dozen people out of that gravity well. But in the long term, I imagine we\u0027d switch to an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E plane of some kind. It would be parked in orbit where its cryogenic fuels won\u0027t cause problems until it is needed. At that point, it can dive into atmosphere, dock with the colony, pick up passengers, and take them to orbit where it would be refueled by one of Starships or w/e.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe turn-around can actually be more efficient than Earth-Mars missions and you wouldn\u0027t rely on refueling infrastructure in the short term.

Sure it is political flags and footprints nonsense, but national programs and SpaceX are devoting time and money to the problem. The same can not be said for Venus, despite its advantages, which makes Venus a less achievable destination near term.

If you want to propose an alternate architecture to go to, and come back from, Venus, well then I am all on board. Then we need to sell it to SpaceX or whoever else has billions of dollars\u00A0to spend turning metal into reality. But it seems very unlikely that we are\u00A0going to throw hundreds of Starships to the bottom of the Venusian gravity well with no way to get them and the people on board back out. Mars colonization is never going to be about the loony Mars to stay proposals. Some, maybe most, of the people who go to Mars (especially early on) are going to want to rotate onto\u00A0and off of Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCompetition between national programs,\u00A0NASA and CNSA, will be good for Mars colonization long term as they look to find the best solutions to the problems of living on Mars.

The infrastructure to support human atmosphere is straightforward, but the rest of the human built environment has to be shipped down there as well since there is no surface to build on and no solid materials to use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou seem fixated on the \u0022short miserable lives.\u0022 I think it is far too early to say with confidence that future Mars colonists will be miserable.

I would like to clarify the only reason I am \u0022against\u0022 (more like simply don\u0027t support) Mars colonization is because of the abundant problems there appear to be, in comparison with Venus that while it has its own issues, eliminates or alleviates many of the critical ones on Mars.

That\u0027s not to say 90% of Earth gravity might not cause its own problems, but if living in microgravity\u00A0is already known to cause issues, then\u00A0logically it could be theorized there will be some issue with 0.38g as well, so Venus\u0027 gravity might be the \u0022least worst\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224004102\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022203550\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221626195234\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204094\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022southernplain\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, southernplain said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI definitely understand the history behind why Mars has been targeted for colonization.

However, Venusian gravity isn\u0027t strictly Earthlike, it is about 10% less than Earth. Given that we don\u0027t have very much data at all about partial gravity environments it isn\u0027t fair to say that Venusian gravity is Earthlike\u00A0for humans. The answer is that we need more data on partial gravity enviroments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that a solid surface\u00A0is important insofar as we can land stuff there, use the surface as a staging point, and extract resources from the surface. Every single built environment on Venus needs to be shipped in except for the atmosphere and what we can extract from it. For example, we can mine water ice on Mars (using techniques we perfect at Shackleton crater on the Moon), and bury habitation modules in regolith.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. As far as I know, this isn\u0027t an insurmountable\u00A0problem. Mars isn\u0027t particularly seismically active. Marsquakes do happen, but from the evidence that we have they are mild compared to earthquakes. INSIGHT was barely able to detect the marsquake it observed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. It is not clear why colonies need to be widely separated on Mars, please explain. There is as much surface area on the surface of Mars as there is on all of the land on Earth, but we don\u0027t need to have widely separated colonies to start with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. This seems quite overstated. Astronauts on the ISS live in a decades old\u00A0artificial pressure vessel millimeters from literal vacuum and it doesn\u0027t seem to impose undue stress on them. Leaks on ISS are easily detected and quite slow, leaving lots of time to react and patch the hole. The same principle applies to Mars if we can suitably engineer the habitation modules.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. A reasonable point, but not a show stopper. A backup power source, nuclear energy seems quite good for Mars, is definitely needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis concern seems a bit exaggerated given that the only thing we can observe\u00A0from SpaceX is progress on the transportation infrastructure. Starship is a natural starting place because as it stands, no amount of money will let us put someone on the surface of Mars or floating on Venus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat isn\u0027t to say that there is no work being done behind closed doors or that SpaceX can\u0027t leverage NASA\u0027s expertise, on ECLSS, habitation, human biomedical needs, et. al, when (if?) Starship is fully operational. I doubt that SpaceX is going to throw some humans at Mars and hope to sustain them later. They can do that with hardware because the consequences are low, but I would guess that they will be quite cautious with humans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVenus *can* have an Earth-like day night cycle if the colony-platform-balloon\u00A0is built in the circumpolar regions.

That Martian surface is dusty and will cause problems for construction, whereas damage to construction equipment caused by the environment can be much more easily prevented on Venus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason I raise the problem of gravity is because we just don\u0027t know about what problems they might present at all. The question of the thread is \u0022what is SpaceX doing wrong\u0022. I am assuming they want to build *a* colony somewhere as fast as possible. If you don\u0027t want to spend 20-30 years studying the effects of Venusian or Martian gravity on humans and other animals before building your colony (which SpaceX seems to not want to do), then \u0022they\u0022 (the colonizers) would be better off choosing the lowest risk target, which would be Venus due to it being the most similar to Earth\u0027s gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, just looking at it from a logical stand point, if there are health problems in microgravity, it should be expected there will be some in 0.38g. Likewise there may indeed be\u00A0some with only 90% of Earth\u0027s gravity, but there should be fewer and fewer the closer you get to Earth\u0027s gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVenus does indeed lack resources in the atmosphere but for the \u0022first colony\u0022 the habitation module-platform-balloon\u0027s will be manufactured on Earth anyways, just as it would be for habitation modules for the first Mars colony. Venus *could* have resources not from Venus itself, but by redirecting asteroids to Venusian orbit, mining them there, and then transporting the materials down to the colony-platform-balloon. Heck, even if Martian colonization proves impossible for other\u00A0reasons, mining facilities could still be constructed on Mars, and then although Mars\u0027 environment prevents ultra-long-term habitation, the resources could be put to good use on (above) Venus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow if the goal is a self-sustaining colony that idea doesn\u0027t work. But a Mars colony will have a number of problems becoming self-sustaining too, so instead of aiming for a \u0022bunker-like\u0022 colony that is completely self contained, I think it would make more sense to expand not just living space/habitation but the whole of human society into space- including mining, space travel itself (Starship factory on Mars, just to list a random idea), etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we can renegotiate the Outer Space Treaty and establish something like \u0022Kasei Prefecture, Japan\u0022, \u0022Mars Oblast, Russia\u0022, \u0022Ares State, USA\u0022, etc. in space, I think that would give humanity a much better chance of *surviving another* extinction level event than just building what is somewhat of a nuclear bunker on Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. The only reason the Marsquake detected was so small was because it was likely on the other side of the planet. Just as earthquakes are detectable across the Earth- the USGS reports on the earthquakes caused by North Korean nuclear tests, not the South Korean counterpart to USGS- Marsquakes may be very strong where the hypocenter actually is. This is quite problematic- it is not safe to say \u0022they might be weak\u0022 and then design a colony assuming zero seismic activity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. I only mention this because I assumed an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E on Mars would be needed for P2P between Mars colonies.

The thing with the ISS is that those people want to be there and go through much training, and are psychologically prepared to die (they write \u0022in case I die\u0022 letters apparently). Not only will the first generation colonists possibly consist of average people, but you have to deal with the next generation born at the colony (assuming pregnancy and child development can actually go forth in 0.38g). Can a 14 year old second generation colonist, already going through the complexities of modern human adolescence (which will likely be brought along to the colony) be able to handle knowing that just an undetectable defect in the hab module might kill him/her?

No nitrogen, no phosphorous, sodium, chlorine; all stuff you\u0027d need to grow plants. No iron, silicon, or anything else you can use to make buildings. Those things don\u0027t float in the air, so you need to go down on the ground to get them.

But until we have that, Venus is not feasible. Even when we will have that kind of technology, the amount of material we\u0027d need to send to venus to sustain a colony that could extract resources on its own is staggering.

I would argue that carbohydrates are actually easier to get in moderate quantities on Venus. On Mars, you might be able to get large quantities of ice, but that would require a fairly polar region to have it in good quantities, which is an inconvenience, and it\u0027s all going to be dirty ice, so it\u0027s still a process. While CO2 extraction is going to be a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Epain\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0at these pressures. On Venus, water for food and plastics required for upkeep is reasonably easy to extract from the clouds, while CO2 is available in spades. If you want to get enough water to make fuel, you\u0027ll need\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elarge\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0collectors. So that\u0027s definitely not an option early on. But on the net, it still seems easier to get early fabrication going on Venus. And for colony sustainability, having easy, reliable way to fabricate materials for repairs ranks way higher for me than ability to build new structures from scratch and to refuel rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, yeah, Mars beats Venus in variety of what\u0027s easily available. Again, Martian dirt is going to be\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eeverywhere\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0meaning that even if your minerals are\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eright there\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0it\u0027s actually going to be work, but not as much work as on Venus. Eventually, I suspect a Venusian colony will start dropping drone scoops that will bring up dirt and minerals every time the colony passes overhead, but this is maintenance and maybe slow growth kind of quantities.
