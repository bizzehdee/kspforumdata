The player chooses which sections to take images and scans of and must plan ahead if they want to scan a whole planet in detail.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPerhaps there is a place for signal delay in this game, where the player records a sequence of commands to be sent to a probe instead of controlling it in real-time. If you haven\u0027t mapped the terrain of a planet, your probe will need to be able to measure its own height above the ground or be able to reach landing speed miles above the ground to ensure a good chance of a safe landing. Of course, things like terrain maps of planets at various levels of detail could be unlocked for easier difficulty modes or returning players already familiar with the planets who just want to fly around.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMagnetometers orbiting bodies can map magnetic fields, and a network of solar observation satellites would be the only way to detect incoming solar storms ahead of arrival. Perhaps the \u0022monuments\u0022 would appear as anomalies in maps generated by surveys. They should NOT appear as a mission or text box appearing out of nowhere telling you to go visit them.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe relationship between the tech tree and the collection of science would be expanded beyond the simple currency system. The direction the player chooses to go in on the tech tree would be related to the missions they choose to perform, where they would create some sort of \u0022directive\u0022 for the space program. The science they collect would influence the directive of the space program, for instance discovering a water resource on Duna could provide incentive to increase development of resource extraction and long-term crewed mission technologies, or discovering an exoplanet could incentivize development of larger space telescopes and instruments that can characterize planetary atmospheres.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, I want science in KSP2 to function as sensors that gather data about the environment, not as currency dispensers that unlock new parts as a reward for traveling someplace new with limited technology. I think the place for \u0022tech tree\u0022-like progression lies more in the missions and the player\u0027s own directive to perform increasingly complex missions around the destinations of their choice, with science acting as an influencing force on those directives and mission goals but not directly acting as the sole source of the currency for unlocking parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay so I haven\u0027t read this WHOLE thread so apologies if I\u0027m just re-stating what someone else said...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI couldn\u0027t agree more with this. I\u0027m new to the game since the Science release just before Christmas, and as much as I\u0027m enjoying the challenge of building rockets to get me to certain places, the whole mission/science element isn\u0027t really working for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree with others that I don\u0027t just want everything handed to me in sandbox fashion though either. I like the challenge of being limited in some way to what I can build and rather than building a super do-all system that gets to most planets from the word go, I have to build within the confines of the technology available to me. I do also think this is why the financial system of the previous game would of been nice to see at least as an option in this one as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as how to tie in science, like Cubinator said, it should be related to the missions you\u0027ve been given/chosen. Made up fantasy alien race of Kerbals or not, it should mimic real life. You are offered a set of missions to choose from and a financial budget to go with it. So for example, land a Kerbal on the blue planet X - $10million budget. You accept the mission and get a nice healthy $10million budget to go along with whatever money you\u0027ve also made from other missions or contracts. You can then unlock certain parts using said budget, but only if you also have the science to back up the invention/design of these new parts. For example, I spend part of the budget to design and launch a rocket to send a probe into orbit around the blue planet-X to map the terrain. The probe maps the terrain and finds that the now named planet Aqua is blue because it is actually completely 100% water with no land. That then triggers the ability for me to now unlock a new flotation device designed for landing a heavy lander on water. I don\u0027t HAVE to unlock it, I can choose to attempt the mission without it, but the data is clear, I will need it, and therefore I spend part of the budget to have that part invented/designed or whatever you want to call it. Sometimes you will always need said part, other times not but it would definitely make it easier. That parts existence (unlock) is then tied to the fact that it was NEEDED and therefore someone had to invent/design it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere would obviously be multiple examples of this for each part and sometimes you will find out the hard way (god bless Jeremiah who drowned on planet Aqua because we just went straight there and didn\u0027t realise it was all water), but at least there will then be a point to the science. At the moment, the way I find out planet Aqua is all water is by either A, landing there and going \u0022o excrements\u0022, or by doing what I do for all other planets in KSP2, google them and find out. Want the know the lowest safe orbiting altitude of Duna? Google. Want to know the phase angle for an Eeloo intercept? Google. Unless I\u0027m missing something, these should all be things the game is teaching you through the missions. And rather than have me land at a specific point on Duna because there is a special alien monument there that we somehow just KNOW about, why not have me find it through Terrain mapping, or how about I do terrain mapping and see there is only one viable landing spot on the planet and then I stumble across it naturally.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also wouldn\u0027t want the horror of failed rocket design and the learning by failing experience to bankrupt the agency and cause anyone to rage quit the game forever, so when you revert you get your money back, if you so choose. That then gives people the option of playing how they like. You can go all out hardcore and every failure costs you dearly, or you can revert and chalk it up to it being a GAME and the experience of learning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, that\u0027s just my random two cents.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ahres","CreatedById":180308,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-09T23:46:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224357328\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022222109\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221704762892\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022184845\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MechBFP\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 hours ago, MechBFP said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe line between QoL and a gameplay feature is actually quite simple.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnswer the following question:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes the feature add new game play elements, or does it just improve existing ones?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m happy to have my mind changed, Mech, so don\u0027t read this like I\u0027m trying to disagree with you.
