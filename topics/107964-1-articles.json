I went from LKO to Duna Prograde orbit(I\u0027ll explain later) on two tanks of jet fuel, although I took 6 with me. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E The one thing I messed up was coming in on the wrong side of Duna and doing a clockwise orbit, so I burned prograde and used a gravity assist with Ike to get a high elliptical orbit, and at my Apoapsis, reversed my orbit, and I still haven\u0027t had to jettison my first two drop tanks! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Here\u0027s the Imgur album, I find that linking it is more clean and organized to look at than the way embedding is now.

The step from popping out to the Mun and Minmus all the way to interplanetary travel is less a \u0027step\u0027 and more a \u0027flinging yourself off a massive precipice while strapped to a cheap kite\u0027 sort of experience. That first ejection burn is a trip. The first real view of another world. I still remember repeatedly re-working my deceleration burn and approach for aerobreak to Duna. Was SO uncertain. I nearly flung myself face first into Ike on the approach too. Snuggling into a celestial body at just shy of mach 9, while awesome in concept, is a poor choice for serious exploration. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour first landing on Eve, your first visit to Jool and your first visit to Eeloo are all pretty incredible. Moho is its own sort of fun challenge and every facet of KSP has a particular flavor of cool but your first Duna visit and that short list, those are the ones that at least for me really defined what makes KSP so incredible to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat first step really is the hardest.
