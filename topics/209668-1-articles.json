Yes, I mentioned the Star-48v instead of another star-48 variant for a reason. It has a nozzle that is capable of thrust vectoring.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAdditionally, perhaps some specific special variants of larger vacuum-rated SRBs could be complex enough to incorporate blow-out panels intended to be used as a thrust termination system? You still can\u0027t stop the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E from firing, but you can stop it from providing meaningful thrust by opening the other end of the tube! Maybe also adjustable multi-pulse SRBs, for similar requirements where you want to precalculate where the burns start and end, but also useful for times where you don\u0027t want to use 2 or more SRBs with part loads of fuel in each one when you could save weight by using one larger \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E and dividing up the fuel by putting one or more high temperature burst disc(s) and additional ignition system(s) in the middle of it to split it into multiple smaller \u0022segments\u0022 of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E thrust.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBoth of those things exist IRL, tho in general they\u0027re only used on ICBMs. Plenty of places where you could use them in a space exploration mission tho. You could use a thrust termination capable \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E to get a moderately precise transfer burn done to encounter the Mun, and then a multi-segment \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E to do the Mun capture burn as well as the de-orbit burn and braking burn, with liquid fuel only taking over on final descent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe shouldn\u0027t be forcing players to learn that they need to spin-stabilize their small solid rocket motor stages or provide additional systems in the form of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E for them, that seems like something that just adds more parts and reduces fun even tho it\u0027s realistic, and who\u0027s going to code in a \u0022yo-weight de-spin system\u0022 into Kerbal when that\u0027s a thing that\u0027s hardly ever going to be used outside of some extremely specific situations anyways, realistic or not?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-09-22T17:16:18Z\u0022 title=\u002209/22/2022 05:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 22, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by SciMan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TLTay","CreatedById":184633,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-22T17:27:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApparently they\u0027re only planning about 600 parts (no word on if this is at launch, or over planned DLC as well), which is only about twice the KSP1 part count.
