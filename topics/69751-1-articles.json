In simple terms they flex out when you are on the ground causing the aircraft to pull one direction or the other. This is caused by the fact they are under the wings, and the wings are not structurally strong enough to handle the load of the craft, thus they flex upwards as the aircraft attempts to pull up. Which pushes down on the landing gear. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other issue is your landing gear are to far back from the CoM of the aircraft, this is crazy considering how short this airframe of this craft is. But it is true, your rotate point is almost in line with your CoL, which is a fair bit behind your CoM. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are several options to fix this problem. You can add struts to the wings which will make them more ridged and fix the flex issue making the aircraft a lot more stable. And you can move the landing gear on the wings foward just a bit to get them closer to your CoM. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA couple of other minor fixes I would do for stability sake. I would remove those massive control surfaces and that tail, and go with smaller control surfaces so I can set roll and pitch on different ones so you dont have aileron-elevators, which will cause stability issues while flying. I would also ditch the leading edge control surfaces, there is a reason why you dont see many aircraft out there with leading edge control surfaces. Sure you see planes with slats, leading edge flaps but not control surfaces. As for the tail there is a winglet/canard part that has a built in control surface and doesnt move the whole part. This is perfect for a tail for an aircraft this small as it would reduce your loss of stability on sharp yaw meneuvers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck, and dont worry I have lots of experience with FAR\u002BDRE, just look at my sig, that is ALL of the mods I run.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
