Scooping ice into an open cargo bay by flying through Saturn\u0027s rings. Use cargo bay bots to haul the ice into a processor which melts it and separates water from minerals. The minerals you can chuck back into space unless you want them. This is fairly easy... but the distance is the only real challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Have refuel depots on worlds or moons with abundant ice. Torchship water tanks would \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E to orbit and dock and refuel an orbiting torchship. Then another Torchship tank would be sent to grab the near empty one to bring it back to the depot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Try and find a comet or icy asteroid. Processing it will be harder due to all the rubble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInterestingly... places with little or no water would have a much smaller if any manned presence at all. Unless a fleet of water tank torchships are sent ahead in advance to orbit them for spacehips to dock with later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I guess I learned something new. You other boldly go into the unknown looking for Saturn-like rings for any easy refuel, or you sent an entire fleet of water tank torchships to a place with no water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second option is far more expensive since you may not recover the water tank torchships, and even if you did it would be a long and expensive process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in conclusion if you have torchships... refuel depots and Saturn\u0027s rings are the easiest ways to refuel.... but Saturn is so far away. Asteroids and comets may be closer but are harder to process the water due to all the rubble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo while we poop waste, a torchship finished processing water from a comet or asteroid is going to be \u0027pooping\u0027 minerals and rock debris that it does not need or want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-26T05:40:09Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2023 05:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
