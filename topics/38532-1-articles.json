Firstly, the claim that it allows you to adjust one axis while keeping the other 2 stable seems to be false. I\u0027m getting phantom rolls when I yaw and pitch, phantom pitches when I do the other two, and so-on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, the \u0022lock to heading\u0022 functionality is completely gone. The thing will drift, regardless. The old ASAS could be used to pick an angle of attack and hold it, so you could build up speed while in straight and level flight, just below your flameout altitude. That ability is gone now. They drift up and down, wandering about by themselves, so while trying to pick up speed I\u0027m getting random flameouts which I could avoid before. I\u0027d say this is taking 100-200 m/s off my top speed on jets, which when you\u0027re trying to save rocket fuel is a *lot*.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThirdly, even in space it seems it will only hold a heading if your plane is perfectly balanced. It turns out mine has a very slight off centre thrust on its rockets. The old ASAS simply used the pod torque and gimbals to counter this. The new SAS doesn\u0027t hold a heading, so the moment I throttle up the direction starts to change and I have to make constant manual corrections. Burning for a manoeuvre node seems to be more or less impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do appreciate the removal of the random oscillations, but \u003Cstrong\u003Eplease\u003C/strong\u003E can we have some sort of heading lock functionality back?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETA: Some more flying in space. I\u0027m getting phantom \u003Cstrong\u003Erolls\u003C/strong\u003E. I can understand a slight unbalance causing phantom pitch, but the only thing that\u0027s possibly off centre in the roll axis is the fact that I have a ladder on one side. As far as I can tell, SAS is making no effort to counter this at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-24T19:33:08Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2013 07:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ComradeGoat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cesarcurado","CreatedById":60073,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T19:41:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you might have activated trimming accidentally...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPress alt \u002B x and see if it works now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ComradeGoat","CreatedById":59041,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T19:43:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo difference.
