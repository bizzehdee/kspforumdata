With save files not compatible through to 0.17, I\u0027ll be opening a new thread with revised rules later tonight for 0.17.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic rule changes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- there will be a separate sign-up list for each planet \u002B its moons. My goal is to have a single save file for everything, but if that becomes a problem I\u0027ll split the saves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- to be placed on a sign-up list for a planet, you\u0027ll need to post a screenshot of a successful flight to the SoI of your chosen planet. Kerbin/Mun/Minmus is the exception.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- initially, one base per landable body; once at least three craft are landed at every existing base, you can open a new one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- space stations are still allowed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- all turns are 48 hours, so that I can start and end all of them for the different saves at the same time. We\u0027ll have multiple people fly their turns at the same time, and then afterwards I\u0027ll merge each person\u0027s new craft into the main save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- if you\u0027re signed up for multiple lists and your turn comes up on more than one at the same time, you\u0027ll get bumped down one spot on any of them that have someone else signed up after you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll have some basic mods - Carts, MechJeb, Crewtank - added from the very beginning. If there\u0027s others that should be in the beginning list, let me know here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese chagnes should let people get turns in more often and get a lot more flights completed too. For now, I\u0027m sure everyone is having enough fun with non-community flights, and you\u0027ll need to complete some anyway to sign up for the new per-planet lists!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-21T14:15:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESign me up!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Saphira","CreatedById":33161,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-21T16:25:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esign me up also \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
