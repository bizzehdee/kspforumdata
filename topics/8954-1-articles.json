Since the physics have to be calculated from the scene origin, and distant vessels are very far from the scene origin, you hit huge inaccuracies due to poor floating-point math. This would be a problem even without timewarp if we\\\u0027re talking an N-body solution, because the patched conics approximation skirts physics completely. If you include timewarping though, the inaccuracies become absolutely ridiculous, leaving vessels (or worse yet, parts of vessels) dozens of kilometers away from where they should be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if a way around the Must-Be-Near-Scene-Origin problem can be found, it will be extremely computationally complex for any world with more than a few vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022socket7\u0022 data-cite=\u0022socket7\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can accurately solve the N-Body problem for over 2 bodies you\\\u0027d win yourself a Nobel prize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe aren\\\u0027t talking about a solution, we\\\u0027re talking about an approximation, which isn\\\u0027t all that hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Harv can actually solve it though, he totally should. 8)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"giucam","CreatedById":21099,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-01T21:12:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@RC1062\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually the engine internally is 3D, i just live on the z=0 plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@millitron\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t know really well how the engine i\\\u0027m using works internally, but afaik it handles big distances pretty well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve being simulated the Earth with the Moon around the Sun in a 1:1 scale and warping up to 20x and an year keeps taking 365 days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: i forgot, 1 sec is 1 day in my simulation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"socket7","CreatedById":3956,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-01T21:12:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Millitron\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Millitron\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe aren\\\u0027t talking about a solution, we\\\u0027re talking about an approximation, which isn\\\u0027t all that hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027d argue that patched conics ARE an approximation. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind we don\\\u0027t eve have patched conics yet. we just have conics, which is why orbits look so screwy when changing SOI.
