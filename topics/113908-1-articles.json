To get the blue lines (which opens up lots more info display and enables things like maneuver nodes), you need to upgrade the Tracking Station, which costs a few hundred thousand funds and therefore will need to wait until later in your career.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now, without that added info, here\u0027s how you get to orbit the low-tech way:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Build a ship that has enough dV to get to orbit. This is not too hard, as long as you\u0027ve unlocked decouplers and some liquid-fueled engines. 3 stages should do it. SRB on the bottom, liquid-fuel engine with fuel tank(s) in the middle, liquid-fuel engine with small fuel tank (and command pod) on top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Launch straight up\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. After hitting 100 m/s or so, gradually start tipping over towards the east. Ideally, you want to be tipped over at around 45 degrees by the time you get to about 10-12 km of altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Floor it and accelerate as hard as possible until you get your apoapsis up to, say, 80-90 km or so. Then turn off your engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. When you get up near your apoapsis, point your rocket horizontally (i.e. level with the horizon on the navball) and accelerate as hard as you can until your orbit turns into a circle and your periapsis is raised above atmosphere (i.e. above 70 km, on Kerbin).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPresto, you\u0027re in orbit. When you\u0027re ready to come home, point your rocket retrograde and do a small burn to lower your periapsis into the atmosphere (say, to an altitude of 30 km or so), then keep your rocket pointed retrograde all the way down. You\u0027ll speed up a little first, as you fall, but then start slowing down as you get into the thicker part of the atmosphere. Wait until your speed drops below 250 m/s or so, then pop your parachute and drift to ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T21:18:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, basically what everyone has said above.

When to perform an orbital insertion is dependent on your Thrust-to-Weight ratio. Instead of burning at Apopasis, burn a little before. If you want to get really specific, you can do a bit of math to find out the best possible time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E TWR of 1 = 9.81 m/s^2. Take your own TWR, and multiply it by 9.81 to get your current acceleration. Take the average orbital velocity of Kerbin, and subtract your own velocity to figure out how much Delta-V you need. Take that number and divide it by your acceleration to get your burn time in seconds, divide it by 2, and you have your answer. Burn X seconds before reaching Apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T22:53:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E4.5km/sec is from .90.
