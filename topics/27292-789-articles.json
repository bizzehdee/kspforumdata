(destroyermen series FTW!) Anyway, I added working extra power generators to my landship that run on only liquid fuel, and also added radiators and tested its max speed: 13.1 m/s. way faster acceleration than any of my other landships, which need a jet engine just to move, even with tracks and wheels. my fast, huge one turns like a brick though. probably because of how far apart the two pairs of tracks are. Imma have to see how effective it is in AA. the two goal keepers to a side should definitely help it out more if the other aa guns don\u0027t work. I also redid my sub-orbital tourist rocket. It can\u0027t hold ten tourists anymore, but it can hold four, and that\u0027s more than my other model that works. Imma have to add seperatrons to the launch stage though to push it away, and rcs to it since the reaction wheels don\u0027t like working. it can re-enter fine, and the three HugeS Behemoth Aerospace Engineering small parachutes bring it down to about 2.2 m/s, so I don\u0027t really need the large parachute on the top. Gonna have to use it some to get the tourist moneyz so I can get back to over 2M funds so I don\u0027t worry about stuff. As soon as possible imma have to try and get nuclear engines to use the nuclear reactor engine from the mk2 expansion mod so I can see if I might be able to get sub-orbital with that. Not a huge amount of thrust, the wheesely might actually have more than it, but it doesn\u0027t need atmosphere stuff to work and it uses enriched uranium stored in it meaning it has basically infinite fuel, so I could probably just have a cockpit, several passenger compartments, the engine, some wings, some parachutes, and landing gear and it hopefully can get to space. it might take forever or take a few tiny rocket engines near space to help it get there but it should do good. plus I can get tons of tourists to space.
