I tried some of the stock ones and attempts to use ascent guidance had them flipping up sideways and doing a 90 degree right turn. Managed to slam straight into the VAB once. Also can\u0027t land for crap on the island runway, never lines up on it, just crashes into the island from random angles. Once I got it onto the right path but it came in too low and crashed like it was flown by those Asiana pilots. I didn\u0027t try going out a long ways then circling around to give it half a chance at attempting a KSC runway landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAircraft control is a completely different ball of yarn from rocket control. So is rover control.
