Yes, it is an intended feature/design choice.\u00A0 I did not design those models originally, and they were not modeled or rigged in a fashion that would allow for steering of the wheel while the strut was angled.\u00A0 As such, anytime the strut is angled I explicitly disable steering for those parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly I\u0027m not aware of a workaround currently.\u00A0 The function is hard-coded without any config-based option to disable it, and even if it could be enabled, I could not guarantee that the steering would actually function as desired.\u00A0 However if you would like to open an issue/feedback ticket regarding the problem (either on the KerbalFoundries or KSPWheel repositories), I will see what I can do about it next time I\u0027m working on wheel
