It would travel on a suborbital trajectory, and after reaching the target biome, release the scientific payload (a materials bay, mystery goo, thermometer), and land, to be recovered for science.

The Reliant is a very good choice of engine for them. They can also be easier to fly \u0022right\u0022 than rockets -- basically, point them at the sky at about 45 degrees, then follow prograde once you hit 10 km or 500 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was the good news.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bad news is that they\u0027re not more efficient than rockets. You win a little by getting away with a lower thrust to weight ratio (i.e., you can pack more fuel), but you lose a little by having to pack wings, landing gear,\u00A0and aerodynamic surfaces, and (usually) staying in the atmosphere longer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other words, I don\u0027t think you\u0027d find it any easier to get where you want to go with a rocket plane than a plain rocket (if you pardon the pun).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, in addition with what the others said -- refine your gravity turn -- you need to do what everybody needs to do: find a way to pack more delta-V on your craft. That means either (1) make the payload smaller, (2) use a more efficient engine, or (3) make it bigger. Since this is mostly an atmospheric craft, you should also see if you can make it more slippery (better aerodynamics).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
