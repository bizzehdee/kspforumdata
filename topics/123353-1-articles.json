There are getting just big enough not to work on a CD. 4GB USB sticks seem to be at the bottom of the range these days. But they aren\u0027t made for the large numbers of writes that are needed to substitute for a purpose-made SSD or an HDD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, an external USB drive, using USB 3.0 and a 1TB HDD, seems to be the current standard, and the price isn\u0027t that much more than a similar-size internal drive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, step one: download your Linux distro of choice, get the 64-bit form, and transfer to a USB-stick. Get your system booting. I was using Linux Mint and I was pleasantly surprised that I could read and write to all my Windows drives, and to my NAS drive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can find tutorials and walk-throughs for all this, how to install Linux from the USB-stick to an external drive. It\u0027s not that long a process. Then shutdown Linux, switch off, remove the USB-stick, and reboot with the external drive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings get long and tedious here, getting various programs and installing them, and getting at things such as browser bookmarks. It\u0027s not so different from the hassles of switching from 32-bit to 64-bit Windows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for the observation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis particular system I am using isn\u0027t something I plan to use long-term. It\u0027s OK with 64-bit Windows and the Windows version of KSP 1.0.4, but with only 4GB of RAM it\u0027s a bit tight for space. Nevertheless, the page swapping it does for virtual memory is tolerable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo to Linux, and mostly I can\u0027t see any significant difference. Even USB 2.0 seems adequately fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut my experience strongly suggests that a shortage of RAM will hit very hard under Linux. Base install, no problem. Add a few mods, and things can trip up, ending with nothing loaded. I ot warning messages about Kerbin-crossing asteroids not being loaded because a file wasn\u0027t found. No components were visible to pick from in the VAB or SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe shall see what happens when I boot with the new motherboard/RAM combo. It may be I can tweak some details. I did get some mods loaded and working, and watching the program load with an eagle eye, it does look like a RAM shortage, something that might produce an outright crash with Windows. That loading bar doesn\u0027t reach the end of its travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESummary: Linux is different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I ran a few flights with no problems, once I cut back on the Mods installed. Linux, generally, is giving me what I want, and knowing I can boot linux from an external drive. and still access the Windows drives, it quite reassuring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Linux package called Wine lets you run the Windows programs you might still need. Should I believe the stories about what Microsoft is doing to \u0022trick\u0022 you into a Windows 10 upgrade? It does feel a little like a common pattern of abusive, \u0022It\u0027s for your own good\u0022, behaviour, and now I am fairly confident I can walk away from the whole Windows business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorst case, you end up with a 1TB external drive that you can re-format and use to back-up your data.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-19T07:59:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for this post, I too recently found a seed planted in the back of my mind for permanently ditching Apple/Microsoft.
