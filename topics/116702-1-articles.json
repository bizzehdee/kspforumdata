It\u0027s just like soccer, which was coined by the British as some sort of slang for asSOCiation football, and that word landed in North America, and we stuck with it, even though it got changed on the continent, and we (US/Canada) never got the memo until it was too late."},{"CreatedByName":"uglyduckling81","CreatedById":129740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T04:25:34Z","Content":"I can copy paste too.\n\nHowever, the name \u0027aluminium\u0027 was adopted to conform with the -ium names of most other elements.
