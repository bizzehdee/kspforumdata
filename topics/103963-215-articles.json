I am but one person, with kids and a real job. I make mistakes and I do this for free. The reason I overlooked it is because I test the mod the way it is intended to be played.

I am thoroughly in appreciation and admiration towards you and your work, god knows, my gratitude is sincere. The frustration comes from literally spending hours to fix this and blatantly blaming the scatterer itself rather than the modified config file. I wholeheartedly apologize for the word \u0022huge\u0022. Imagine that after searching for the TV remote for a long time and blaming your wife for having put it in an irrelevant place, you realize it was in your hand all along!.. The hand being the modified config file of the SVE for the scatterer in this case of course... Still, I do have to admit that I was slightly demotivated to see it took 11 days for an updated version to come out. \u0022Marjorim!\u0022 posted the very same issue on November 3rd, also believed it was an error on the scatterer\u0027s part, so I read the topic over and over and over again to see if there was an answer on it... There wasn\u0027t... I searched even more, found another post on July 5 (Yes... July, can you believe it?) regarding the exact same problem, and again, believing it was because of the scatterer itself. Naturally, at that point I had little doubt it was the scatterer causing all this problem. Hours passed and I found out that it was actually SVE config file.. So I went \u0022FFFFFUUUUUUUU\u0022. Hence the word \u0022huge\u0022 was ushered. On a final note, I wish I could download your newest configuration for SVE, but I already edited some stuff to my personal liking and now I am a bit too lazy to go over those again. I will read your changelog later to decide whether I can bother all the edits and whatnot.\n\nPlease, do keep up the good work!
