Maybe few ingame days that went since quicksaving should display a warning message when you try to quickload? Like 3? or 5?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-23T17:12:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes. If your quicksave is older than your last autosave, the game should prompt you to choose which one to load. If your quicksave was created in an earlier play session, the game should warn you before loading it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
