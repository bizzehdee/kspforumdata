Though I have not yet myself built anything that has \u0022exploded\u0022 due to heat build-up, I read in the forums that it can happen with frequency, necessitating the use of radiators to dispense with waste heat. I have also read that some space-probes are designed IRL in such a way as to facilitate the radiation of waste heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy very novice question is; space is \u003Cstrong\u003Ecold\u003C/strong\u003E- why is \u0022waste heat\u0022 an issue at all? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-18T18:08:50Z\u0022 title=\u002209/18/2015 06:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GarrisonChisholm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whizzkid","CreatedById":126892,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T17:32:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a feeling that it is because space is a vacuum, therefore heat is more difficult to get rid of as conduction and convection do not work in a vacuum.
