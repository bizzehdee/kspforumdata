Thank you. It doesn\u0027t sound like much, but being able to just scroll down to the bottom and hit a single button makes a big difference when rapidly iterating through different tank/fuselage configurations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHrm... there\u0027s also the issue of SABER/RAPIER engines where I\u0027d want the tank to auto-configure with LF/LOX and not just read the intake-air/LF combination. Something to think about for future iterations!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Velorium117","CreatedById":73648,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T22:38:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI seem to be having an issue getting this mod to work, and I\u0027m assuming I\u0027m doing something wrong so let me lay it all out.

Now, i read the ReadMe for this mod and I\u0027ve done everything I could see to do. It mentions being able to edit the contents of tanks through the action group menu but for the life of me I can\u0027t see where to do this. I went to action groups, clicked on a tank and there\u0027s no options available to me (I also tried clicking on an engine). So because I can\u0027t edit the contents, none of my engines fire because they all say \u0022Liquid Oxygen Deprived\u0022 and I can\u0027t edit the contents of the tank to have said liquid oxygen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be greatly appreciated.
