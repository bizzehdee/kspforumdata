Spent some time trying to figure out how to install making history. Finally got it to where it showed the install successful in the command prompt. But now when I launch KSP it just sits on a black screen. I can see the KSP cursor, it goes green when I click, almost as if the game is running I just can\u0027t see anything, and when I click x it asks me if I really want to quit in the normal ksp prompt window inside the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
