I will activate the sequence now.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly, bright floating orbs appeared over the rectangular blocks of Vallhenge. The orbs shot out beams of light that met just above the largest pyramid spike of Vallhenge, creating an enormous orb on top of it. Then, orbs formed over the other pyramids. The orb on the smallest pyramid shot out a beam of light that passed through the other pyramidal orbs, joining the largest orb, which shot out another beam of light which flew to the monolith that Jeb was next to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- Back at the Monolith --\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe monolith shone like a star now and sucked Jeb into it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA strange light show greeted Jeb, who was rather confused by all this, but smiling as usual. Sights and sounds flashed by his spacesuit visor. Then, music started playing, and a rocket flew past. Jeb saw a spaceship that he recognized, with a few of his comrades in it. Then, he heard a voice, \u0022Hullo, it\u0027s Scott Manley here...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe strange vision vanished as soon as it had come, and other sounds came and went, such as \u0022Hello, and I am the Beardy Penguin, and...\u0022. Every sound was accompanied by a video, although not all videos had talking, just music. Finally, black words appeared on the blank white background: Arriving at Mexico City, Mexico, KSP developer\u0027s conference table.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb shot out of a computer next to the conference table, where the KSP developers were discussing bugs to be fixed for 1.1. Jeb said a cross between \u0022Whee!\u0022 and \u0022What the !@#$?!\u0022 The developers just stared as he bounced of the table and into another computer, where he faceplanted into the soil next to the KSC. Bill and Bob found him, and they worked out what all this craziness meant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe End\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-31T15:49:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat?
