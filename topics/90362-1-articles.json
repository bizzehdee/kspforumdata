The trouble is that the Andromeda Ascendant was a pretty large warship. We\u0027re talking about a huge crew capacity, the capability to take on some of the meanest bullies in several galaxies of space, retractable defense systems, and a state of the art AI capable of commanding the vessel competently in the case of overwhelming crew loss. In KSP sizes, this thing would still easily dwarf the entire region that the KSP is built in. These things were never \u0022launched\u0022 in the traditional means, but rather \u0022built\u0022 in orbit (of the local star, not some unworthy planet) and navigated in the scale of star-clusters instead of how we navigate KSP, which uses planetary bodies as locational markers.
