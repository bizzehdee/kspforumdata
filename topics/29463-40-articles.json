But my Minmus Base 1 just failed today, completly. I had designed a base that has Docking Port Srs on its perifial. I had made a ship to slowly lower the different moduals onto the docking ports, so that they all could be connected and shared ect. Well, I was lowering onto the Power supply modual, that had LOTS of batteries, Solar Panels and a coupleof those generators. As soon as the docking stations connected after about 10 seconds of just sitting on the \u0022landing pad\u0022 docking port, the game glitched, and the entire base went under ground about 2 meters. This caused massive distruction. Peices went flying everywhere. The drop ship managed to escape, however when I switched back to the remains of the base to see if I could save the Kerban in it still (Bob Kerman) the dropship despawned. We\u0027ll just say it made a stealth return to Kerban. But Bob survied the explosion, and then went into the capsul on the base. The life support modual was compelty destroyed, so all he had was the life support from that lander can pod. (Tac Life Support) So I IMMEDANTLY mounted a rescue op. Just as I was enterting Minmus\u0027 sphere of influence, I got the messagethat Bob was running low on Oxygen, Food, and Water.
