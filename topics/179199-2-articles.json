Google was almost useless. \u0022KSP\u0022 didn\u0027t return anything about the game and I\u0027d forgotten the word \u0022Kerbal\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually I think it was something like \u0027k \u0022space program\u0022\u0027 that got me there on the second or third page.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll physics concepts of space (beyond equal and opposite reaction, and go fast sideways,) were completely alien to me. Gravity turn? Never heard of it. Apoapsis/Periapsis? Never heard of it. Rocket Equation? Never heard of it. Delta-V? Never heard of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack then parts were very VERY limited, orbit wasn\u0027t easy even if you knew what you were doing. (I didn\u0027t.) Landing on the wrong side of the planet was actually impossible due to the way the physics was handled at the time. Map View didn\u0027t exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a few hours I built monstrosities that could barely lift themselves off the pad and then tore themselves apart. Eventually I managed to get one that went straight up, and kept going. And going. And going.\u00A0I think I reached escape velocity, in that gravity was reducing faster than I was slowing down due to gravity. It was my first success. The fact that after watching every attempt fail, this one had actually stayed in the sky, was awesome to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that I took this monstrosity, and of course made it bigger. I wanted to orbit the planet. I failed again and again as I didn\u0027t know how to build (or fly!) a rocket. Eventually, I got one up into space, and did a ninety degree turn there, and went for it. Horribly inefficient, but for me the fact I\u0027d done it at all was unbelievable to me. I sat there for a long time, watching in real time to see if this thing would stay in the sky. After that I spent the rest of the fuel trying to circularise the orbit, but in a horrible, horrible way. (Altitude going down, boost up, altitude going up, boost towards the planet.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith nothing else I could do, and not wanting to lose this success, I must have sat there for about an hour, entranced by the view of this thing in orbit that I\u0027d put there, knowing it\u0027d just keep going.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI left the game running there for hours while I did other stuff, just to see if it\u0027d stay up there, which of course it did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d already had an interest in space before. Star Trek TNG had been one of my favourite shows. I\u0027d be glued to the TV when there was news about Hubble,\u00A0Spirit and Opportunity invoked a sense of wonder, especially as Opportunity had already gone on for far longer than it was\u00A0meant to,\u00A0and the Space Station being completed at the time was awesome to me. But that time there, watching this thing in orbit that I\u0027d put there... that still stands out in my memory as the exact moment I got the bug for HOW stuff in space worked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve learned far more about space missions because of KSP than I ever would have without it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbinchaser","CreatedById":160817,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-06T17:46:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.0.4 My first few hours were spent learning controls and flying rockets.
