I just did something that I\u0027m very proud of and I thought I would share it here. I landed a probe on The Moon in Realism Overhaul with a probe of my own design riding on a rocket of my own design. There are tons of mods involved, so I won\u0027t be posting the craft files (unless you REALLY want them.)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ESo lets begin with the probe design. I has 4 generic pressure-fed engines that provide 1kN each. Its 2 solar panels provide power for the reaction wheel, a long range dish, and 2 omnidirectional antennae. The probe on its own has 3,879 m/s of delta-v that takes 10 minutes and 58 seconds to burn.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022zjHTnqLl.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zjHTnqLl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EThe probe has an attached service module that provides power for final orbital insertion and the Lunar transfer orbit. The lower tank contains about 100 liters of hydrazine for its RCS, along with the normal fuel for its engine. The engine is a pressure-fed EADS Astrium Aestus II. This stage provides 4,161 m/s of delta-v and burns for 13 minutes and 38 seconds.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022v4CIhlIl.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/v4CIhlIl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EThe upper stage of the rocket I have titled \u0022Medium Lifter\u0022 is powered by a Rocketdyne J-2 engine and provides 4,592 m/s of delta-v that burns over a duration of 4 minutes and 23 seconds. Inside the interstage fairing, there are 2 solid rocket motors for ullage (settling the fuel at the bottom of the tank.) These motors burn first, and then the J-2 main engine ignites.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022FR8oP04l.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FR8oP04l.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EThe lower stage of this rocket is powered by an NPO Energomash RD-180 engine. This stage provides 3,637 m/s of delta-v and burns for 2 minutes and 42 seconds. This stage has fins for atmospheric stability. The fins are not necessary for roll control, since the engine has 2 nozzles and can simple gimbal them in opposite directions to roll. The fins just help with the gravity turn not happening too fast. On the very bottom, 4 separation motors can be seen that quickly and cleanly separate the lower stage from the upper stage, preventing the J-2 engine from colliding with the interstage shroud.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022PBLO42Dl.png?1\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PBLO42Dl.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EThis rocket as a whole contains 16,275 m/s of delta-v.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022BHjdeZKl.png?1\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BHjdeZKl.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EI went on a strange path that I\u0027m not so sure is normal to do when setting up a Lunar transfer in real life. What I did is burn prograde at the ascending node\u00A0until the apogee was a little higher than the Moon\u0027s altitude. This is the point where the service module detaches and the lander\u0027s engines start being utilized. I coasted to apogee and matched my inclination relative to the Moon. Then I burned about 200 m/s prograde. It didn\u0027t circularize my orbit, but it was helpful for getting a Lunar encounter.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022H5uAcTtl.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/H5uAcTtl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EI ended up landing in the Sea of Crises, with only about 200 m/s of delta-v left to spare.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022mvNFDPNl.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mvNFDPNl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ELooking back on that, it would appear I subconsciously named it \u0022Mun Probe\u0022 instead of \u0022Moon Probe\u0022 \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EHere is the Imgur album for the whole mission:\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/bubfh\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
