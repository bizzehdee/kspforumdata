I used fuel I have brought along with aero braking to get the asteroid into orbit of Kerbin, so most of the original asteroids ore is still available. That being said I only made 60 tons of fuel on this venture. What kind of pay pack can a truly efficient class E asteroid bring and is it worth the time?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Axelord FTW","CreatedById":1896,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T05:50:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor most E asteroids, it\u0027s simply not worth the effort. The kerbin SOI encounters can be any which way and it\u0027s just better to wait for one that will naturally dip into the atmo. The rdv-capture ship would only be used for minor adjustments and for the final raising of the PE out of the atmo once it is captured.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can still be a good monetary venture in other ways if you do not consider what else you could be doing with your time to get some more dosh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I have a thing for getting a LOT of A and B class asteroids circularized at KSO instead of trudging for getting the bigger pain in the ass rocks where I could want them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
