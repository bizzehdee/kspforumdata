About the rope rig, it wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t a joint driven rig after all, and no dynamics, since we don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have the power to do those calculations.

He\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be delivering some epic gameplay trailers and working with our animators. We are also in the process of rolling out an affiliate program for our video partners on YouTube and Twitch.TV.

One thing I am excited to share is that Nassault, one of the best \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;KSP\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; videographers has joined the team on an intern basis. He\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be delivering some epic gameplay trailers and working with our animators. We are also in the process of rolling out an affiliate program for our video partners on YouTube and Twitch.TV. We think this will be an exciting way to support those creating content on KSP and help us introduce new players to the game. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be sending out more information about this as we get everything lined up very soon.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t been paying attention here, so if there\u0027s some clarification somewhere...?
