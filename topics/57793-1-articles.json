He stated that the burns for transfer orbits were more efficient when starting from a low initial orbit. Is this correct, because it doesn\u0027t make sense to me? Any type of transfer orbit requires increasing your orbital velocity to a point where it escapes. The transfer part comes from timing that escape, correct? To go from a small orbit to a large orbit you need to increase your orbital velocity as well, and if you are making a symmetric orbit (2 burns) timing isn\u0027t a factor because you can still do your escape burn at any time on that new orbit. In other words your velocity increase to get a bigger orbit is put towards your escape burn and not wasted. The reason I am wondering is because when using nuclear motors, trying to escape from a low orbit and firing before the node to balance your burn you actually need to burn in towards the planet, which when it has an atmosphere can prevent an escape at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I missing something?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-29T00:37:18Z\u0022 title=\u002212/29/2013 12:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by 2-Zons\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redjoker","CreatedById":68444,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T17:37:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s called the Oberth Efffect, I can\u0027t really explain it but \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the burning towards the planet is because your burn time is so long.

It really saves a whopping amount of fuel. It\u0027s also important to realize that the developers did not need to add in anything extra into the game to make the oberth effect work, beyond the basic physics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe that\u0027s what makes it hard for people, including myself at some point, to wrap their head around it. The oberth effect works because of physics, and, unlike what the name might imply there isn\u0027t some spooky \u0027effect\u0027 going on at all which you can or should try to understand separately. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopes this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"2-Zons","CreatedById":94850,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-29T00:36:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the responses from everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few replies resonated and I think I understand. When you fire pro-grade to increase your orbit you are actually pushing your orbit on the opposite side away from the planet. Another way of thinking about it is if you are at your periapsis (as was said above) you are at the bottom of falling towards the planet and are moving away from it due to your speed. When you fire pro grade you are increasing that speed on your ascent so you will get to a higher apoapsis. This combined with the fact that velocity increases as you get closer to the planet, for the same reason that an object on a string being spun around will increase in velocity as the string gets shorter wrapping around the object. I think I finally have wrapped my head around it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this brings up a new question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you are re entering an orbit from escape velocity. Is it more efficient to aim for a higher orbit and and retro. Actually as I type this I think I can answer, tell me if I\u0027m correct. If you aim for a low orbit (high velocity) you have less velocity to lose. If you try and capture from a high altitude the orbit velocity is very low and you will have much more velocity to lose. So you should aim for a low orbit to get captured.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Roastduck","CreatedById":98490,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-29T01:09:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be more efficient to aim for a higher orbit, yes. But in my experience, it has been more important that I do my retro burn as early as possible once I enter the new gravity well. Once you shift into the new gravity well, you begin falling towards the new \u0022down\u0022 and begin gaining velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
