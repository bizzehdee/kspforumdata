It has a capacity of just 6 Kerbals (2 pilots and 4 passengers). I have managed it into a 100km x 100km orbit with a small amount of fuel left in the main tanks. The main craft has only a small amount of mono-propellent in it for orbital manoeuvring as well as docking so don\u0027t forget to fill it up if you dock at a station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen descending you need to keep a high AOA in order to bleed off as much speed as you can in the upper atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust like the STS the SRBs have parachutes for recovery (my flight profile lands them straight on the runway) and I have plans to attach docking ports to the liquid boosters so that I can reuse them in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m generally happy with its performance however any hints WRT to the aesthetics are welcomed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/v6klhev0r4ftbtk/Cipler.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere is a download\u003C/a\u003E if anyone wants to fly it for themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E9JOfF\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u0026gt;Javascript is disabled.

Just a question have you tried to change the thrust limiter on the skipper halfway through the flight to help out with the thrust balancing?

(The most simplest of things that engineers can forget to do) *Oh it doesn\u0027t fly straight, add counter thrust!!!! When all you really need to do is thrust limit.

Ok I see what you mean by cargo, it\u0027s quite funny actually, I was so close to this being a SSTO, the amount of fuel in the tanks is just enough to get it to orbit, I\u0027m wondering if I just added a bit more fuel to it if I would be able to get rid of the SRBs\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWRT the returning stages I absolutely love the extended physics range, it is so satisfying to see them land. In the second version I have made the entire craft \u0022reusable\u0022, I put that in quotation marks because I have changed all of the decouplers out on the boosters to docking ports. So now I can dock the tanks to an orbiting propellent depot and de-orbit the engines to be \u0022reused\u0022 (sandbox mode).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
