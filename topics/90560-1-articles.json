Kudos on the last release, by the way. I\u0027ve started a Hard Career mode game, and having coordinated an Aggressive Negotiating Strategy with Gus Kerman in the administration building, I am now enjoying an 8.5% discount on my launch costs. I was recently test firing and recovering a prototype interstellar transfer craft, making some tweaks, and I noticed that I\u0027d gained a little cash from all this experimentation. It seems when recovering the parts from the launch pad, I am receiving the original value of the parts, instead of the discounted launch value. Seems like a win/win for my accounting department, but I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll want to address this in a future update. I\u0027d guess Rockomax will go out of business if they keep giving me more money for parts than I paid for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sealed:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice work.

I am also playing on hard career mode and thoroughly enjoying myself but this little oversight on my part suddenly left me scratching my head as to why I was suddenly gaining a lot more funds. On hard career mode you tend to focus a lot more on your funds so I\u0027m sure it wouldn\u0027t bother players on say easy difficulty for example. But alas i eventually got a bit frustrated at all these \u0022no free launches\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I can suggest to fix this and still keep your aggressive campaigns intact is to download the \u0022Mission Controller Extender 2\u0022 mod, What it has is a little red button you can push after a failed or in this case test launch, where it then charges you 1000 funds to revert to the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t need to use all the extra contracts if you don\u0027t want to, you can disable them in the GUI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I use it with all my on launchpad tests just to try and balance the relationship between the OP of the admin building. Its not a huge difference but might help from feeling cheaty if you commit 100% for example to the negotiations giving you plus minus half your ship value added to your total funds. The red button takes you directly to the VAB thus skipping the recovered parts section, but you are still able to complete contracts after you have used it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E//oh I realized this is in the unmodded installs section sorry, not sure if you are open to mods, but all you will really be using is the red button, as I said you can disable all the other facets of mission controller and just use it for the \u0022pay to revert\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-17T19:56:42Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2014 07:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by velve\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"born2fly145","CreatedById":118293,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T23:46:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Velve, that\u0027s good to to know.
