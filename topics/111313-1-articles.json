The first flights will use surplus RS-25Ds (AKA SSMEs), and later flights a cheaper, simplified version called RS-25E.

The first stage (core, excluding boosters) will have 7,440 kN of sea-level thrust (4x RS-25), and a gross mass of 979 tonnes, for a TWR of about 0.78.

The reason is the core is taller than the ext tank and stack will accelerate at a max of 3.3 g vs the shuttle\u0027s 3 g. This results in a LOX head pressure of ~1.8 MPa vs the shuttle\u0027s typical 1.2 MPa.
