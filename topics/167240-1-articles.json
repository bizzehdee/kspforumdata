relays.\u00A0 Then the distant ship links to a relay on the back side of Kerbin, which links to 1 or more other relays in the ring, until one of these can link to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space

geostationary orbit, or any other finely synchronized orbit at another altitude.\u00A0 And even if you use a mod that gives you that data, the orbit won\u0027t stay where you want it due to floating point errors and a general lack of fine control over maneuvering.\u00A0 So over time, your satellites will drift until eventually your neat formation of relays gets out of whack and you get gaps in

So the faster one will overtake the slower one, even if it takes a million years. The key is to... well,\u00A0 make it so as it _does_ take a million years. The higher the orbit,\u00A0 the slower is the orbital speed. So I always put my relay constellation as high as I can - certainly higher then Minmus. It minimizes the effects of speed differences between two different satellites,\u00A0 because not only they will be much,\u00A0 much slower,\u00A0 but also the distance between them is much greater. So whatever differences in their respective orbits,\u00A0 it may take decades or hundreds of game years for them to start disaligning in a relevant way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second thing is,\u00A0 of course,\u00A0 to try to have their orbits be as similar as possiblr. Fine tuning is the thing here. First you need some mods. Kerbal Engineer,\u00A0 Basic Orbit.... mods that help you visualize orbit data more precisely.

By doing that you can make cirurgicly precise inputs in your orbit,\u00A0 making the different satellites fall into a much more similar pattern (albeit,\u00A0 I agree,\u00A0 \u0022identical\u0022 seems to be impossible).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy \u0022finely-tuned, higher-than-minmus\u0022 relay constellations always last a long time in an usefull patern.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-24T16:48:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe answer to this problem is the same as every problem in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMOAR!\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore satellites to be specific.
