I think KSP has made shows like this far more enjoyable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was too young when it premiered (and lacked HBO) so it\u0027s awesome that I found it online. Enjoy it while it is still up and streaming!!

I absolutely loved Apollo 13 and I had no idea there was a whole series built right afterward by the same crew. Sort of like Band of Brothers to Saving Private Ryan (which I also adore). The Pacific wasn\u0027t so good, however, at least to me.. it just came too late and didn\u0027t develop the characters as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut From the Earth to the Moon has kindled a new love for the astronauts that I never had before (I always loved the hardware, didn\u0027t care much about the people or the stories). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I find myself devouring articles about manned spaceflight, following every nose pick on the ISS, and reading up on every weird proposal NASA has made lately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds like a good tradition, however, watching it on the anniversary.
