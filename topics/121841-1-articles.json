Yes, I realize there\u0027s a myriad of different situations and parts that affect how something is attached, and half of them are problematic for me, but let\u0027s go with a specific example. This has had to have come up over and over, though I\u0027m not quite finding what I need in searches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the VAB or SPH, I want to build a craft where docking ports are attached as docked, not directly attached via nodes. Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn\u0027t, usually doesn\u0027t. A bit of reading suggests having angle snap on - doesn\u0027t seem to help. Holding the Super key, apparently turns on node-only attachment (no surface) but this is the opposite of what I want. I want surface only. Tried changing view angles, most of what I could find through searching. Soooo....is there any sure-fire way to get docking ports attached as docked?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the problem I\u0027m trying to solve. I\u0027ve got some wheeled cargo that I put in the hold of a cargo plane. I want to detach these and roll/drive them out the back. What\u0027s the best way to get them in and out of the plane? How do I attach them for the flight then release them when I land? Is there some way other than building them into the craft with docking ports (or decouplers, though this has many of the same problems) in order to transport them?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-BS\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-29T06:39:03Z\u0022 title=\u002209/29/2015 06:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by barfing_skull\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TronX33","CreatedById":109784,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-27T21:29:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, there is no way to attack docking ports as docked. However, it fll function the way you want, if you attach the two docking ports with the nodes, in flight, right click one of them, and click Decouple Node.

It\u0027s a way of getting the moving bases into the plane - since bringing them in when the plane is parked on the runway has its own set of problems.
