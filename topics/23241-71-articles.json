It\u0027s pretty hard to waste all the fuel on it and just get into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlying it is very simple, just climb fast to 10-15km then level out, kill most of your vertical speed and gain velocity as high as possible. Climb slowly from 15k, preferrably within 10 degrees over the horizon, so that you can push the plane to the fastest possible speed without losing air. As you go faster, you get more air intake, allowing yourself to climb even higher without flameouts, allowing yourself to speed up more due to lesser drag. When air intake gets into 15-10% area, cut the throttle of the engine to 75% and continue to climb, that will cut air intake requirements significantly and will delay the flameout further. Cut the throttle further just before the switch if you can sustain the vertical speed with it. Also, don\u0027t forget to watch your prograde vector on the navball and pitch upwards: at high altitudes, nothing ever flies horizontally oriented as there is too little air to hold you. If you want to fly horizontally, find an angle of attack that will keep you there, which will be noticeably higher than horizon. When I\u0027m saying \u0022climb within 10 degrees\u0022 , that\u0027s your prograde marker, not your spaceplane orientation, which could be 30 degrees up even.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally you should be going no slower than 1200-1500m/s and no lower than 25km at the point of switching to oxidizer. Return to full throttle upon switching to it, keep going almost horizontally while stabilizing yourself with RCS. It\u0027s best not to burn upwards, keep burning almost horizontally, maybe 20 degrees upwards if you insist on reducing little drag that is left at this point even faster. Getting extremely long trajectory to AP is better than getting up there with a steep trajectory as it will be a lot easier to circularize when you already have most of the orbital velocity needed. Ideally, you will only need a quite short push at AP to raise your PE over the surface and into low orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seem to have similar issues. I\u0027m using mechjeb2 to get every last bit out of it. I climb to 27km at a speed of 1650 m/s that seems to be the maximum I can get out of it using the air breathing mode. Then I set the pitch to 10 degrees and switch to rocket mode. Mechjeb shows that I have enough oxidizer for 1564 dV in Vacuum. I burn at full throttle until I reach an ap of 100km. At that point I have 767 dV left. Unfortunately the drag is still strong enough to rapidly decrease my speed so I have to burn continuously to keep my ap. I settled with an ap of 85km which left me with about 300 dV which was enough to circularize and a burn that brings me back in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had better results with a pitch of 45 degrees when I switch to rocket. That left me with about 350 dV after the circularize @90km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat am I doing wrong?
