Preferably with proof.\n\nNope, you are completely correct in the case of a 2D planet. You won\u0027t have polar coverage though. Best way to fix that is to add another 3 satellites in a polar orbit.\n\nThis is a well known relation for equilateral triangles. The distance from the center to one of the corners is twice the radius of an inscribed circle."},{"CreatedByName":"Invader Myk","CreatedById":137014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T20:04:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E While there\u0027s a couple other errors I see, the main one is that you assume full coverage of a planet is possible with three satellites.
