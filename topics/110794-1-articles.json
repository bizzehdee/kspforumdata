I had that issue before i switched to photoshop)\n\nTo make a \u0022hollow\u0022 collider in unity you must first understand that a collider in unity has to be convex (ie it cannot have holes through it) but there is a workaround. Use several box primitive colliders arranged so they approximate the shape of the model. This works well and there are no problems if the boxes intersect. try however to keep the collider count at a minimum for performance reasons. I used unity primitives but i guess you can use several mesh colliders too. But probably at a performance hit. i havent tried that tho."},{"CreatedByName":"mariohm1311","CreatedById":114131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T18:19:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E To make a \u0022hollow\u0022 collider in unity you must first understand that a collider in unity has to be convex (ie it cannot have holes through it) but there is a workaround.
