That is a very good question. My best attempt at an answer (studied this stuff way back at university, it really is weird):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the outside observer of a hypothetical stationary black hole, there is no mass that causes the gravity of the black hole itself. Spacetime around the black hole, if you exclude the event horizon and an arbitrarily small bit of its neighborhood, just looks exactly like it would look as if there was a suitably formed mass in the area you excluded, but outside the horizon. In a way, it is like your mirror image: when you look at it, it just seems like there is another person in there behind the glass, but really, it\u0027s just photons reflected back forming that image. The black hole is just gravity that looks like there is mass there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, of course, if you would smash the mirror or move away from it, the image would go away, so why does the black hole stay there with all its gravity even if the mass that caused it is gone?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMathematically, it simply is so that the curved space outside the event horizon that you can observe is a stable solution, just like flat space is. It can simply exist on its own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps easier to understand: Nothing escapes from the event horizon. Not even information. Not even the information that the whole mass that formed the black hole is gone. You are in the \u0022FSM removed the sun\u0022 scenario, only that it removed the collapsing star (bit by bit) as it passed the event horizon. But we outside the black hole will never know, it takes infinite time for that information to get out to us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same goes for the rotation. A rotating black hole is just spacetime curved in the way the rotating collapsing mass was last shaping it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, you can calculate what happens inside the event horizon up to the final singularity. That does not help much here: whatever happens inside does not have any influence on the outside. If you are also interested in what happens when you fall into the black hole and why you still are spaghettified even though the mass is gone, replace \u0022event horizon\u0022 with \u0022singularity\u0022 in the above.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-13T10:12:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_gravity\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_gravity\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELots of discourse on the subject on this wiki article.

So the field on the event horizon itself is essentially frozen in time for the rest of the universe. It just hasn\u0027t had the time yet to dissipate since the star collapsed.

Just like electromagnetic equations, Einstein Field Equations are local. Mass only affects space-time where it is located, and gravity propagates further via interaction of space-time with itself. So any perturbation propagates at the speed of light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022peadar1987\u0022 data-cite=\u0022peadar1987\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDoes that mean that the earth is actually orbiting the point where the sun was 8 minutes or so ago?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, no. I have no idea how to derive this result in proper GR, but at least for the case of interaction between planets and stars, using gravitoelectromagnetism is good enough. And just like in normal electromagnetism, there is a very cool effect. All of the fields are oriented in such a way that you feel attraction towards the point where the object actually is, rather than where it was with appropriate time-delay, \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eso long as source travels at uniform speed\u003C/span\u003E. This is a very important result in electromagnetism and it carries over to gravity. If this wasn\u0027t the case, planetary systems would outright collapse, because the gravity fields would all come in at an angle, causing systems to use energy as if through a very strong tidal interaction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaturally, if the source suddenly accelerates, that\u0027s something you cannot possibly predict until fields propagate, so that\u0027s something that\u0027s going to have an effect on how things move. But constant velocity allows things to keep working as if all fields propagated instantly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-13T16:06:45Z\u0022 title=\u002201/13/2014 04:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by K^2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
