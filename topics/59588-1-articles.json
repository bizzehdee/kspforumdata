Generally anything with over 500 parts will lag the game; this can be severe if you are trying to dock 2 ships with a lot of parts.

KSP is a great game, but when you can play the game on the highest settings and have excellent frame rate (usually over 100 fps), it becomes an awesome game. It is much more enjoyable if you can play it without any limitations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, if you really like KSP and are devoted (obsessed) to (with) it, then a rig built for it is way worth the investment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EV See my specs below V Remember, KSP is CPU intensive, so dump your money in a processor, not a graphics card or RAM.
