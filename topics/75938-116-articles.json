Would save a hell of a lot of duplicate code! There\u0027s about a ton of stuff that can be stripped out too. It might even be worth stripping down the DustFX stuff to some static methods that get fired by collider collision info being handled by KFModuleWheel and KFRepulsor, which both hold lists of wheel colliders themselves and grab hit info anyway (or should in the case of KFRepulsor). Another thought I had for effects on the tracks is use the list of colliders to set limits for random number generation and have a wheel collider in multi-collider parts (tracks, repulsors etc) get randomly selected to spawn the particles from its collision location. That way it certainly won\u0027t overload and would give a nicely spread effect.

I began, about 6 months ago, attempting to adapt the dust portion of that mod for use as an effect which would simulate the dust that gets thrown up, especially by either fast-moving or very large wheels over surfaces that are not completely stable. That part was a complete success, but I decided that I would merge it with the work I was doing on KF in order to make sue of some special features that are unique to kF wheel modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a good example of what it \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E look like, simply watch a video that features a large truck moving at high speed over an unpaved surface. You\u0027ll get the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELo-fi... There is really no chance of us committing at the same time because, you see, I do not have permission to commit to the KF_plugin github. Anyway, the separate modules were really only a temporary thing that I intended to re-merge at a later date. The issue I still have that keeps me from merging them is that I need to know if we\u0027re dealing with a repulsor or not so that I can force the dust to be thrown up at a much lower scrape speed than with the other parts. A repulsor field would not only push the repulsor part upwards, but also exert some forces on the surfaces in which the field is reacting. This would, in theory, throw up a small amount of dust even when the craft is stationary. I added the appliedRideHeight to the equations and lowered the default value of the field-variable which controls the minimum magnitude in which to call the scape method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, I\u0027m perfectly happy deferring to your work on the Dust.
