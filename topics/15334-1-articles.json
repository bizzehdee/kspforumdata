I did a simple config edit of the parts, similar to the original unmanned crew pod mod, to create empty versions of all of the stock crew pods. While it is simple enough to do this editing on your own, I figure this makes sharing of .craft files easier. I make no guarantees about functionality or lack of bugs. In my own testing they seem to work fine, but cause Kerbals to appear very white. Seems to be simply a visual issue. May include a screenshot or two later if necessary, but they are simply stock edits, so I don\\\u0027t really think its required. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Split into two parts due to upload limit, attached at bottom of this and next post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUPDATE:\u003C/strong\u003E Noticed like 15 minutes after posting this that someone else already did it. Would take this topics down if I could figure out how, but whatever. An empty pod is an empty pod, no matter who did it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUPDATE 2:\u003C/strong\u003ESince I\\\u0027m continuing to use these myself, I figured I\\\u0027d keep them updated in case I uploaded any .craft files that used them. Changed part type to SASModule to restore the pod\\\u0027s torque value and made them radially attachable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SquirrelMachine","CreatedById":28033,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-26T20:17:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd here are the cockpits.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-26T20:52:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found an ugly glitch with these.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI detached one of these from a separate craft, when the mother craft crashed shorty afterward, and I hit ], I had to cycle through all the debris to get to the detached part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SquirrelMachine","CreatedById":28033,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-26T21:03:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomeone else made similar empty pods here:\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=16824.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=16824.0\u003C/a\u003E.
