However, this works only about one time in maybe a dozen or 15 attempts. Usually, pressing the spacebar has no effect, although it usually works the first time I use it on a given EVA. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout this control, you have to do some weird estimate of transformed coordinates to translate the Kerbal\u0027s left-right-forward-back reference to your line of sight to the capsule.
