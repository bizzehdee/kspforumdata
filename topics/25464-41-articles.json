So, first item for today is to take care of getting some refurbishment and replacement comsat equipment headed off to Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe comsats in Laythe orbit have docking ports, so they can be refurbished by adding on a reaction wheel part -- but all the other comsats lack docking ports, so they will eventually need to be replaced. There were only a couple months before the next Kerbin-to-Jool transfer window, so I rolled four d4 to see how many comsats the KSC crew could have ready, and got 9.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow we see the launch of the comsat payload. Because this payload has roughly half the mass of the typical payloads I send out to Jool, it only required a two-booster version of the Reusable Rocket to get to orbit (despite also carrying a Rockomax X200-32 Fuel Tank that will provide fuel for the trip). You can imagine along with me, the fairing enclosing the payload prior to the nose cone being jettisoned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XIZipqb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XIZipqb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe get a closer look at the payload in the next picture as it continues on to orbit. There is a carrier bus (which is also equipped as a comsat) with eight comsats attaced around it. The central spine of the bus ends in a stack of reaction wheels with docking ports which will be used to refurbish the Laythe comsats. Note: The action group that separated the nose cone and fired its sepratrons also deactivated the torque of those reaction wheels...because otherwise the stack waggled around in a rather obscene manner during maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zZvQfSu.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zZvQfSu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter depositing the payload into a roughly 100 km orbit, the Reusable Rocket sustainer separated and returned to KSC for re-use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/v4D1poD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022v4D1poD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/z3JH66E.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022z3JH66E.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo push the payload to Jool, a Tug that had previously been to Jool and back (at least once) was chosen. This Tug was residing in Kerbin orbit attached to the Big Gas Tank, and it was about four-fifths full of fuel that had been taken from the Big Gas Tank and from other ships that had docked there to offload excess fuel. In fact, it had MORE fuel than would be needed, so some was put back into the Big Gas Tank (leaving the Tug\u0027s central tank mostly empty) before the Tug was undocked and headed off to rendezvous with the comsat payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Jghk8rx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Jghk8rx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the Nuclear Tug rendezvoused with the comsat payload, it first docked its rear end to the comsat payload. Then the Tug separated the X200-32 Fuel Tank from the payload, moved off a little way, flipped 180 degrees, and then re-docked to the comsats using its front docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3uzM881.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223uzM881.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel from the X200-32 Tank was transferred to the Tug\u0027s main tank (leaving the X200-32 almost empty). Then the ship was pointed prograde, and an action group was activated that undocked the X200-32 Tank and fired four canted sepratrons mounted on the tank. The sepratrons gave the X200-32 Tank a big enough kick to deorbit it, in accordance with my No Littering policy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QhdbFem.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QhdbFem.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of the low mass of the comsat payload (11.6 tons), the Nuclear Tug would have plenty of fuel to push the payload to Jool even without an additional rear tank attached. The trajectory plotted for Jool transfer is shown below. Jool will be near its node with Kerbin\u0027s orbital plane when the ship arrives, so an encounter is showing up even before any plane change maneuver is figured in. (We don\u0027t see the trajectory of the returning Grey Havens Express in this plot because that\u0027s being handled in a separate copy of the save file.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/o6bBfxw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022o6bBfxw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 1,952 m/s burn would take only 12 minutes (as opposed to the nearly 20-minute burn I typically deal with when sending heavier payloads to Jool), so this burn was performed in one step (instead of my usual two). This resulted in the periapsis dropping down below 85 km during the burn, but that was no problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5bNkHyM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225bNkHyM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Tug was still firing when the ship passed out of Kerbin\u0027s shadow for the back-lit picture below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/e1gHRBZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022e1gHRBZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Tug used about 66% of the fuel in its main tank for the Jool transfer burn. The side tanks on the nuclear nacelles were still full, as was the X200-8 Fuel Tank at the base of the payload (the fuel flow through the docking ports had been disabled during the burn).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9BMr1c1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229BMr1c1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhenever I get a transfer trajectory that leads to an encounter (as happened here because Jool was going to be near the node), I always seem to waste lots of time messing with that maneuver, trying to get an acceptable final equatorial orbit...and I\u0027m never happy with the result. It\u0027s so much easier to just do the separate plane shift maneuver. Below, we see the plane shift maneuver that I set up (after the ship left Kerbin\u0027s SOI) for when the ship approaches Jool -- the node was located just three days before encountering Jool\u0027s SOI. Because the plane shift takes place far from Kerbol, it will only require 58.6 m/s of delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eRSBRmW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eRSBRmW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat plane-shift maneuver node also includes the fine-targeting for the Laythe encounter. Below we see the maneuver results, focused on Laythe, coming in for a nearly perfectly tangential encounter. This is important for minimizing the velocity of the encounter and minimizing the heating during aerocapture (which might be an issue by the time this payload reaches Laythe, depending on when KSP 1.0 is released). This targeting is done using Precise Node to tweak the radial and prograde components of the burn to get the desired tangential encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2xxAC2y.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222xxAC2y.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat plane-shift burn, of course, is not going to happen for another 295 days, but the maneuver node is stored with the ship so it will be ready when the time comes (and I set an alarm in Kerbal Alarm Clock to remind me). Did I ever mention how happy I was when Squad made the change that allowed future maneuver nodes to be stored with the ship? Because it\u0027s very handy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EHeroic Homecoming\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to skip ahead here and take care of the Old Crew\u0027s return to Kerbin. There are a couple other Kerbin-to-Jool transfer windows that will occur during this phase, and I\u0027ll go back to them as needed in my timey-whimey ways if I decide there is anything else I want to send out to the New Crew on Laythe during that time (but they already have most everything I could think of to send them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen we left our Old Crew, heading home in the Grey Havens Express, the plane-shift maneuver prior to Kerbin encounter (which will happen very close to Kerbin), was already set up and stored (see the plot below). Because it happens way down near Kerbin, the plane shift will require over 500 m/s of delta-V...but the Old Crew was sent home with plenty of extra fuel, just in case, so this won\u0027t be a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9U7hCP9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229U7hCP9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Whoa, Dude!
