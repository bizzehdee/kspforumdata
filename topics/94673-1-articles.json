You are trying to meet up with a target that is not necessarily on the same plane as you, or in the same position as you, and the maneuver node aspects work in a similar way. It\u0027s good because it teaches the following skills:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The maneuver node system. The maneuver nodes tell you how close your orbit will take you to whatever you are trying to meet up with. It costs no fuel to play with maneuver nodes, and they give you the level of accuracy that winds up being vital for travel to anywhere other than the Mun or Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Plane changes. Most planets are on a slightly inclined plane (compare the Mun to Minmus) and so require you to know how to bend your orbit to account for these changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Patience. Sometimes, a few minutes of waiting during time warp for a better orbit can do more for you than a million units of fuel. Inpterplanetary travel means that you will have to wait for things to line up, and then even longer for the ship to get where you need it to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany of these skills are introduced by KSP\u0027s tutorial missions, but practice makes perfect. The more you practice docking, the better you get at everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have spent enough time working on these, try for Minmus again, treating it like something you\u0027re trying to \u0027dock\u0027 with. Once you enter its gravity, it becomes very similar to a mission to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter you have gotten comfortable with travel to minmus, I would highly suggest that your first interplanetary trip be an unmanned parachute probe to Eve. The fact that it\u0027s close by, has a larger gravity range than Duna, and is insanely easy to land on makes this a good first target, and gives you a good chance of success. Remember, UNMANNED means \u0022Don\u0027t send Kerbals\u0022; returning Kerbals from Eve is one of the hardest things to do in the game. Use a probe core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few tricks to a successful interplanetary flight:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) LV-N. The nuclear rocket motor. One LV-N attached to an x200-16, probe core, SAS, and a reliable power source can fly to anywhere in the solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Know when to go. Based on the position of the planets, it is better to leave at some times than others. These are called \u0022departure windows\u0022 or \u0022transfer windows\u0022. Leaving during a departure window lets you go somewhere while using the least amount of fuel to get there. To learn the best departure windows for your flight, type \u0022olex orbit calculator\u0022 into google and use the first link that appears, ksp.olex.biz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Start in a low orbit. The lower your orbit, the less fuel you need to use on your first burn. This is that \u0022oberth effect\u0022 that you probably keep hearing about in KSP videos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Maneuver nodes. Remember all that docking training you did? This is where it pays off. Never make a burn without simulating it with maneuver nodes first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Pack light. The heavier your ship, the harder it will be to get it going where it needs to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace is complicated, there is no easy set of rules for getting from one planet to another without mastering the fundamentals.

Then drag the purple triangle up or down until you get very close to the same plane as Minmus, ideally the reading will be NaN. Then you do your burn at the node, and presto, you now have a good transfer to Minmus. The injection point to Minmus SOI will be much smaller than Mun because Minmus is a smaller and therefore has a smaller SOI. It will require a change in speed of about 900 m/s, which is a bit more than Mun, but it\u0027s easier to land and take off again because of the reduced gravity.

Fiddle with the node. Create a new one and burn to match planes. Make your own Hohmann transfer to the Mun. As soon as you finish the transfer burn, set a new node about an hour away and try to adjust it so that you leave the Mun SOI on a trajectory for Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERepeat as necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will eventually help you get a grasp of the mechanics. It worked for me. It isn\u0027t that important right now to understand a lot of the terms like Dv or Hohmann transfer. All you need to know at this moment is how everything looks.
