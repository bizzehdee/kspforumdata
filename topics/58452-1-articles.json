Four! Three! Two! One! Happy New Year!!!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the confetti began to blow from dispensers in the nearby rooftops down upon this enormous crowd of spectators gathered in downtown Kersepolis, spheres of fire and light burst in the sky sending a rain of embers into the pristine ocean beyond the space center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Those KSC boys really know how to put on a show, don\u0027t they?\u0022 noted a nearby stranger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah, well they have plenty of experience at blowing up their rockets a thousand feet above the launchpad. I wouldn\u0027t call this anything groundbreaking.\u0022 I retorted. The stranger laughed, and I continued to watch the fireworks. Although I would have been content to leave it at that, this was the new year and the opportunity to make new friends outside your corps of new recruits didn\u0027t come often outside of these sorts of regular gatherings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI turned to the stranger and I said \u0022I\u0027m joking, of course. KSC takes its job very seriously. I would know - I\u0027m one of the test pilots.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stranger smiled. \u0022You? Seriously? I wouldn\u0027t have pegged you a day over 21 if it weren\u0027t for that drink you were holding in your hand.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Chadmore\u0027s the name. And you\u0027re right about my inexperience. Haven\u0027t even gone up on my first flight yet, though I\u0027ve logged more than a few hours in the sim. And what\u0027s your name?\u0022 I reached out my hand to this new aquaintance. He let it linger for a second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ferdan. Nice to meet you!\u0022 We shook hands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next day I woke up in my dingy apartment, two blocks from where the party started. My head was pounding, though not from the drink so much as lack of sleep. \u003Cem\u003EYou\u0027d think with all the leave they passed out for the new year celebrations, they\u0027d have the decency to push back the training schedule for this morning...\u003C/em\u003E Or maybe the idea was to see how we abused our time off. The training director at KSC was always handing us these subtle challenges, and culling the herd based on the results. \u0022I\u0027ll be damned if they get me \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E way.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe flight suit went on easy. Not having to iron it and straighten it out every time you had to put it on was one of the few things that being a test flight pilot trainee had over being in the Navy. \u003Cem\u003EI can still remember wearing dress whites for those blasted dinners where they seemed to serve nothing but marinara and barbecue-heavy dishes. Pure torture!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least KSC was barely a stonesthrow across the bay, and traffic due to the holiday was very light. I flashed my ID to the guard at the gate and he let me through. Ahead I could see the monolithic vehicle assembly building growing larger with every yard. At its foot was the recruit training facility, where I was handpicked by the suits after my \u0022long and faithful service,\u0022 which was what they called being discharged after only four months of flying experimental aircraft in the military.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn truth I crashed my last flight, but the details surrounding the aircraft were classified beyond what the KR branch at Munstak Industries could get records access for. All my resume showed was that in those four months, six out of the ten craft I\u0027d flown were deemed passable for the needs of the military and put into production. That had nothing to do with my flying, but perhaps it was just an excuse for KSC to expand its pilot pool - they weren\u0027t exactly being picky about applicants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here I was, the youngest test pilot admitted to Munstak\u0027s pilot corps since Jebediah Kerman entered on the scene nearly two decades ago, and what did they have me doing? Running on treadmills; sitting through jumped up theme park rides; learning which end of a Mk IV-b Extraterrestrial Long-Term Terrain Marker stuck into the ground. Yes I was itching to get back into a flying machine, I just didn\u0027t know it would be so soon...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we filed into the training facility one at a time, I could see a group forming around the mission assignment board. Normally the foyer was desolate as the new trainees packed off to their various exercises and training programs, but today I could barely get to a point where I could see what all the fuss was about. Before I could even get a glimpse at the latest assignments I felt a tap on my shoulder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Congratulations Chadmore. Everyone knew you\u0027d be one of the first in our training group to go up, but it\u0027s still nice to see it happen!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Thanks Dandun! I haven\u0027t been to the board yet. Do you know what\u0027s going on?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Our first mission Chad! You and I, we\u0027re both going up on the next test flight!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Just us?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, Ferdred from the last training group is joining us, but he hasn\u0027t been up either. If anything, he has it worse than we do. Since training he hasn\u0027t been on assignment even once! There\u0027s one more slot available that wasn\u0027t filled when I checked the board about two hours ago, so maybe one of them will get it.\u0022 He shrugged his head in the direction of the ever-expanding hoarde surrounding the mission board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried hard to hide my excitement, but it was in vain. Already I could feel a massive smile spreading across my face. Looking down, I regained my composure. \u0022When\u0027s the flight?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This morning.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Cem\u003EWhat!?\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 They gave me leave for new years, told me to take my time getting back to work, and then scheduled me on a flight the very next morning that they didn\u0027t tell me about until mere hours before liftoff!? \u0022I\u0027d better go get in my suit!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I could skip off to the preparation facilities, Dan put a hand on my shoulder and put his head mere inches away from mine, his own eyes positively glowing with excitement. Lowering his voice to a whisper, he continued \u0022I haven\u0027t even told you the best part, Chad... They... They\u0027re coming \u003Cem\u003Eback\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was confused. \u0022Who, Dan? Who\u0027s coming back?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022W-Who\u0027s coming back...?

Dan, they must be in their fourties by now.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, they\u0027re getting up there. But Munstak\u0027s been in desperate need for some PR. Ever since that debacle with the fuel lines on the Mun... We haven\u0027t even been past LKO in 15 years! The old satellites have all gotten worn down due to exposure, and most had to be de-orbited or blown up to save costs. For all intents and purposes, this space program is starting from scratch. Even the old designs have been turned into museum pieces and the brains over at R\u0026amp;D are turning out new contraptions every month. Seeing Bill, Bob, and Jeb get back into the pilots\u0027 chairs will be just the photo op that Munstak needs to build public support, and when that happens who knows where we\u0027ll go next!?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027re probably right. No sense to dwelling in the past or speculating about the future. I want to know about this mission!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Right, well... I don\u0027t know everything about it. I\u0027m in the same boat as you in that regard. From what I know, it\u0027s a new shuttle they\u0027re developing with a crew of seven. There\u0027s the three pilots, and those\u0027ll be-\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022-Yes, go on?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And then the four of us... Well, the two of us, plus Fredred, and the slot that was still available. We don\u0027t have a whole lot of responsibility, but if anything happens up there we\u0027ll have to act just as fast as the pilots.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u0027Not a lot of responsibility\u0027? What does that mean? We\u0027re essentially... cargo?\u0022 \u003Cem\u003EHow disappointing\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, it sounds like the ship is going to be a crew shuttle using those new engines that R\u0026amp;D turned out. \u0027SABRE\u0027 or something like that.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Nah, I think they\u0027re called \u0027RAPIER.\u0027 Something about SABRE sounding \u0027too science-fictiony.\u0027 Read about them in the \u003Cem\u003EKersepolis Times\u003C/em\u003E. That\u0027s interesting though... If Munstak\u0027s playing around with RAPIERs, then maybe they\u0027re testing a new SSTO?\u0022 Ever since exploration of the Mun ended 15 years ago, KSC has been going for reusability over modularity. It made sense that they would want to design a ship that could make orbit and return on a single stage, but the dangers were obvious and many... \u0022If they are, and it does work it\u0027d be the first of its kind. The videos from previous test flights still haunt me.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Nah, man it\u0027s okay. The technology\u0027s really improved since then. What\u0027s the worst that could-\u003Cem\u003Eumph\u003C/em\u003E! Hey, why\u0027d you just elbow me?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You were just about to say the six words that you \u003Cem\u003Enever\u003C/em\u003E say in test flying. Don\u0027t do it again!\u0022 The look on his face was priceless. You could almost tell that he knew I was being dead serious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe suits hadn\u0027t changed much since the begining of the space program. They could be donned entirely by one individual, and all the seals were closed and opened manually. There wasn\u0027t much in the way of safeguards in place to keep an astronaut from, say unlocking the seal on his helmet in vacuum (though nobody has yet to try). Still, if left alone the seals would hold for years without any maintenance, making them incredibly useful for long term missions like the ones Munstak planned for Duna after the Mun missions ended. The life support was extensive too, and portable carbon scrubbers would keep the wearer alive and supplied with oxygen for over a day if separated from the main craft, meaning a rescue mission could be mounted to save you if for some reason you found yourself separated. The EMUs were invaluable too, but I hadn\u0027t had much opportunity to train on those outside of the sim.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithin the hour I was donned and ready to go. We\u0027d attend the mission briefing in full gear (minus helmets of course), and before we could even say goodbye to the dirt we were standing on we\u0027d be heading up into the sky on a pillar of light and smoke. I found the auditorium where us, the pilots, the mission planners, and the craft engineers would be crammed into for thirty minutes or so as every facet of the mission was covered in arduous detail. As luck would have it, I was one of the first to arrive, meaning I could spend the next few minutes getting to know the other crew and, hopefully, getting to meet the pilots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was no such luck on that front, but I did get to say hello to Ferdred - a bitter son of a gun, that one. The lull between finishing training and getting picked for the mission was not fun for him, and he was the type of alpha-male personalities who would take it out on everyone else. If I ever ended up going to the Mun I would not want to be sitting in a capsule with him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen Dandun greeted me again, and continued to gush about how excited he was. I couldn\u0027t blame him either. We spent a couple of minutes discussing our pilots, and their fantastic mission records.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was checking my boot seals when I saw the third crew member walk up and stick out his hand. \u0022Nice to see ya again, kid.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Kid? Wha-\u0022 As I stood up I could see who I was talking to. \u0022-Ferdan!? Since when have you been a trainee?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I was one of the first astronauts they brought on after reopening mission control. You\u0027d never have met me until this mission if it weren\u0027t for last night. Impressive the way you packed away that champagne by the way.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But... I, uh... Why didn\u0027t you say anything?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Who wants to talk shop on a holiday, kid?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Kid? Why do you keep calling me that?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022One day, I\u0027ll tell you. New recruits: You\u0027re all kids to me. Right now though, we have a mission briefing to attend. See you on the pad.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere wasn\u0027t much of a briefing at that. This was a PR mission designed to prove the viability of a Single Stage To Orbit (SSTO) rocket using the new RAPIERs developed by R\u0026amp;D. A crew of 7 would be loaded in with a month\u0027s worth of supplies for a space station holding a crew of 8, in order to simulate the weight that the spacecraft would be required to handle during an actual resupply mission to a space station that, as yet, existed only as separarate payloads floating aimlessly through orbit. Once this mission was deemed a success, however, they would be brought together to form a new command, control, and refueling depot called \u0027Halcyon Point,\u0027 which was a very cheesy name in my opinion. \u003Cem\u003EI\u0027ll just stick with the official name, Fuel Depot Ke-01\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship was the Crew to Orbit Transfer Shuttle Mk. IV-d4, or COTS for short. COTS itself was a dainty looking thing, with four engine pods arranged in a plus-shaped configuration. Each pod was adorned with two high speed air intakes and a single RAPIER engine, which looked rather unimpressive shrouded as it was. There were four landing legs that looked to be made from match sticks, and I had no idea how it would hold up on an actual landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7aJBwgW.png\u0022 alt=\u00227aJBwgW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere were no reporters for us. No fanfare, nor any awaiting crowd cheering hopefully for our success. The only documentation of this mission was being collected by approved media personnel. In the event of critical mission failure, Munstak would want the footage tightly controlled. While I was thoroughly flattered by the consideration, I couldn\u0027t help but agree with the strategy. The pilots had already boarded by the time we got there, but the ladder was down so we climbed up and into the crew cabin just below the command module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce on board I heard Ferdan say aloud \u0022so far, I\u0027m not impressed.\u0022 I would have disagreed with him on principle, except I didn\u0027t actually disagree. Still, I kept silent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs he was buckling into his seat, Dandun noted that the view outside the window was actually pretty nice. \u0022At least they afforded us that consideration!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFerdred piped in next. \u0022Say what you want, but I\u0027m not here for the view. Do you know that we\u0027ll be the first kerbals in orbit for over 10 years? Yet nobody is around to watch us go... Doesn\u0027t that strike you as odd?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022If we go up in a fiery ball of death,\u0022 I said \u0022it seems as though Munstak would rather this mission never happened.\u0022 Nobody spoke after that. Their faces all acknowledged the truth that there was no such thing as a routine mission to space. After a moment or two of uncomfortable silence, the intercom crackled to life:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! This is your pilot, Jebediah Kerman speaking. Copilots Bill and Bob are with me here in the cockpit. I\u0027m sorry that we never had the chance to get introduced, but there will be plenty of time for celebration once this mission is over. I know you\u0027ve all been briefed, so let\u0027s begin...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-01T19:00:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the countdown wound to zero, I could feel the engines going before I heard them.

Through my little window I could see the chutes tangling as they tried to wrest the spacecraft back under control. Throughout all of this I wasn\u0027t thinking about how painful it would be to die this way, but rather overtaken by the irony of being done in by my very first mission. Would anybody even know? Would this mission ever see the light of day? Would my family... \u003Cem\u003ENo. We\u0027re slowing down, can\u0027t you see that? Look...\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was so lost in my thoughts that I forgot for a moment that my eyes were closed. When I opened them I saw that all four remaining chutes above had opened fully. I couldn\u0027t know for certain, but it looked like h-dot had slowed to a little under 30 feet per second. But was it enough? As long as those chutes stayed deployed, we\u0027d have a chance at getting out of this alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo sooner had I thought that had I heard the snapping of the lines.

The landing legs, deployed in the hopes of breaking our fall buckled first. At this speed the water might as well have been made out of concrete. The lower tanks caved in next - in the split second after impact I could hear them being crushed like a tin can under the weight of a mountain. Then the floor rose up, holes opening as big as the world to let the water come through. Another moment past that, imperceptible as it was, and I could feel my bones crush as the unstoppable force met the immoveable object.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy breath escaped me, and my world turned blue. Suddenly I \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E thinking about the pain, and then I realized there was none. It wasn\u0027t there... I was floating outside of my body, looking down on the sinking wreckage of the ship, bubbles all around it. As the ocean swallowed my tomb, I gazed up to the stars I would never see again. To space, where I would never set foot.

Bill, Bob, and Jebediah - our pilots today - were sent out on a mission that ran into some problems. Some say it was sabotage, others say it was simple oversight. One way or another, the ascent stage of the lander failed to ignite its engine. It turns out the fuel lines connecting the tanks to the engine were \u003Cem\u003Esevered\u003C/em\u003E, i.e. intentionally.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDandun looked confused. \u0022How do you know about this? You must\u0027ve been five when this was happening!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It wasn\u0027t classified. Everybody in the world knew about this at the time, but the information was surpressed over the years that followed. Accounts of what happened became next to impossible to find in any of the textbooks and schools never taught about it in any of their history courses. Eventually it was like the mission never happened.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Okay... But how do \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E know? We\u0027re of an age, you and I. I should know this too.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere were some bad memories left untapped. I suppose there wasn\u0027t really much use in hiding it, but then again Dan didn\u0027t need to know everything, did he? \u0022My father was involved in the design of that spacecraft. He never forgot what happened, and never let it go. His responsibility was the lander, and when something goes wrong with your baby you never forget it... Not ever... No matter what the textbooks say.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFerdan smiled. \u0022Tell them what happened next.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Accounts vary. The most popular version of the story is that Bob, who was in the command module at the time returned from Kerbin with a ship containing a state of the art autopilot system. \u0022Mechanical Jebediah\u0022 they called it. From the Command Module, Bob was able to remotely oversee the landing and take over if anything went wrong. Nothing did. The lander touched down, Bill and Jebediah came back home, and were celebrated as heroes one final time. Then, the space program ended and we haven\u0027t been beyond LKO in the last ten years, yadda yadda yadda.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Okay, so what does Ferdan have to do with any of this?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022There was a... contingency... In case either Jebediah or Bill failed to return from the mission. Some extra room was carved out in the command module for a fourth passenger. One that nobody knew about... He...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I was a stand in. In case one of them didn\u0027t come back. But they did come back, so Munstak Industries just wrote up an article explaining my role as the \u0022mission contingency planner\u0022 to shut up the conspiracy theorists, and released it. Declassifying the whole story. What I want to know is how you figured me out.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFerdan and I locked stares. We each knew what the other was thinking, but how much could I say? In space, nobody could protect me from him. \u0022It was obvious that you\u0027ve been on missions before. Honestly could\u0027ve been anyone. Any pilot from any of the missions KSC had ever run... But it takes a certain kind of kerbal to know the unknowable. Nobody could completely mask your utter lack of surprise upon seeing a completed space station - one that Munstak must have been keeping secret for \u003Cem\u003Eyears\u003C/em\u003E... I knew beyond the shadow of a doubt after that... You knew about this station. You were added to the crew to oversee this mission, to some greater purpose. But what is that purpose? Why don\u0027t you tell us?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENobody said a word for what felt like hours. You could cut the tension in the room with a knife, and I knew from the amused look in Ferdan\u0027s eye that I had just stepped into a web of lies. Where did these threads all lead? Did they end with him? Why were we here, at a station nobody knew about, on a routine mission that appeared to all the world to be a simple flight test of a new spacecraft? I knew I would get no answers from asking questions, so I decided then and there that it would be for the best if I just let events unfold.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fhW0Qd3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fhW0Qd3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This is Jebediah Kerman speaking.

Ferdan muttered something: \u0022Now, the real test begins...\u0022 Then... He smirked at me... Like I wasn\u0027t supposed to hear, except he knew I could but didn\u0027t care. I didn\u0027t like that look... Before I could dwell on it further, Ferdan picked up the radio and continued. \u0022Change of plans, Ferdred.
