With the addition of Kerbals being permanently lost, Career mode could be the realm of permadeath, while Sandbox would be your flight sims, where the Kerbalnauts can gain mission experience. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMissions in Career mode would be multifaceted with goals and gain access to research and new parts. The next Sandbox round would incorporate the new parts and let you being a new series of flight simulations. Missions would start with sending a satellite or two to a target, gathering data for manned missions. Manned missions pave the way for bases. Then, SCIENCE!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could even been broken into a series of mini-games. Develop a launch platform and place X mass in Y orbit. Develop a habitation module, ground test in mountains/desert/tundra. Design a rover, test at rover facility outside KSP. Design lander, simulated based on current data only. Construct a flight plan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the while, the Kerbalnauts selected for the mission would gain skill experience and flight experience. A small increase to engine isp, a longer lasting batter, increase life support, improved instrumentation, quicker reaction time could be a few minor perks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPatches, ranks and assignments would be an awesome addition towards personalizing the Kerbalaut Corp as well!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJS\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Designer225","CreatedById":48514,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T20:07:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat sounds good, but as for the mini-games... do you mean missions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Armchair Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":76165,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T20:16:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo... basically, you\u0027re suggesting getting rid of sandbox mode?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s up there with \u0022require an always online connection to play\u0022 and \u0022make parachutes DLC for an extra $9.99\u0022 in terms of angering the player base.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JadedStoner","CreatedById":63684,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T22:39:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDesigner, missions would be a full implemented, from Liftoff to Landing according to the mission profile. Before you embark on the mission, you go through a series of craft designing stages that focus on specific aspects, such as launch, habitation and IP travel. They would all come together at a final stage in preparation for the actual mission, much like the Space Shuttle use to do at the actual VAB at Kennedy Space Center. Parts would be shipped in, astronauts included, to be finally packaged and assembled into once piece for launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArmchair, no, not at all. I\u0027m totally fine with a fully stocked, free to do whatever your heart desires Sandbox mode. If you need/want/must have all the gadgets and whirlygigs from Day 1, go for it, it\u0027s your space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m suggesting is a model for a Flight Logistics and Planning mode nestled inside of Career mode. KSP is about creating a space program and I think some people would relish at the chance to build one from the ground up, so they can look back at their first Stayputnik or Kerpollo missions and feel they have truly built a space program to rival the stars. Going through mission development is a very fun process, think of the JPL guys that said \u0022Golly, let\u0027s just use rockets to land the damn thing and lower it on a rope!\u0022 (KSP even comes with a stock skycrane/rover!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission profiles have an astronomical number of possibilities and some might find it helpful to be guided through what is needed to launch a probe to orbit the Mun versus land a probe on the Mun. Having a series of in-game simulations (simulationception?) could help the non-hardcore, fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants space cowboys some players think they are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJS\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Armchair Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":76165,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T22:48:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm... that makes much more sense.
