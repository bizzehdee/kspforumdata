After landing the ship I went onto one of my saves and then decided to send an aircraft to fly to the KSC2 area (since I wanted to land there after placing a flag to mark the area). When I entered the Spaceplane hanger, this suddenly happened.\n\n![Capture.JPG](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5smw_Z8L9IA/VWXbGzoGW1I/AAAAAAAAAVY/fO5XYea77Ac/w981-h553-no/Capture.JPG)\n\nI was frankly surprised at what happened to the building. Then I decided to build a random craft and move inside of the building.\n\n![Capture2.JPG](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-TC9COk0qIXk/VWXbHyhQObI/AAAAAAAAAVY/rcY2vIC6Q2A/w982-h551-no/Capture2.JPG)\n\nIt appears the VAB has merged with the SPH. So instead I decided to load a Z-map sattelite launch kit (unmodified). I pressed launch and the Planet Kerbin seems in a mess.\n\n![Capture3.JPG](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-r8bjzz8Ym2I/VWXbKQ8AaAI/AAAAAAAAAVY/vNhAt2j1cQM/w982-h555-no/Capture3.JPG)\n\nNext to the runway you see (not only the Galaxy background) a booster firing sideways. I can\u0027t do anything (interact with the buttons) until I press M.\n\n![Capture4.JPG](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-pJDkfvmfeI0/VWXbPFL7jgI/AAAAAAAAAVY/38XUkpmtgCI/w982-h552-no/Capture4.JPG)\n\nThe game focuses on the Sun (Kerbol) for some reason. I decided to click on Kerbin and I find no evidence of my loaded craft ever existing. So I go out of map view and find the Planet slowly leaving me.\n\n![Capture5.JPG](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-0VTUgWzWU-0/VWXbQO7U5xI/AAAAAAAAAVY/d_QYduouIF4/w982-h553-no/Capture5.JPG)\n\nThe map mode\u0027s Statistics merge with the non-map mode. And you can see a booster in the background firing its engines.\n\nMods used: Hyper Edit, Kerbal engineering Redux.\n\nVersion: 1.0.2.842\n\nSo what is going on hear? Is there a Kraken that I haven\u0027t read about?"},{"CreatedByName":"Daveroski","CreatedById":93896,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T18:57:04Z","Content":"Maybe you have been playing at god just one too many times with that Hyper Edit and the universe just couldn\u0027t take any more ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Scientia1423","CreatedById":116562,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T08:36:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Maybe you have been playing at god just one too many times with that Hyper Edit and the universe just couldn\u0027t take any more ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nLOL That made my day! But I\u0027ve only started installing hyperedit onto the game, haven\u0027t used it (except for that one time where I put an E class asteroid from hitting Kerbin). It\u0027s quite a weird, game crashing bug.\n\nI think to say this new bug could be called \u0022Titan Kraken\u0022 But It could be simply fixed by just reloading the game. Also, as a pre-caution; any ship that you launch when this happens will dissapear. So unless the game auto-saves the craft that you\u0027ve made, the game will register the craft as \u0027Wait, was this here before?\u0027\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-30T10:10:43Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2015 10:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by diomedea**\n  \nmerged consecutive posts"}]}
