To pull the capsule away from such a mighty rocket, a very strong motor is needed. Separation motor doesn\u0027t need to be this powerful, so you\u0027re either making an underpowered abort or an overpowered LES separation. And then, there\u0027s the tendency of the LES to stick to the capsule after an abort and decoupling, especially apparent on heavy towers like this one. We\u0027ve been through this with BobCat when working on his N1, he ended up making a 2-part LES which had worked very well (even before the joint upgrade) and solved those issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pockrtplanesairways","CreatedById":101834,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T23:41:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, Frizz, are you planning to make the MOL for career mode?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Also, after you are done with the american stuff, are you thinking of doing soviet stuff?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 2: Dammit, i keep saying stuff before i try something.

The freezing is intermittent and is really annoying compared to lag that happens sometimes. The normal lag I am talking about seems to slow down the whole game.

I also roughly built the whole Saturn V with the stock Command Pod and no OLDD parts and it flew perfect.
