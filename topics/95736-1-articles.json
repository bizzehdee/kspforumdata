I\u0027m using Infernal Robotics to make a gantry that raises and lowers in the cargo bay of the rover. The idea is that the gantry will have a robotic arm that will grab KAS storage units, lift them out of the cargo bay and deposit them on the ground for Jeb and friends to do stuff with. I\u0027ve got the gantry attached to an adjustable rail on one end of the cargo bay. The other end of the bay has it\u0027s own adjustable rail but I\u0027m not having any luck getting the Octagonal Struts to attach to the far opposite rail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a screen shot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i174.photobucket.com/albums/w83/Jason310019/screenshot1_zps93a42493.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1_zps93a42493.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, the left side is just hanging there and it will not connect to the rail.

Think of your craft as a tree, with the root part as the trunk and every part attached to it, as a branch, and (almost) every part can have others branching from it (except certain radially attached parts or struts). The issue for the OP is that he wants the branches to form a loop, which a tree cant do (a mathematical tree cant do anyway), the only exceptions, as mentioned above, are the humble strut, or \u0022space tape\u0022, or a docking adaptor (which was connected in the simulation and NOT in the VAB or SPH) which can close your loop\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"twiget","CreatedById":134021,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-07T06:31:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the advice guys.

Take one and attach it to the adjustable rail then attach one to the cubic strut holding the gantry then make sure they are close together so that when you launch the ship the two docking ports will connect with eachother.
