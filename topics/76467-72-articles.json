On a semi-related note: does it seem like a good idea to add the CECE to the list of alternate configs to that engine? Now that it\u0027s got so many, it seems like the right place to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe procedural decoupler seems to have a hard time locking into the very bottom node of the mk1-2 pod heat shield (when attached to a mk1-2 pod). If it locks in higher up it won\u0027t separate (which then causes the reentry to have a very low drag coefficient, besides probably other badness). In addition when it\u0027s attached in what I believe is the correct location, there\u0027s a noticeable gap in the rocket (although everything handles fine).

So when I find the RF zip with a TS directory, I carefully copy the contents of this TS into the existing GameData/TS directory.

Knowing how DLLs work... (they load dependencies automatically if found in the same dir) I decided to move the DLL. Lo and behold, it works. I don\u0027t know what system you used to test the install, but on *my system* it doesn\u0027t work.

This is a TweakScale/RF interaction issue which would present itself regardless if RO was installed or not. Regardless of platform or computer. So I\u0027m going to consider that particular issue closed, at least on this thread. I have taken note of your findings with the probe cores however and will be spending some time on them in the near future.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-26T18:07:46Z\u0022 title=\u002210/26/2014 06:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RedAV8R\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedAV8R","CreatedById":94171,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T18:07:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@Keudn:\u003C/strong\u003E Your second craft is suffering from nearly identical issues as the first. It\u0027s simply too powerful. Once again, the vehicle has over 16000 dV. That is simply not needed for your intended mission. I didn\u0027t make it to my big machine yesterday, so hopefully I\u0027ll take a look here this afternoon. In the mean time, build some replica launchers based on real vehicles to learn the basics, then go from there. There is a repository and a discussion forum that would be helpful for you. Once FASA is done here, you can use some Titan\u0027s or even Atlas-Agena\u0027s to launch what you need. I also suggest you use the RT settings file provided which adds more ground stations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found the solar panels, sneaky buggers. That and they were hidden by you using tweakscale, not your fault, just that craft files don\u0027t load right when tweakscale is used.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-26T18:09:22Z\u0022 title=\u002210/26/2014 06:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RedAV8R\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
