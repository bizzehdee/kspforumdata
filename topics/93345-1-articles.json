I\u0027m not sure if these are bugs yet, or features, as I\u0027ve yet to get terribly far in the new campaign:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI cannot target things? Is this from an upgrade from a buildings? Future upgrades are not outlined anywhere, it seems, except for a few in the big .90 post. There\u0027s no information in game on what I will gain by upgrading a building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUtter lack of SAS without a pilot makes remote probes QUITE difficult before a certain point. Even NASA could do this in the early days. They launched several rockets with no crew aboard to test things. We don\u0027t normally send people into space if we\u0027re unsure if they\u0027ll live at all. I\u0027ve attempted to pilot a few rockets into space utterly manually. It\u0027s... less than satisfying. Maybe I\u0027ll try with a joystick.. but meh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game is definitely a bit tougher now. Getting past the hurdles of the initial program, where I have to do piddly missions I normally skip is kind of a frusteration. I\u0027m not a huge fan of doing billions of parts tests, since their payout is generally meager, or they involve hauling a huge SRB into sub orbital just to fire and drop them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will figure it out, just wondering at other people\u0027s experiences.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RW-1","CreatedById":107278,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T13:52:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I\u0027m sure the targeting is part of upgrading your tracking center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for information on upgrading, yes, it is there in that dialog box, at lest when I hovered mouse over upgrade, the increases for launch weight showed for the launchpad, I didn\u0027t yet see about the tracking center, but try placing mouse over the button and see what it tells you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, I just declined parts tests and went for the alt, escape and orbit so far so good ... though I notice you start with just Jeb as a listed pilot, no others available in the astro complex, which means be careful! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rdwulfe","CreatedById":107690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T13:55:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah.

I rarely lost them before, but accidents do happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Oh and thank you, yes, they show the *next* level when you upgrade, but not the full progression. It\u0027d be nice if there was some kind of in game encyclopedia for this information, so I could know what I get from tier 3 without having to go google crazy.

I don\u0027t like doing part tests either, so I tend to skip them unless they fit with a mission profile I\u0027m planning. So far I\u0027m struggling with gathering enough cash to upgrade the buildings, but was able to follow a slow and steady progression that goes somewhat like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 1: Launch vessel and break altitude record contracts;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 2: Break altitude record and reach space contracts;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 3: Reach orbit and get science from kerbin space contracts;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 4: With these three missions I was able to get a reliable orbiter and unlocked batteries, allowing me to do multiple \u0022Science from kerbin space\u0022 on the next launch; with a strategy to convert funds into science I unlocked the tech to a probe with SAS, solar panels, and everything needed to build a small jet plane\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 5: Multiple plane \u0022survey\u0022 contracts;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 6: Multiple \u0022place satellite\u0022 contracts;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI upgraded the launchpad and plan to upgrade either the tracking station or the R\u0026amp;D next.
