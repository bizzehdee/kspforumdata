In fact, in the current model, the failure chance is only a function of the age. I was thinking that I could subtract from the age a percentage of the time that has passed since the last inspection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say that you have a tank that is 1 year old and was last inspected 6 months ago: for example, inspecting it now would remove 2 months from the part\u0027s age (or another fraction of those 6 months) thus making it more reliable from this point on. If I perform a new inspection 3 weeks from now, I only discount 1 week.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, we might discount a percentage of the total age of the part. This model is simpler, but has 2 BIG problems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- because of the non-linearity in the aging function (well, actually in the failure chance function) inspecting earlier is a lot more profitable than inspecting later;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- also, I might just start spamming the inspection and effectively force the part\u0027s age to (almost) 0. This can actually be mitigated by having the inspection require the use of spare parts, so that spamming inspections actually becomes more dangerous than just risking it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts?
