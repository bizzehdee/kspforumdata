I don\u0027t have a set number in mind for payload mass yet. My current thinking is that I want to recreate the SpaceX designs in a realistic way (scaled to KSP) but also have them be able to carry the crafts people actually build into low kerbin orbit and beyond. The Falcon 1 would be able to deploy satellites and such into low kerbin orbit and keostationary orbit, the Falcon 9 would be able to bring a small lander to the Mun and Minmus and so on. Does that make sense? Like I said, I don\u0027t know for sure yet. I\u0027ll happily listen to what people who want to use my mod want it to be, within limits.

The Falcon 9 second stage would not go to the moon, is what I\u0027m saying, but it would propel the craft enough to enable a TLI. Any eventual Google Lunar X Prize winners will launch on a Falcon 9 (not Falcon Heavy). One company, Astrobotic Technology, has already signed a contract.
