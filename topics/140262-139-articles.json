Since it\u0027s nothing specific, I assume anything I pick is fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst I took the 9J \u0022Baron\u0022 Rotary Engine which struggled to go up to ~50-60m/s\u002B, the engine cut off at nearly ~130m/s [The craft is Aeris 1A from Kerbal X]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond and up next on pre-modern, I took the RR \u0022Marlin\u0022 Engine\u00A0which has good performance at certain altitudes to \u0022simulate\u0022 a supercharger or whatever - it\u0027s rather fast, and the power is front-loaded, it tapers off so fast at high speeds and cuts off at ~180m/s, the engine just simply stops. At sea level, the results are lower. You can dive above 200m/s but the engine stops. [The craft is Stallion from Kerbal X]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird is the RR K56 \u0022Titan\u0022 Turboprop Engine, extremely front-loaded, it takes off with 4x of it, in fact, I think even with one of these would pretty much do the same thing to an aircraft with smaller size. The engine stops at ~290m/s pretty spot on, this one is on a dive. It sustains ~170-180m/s crusing and can never get there with normal circumstances. [The craft is Dodo Heavy from Kerbal X]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNotes: The KP-12 \u0022Bear\u0022 Kontraprop Engines can maintain ~270-280m/s cruise, these are based on the engine of Tu-114 and Tu-95\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI honestly don\u0027t know as much as the others do in terms of these kind of things but I can\u0027t say I know nothing. I still based them off somewhere, not just guesses. First off, the numbers seem\u00A0to be off, other than the fact that you may have been exaggerating for hyperbolic purposes and I misunderstood it\u00A0- you might wanna check if you\u0027re using something like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E since the curves are made and tested on stock, results may vary. Though\u00A0it is a fact that my testing was in no way standardized too. The variation helps provide data for different applications though.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow before I say the mechanics behind some considerations on why they have deviations in accuracy to reality - I want to tell you that I agree if people complain, there must be something wrong, what I need though is a good amount of dissatisfaction to the current mechanics compared to those who are satisfied. Because in the end, where people are more comfortable with will stay or change, you know what I\u0027m saying?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo a lot of these engines are front-loaded in power, they have higher initial curves and taper off at the end. The reason is because the curves are speed and atmosphere based. This is seen in two ways - take off speed, tight maneuvering speed. In order to not lose much on maneuvering, the power is \u0022front-loaded\u0022 so you can do more ksp-like maneuvers, except more limited. The jet engines use delayed thrust response for slower take-off\u00A0but I tested it back then and props can\u0027t have it because it\u0027s much like a jet like lag on controls\u00A0for obvious reasons.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSome engines are \u0022pseudo-2.5m\u0022 engines too, which affects this as well. We can use K56 or KP-12 which are treated with something close to those kinds of performance but the size is 1.25m. You can use these as tractor propellers because of how simple engines work in KSP - just a thrust transform and curves, with airflow resource. No complicated machinery limiting the usage\u00A0and all that jazz. They\u0027re offset with their weight instead, they\u0027re quite heavy for non-cargo usage. It\u0027s difficult to use but eh, people exploit what they gotta exploit so it\u0027s fine.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA lot of the engines, well all of them will inevitable compared to the jet engines. And the consequence is that they\u0027re just inferior when your goal is to finish the missions. This is plays a big part on the performance too. The bottomline ends up above the aforementioned considerations, that the props are good enough to do the job, cheap, but not as powerful as jets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I gotta say that jets in KSP are really fast too, just the weasley could get to Mach 1.5\u002B if you wanted to when it\u0027s not even supposed to surpass supersonic proper at cruise speed in terms of the aircrafts that used it irl. Though KSP\u0027s jets are a bit \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E, they\u0027re kind accurate too. In comparison, my engines are a bit more \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E than that, and less accurate if you actually take a closer look, and the reasons are stated above. But the tests I\u0027ve exhibited so far doesn\u0027t stray too far from the intended \u0022realistic enough\u0022 range in my opinion. If the people say otherwise, I\u0027d be happy to tweak it though. Really, it\u0027s just quicker on accelerating is the most obvious deviation I implemented I can see - this difference in maneuvering is what really sets it apart from KAX for good reason. KAX really gets it spot on in realism though, I\u0027m nowhere that level and don\u0027t intend to be too accurate as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know where to put this but I just remembered this, like I said, an \u0022engine\u0022 is defined by curves and intake resource. You have a top speed you want and you want to either accelerate so slow you never get there so you don\u0027t exceed it\u00A0or reach/exceed that and slow down afterwards- you gotta choose. If you nerf the acceleration, you\u0027ll never get that top speed. If you put a hard mark on the top speed, the engine cuts off - this was a major problem before and a lot of people complained so I boosted the acceleration to get to the top speed instead, and slowed down the engine after that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Uhhhh, regarding the sliding doors, you mean remove the other side of the cylinder?

Which is kinda made it less relevant for turboprop-powered\u00A0bomber or cargo plane construction, as the load the plane needs to take could be tremendous; something like 12 (?) BDAC Mk83s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the SXTC\u0027s KO-TP12 (Based on the same engine) is far more powerful, at 300 kN (Almost on par with the stock Goliath).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027m thinking of is the thrust increase up to 250\u002B kN.

In Airplane Plus, T56 has both better power and weight though, but it\u0027s limited on its speed. In reality T56 is scaled up a bit in power because KSP parts are heavy and I want it to be able to carry heavy cargo. NK-12 is mostly used on bombers and not cargo so it\u0027s got speed instead to balance it out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: The speeds are all based in real life too in some ways\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-16T02:36:19Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2019 02:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by blackheart612\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
