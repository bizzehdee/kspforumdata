Windows 8 was very well done in performance terms, and Windows 10 seems to have taken it even further plus adding a user interface people actually like.\n\nYour biggest concerns for windows 10 are not software, but drivers, and even then they shouldn\u0027t be a very big concern. Printers are often most likely to break if they have functions beyond printing (All in ones) but even then there shouldn\u0027t be many of them that do. Most of your common devices with either have universal drivers updated (gaming mice and keyboards, video cards, etc) or be built into the OS.\n\nTL;DR: Don\u0027t worry about existing stuff.

Nvidia and AMD/ATI do seem to be on the slow side for drivers for new OS\u0027s, at least as far as their new hardware is concerned. Makes me wonder if they get a fair look at the new OS and DirectX before both are publicly released."},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T19:26:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s up to your video card manufacturer, not Windows 8.
