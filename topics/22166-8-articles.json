I have a 2 station 3 ship setup right now. A station around the mun which can hold fuel and kethane (has a converter on the station) I normally only add kethane to the station on my last extraction from a site before I move on. I have a 2nd lander which is just to haul fuel from the surface to the Mun orbiting station. finally I have a tanker that stays in orbit that hauls finished fuel from the mun station to the Kerbin station. I use the Quantum Fuel transfer mod instead of using the KAS. I use this mod because I found that once I establish a link between two ships, if I don\u0027t turn it off I can launch off load, and return and the link between the ships will still be active and I can start transferring fuel between them again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am redesigning my miner to make it more conversion friendly, been using the small converter and not liking the overall results. But given how quickly deposits can be depleted I still think having a relaunchable miner to move it to a new field is a better option than a permanent ground based one. I saw Scott Manley move his ground based setup just 30k distance and it was a chore and a half.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Throggdor","CreatedById":61234,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T17:24:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mihara\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mihara\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo I\u0027m trying to figure out a two ship setup -- a manned driller/converter and a tanker - and work out exactly how few drills and how little electric charge I can get away with. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually I had the same problem. I created a mobile conversion station... 3 tankers... a drilling rig which was just 6 kethane drills hooked up to the biggest kethane storage tank, a power/converter which was mostly batteries, solar panels, and large kethane converters, and a storage tanker... which stored the fuel. A drop ship to land the parts on the Mun, and a cargo ship to ferry the fuel into orbit. This lagged me to all hell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I abandoned it and picked another kethane deposit on the opposite side of the Mun. I used the part generator mod to create a tank that could hold everything. I used that to replace my cargo ship and storage tanker, then modified my driller to add a converter. Although my approch has 2 main components its far less impressive then the main station I created... all in the interest of being able to set up bases on other planets... this one does the same but it takes longer, my tankers were driven by a need to make a mobile base since i prefer to land my ships under my own power.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
