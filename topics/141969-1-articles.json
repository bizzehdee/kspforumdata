Especially antennas. Btw, the highest airpressure is that of Eve at sea level (or Jool if you count that one)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAntennas during excessive air resistance should snap off. I think you mean only \u0022Air resistance\u0022 in the entirety of your concept. But if you also meant damage being dealt through airpressure alone, then that\u0027s not what supposed to happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAir resistance can happen on low and high airpressures since pressure has nothing to do with it. There is little logic for parts to suffer due to airpressure alone. BTW, If you need to haul the parts to the high air pressure conditions of your destination you want them to survive there. If they didn\u0027t we would need specific parts for high pressure locations, adding even more parts to the already vast selection of stock parts.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnly empty canisters should fail due to excessive airpressure alone. And we just assume those landing canisters can hold that pressure. Fuel tanks are always under pressure, also unpressurized tanks because.... well..... they usually carry tons of burny stuff that weighs alot, let\u0027s say on launch. Adding immense weight to the metal construction of a tank.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you get a fuel tank into a high air pressure environment it\u0027s probably going to strenghten the part since a pressurized tank under exterior pressure now has a balancing force.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then again, why even get there if it\u0027s the purpose of this game to get parts to high pressure conditions anyway.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI don\u0027t see what crash tolerance has to do with air pressure. Old CRT monitors had glass chambers that protected a inside vaccuum, thus alot of exterior pressure under 1 atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey could run for years without hurting those sitting in front of them. But scoop out the contents and let it drop from 2 stories high and it breaks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA real life part with high pressure resistance but breaks relatively easily, and something to try at home. Mind the pedestrians though.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut as for your antenna example, yeah, that one should snapp off definitely.
