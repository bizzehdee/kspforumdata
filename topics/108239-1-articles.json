Designed to house astronauts on the way to Mars and back, it was truly an impressive feat of almost-built engineering. I cri evrytiem. Copernicus may never exist in the real world, but you can have it sitting in LKO as soon as you want! (Provided you find a way to get it up there.) Hopefully this replica does it justice.\n\n**Craft Info:** 346 parts, 127 tons, and enough dv for a Duna roundtrip. Only .16 TWR though, be warned.\n\n**Craft Download:** (Mediafire) [\\_Copernicus\\_MTV.craft\u0022\\]Link](http://www./download/x7tz7080wd7xdjm/%5BREPLICA)\n\nAnd now the beauty shots!\n\n![vPfCEHX.png](http://i.imgur.com/vPfCEHX.png)\n\n![s4X3z7u.png](http://i.imgur.com/s4X3z7u.png)\n\n![mdzGiwP.png](http://i.imgur.com/mdzGiwP.png)\n\n![NUNFcIQ.png](http://i.imgur.com/NUNFcIQ.png)\n\n![1UUP58t.png](http://i.imgur.com/1UUP58t.png)\n\nThanks for viewing, and leave some rep if you enjoyed!"},{"CreatedByName":"pTrevTrevs","CreatedById":131541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T18:32:58Z","Content":"Great job!
