At 20km you do not have enough atmosphere to use control surfaces effectively. I have found that that is normally a center of drag issue caused by high drag parts (open intakes and docking ports) in the front. The first option is to redesign to have docking ports in the back of the plane to try to stabilize the ship. The second is to keep the intakes closed until you are below 10km. A third option is to turn on a gimbaled engine before you try to turn as that will provide some more control but you probably don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have enough fuel or air for that to work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T14:52:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring re-entry drag is a big factor.
