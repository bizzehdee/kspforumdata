The basic version let\u0027s you predict only two types though: the ISS and the Iridium sats. The premium content let\u0027s you show the path of the Hubble telescope, X-37 and some other stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question is (if you have it): has anyone\u00A0bought the premium version? Are Hubble and X-37 bright enough to spot them with the naked eye?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-02T23:13:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCelestron Skyportal is on both and it has a ton of sats you can see for free, as well as a lot of other stuff. You can also link it up to a Celestron telescope and have the app point the telescope around to objects. It\u0027s awesome and free!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-03T00:18:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAwwwwww... I thought for a second you can connect to a telescope somewhere in the world and observe planets in real time. Shame there\u0027s nothing like that. The app looks ok, but I would like to have the ability to track sats only.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-03T00:19:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell it has all the functions, nothing is impeded. It also highlights easily visible stuff right then. It\u0027s really nice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
