It looks gorgeous but when I tried to manually install a few of these, like EVE and Astronomer\u0027s Visal Pack, the game crashes when it loads the main menu. And I paid attention to the instructions \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E I tried to do it through CKAN as well, only to get the same results.
