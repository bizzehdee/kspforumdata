Glanced through the already suggested/don\u0027t suggest lists and I don\u0027t see anything like this yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really like the idea of launching probes/spacecraft and not timewarping the game. I already do this frequently (currently have my first two interplanetary spacecraft - Explorer 1 and Explorer 2 flying through the solar system!) and it tweaks that total nerd/scientist in my head. Sometimes, like my Explorer craft I\u0027ve sent them off and just leave them as I do other things in KSP, and sometimes I\u0027ll just leave the game running while I wait for a burn maneuver or something. I still time warp plenty too, but I do enjoy playing that way frequently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, there\u0027s piles of ways to go down this sort of path (KSP server you can log into which runs in real time, etc) which I\u0027m sure are completely out of scope of KSP and all expansions \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. But one simple feature that would greatly enhance my KSP playing is a settings toggle which allows KSP to run as a background application - still operate when it\u0027s minimized or another window has focus. That would be fantastic!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UbioZur","CreatedById":72946,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T21:26:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFollow the discussion \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/53464-things-happening-when-we-aren-t-playing-%28Realtime-mode%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince it seems to have more answer, I will close this one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
