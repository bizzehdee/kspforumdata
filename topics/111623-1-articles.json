Launch ISRU to Minimus orbit (don\u0027t forget electricity and docking ports)\n\n2. Launch Miner Lander to Minimus (lander craft with ore container and drills)\n\n3. Land on Minimus, extract ore, then dock to ISRU station in orbit, produce fuel.\n\n4. So far no problems.\n\n5. Restart KSP\n\n6. Undock miner craft and land it on Minimus. Check that your ore container is empty.\n\n7. Activate drill. Ore container is (almost) instantly full.\n\n8. Launch, dock to ISRU. Once you dock, ore container is instantly empty.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-01T21:57:43Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2015 09:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GagaX**"},{"CreatedByName":"GagaX","CreatedById":57813,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T07:22:35Z","Content":"This is my ISRU Fuel Factory:\n\n![taovoj.jpg](http://i62.tinypic.com/taovoj.jpg)\n\nAnd this is my lander miner:\n\n![2wd3tao.jpg](http://i57.tinypic.com/2wd3tao.jpg)\n\nYou can see Small Holding Tank is full, despite ore has just been jettisoned."},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T12:16:47Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been having a similar issue when mining asteroids. One thing that I\u0027m beginning to note with that; if you deploy the drills and then activate harvesting BEFORE the drill has fully deployed it will instantly drain the asteroid of all resources. This may be related, not sure, but check to see what happens if you wait a bit between deploying drill and activating it."},{"CreatedByName":"GagaX","CreatedById":57813,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T15:53:54Z","Content":"Thanks for the reply, but waiting to activate drill didn\u0027t help ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"GagaX","CreatedById":57813,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T12:20:41Z","Content":"My career is on hold because of this.

At the worst, I\u0027d get my ore/fuel faster than I should and as I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a bad thing (When time warp does the same thing with such a slight bit of more work what\u0027s the difference?)

I\u0027ve only ever seen the situation where you land, start drilling, and instantly have a ton of ore. Then you leave that ship and come back and the ore tank\u0027s empty.\n\nEvery other instance but that one, ore tanks have behaved themselves. If your ore tanks are unfilling themselves after you sat through a long session of mining then that\u0027s a different story.\n\nFrom your first post, you seem to have experienced a similar thing to me, though. The only difference is you spent fuel transporting that phantom ore to space before it vanished."}]}
