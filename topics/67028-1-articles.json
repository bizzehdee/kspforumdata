I brought two more home but like the Matrix we all live in I a pushed a button and changed reality. Jeb , Bill and Bob are back with me !!! I built a new lander and a rover WITH docking ports. The rover docked right up with my ship on the pad but I cannot figure out how to get them back apart !!! Stuck like dogs in heat. I can\u0027t find any commands in my list for it. I ended up actually knocking over the ship on the pad ... which made for one awesome explosion. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Building a rocket to get the new Rover there ... will then be able to move all the fuel around I ever need ... this one is turning out to be just a bit more difficult, but I am learning a bit everyday ... especially with the help I have received here. I called my rover the Matrix Centipede as in testing it seems it can crawl over anything and keep on going. Now if I can just get it undocked !!! Thanks for all your help guys. One day I shall make a you tube vid .. Kerbal 101 ... my way to repay for all the help I have received. Time to test what I have learned today. Thank you all !!! Jeb ..
