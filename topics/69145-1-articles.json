I\u0027m currently developing a mod, but I can\u0027t quite seem to get mesh colliders to work in Unity. When I try to give the mesh a collider, it doesn\u0027t do anything. Nothing happens if i change and of the options either. However, if I try to use, say, a capsule collider, it works completely fine. Any idea why this is happening?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Justin Kerbice","CreatedById":101695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-13T20:23:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt looks like collider made with mesh themselves doesn\u0027t appears like convex colliders (in light green, as well as basic ones like cube or sphere), but they are there in game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry it with something simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite Unity reference is very unclear about collider (according to it, only convex collider can interact with others collider):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMesh Colliders cannot collide with each other unless they are marked as Convex\u003C/strong\u003E.
