I\u0027m asking about a craft that has already been launched. Say you launch a rocket to Duna. Then you want to make a copy of that craft in mid-flight, or after landing, and paste it into your sandbox game for simulations without having to recreate the entire situation. Or to build a scenario. Use it for story purposes or something. Is it possible?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not afraid of mucking around in the file if it\u0027s complicated, I just want to know how complicated and what the pitfalls might be, if anyone knows already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion 2: Can you create a craft file out of a launched craft?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou launch your prize rocket. Then you go into the VAB and start fussing with the saved version, decide to leave the VAB and accidentally click to save the craft. You just saved over the ship you spent three days building.

I could probably go rooting around in the save file and learn by trial and error, but if anyone already knows, I hope I can avail myself of your knowledge and save myself a lot of experimentation. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-31T00:00:30Z\u0022 title=\u002210/31/2015 12:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kyrt Malthorn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EGot my answers\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-29T12:41:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1. Yes. That\u0027s how I replicated my career save RT satellite network to my sandbox save for testing purposes. Just copy the whole vessel section and should be good to go. Having an editor that can select matching {}\u0027s will make the work super easy. The only thing is the ship may not appear at the exact location from the other save because the current time may be different between saves, and current location is derived from orbit parameters and time, not saved directly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.
