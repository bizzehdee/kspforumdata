This is also a great opportunity to test an experimental craft, apparently holding so much Delta-V that it doesn\u0027t require docking or any of that lame stuff. That\u0027s right, first mission to Eeloo, and a ballsy one at that! Without further adieu, let us begin the countdown!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, before I forget, here is our rocket on the launchpad:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-5VsOmBJGw3Q/VEstwlw3YMI/AAAAAAAAAbI/sqCAYZEC97g/w346-h208/Launchpad.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Launchpad.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said, this is totally experimental, and we have brought along with us some Kethane just in case we need some extra Delta-V. We wont be updating next until we\u0027re in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0bE_JI51954/VEszb628dII/AAAAAAAAAbs/9la-s9UGBeM/w346-h208/First%2Borbit.png\u0022 alt=\u0022First%2Borbit.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich of course for you guys is a matter of milliseconds, but for me is a whole 4 minutes. We still have buttloads of fuel left, and with that, lots of that sweet Delta-V. A lot of you might think it\u0027s a good idea to switch to the Nuclear engines right now, and just do manual fuel transfers, but the problem is that we wont be able to maneuver properly. Through a simulation recently conducted, we would be slamming head on into Kerbin by making a maneuver into interplanetary space, so that\u0027s out of the question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Vg7C2uOdB0k/VEs4hbz419I/AAAAAAAAAcU/GhQARGK6fhs/w346-h208/Interplanetary%2Bburn.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Interplanetary%2Bburn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we leave the Kerbin sphere of influence, we take a good look at the planet before getting too far away. After all, it\u0027s the last of it they\u0027ll see for several years. It\u0027s also the last they\u0027ll see of you...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2VF0ySpfbfA/VEs6jgrF5EI/AAAAAAAAAc8/Dzx1_geDyDw/w346-h208/Plane%2Bchange.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Plane%2Bchange.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA quick plane change puts us on a matching inclination with Eeloo, which will ultimately allow us to go later in our lives!. Turns out we actually have to wait a while. I can\u0027t imagine doing this in real time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3rosW86jDyU/VEs8lrtDgjI/AAAAAAAAAdk/4ixibF4DWus/w346-h208/Eeloo%2Bencounter.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Eeloo%2Bencounter.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a bit of finagling with nodes, we got an encounter. This is the one I found that requires the least amount of Delta-V. Speaking of Delta-V, we don\u0027t have much left in the skipper engine, so we may have to use the lander for trimming. That cuts into out fuel supply, however don\u0027t forget about that Kethane. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-U5x7V36NtFU/VEtA4PGd5yI/AAAAAAAAAeU/OI31x1QS8zo/w346-h208/Eeloo%2Bburn.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Eeloo%2Bburn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd thank god we had it to! We actually ran out of fuel and had to use the Kethane converter. I had to balance the fuel to oxidizer ration by hand, and in real time as best as I could (I didn\u0027t do a very good job, let\u0027s be honest), and it left us with the Delta-V we needed to make a final push to Eeloo. Now it\u0027s time to play the waiting game! I think I\u0027ll go make a grilled cheese while this plays out at 1,000,000x time warp. Yeah, it takes that long. Anyways, I\u0027m hungry, so I\u0027ll be back in a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mRq-runT63E/VEtEpDnyqXI/AAAAAAAAAf8/NyNMLSSxblc/w346-h208/Jool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Jool.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething interesting I found: We can see Jool from here! It may be a bit hard to see, I\u0027ll zoom in with the telescope. Here\u0027s what I see:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jwWVvoa9mVE/VEtFTymlZ5I/AAAAAAAAAgo/eFmMVeR10lc/w346-h192/Jool2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Jool2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see the arrow had followed... Oh well. At least Jool\u0027s visible now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this, we will stop updates for now (I\u0027m just getting tired. Running on 3 hours of sleep for 21 hours so far).

I was here for a straight 40 minutes. Anyway, we got to our encounter, and I thought to myself: \u0022This is experimental, so why not just be aggressive?\u0022 Thus, we did this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-rQlIivtzhCc/VEwu9E8uIOI/AAAAAAAAAiM/TyKvpK3b684/w346-h208/Nerveracking.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Nerveracking.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that was a bad plan. I couldn\u0027t take any shots of anything in between this. I realized I wasn\u0027t landing on a Kethane deposit, so I had to correct that, and then heavily slow down as I realized we were much closer to the ground than I thought! Slowing down and landing this in that scenario was a beast, but I was able to do it nonetheless, and now you see the surprise we brought with us; the Rover!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-w9FnjvNMRpg/VEwxjfXqMLI/AAAAAAAAAi4/Evri3oThhGo/w346-h208/Rover.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Rover.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis little guy has proven useful wherever I put him!

Sorry that this one is really short, but I need some time to rove around off camera, and after that we need to wait for the launch window back to Kerbin. With this little amount of Delta-V, we can\u0027t afford any mistakes! (We do have the Kethane reserves still, but they\u0027re empty. Thankfully we can mine for some where we landed.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WooDzor","CreatedById":72106,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-25T23:37:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you play on your nokia 3310? damn these pics are tiny \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E Well done though!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-25T23:44:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WooDzor\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WooDzor\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDo you play on your nokia 3310? damn these pics are tiny\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHa!
