If it is still like how it was when I based the submarine parts off of the Firespitter parts, then the Firespitter parts only change how their own colliders interact with water. Thus, a pontoon might do fine in water but for any other part it is like hitting solid earth. The submarine ballast tanks make it so the entire vessel has its parts\u0027 colliders replaced with ones that treat water as water and not as solid ground. So yes, your whole rocket not splashes rather than crashes!
