But one of the crafts I have linked here (the fuel tank) is just about 20tons or even lesser in kerbin orbit and it accelerates like maybe 1deg/sec/sec.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you try the two files for yourself? Both of them have large ASAS. and the station I have 4 more smaller SASes as well. So 5 in total.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw I have landed on moon, minmus and almost landed on duna but I still can\u0027t dock.
