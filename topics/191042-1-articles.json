You can\u0027t see it in the picture, but the rear landing gear is spread just wide enough to give me a free degree or two on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E while still on the runway. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E is close to and ahead of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E, and both are close to and ahead of the main (rear) landing gear. I\u0027m also flying at about a 10% fuel load in engine tanks and empty main tanks because I don\u0027t need more for runway tests and short hops around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. One model has gotten into full flight at 40% engine thrust. I expect others to follow soon. A couple are lifting the nose wheel already at about 38 m/sec, before crossing in front of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E building, and without touching the pitch control, so I think I\u0027m good with with these issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat concerns me is the oscillation in attitude before I even leave the ground. I have pitch on the one hand, yaw on the other, and why not roll, too?\u00A0 This appears to be highly sensitive to details of vehicle configuration and speed. It appears in some models but not others, and it could be due to interaction with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E; one more thing to test.\u00A0 It may either go away or get worse with increasing speed.\u00A0 If it persists in flight, it\u0027s an invitation to a crash.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think this is a typical beginner problem, although it could be one of the many factors contributing to the high crash rate among beginners.
