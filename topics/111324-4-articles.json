SMT is the practice of creating \u0022virtual cores\u0022 out of a single core, allowing multiple threads to execute at the same time on the same core (sometimes). This works because some CPUs have hardware that sometimes goes unused by a single thread (for example, a CPU might have multiple ALUs per core); and so the CPU can expose multiple virtual cores, and provided two threads don\u0027t both need all the resources, they can both execute simultaneously. If they both need something that there\u0027s only one of (such as the FPU), then they can\u0027t execute simultaneously, and the two \u0022virtual cores\u0022 perform just the same as a single core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultithreading (the programming concept) is the practice of breaking the program into separate \u0022threads\u0022 of execution, each of which can be thought of a bit like a separate program. Because your CPU generally spends most of its time waiting for things (reading from disk, writing to disk, reading from the network), it can suspend one thread and execute another, instead of sitting around idle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally, threads are not assigned \u0022affinity\u0022 (which locks them to a single core), because CPUs and operating systems are pretty good at deciding what to execute, when, and where. Setting affinity usually leads to decreased performance, where CPUs go back to sitting around waiting for non-CPU things to do their thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP right now is multithreaded, and is multithreaded regardless of whether you have one, ten, or a hundred cores, and whether any of those cores use SMT or not. KSP will use any cores that are available to it. Sitting here looking at the KSC, KSP has 33 threads going. Unless you have more than 33 cores, KSP will use up to all your cores simultaneously, if the OS decides that it needs to (i.e., all those 33 threads need to do work at the same time). Most likely, all but a small number of those threads are sitting around doing nearly nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFurther to NecroBone\u0027s (excellent) explanation, AMD also has some oddness regarding cores: There are twice as many integer units as floating point units. So an eight core processor will perform like an eight core when doing integer tasks but only a four core when doing floating point tasks.
