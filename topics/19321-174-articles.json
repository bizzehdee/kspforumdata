On top of that, high AR has lower induced drag, thus better gilde ratio. Low AR has better high-AoA capability and less wave drag. That\u0027s why low-speed airplanes usually have high AR wings, while modern fighters have low-AR wings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T21:32:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyes, I know the benefits of high AR wings, I just misinterpreted the desription or wha FAR does.

Might it be possible to increase the normal stability of an aircraft which is neutrally stable in its normal configuration by using large flaps behind the centre of lift to move it back? This would certainly make flight easier without compromising on maneuverability. Additionally, could you use an airbrake under the rear of the fuselage to achieve something similar during approaches? I\u0027m thinking of an airbrake whose root is nearest the nose, which swings open to maybe 20-30 degrees maximum, generating some deflection lift as well as drag and moving the Cl back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DivisionByZero","CreatedById":62591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-24T06:13:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve added the start of a description of how I use the FAR windows in making craft.
