Otherwise, that Universe was decent. Besides from ethical objectors, the technology would certainly be rolled out to those who couldn\u0027t currently afford it (the middle class could), with government programs helping if it did not. From the point of view of that society, normal people are a drag on society, and costly, so even if ithat society was a unempathetic dystopia it would have reason to give the technology to all within a few generations. The Third World would be likely screwed, but they are now, and eventually they would be treated too. People in Gattaca cared so much about enhancement and were so biased about it charities would likely sprout up offering it to expectant Third World mothers.
