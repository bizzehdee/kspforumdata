I always end up with so much extra fuel. I have things like mech jeb 2 which is able on its is able to make these amazing hohman transfers and provides the best fuel efficiency, but I really want to learn how to calculate all this on my own in order to take myself to the next level. I was wondering if anyone could point me in the right direction to learning rocket science on my own, or if anyone could start a thread teaching the basics and then building out on that to help me and anyone else who has the same goal as me because I am confident other people probably feel this way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T05:22:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, what\u0027s your current Math/Physics background? \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Astrodynamics-Dover-Aeronautical-Engineering/dp/0486600610/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1367126130\u0026amp;sr=8-1\u0026amp;keywords=fundamentals\u002Bof\u002Bastrodynamics\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EIf you\u0027ve already taken Calculus, I recommend Fundamentals of Astrodynamics\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore generally, how familiar are you with the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Erocket equation\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKepler\u0027s laws?\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jason Patterson","CreatedById":44388,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T05:27:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESurprisingly, wikipedia is a fairly good place to start. Reading any of the articles about orbital mechnics, delta-v, hohmann transfers, bielliptic transfers, gravity drag, or orbital maneuvering can give you quite a bit of information about the mechanics of spaceflight and most (all?) of the articles include some of the math involved. The actual equations are a bit clunky, but not particularly difficult to use, given good information.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"purpletarget","CreatedById":57317,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T06:58:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave I got a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24623-Tutorial-Video-Krash-Test-Kerbals-How-to-science%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethread\u003C/a\u003E for you. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"elijah254","CreatedById":61797,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T09:28:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eits pretty easy, its not rocket science, oh wait\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Malaugrym","CreatedById":57689,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T16:15:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWatch purpletargets videos.
