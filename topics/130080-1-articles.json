Now instead of launching, intercepting, capturing, landing, collecting samples, taking off, and returning safely, you would stop after landing,\u00A0leave the craft there, and go launch a new copy of the same lander to land in the next biome. (More realistically, you would probably launch a fleet of 15 one after the other before the first one landed.) Without return trips, the re-entry heating mechanics\u00A0would become pretty much irrelevant, and we\u0027d miss out on the somewhat unique orbital mechanics of those return trips.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 hours ago, TheRag said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:.357143em 0px 0px;padding:0px;font-size:14px;line-height:1.42857em;\u0022\u003E\nA sun probe, would much more viable, as science instruments would drip in science rather than vacuum all the science in one orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere you have a point; IRL, the sun is a complex dynamic body with many facets like solar wind, solar flares, coronal mass ejections, etc. Real solar observatories exist to monitor these things and build up data about what the sun has done and is doing. It\u0027s not a constant rate of discovery, though; we learn things when the sun does something new or unexpected, or when we have a new question to ask of the old data. I think it\u0027s fair to say that KSP would be a richer experience if it had some kind of dynamic aspect to\u00A0its sun and instruments for monitoring it.
