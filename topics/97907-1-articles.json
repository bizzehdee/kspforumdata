Is there a better way to find a location on the ground/in the air to satisfy a contract? I think this question has been posed already on the forums, but I can\u0027t find the thread now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI spent four hours yesterday struggling to complete three Visual Survey/Ground Survey contracts on Kerbin. I built a simple plane so that I could fly over the locations, and a rover so that I could drive from one ground location to another, but I could never be sure where the destinations were. So I spent a lot of time flailing around, driving up and down hills, making racetrack flyovers until I stumbled upon the target areas. It took forever and it wasn\u0027t fun at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad really should implement some type of navigational arrow to point you in the direction of where \u0022X0923\u0022 or \u0022Manley\u0027s Demise\u0022 are rather than fiddling with the Map view, which gets blurry if you zoom in too much. Is there some workaround or mod? Something that displays your vehicle\u0027s coordinates and the coordinates of your target?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-26T20:32:51Z\u0022 title=\u002201/26/2015 08:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NASAHireMe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rosco P.
