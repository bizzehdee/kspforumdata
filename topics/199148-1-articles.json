I was browsing through the internet today and I remembered all about this forum. I decided to log in (succeeding after a few wrong trial-error attempts and a password change) and look through the subforums. I\u0027m amazed at how this forum is still alive and kicking after so many years. Scrolled through my posts from years back and man, the nostalgia was overwhelming. I was a kid who loved space, real nerdy type\u00A0with not a lot of friends back then, (still not quite an adult-adult yet) and I realized just how much time I spent in these forums. These were quite literally where I spent my adolescent years, posting and lurking here and playing KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith all this, I just wanted to say I\u0027m grateful this community exists. Thank you for all the memories and for fostering the passion for space in me that has shaped my dreams and who I am today. I am now a STEM senior student with a focus on engineering, and planning to take up aerospace engineering. Sadly, I don\u0027t think I have time to be active in these forums what with school and life going on but it was great to take a trip down memory lane. I\u0027ll be back when I have the time and when I hopefully become an aerospace engineer in the future\u00A0to post pictures of actual rockets I will be\u00A0working on without them crashing \u003Cs\u003Eon the first try\u003C/s\u003E.
