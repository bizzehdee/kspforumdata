Rockets are hard, yes, but the trouble is getting them to work reliably and safely, and most of complicated bits are in the internal workings of the motors themselves (which is abstracted in KSP); conceptually the whole package is little more than speed stuffed into a tube. On the other hand, airplanes are beholden to a whole bunch of complicated, non-intuitive, and occasionally contradictory aerodynamic effects, and are very sensitive to exactly how the vehicle is made and laid out. Many, many things that go into aircraft designs even today are simply because we know they work and changing them would be an unacceptable risk. With the exception of Northrop Grumman and Burt Rutan. They laugh at convention a little bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, airplanes are slaves to the aerodynamics of the regimes in which they operate, whereas rockets\u0027 answer to aerodynamics is brute force.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ForScience6686","CreatedById":144187,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-23T14:26:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222931078\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022155432\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221485125837\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022151713\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022fourfa\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, fourfa said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI bought a stick, and I found it\u00A0less convenient than the keyboard. \u00A0I do however spend a lot of time tweaking my planes so their \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E doesn\u0027t move as fuel burns out, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E is tight to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E but stalls gradually and stably, and my control surfaces are adjusted so it\u0027s hard to over-control. \u00A0When set up like this, everything flies wonderfully with keys.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd just guessing, but I think you meant \u0022you could even get by without rudder and use ailerons and pitch to turn\u0022 (this is my default flight mode),\u00A0and \u0022suggest starting on 2 axis, pitch and roll.\u0022 \u00A0With all the weird asymmetric lift forces KSP has, zero roll control will mean a lot of crashing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit - on second thought, if the plane is under ~5t, command pod torque alone is enough to fly with no control surfaces at all.
