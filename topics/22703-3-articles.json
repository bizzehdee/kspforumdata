So yeah, I will basically do the entire thing and show people how you can model something like the WT-51 in less than a day, hours even -all from a 24 sided cylinder and a cube. I don\u0027t mean I made 20 cylinders and went from there. The first, only cylinder was cut and extruded and subdivided from there - and it took its own shape. (an ugly one, but its meant to be more army looking)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kamsko","CreatedById":59669,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T10:53:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEpic new ship! These Wayland Corp ships have grown on me, as such the PX-2 and the Eagle have important roles in my space program. Got a modified PX-2 in orbit around the Mun waitting for the time to do a slingshot from Kerbin to Jool. I also have modified Eagles doing cargo hauling around the Mun to make my bases bigger. the goal being to have a large support base to make setting up these sling shots require less timing. This new transport is exactly what I needed to bring more Kerbals to the Mun all wily nilly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
