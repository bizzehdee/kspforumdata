Some  contracts, like investor tour, check if player has orbited Kerbol via Sun() function. However, in modified games stock Kerbol is the center of the universe and parent for all other stars, including new Kerbol. As such the contract requires the player to orbit the new Sun, which means leaving \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E of Kerbol. As a result affects difficulty of these contracts.\n\nA possible solution to the problem would be get a name for the homeworld parent and use it on contract requirements.
