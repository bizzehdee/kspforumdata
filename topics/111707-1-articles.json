At that point, stock heat mechanics shed the heat via radiative cooling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWild Blue radiators are calibrated to operate at approximately 85% of their maximum rated temperature of 2,400 degrees Kelvin, known as the working temperature. In accordance with the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%C3%83%C2%A2%C3%A2%E2%80%9A%C2%AC%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%C5%93Boltzmann_law\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EStefan-Boltzmann\u003C/a\u003E law, the hotter the radiator, the more heat it sheds; it pays to let the radiators glow. For safety reasons, should the radiator exceed its maximum working temperature, it will automatically stop transferring heat into the radiator, allowing it to cool down. As an emergency measure, you can switch to Open Cycle Cooling to dump Coolant in exchange for rapidly cooling the radiator. You can tell when a radiator is in Open Cycle Cooling Mode by watching for streams of coolant exiting the base of the unit (with the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Angel-125/DSEV/releases\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elatest update\u003C/a\u003E, of course).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome ship components, such as the WB8 Supernova fusion engine and all three of Wild Blue Industries\u0027 fusion reactors, generate significant amounts of heat and thus require the active cooling provided by the radiators. Determining how many radiators a ship requires is a bit of an art; it depends upon how many engines/reactors are running, and how long a typical burn lasts for your vessel. The Discovery II, for instance, with one Supernova and one WB-2, requires a dozen Graphene radiators to function properly under full thrust, and can sustain burns for up to 5 minutes with Closed Cycle cooling, sufficient for most transfer maneuvers. The current generation of FLM fuel tanks also require heat management, though newer models no longer need active refrigeration, and will be available in a future update. You can however, retrofit your tanks by simply removing the ModuleTargetTemp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe hope this brief introduction on Wild Blue Industries\u0027 Cooldown technology helps with you fulfill your vessel design requirements.
