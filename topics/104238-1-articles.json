I was trying to replicate the SpaceX barge landing and I made a platform which is more like an oil rig (4 pillars that go into the water), I flew it out to sea and set it in the water nice and slow. I went to the VAB to check something and then back to the platform. When the physics loaded the platform was transported 900 m underwater and went BOOM. \n\nDid anybody else had the same situation with loading vessels while in the water?\n\nThanks\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-17T06:06:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2015 06:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mighty1**"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T16:29:03Z","Content":"I\u0027ve never had or seen this issue, have you been able to replicate it?"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T16:30:58Z","Content":"Do you have Better Buoyancy?

Better Buoyancy doesn\u0027t seem to have anything to do with it: I don\u0027t have it installed! It either places the vessel immediately above the bottom of the ocean (where it can then gently float to the top) or clips the vessel into the bottom of the ocean (Boom!). \n\nI have no idea what\u0027s doing it, but my best guess is that if the vessel\u0027s center of gravity is below the water\u0027s surface, the game thinks that the vessel should be on the bottom of the ocean for some reason. (Again, though, this is just wild speculation.)\n\nI would recommend placing air intakes and other very buoyant parts on the vessel to make it float a little higher in the water. Maybe that will fix it.\n\nBest of luck on a barge landing!\n\n-Upsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T16:45:40Z","Content":"There is a random bug that sometimes leaves a vessel in the \u0022landed\u0022 state while on the water. It should be \u0022splashed.\u0022 Because of the landed state, the game places the craft on the ground (which is sub-marine).\n\nYou can edit the save to change the state, or try launching another barge.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Mighty1","CreatedById":95750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T19:21:22Z","Content":"Thanks, game is loading now. I can\u0027t find it in the persistent. There are too many \u0022untitled space crafts\u0022. The COM is above the water but I\u0027ll extended the pillars anyway. They are procedural parts structural part as I am trying to cut down on part count. I shall report on the progress.\n\nEDIT:\n\n\u0022#$%\u0026!\u0022!$ I\u0027m gonna have to land on the island or test the buoyancy of every large part.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-17T06:05:47Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2015 06:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mighty1**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mighty1","CreatedById":95750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T12:17:43Z","Content":"It appears that hollow modular girder segments made of steel are more buoyant than closed cylinders full of air.
