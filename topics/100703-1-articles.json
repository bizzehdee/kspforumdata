Now I\u0027m jealous.\n\u003E Welcome to the forums!\n\nYeah I was lucky enough to get into the world of EMI/EMC (electromagnetic interference/compliance) testing a few years ago. the new ESC contracted needed techs for the EMI lab, and an engineer I worked with previously was nice enough to recommend me after she got hired on. \n\nSo far other than the work environment its been kinda boring. I\u0027v only worked on 3 payloads in the year, the rest are just various sensors for ground systems, but since the lab also does RF monitoring for the site I get accesses to all the pads and the roof of the VAB because we have equipment we have to maintain up there. \n\nBut the view is nice, the video is of EFT-1 from outside my office building \n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/t6w-Un6vNn8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T21:40:23Z","Content":"Glad to have you aboard astrovall321!
