An object the size of Titan can hold onto gaseous nitrogen at 70 Kelvins (the middle of Nitrogen\u0027s liquid range) without problems. However, the planet would likely have nitrogen oceans in equilibrium with a mostly nitrogen atmosphere; most of the substances common enough to form planetary atmospheres freeze at a higher temperature than nitrogen boils. The main exceptions are hydrogen and helium. Assuming a density similar to Pluto, a planet about half Earth\u0027s mass will retain helium at 70 K, and a planet of Earth\u0027s mass or larger will retain hydrogen. However, there are two main obstacles to the formation of nitrogen oceans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Nitrogen isn\u0027t THAT common. All the nitrogen in Earth\u0027s atmosphere is only enough to form a layer about 10 meters deep if evenly distributed over the entire surface. Venus has several times more nitrogen than Earth, enough to form a 46 meter layer. By comparison, Earth\u0027s oceans would have a depth of 2500 meters if evenly distributed, and Venus\u0027s CO2 would form a 900 meter layer. As result, nitrogen will more likely form shallow lakes like Titan\u0027s than real oceans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Nitrogen has a narrow liquid range of 14 *C at Earth\u0027s atmospheric pressure, compared to 100 *C for water and 21 *C for methane. This means that small seasonal temperature swings can cause a planet\u0027s oceans to freeze or boil. This is made worse by the fact that planets could enough to have liquid nitrogen on their surfaces will also have very long years (about 60 years for a sunlike star), and shallow nitrogen lakes will have far, far less \u0022thermal inertia\u0022 than Earth\u0027s oceans. However, a thick hydrogen and/or helium atmosphere could stabilize the oceans; a pressure of 20 bars or higher will give nitrogen a liquid range over 50 *C.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lordmuffin","CreatedById":127240,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T22:30:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother question: What about atmospheres with crystals of asbestos, or some other crystalline thing?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T03:34:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lordmuffin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lordmuffin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnother question: What about atmospheres with crystals of asbestos, or some other crystalline thing?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFormation of asbestos requires hydration, so it would have to be a world with previously accessible water, at least underground.

However, their boiling points are too low for them to exist as liquids on planetary surfaces: even hydrogen is a supercritical fluid about about 30 K.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENitrogen, as I discussed previously, \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E form oceans, but they will be rare and mostly very shallow. However, because nitrogen is common, chemically inert, and relatively heavy, it will be a frequent component of the atmospheres of rocky or icy planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOxygen is too chemically reactive to be stable in an atmosphere or ocean over geologic time. It will ONLY be present in significant quantities if it is being released by biological processes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECarbon dioxide is likely to be a common component of the atmospheres of warmer oxygen-rich planets (above 200 Kelvins). It is fairly chemically stable and is the heaviest gas likely to be present in large quantities in atmospheres. Carbon dioxide can only exist in liquid form at very high pressures. The minimum is about 5 bars, but more than 20 is ideal. Nevertheless, it may still form oceans on moderately cool planets with thick atmospheres of other substances such as nitrogen and helium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWater is extremely common, and in oxygen-rich systems is a major component of planets formed outside the frost line. However, water vapor in a planet\u0027s upper atmosphere can be split apart by UV light, at which point the hydrogen will escape to space. This process caused Venus to lose its original oceans. However, on cooler planets like Earth water freezes out lower in the atmosphere, preventing this. In addition, some planets will form with such large amounts of water that even over billions of years losses from photodissociation will be negligible. Current searches for extrasolar planets suggest that hot \u0022ocean planets\u0022 with supercritical water oceans may be very common in the universe, such as Gliese 1214 b. Subsurface water oceans also seem to be very common on moons of cold gas giants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmmonia is rarer than water, and has a narrower liquid range. It is also even more susceptible to photodissociation. However, large amounts of ammonia may form on cold planets with excess hydrogen and nitrogen. Ammonia-rich atmospheres will probably be lost to photodissociation, but ammonia oceans may remain stable over geologic time, especially on planets orbiting K or M stars, which produce less UV light than the sun. In addition, some subsurface oceans on icy moons may actually be a mixture of water and ammonia, which remains liquid at temperatures where pure water would freeze.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMethane has a narrow liquid range of about 20 Kelvins, but it is confirmed to form Titan\u0027s lakes and seas. Methane also has the interesting property that when exposed to stellar radiation it forms more complex hydrocarbons. While it is vulnerable to photodissociation, on \u0022carbon planets\u0022 it may be so abundant that these losses are negligible. Depending on the environment, it may form lakes, oceans, or atmospheres at a variety of temperatures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor extremely hot planets, rock and metal may form oceans and atmospheres. Silicate rocks such as granite and basalt start to melt at around 1000 K, and rocky planets have been found with estimated peak surface temperatures double that. Such planets will be tidally locked to their stars, except in the rare and short-lived case of rocky planets orbiting slightly above the surfaces of post-main-sequence stars, and will have magma oceans on the light side.
