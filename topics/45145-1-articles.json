When I hit F3 it tells me the decoupler detached from the tank, but during my setup I\u0027ve strutted everything I can think of to keep the damn things attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have the decoupler attached to the central rocket and reinforced with struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I put the other tank onto the decoupler - I struck that tank to both the decoupler and the original tank. As I make my circle of rockets I\u0027m strutting each rocket to the one beside it also. So each rocket is strutted to surrounding rockets, strutted to the decoupler it\u0027s resting on, and then the decoupler itself is strutted to the rocket that it\u0027s attached to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny yet during takeoff these rockets are detaching and just taking off. Generally just 1 rocket detaches but I\u0027ve had a group of 3 detach also. I\u0027ve kept my speed below 2/3 and it doesn\u0027t seem to matter. Also tried above 2/3 and got a bit higher but still decoupled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure others have run into this - what\u0027s the best solution? For some context here these are all Mainsails and the goal is launching a huge fuel component into low Kerbin orbit so that I can attach it to what-will-be a refueling depot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an imgur album:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/POPSR\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/POPSR\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see the detached rocket in these pics - first one you can see the flame behind the main ship.

Personally I believe those tanks are as strutted as they can be. I\u0027ve only been playing for a few weeks, but I\u0027ve got the grey tanks strutted to orange, orange strutted to surrounding tanks as well as to the decoupler itself and even the main body of the craft. I doubt G\u0027s are a problem because, as you pointed out, I\u0027m still in the green and this beast is HEAVY. Frankly I\u0027m not certain I\u0027d get into orbit even I can prevent the orange tanks from splintering off, but I\u0027m trying to exhaust my efforts before I start removing fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Moar Boosters\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Moar Boosters\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/oy-boob8xtc?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Build big asparagus rockets using this technique and this won\u0027t happen.
