Of course this also means sometimes the system might be so stuck it just won\u0027t shut down. Then holding the button down for something like 5 seconds will force a power down, which can damage files as you say. It is still better than yanking the power cord or using the mechanical power switch that some machines have in the back, as that has been said to possibly even physically damage parts of the computer."},{"CreatedByName":"nekogod","CreatedById":103186,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T08:01:02Z","Content":"There is a surefire way to restart any windows PC.
