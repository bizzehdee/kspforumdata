The reason I ask is that I am running KSP on two computers, with different versions of Windows and I am experiencing this on both machines, which makes me think it might be a game problem rather than a computer problem, hence the question.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LaydeeDem","CreatedById":5984,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T23:40:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah I experience it as well.
