I want the size *and* fuel content to scale up by default. How can I do this?\n\nShort version: you can\u0027t. The TweakScale UI always starts at the size of the original part. DefaultScale is just a UI value that is used to display rescale factors in an intuitive way (\u0022Which scale should the UI use to describe the original part?\u0022). So if you set defaultScale to 3.5m, you should still get the original size in the editor. Just the TweakScale UI should show \u00223.5m\u0022. \n\nYou could do some hacks to get what you want, like setting defaultScale to 50% and the minimum allowed scale to 100%, but I don\u0027t think that is a good idea. Better to do what V8jester suggests, preferably with MM patches.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-07T22:26:34Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2015 10:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pellinor**"},{"CreatedByName":"pellinor","CreatedById":85299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T23:06:30Z","Content":"Update: [\\[.zip\\]](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/344/TweakScale%20-%20Rescale%20Everything!)\n\nv2.2.5\n\n\\* recompile for KSP 1.0.5\n\n\\* update MM\n\n\\* patches for the new parts\n\nI am still using the old KspApiExtensions, so far everything seems to work.
