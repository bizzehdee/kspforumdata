My vision was impossible without moving Eeloo like that. If you fix that, there\u0027s no reason for me to not eliminate the Kopernicus folder for config and texture placement. I personally use a file loader/unloader to move stuff in and out of GameData, so I haven\u0027t had to remove files from that folder manually. Other KSPers do, so if I don\u0027t have to use System.cfg anymore, I won\u0027t and I\u0027ll happily switch to a more modular setup that will allow people to easily mix and match other Kopernicus mods with mine.\u003Cp\u003EI think it also doesn\u0027t help that the Kopernicus forum OP hasn\u0027t changed in months and as such look out-dated. When I started my mod Kopernicus was all but dead or at the very least felt like a in-development version instead of a full package. As such it felt natural to bundle the plugin with my mod to reduce my mod\u0027s players from having to scavenge GitHub or the forum thread for the right version, etc. When Kopernicus has had some of its major bugs worked out and eliminates depending on other mods for PQS loading and such, I\u0027d suggest starting a new thread for that version. Then people can download the Kopernicus plugin from that and mods like mine will be like the modular configs for RSS, instead of every Kopernicus-based mod being an island like they are now. That thread would also be a good place to direct modders to tutorials and other information that will help them create planet mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, I probably should\u0027ve made an example for reparenting.

This will concern everyone trying to make realistically sized planetary systems, and is especially noticeable on gas giants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second one is about Kittopia\u0027s sphereOfinfluence parameter, it seems like this one does not get applied at game load; however it does get applied when loading manually from the ingame gui. This one is important for everyone striving to make asteroids and small bodies without neutron star densities, KSP\u0027s way of calculating SOI\u0027s offers no other ways around that in many instances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third one... you apparently resolved before I had the chance to report here, I fail to recreate it.

For example, trying to recreate Saturn with its ring inclination of approx 27 degrees means you need to lock the ring rotation, otherwise the rotation of the rings will wobble around with the rotation of the planet because of KSP\u0027s lack of an axial tilt system, which is, of course, unrealistic. However, while locking the ring rotation solves the problem of the silly looking ring wobble, it means that the rings are stuck at an arbitrary position that might not line up with the LAN angle of the planet\u0027s moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee the following screenshots for an explanation of the problem:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dpKggIs.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dpKggIs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ny7OScN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Ny7OScN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1kmFyzq.png\u0022 alt=\u00221kmFyzq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, an accurate representation of Uranus suffers from the same problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I suggest, is the ability to specify a specific Longitude of Ascending Node for the rings of a planet.
