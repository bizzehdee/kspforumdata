It doesn\u0027t help that I am computer illiterate. My question is I\u0027m buying a laptop. I\u0027m on a budget. I\u0027m looking at the acer aspire e5-573g. Will this run ksp? Is there a better direction to go? Budget is 700 U.S. I\u0027m pretty positive this has been answered here before but like I said, I have searched all day and I still have no clue and I am 20X\u0027s as frustrated. Any help would be great.
