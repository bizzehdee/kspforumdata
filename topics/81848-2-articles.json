And have you read the piloting guide linked in the first post of this thread?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you check the original release thread (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90344-Kerbodyne-Velociraptor-light-cargo-express-SSTO-for-Spaceplane-Plus-and-FAR\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90344-Kerbodyne-Velociraptor-light-cargo-express-SSTO-for-Spaceplane-Plus-and-FAR\u003C/a\u003E) you\u0027ll see that it worked for both me and GoldenPSP. The only handling flaw I found with it was a slight tendency for the nose to climb at high speeds and altitudes; this can be compensated for by either switching on the Vernors or just climbing less steeply to begin with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not arguing with your perceptions, but I would like to identify and hopefully solve the issue for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt won\u0027t climb vertically like the original model; the removal of the turbojets means that it has less than half of the air-breathing thrust. But as the original had more than twice as much as it needed, it should still work fine. Try climbing at 35-45 degrees until 10,000m, then pull it down to 15-25 degrees and keep it there until the apoapsis gets over 70,000m. Flick the Aerospikes and Vernors on (the Vernor starts toggled on, so all you need to do to activate them is turn on RCS) and close the intakes as soon as the RAPIERs switch modes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat exactly do you mean by \u0022fiddling with the throttle\u0022? You should be keeping this one at 100% the whole way up unless you\u0027re trying to squeeze the last bit of altitude out of the air breathing mode of the RAPIERs. The airframe shouldn\u0027t have any trouble so long as you keep if flying straight and try to get over 10,000m before you exceed Mach 2. Keep it smooth; set your pitch and level your wings and then don\u0027t touch the controls. It should climb smoothly unless you try to take it too high before building sufficient speed; small-winged streamlined planes like this need a bit of velocity to maintain lift once they get into the thin upper atmosphere; small wings let you go faster, but they also mean that you need to go faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat altitude were you at when you started having trouble, what speed were you doing at the time, and what pitch were you climbing at? Did you have the SAS on? You should with my designs, because I fly with it on and design the planes accordingly. And did you use any of the FAR flight assistance toggles?
