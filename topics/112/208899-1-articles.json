All of a sudden players have to care a lot more strictly about payload mass and relative gameplay advantages/ disadvantages vis-a-vis science discoveries and resource scouting, but only if there is an overarching set of time-based rewards. From a pure gameplay standpoint relativity simultaneously marginalizes those decisions and makes them needlessly complicated to assess. If anything the harder problem is what prevents players from putting kerbals in a big methalox rocket and time warping 100 or 500 years to another system. If its not a consumable LS resource I don\u2019t know what it would be. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-07-19T02:00:01Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2022 02:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
