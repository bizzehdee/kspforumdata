I\u0027m very interested in making some OpenSource hardware for this game that would be easily replicated for people with little to no experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HomingPigeon","CreatedById":193765,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-12T19:27:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like to propose the development teams and decision makers are able to take this one step further.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope KSP2 has a developer mode of sorts that would enable a local API with authenticated access to vehicle controls, vessel state, etc.\u00A0 \u00A0 KRPc mod allows you to build full fledged UI programs (inside and outside of the rendered in game UI) in several popular programming languages.\u00A0 For instance, I am able to build and implement python module running on a local RaspberryPi which controls in-game very long duration burns.\u00A0 Some of which are required for electric powered thrust.\u00A0 I activate my auto pilot which keeps the vessel on course, rotates for optimal solar dispersion and manages energy consumption.\u00A0 Others, like the streamer GiantWaffle created landing scripts that launched, orbited and landed rockets, all with just KSP, KRPc and python.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith one of the obvious usages of Kerbal Space Program being in STEM education.\u00A0 I can\u0027t imagine lower hanging fruit than to accompany a well thought out API with educational and corporate partners.\u00A0 I am available for a resource as to how I would construct this API what would be the possible interface, reception and control points.\u00A0 Otherwise, I look forward to coding my first rocket\u0027s docking procedures.\u00A0 ;-)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs others, I can\u0027t wait to explore the world of science and entertainment you are creating.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
