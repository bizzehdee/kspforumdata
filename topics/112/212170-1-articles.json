Pretty much everything is done better. But I have a couple issues:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe information being a lot more condensed is very good however, I have one issue, the velocity. The velocity is in the far far left of the screen and I find the need to look at the very edge of my monitor to know the craft\u0027s speed a little annoying. (The altitude meter isn\u0027t perfect either but it\u0027s not as far from the center of the screen, so it\u0027s less irritating)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe big yellow notifications, I find them very distracting and obstructing, I think the empty space at the very top of the screen could be used to place the game paused, unpaused, and the other types of yellow notifications (idk what else to call them) that appear\u00A0in center of the screen. Also the yellow is very out of place in the UI.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUI scaling, just like in KSP 1, I\u0027m hoping KSP 2 will have the option to scale the UI to the player\u0027s preference. If this already exists I apologise.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vl3d","CreatedById":219348,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-22T08:25:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone seen a mach meter and vertical / horizontal speed indicators?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-22T11:08:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVertical speed indicator is above the atmo indicator.
