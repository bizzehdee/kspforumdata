If this were implemented in-game, there could be a building for it, and the maps could update based on how much of the body in question the Kerbals have seen. Maybe you could set waypoints in the map interface, and select colony sites, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think both local and planetary-scale topography will be important considerations in KSP2. The ability to see Mercator and polar projections, examine distances between sites, and see other information like resource concentrations all in one place would be a boon. I would love it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbably not something we\u0027ll see at release, but the dev team might consider keeping it in mind for a future update. Maybe?
