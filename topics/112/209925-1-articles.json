Like if your setting up experiments far from the craft, the lights would turn off and not waste electricity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bajtec","CreatedById":222441,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-13T10:56:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is smart parts mod available for ksp1 with functionality you describe already.
