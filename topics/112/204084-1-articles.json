Even if it is another planet than Charr I would love a k1520b analog. Very challenging to explore, pretty much entirely due to heat, k1520b has less mass than the moon. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry, I probably should have put this in the discussion thread and not the suggestions one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-07-29T10:14:32Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2021 10:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Hyperspace Industries\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EWrong place in forum, too lazy to fix.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
