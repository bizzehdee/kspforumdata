Of course it would still take up data, but so does a video replay. For most people it would be something to review and delete to clear up their drive, and for content creators it would be a feature that creates a lot of possibilities for easier, more cinematic content that will bring people to the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dragorans","CreatedById":223402,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-22T01:52:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust yes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be great for making videos too\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-22T18:49:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts two ways to do this, one is to stream the video output to disk, the other to save that is happening in game, way less data but might not recreate stuff like explosions the same way.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"poopslayer78","CreatedById":212496,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-20T17:43:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224201148\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210721\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221669051661\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022219348\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vl3d\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 11/21/2022 at 11:27 AM, Vl3d said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my opinion a \u003Cstrong\u003Espectator mode \u003C/strong\u003E(needs multiplayer) would really \u003Cstrong\u003Ehelp newer players learn the game\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would indeed help with learning, but it may not be the best use of the KSP2 team\u0027s resources when there are easy ways to stream over programs like discord.\u00A0 Perhaps the effort should instead be focused on making KSP2 play nicely with external apps for streaming, video capture, voice chat, etc rather than implement these features itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI often play various games with one other person and we just share our screens and pull up the other person\u0027s stream on a second monitor, so I can confirm that this helps with learning, even when both of us are past the noob stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
