A lot of the time the stock Mk2 parts don\u2019t really have enough capacity in the cargo bays or fit the aesthetic that I\u2019m going for. They could also open up new opportunities for aircraft recreations.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd for people who say that I could just use Mk3 parts, a lot of the time they are just way to big, hard to work with and difficult to get off the ground.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese Mk2 parts IMO would make a nice alternative for when you don\u2019t want to engineer a giant shuttle but still need some space. To make sure that they aren\u2019t overpowered they would be heavier and less aerodynamic that the stock Mk2 parts. What do you think?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-19T18:16:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you draw an example, or explain in a bit more detail?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-19T18:46:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, 2.5m plane parts.
