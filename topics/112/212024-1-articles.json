Workspaces should be collections of craft/ (sub)assembly objects. This way you can edit a craft or assembly and when you save it all changes / improvements cascade in workspaces that contain said object. So you don\u0027t have to constantly switch workspaces to find the latest iteration of an object.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Also craft should be collections of stand-alone, labeled (sub) assemblies, each containing their own action groups and staging sequences.
