There\u0027s the Kerbals orbiting Kerbin, and the crashed ship on the Mun. In KSP 2, it might be cool to see some more variety/different screens, such as: the game opens with a ship (or station, or kerbal, etc.) orbiting Kerbin at sunrise, similar to that first shot of the KSP 2 trailer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Kerbin-from-Space-with-Emblem.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kerbin-from-Space-with-Emblem.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe twist, though, would be that as you get to and explore more planets and moons, the game remembers, and the menu screen has a chance to show another random body you\u0027ve visited (i.e. you go to the Mun for the first time, and now there\u0027s a 50/50 chance of the ship orbiting Kerbin or the Mun when the menu screen starts). But that\u0027s just my idea, what are your thoughts/suggestions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ahres","CreatedById":180308,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-15T00:38:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u2019d be so cool!

The simplest solution would be to just unlock them once and have them but I feel like having it follow the progress of your current game would be nice. \u00A0However, that adds a host of problems, like for example there is no indication of whether you have competed a play through or not, and then save switching, and sandbox\u2026 if anyone smart has answers to these questions, that would be great.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow to actually contribute something, I like the idea of having your own ships in the menu because once again, having ships that you are playing with allows you to see your technological development as well as which planets you have explored. I sure would love to see a torch drive cruiser when booting up the game. I don\u2019t know if there are any technical challenges to selecting and loading ships for the start menu, but perhaps an alternative to your own ships would be a list of ships at different tech levels. This would make the menu more consistent looking as the ships would all follow the same design principles and would not be too big/small to fit in shot.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darthgently","CreatedById":204885,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-15T19:44:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven that the loading screens prior to the menu screens take up a lot more time, I\u0027m happy just putting the pictures I want to see in the UserLoadingScreens directory.\u00A0 The menu screens aren\u0027t that big of a deal to me and I imagine the makers will keep that their own for more control over the image and branding of the game.\u00A0 That said, I could have sworn I saw a mod that would alter the menu screen images, so doable in KSP1 anyway (i think)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-10-15T19:48:45Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2021 07:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by darthgently\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brofessional","CreatedById":2080,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-21T04:37:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a nice idea as long as it doesn\u0027t impact the loading time.
