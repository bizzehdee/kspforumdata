Unfortunately, I have always had problems with drift with rovers especially when breaking, even on Kerbin, I can understand these problems on moons like Gilly which has very low gravity, but watching video of the Moon Rover traveling on a celestial body which has 1/6 of the Earth\u0027s gravity sprinting around and not drifting like on ksp. I was wondering, do you think that in ksp2 the system with which the wheels will interact with various terrain and gravity will be revisited?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhere some footage of the moon rover:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/az9nFrnCK60?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(PS. sorry for my bad english)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Catto","CreatedById":137773,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-14T17:10:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan\u0027t wait for somebody to build Initial D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jastrone","CreatedById":208489,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-15T09:07:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nrovers defenetly need an uptade from ksp1. both uses for them but also handling and stuff like this. maybe even building them\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
