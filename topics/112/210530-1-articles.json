A launch provider (user 1) could build X amount of those launch vehicles and sell them on an online marketplace to other users using in game currency and science. As the reputation of user 1 grows, they can then unlock the ability to be written into player in game contracts. Thus a player (user 2) would have to build a sat but launch it on user 1\u2019s rocket, splitting the contract by percentage. Basically commercial space but in multiplayer. Players could even submit private contracts for science earnings and money. This could be a great way to share ideas with rocket designs as well as mission design.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nexample of mission design share:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 User 1 creates contract for a geo sat network with\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3 satellites given specific part parameters. User 2 takes that contract and learns how to set up a good geo network using user 1\u2019s network design. User 1 has to pay for that but earns science and \u201Ccommunity\u201D credit kinda like karma for Reddit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jastrone","CreatedById":208489,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-09T15:14:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\na bit complicated and i dont think i would like to just build a rocket and then launch it but it could be fun to use another persons launch pad or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003Evab\u003C/abbr\u003E thats better for a small fee\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-09T15:32:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is interesting, and I do like the idea of sharing designs. I bet it will be more informal though. Probably more like players being allowed to share a satellite design, then letting another player put a series of them in geosync for them, swapping control, and then sending them resources or money if it exists on a handshake.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-11-09T15:33:12Z\u0022 title=\u002211/09/2022 03:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 9, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-10T03:40:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I would love to see this used as is a framework to codify challenges and missions.
