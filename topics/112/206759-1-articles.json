However, there are a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elot\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eof different things to consider, so full customizability might be in the realm of a mod.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPersonally, I would like to see a Capture the Flag game mode. Players would group into teams and would select a starting location, anywhere from a massive space center on a planet to a tiny space station in the middle of nowhere (starting with no tech nodes, so small colonies are hard to survive with). Teams would have to balance expansion of their space programs and stealth, as all the other teams can use telescopes (usually for discovering planets) to track vessels and stations to try to pin down the original base location. Landing a craft near a flag picks it up and once a player has gathered all flags in their home base they win. They can move the flags across their empire if they need to, or hide opponents\u0027 flags in small outposts instead of collecting them in one place.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jastrone","CreatedById":208489,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-05T10:17:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224086803\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206759\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221644025025\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022217583\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ember12\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, Ember12 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you can only play 1 hour a day and there\u0027s someone in your server who can play 4 hours a day, they\u0027ll be able to completely outdo you.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe thing is. multiplayer will have to fix timewarp. one way to do this is that one players actions take place later for another player and they have to timewarp to get there\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-05T10:37:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s less of an issue if servers are hosted locally.
