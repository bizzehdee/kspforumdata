For example if you upgrade a rocket you can project a ghost of the previous model which would be a transparent image of it and see which preformed better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"whatsEJstandfor","CreatedById":220814,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-31T16:05:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027d be really cool.
