Given transfer window timings a player could reasonably have a few major colonies up and running at Jool or Duna in 10-15 years in-game. Unless we\u2019re expected to deliver all kerbals from Kerbin, which would rather defeat the point of colony growth, you\u2019d essentially be playing with a handful of initial colonists and dozens of their useless offspring decades later. It just doesn\u2019t work in terms of gameplay. The nice thing is kerbals are cartoon green men and there\u2019s nothing to say what their life cycle is. From a pure gameplay position Id be fine if kerblings grew to adulthood in a few months even.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darthgently","CreatedById":204885,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-19T18:51:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224078984\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206489\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221642556361\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022216630\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Newgame space program\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 hours ago, Newgame space program said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen Kerbals have kids I do not want it to take 2 years for them to grow up, I want it to take the\u00A0appropriate amount of time for them to grow up, 18 years at the least.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know they are not humans however there is a reason that the bigger a creature is the more time it takes more time to grow up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook, having 2 year old workers is just wrong in my opinion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis post points out a major split in what kind of game KSP2 aspires to be in different peoples minds.\u00A0 Rocket engineering and orbital mechanics vs a resource management game.\u00A0 Of course there is a lot of overlap as the first could sort of be seen as subset of the second with regards to fuel and time, but anyone who has played games will know what I\u0027m talking about.\u00A0 I don\u0027t think KSP2 should put too much effort into turning it into high resolution resource management game, but colonies are a great plot twist so some resource management, ala Sim City, seems like a good thing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe a slider in the settings that allows a player to adjust how gritty the resource management is would be a good idea.\u00A0 At minimum you have basic \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E for fuel and at maximum you have babies, nurseries, life support, academies, cross-training, resource pipelines and rail systems connecting ground sites, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-01-19T18:52:23Z\u0022 title=\u002201/19/2022 06:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 19, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by darthgently\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
