So the general assumption is you will have to discover them to see any information on them. So basically it seems if there is any type if linear progress, it will have to do with the parts available, not so much the new star systems. But in a reply to a post, Nate did say he would love to see what people do with less than ideal technology. So technology progression may not be linear but, be based on what you research.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, answer not clear at the moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-02-09T15:46:55Z\u0022 title=\u002202/09/2022 03:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 9, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by shdwlrd\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-09T18:11:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224089248\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206829\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221644413904\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022206057\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PlutoISaPlanet\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, PlutoISaPlanet said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am very curious to see how KSP 2 will integrate the new systems.
