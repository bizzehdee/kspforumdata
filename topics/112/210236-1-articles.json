If we want the segments to come quicker we could all collectively agree to be silent on the forums and let bugs go unfound, but the order of segment release makes sense for iteratively finding the right bugs in the right order.

Finally, where will you put the resources if you don\u0027t have a colony to bring them too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nResource gathering will probably largely entail establishing logistics systems and automating resource collection. We might even see some resource gathering buildings in the colony phase, just they wont be active yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re not wrong, I get the thought process. But the devs will be introducing a completely unfamiliar system to us with the automated supply routes. Resource gathering, storage, and conversion is relatively straightforward. It\u0027s the automation of resource transfers that may not be intuitive to use. It may require different iterations to get it \u0022right\u0022. Of course, I may be over thinking it, but getting feedback for unfamiliar systems over a longer period of time will seem to get the best results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcwaffles2003","CreatedById":180102,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-24T22:49:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113880-shdwlrd/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022113880\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113880-shdwlrd/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@shdwlrd\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0That\u0027s all true, but I think they want early EA to focus hard on making sure base mechanics work before the stuff that stems from them. When people design colonies, I almost guarantee one will get kraken launched to escape velocity by danny2462 and I think that\u0027s a higher priority to nail down. Im hopeful the tutorial system will help guide us to a fair intuition of the automation systems and I think each stage will get a fair amount of attention . Colonies just seem like a more basic or core system while resource gathering is fluffy extension of that. And please don\u0027t get me wrong, there is a lot I am hopeful for in the resource gathering system. From resource discovery, to initial exploitation, to final automation. For instance, I am really hoping to see a SCANsat like system employed for resource discover with planetary highlighting and detailed maps being developed out of the orbital scans. I hope the system incorporates a plethora of steps like orbital data giving very broad data followed by rover prospecting to verify site resource concentration, this giving rise to some jackpot areas or flat out duds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat all said, I don\u0027t think improvements will necessarily stop at full release either though many basic mechanics will get hard set in their approach so I get the desire for time to iterate gathering and automation methods. I got good hopes though that they\u0027ve come up with good solutions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
