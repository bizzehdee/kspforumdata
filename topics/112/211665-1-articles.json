I always wanted to make an opportunity rover replica in ksp but unfortunately the soft body physics and bouncing/damage mitigation seemed to be something hard to mod into the first game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d absolutely love to see these added into the game. I\u0027ve truly always wanted to do a true to life mock up of the opportunity landing. Only of course, I\u0027d pick the wrong spot and watch my Rover go bouncing like a rubber ball down the biggest mountain on duna.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022airbags01.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022133.20\u0022 height=\u0022666\u0022 width=\u0022500\u0022 src=\u0022https://mars.nasa.gov/mer/technology/images/airbags01.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lowi_Sace","CreatedById":224820,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-23T12:06:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould be a very nice addition to the game\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nicholai_M","CreatedById":224432,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-24T23:01:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood Idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
