That being, of course, a 1.25m dual-kerbal cockpit for our aircraft! See the modded example below (airplane plus, i believe.) In the stock game, to get a similar effect we\u0027ve got to use a Mk1 inline cockpit behind a regular Mk1 cockpit, which just isn\u0027t the same. Basically, this part is integral to many aircraft designs, and it would make a great addition to KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S: I know the Mk2 inline cockpit exists, and it works great... on designs that use Mk2 pieces. It\u0027d be worth having a 1.25m part for this niche as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JLX2c6a.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 height=\u0022674\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JLX2c6a.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-23T01:56:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDidn\u0027t the orginal Mk1 cockpit look like this before it was replaced with the GA style Mk1 Cockpit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgree they should have added the new one to the game instead of replacing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-23T02:29:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224222811\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211620\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221674438968\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022118580\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mattinoz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n31 minutes ago, mattinoz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDidn\u0027t the orginal Mk1 cockpit look like this before it was replaced with the GA style Mk1 Cockpit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWdym?
