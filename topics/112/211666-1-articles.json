It is quite difficult to\u00A0secure the rover with a decoupler because they are designed for tanks not rovers. And there is problem with different heights of rover on lander and surface. To not to suffer making skycrane without ropes or add gyrodines to\u00A0to roll over rover in case of an unfortunate fall from the platform I suggest just to add ramps\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBecause width between wheels can be different, it is obvious to make ramps kinda procedural part. It also must secure rover before landing and this function can be resuable or not. Of course ramps must be folding, as for example on astrobotic griffin lander or another same type rover landers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vl3d","CreatedById":219348,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-23T14:58:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWasted so much time building ramps...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nazalassa","CreatedById":217956,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-29T13:12:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t build a ramp, just lithobrake.
