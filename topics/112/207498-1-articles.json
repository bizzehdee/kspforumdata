I\u0027ve hate having to add warts to my craft to get a specific function. I will just patch the parts out and add the functionality to the appropriate stock parts. Did I mention I hate ship warts? Just make it so when you build the craft you can add the functions you want before launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow if you want to add a control center to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E or colony, I\u0027m down for that. It makes sense to have one centralized building for that function. But don\u0027t make me build a new building for each function if the buildings are equivalent to 10 story office buildings. You can host several businesses in that type of space. So at that point, it becomes a waste of materials to add functionality in that manner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow with that out of the way. I like to have the ability to add one centralized building to control all your logistics, production, gathering, and crew/colonists. Something like that would be very useful once you have several colonies operational and have your transfer routes established. You wouldn\u0027t have to play \u0022where is he?\u0022 or \u0022who\u0027s doing what?\u0022 game. It would get very tedious bouncing around to figure out what\u0027s going on in the background, and making adjustments to your production and gathering\u00A0 individually. It would make sense to be able to make global adjustments that effect all your colonies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis should be available once you establish your first colony, but the true sense of the power of this shouldn\u0027t be realized until you have a few colonies operational. The cost shouldn\u0027t be more than a standard habitation building to construct. The cost would be with the required manpower to efficiently run the operation. Maybe 5-20 workers per section depending on what function they need to control. (You don\u0027t really need many Kerbals for production control, but for HR (Kerbal Resources?) that can vary with the total number of colonists you have.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vl3d","CreatedById":219348,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-02T06:30:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224110317\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207498\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221648862536\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022113880\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shdwlrd\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, shdwlrd said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhate having to add warts to my craft to get a specific function\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree with you, this is why I suggested having just a Command \u0026amp; Control Core that can get added to pods or probe cores.

I was mentioning cheating to demonstrate an example of how players who don\u2019t want to deal with systems can circumvent them, like I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t want to deal with software and some people won\u2019t want to deal with balancing supply routes. The important part that I probably didn\u2019t convey properly is that the game is still playable without those systems. Each pod has a limited supply of electricity which should be enough for basic operations, and you can simply set up colonies that produce most of what they need to make supply routes simple, between two colonies at most. Each pod coming with a default configuration works to make the game playable without fiddling with that gameplay. For example, I\u2019m not sure if you ever tried this, but in KSP 1, you can set fuel flow priorities to make fuel flow from certain tanks first. That opens up a new design aspect, but if you never choose to change the priorities, the default fuel flow will be fine in nearly all applications. There\u2019s lots of examples like this, from mono propellant to heat, where you technically don\u2019t need to install mono prop tanks, EVA thrusters or radiators if you don\u2019t want to because pods have those and heat dissipates automatically.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess what I\u2019m asking for is an explanation of how this is objectively different from the other complex systems that fit into stock already.
