It would be very nice if we had the ability to harness the benefits of such massive projects in KSP2. Here are some of my ideas for which megastructures could fit into the scope of KSP2, partly sourced from wikipedia page for megastructures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nOrbital elevators and fountains. And A Speedy Track That Apparently Doesn\u0027t Have A Non-Proprietary Name\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThese three are the smallest, yet potentially allowing for the largest leap among all megastructures. They all allow for sending objects to space with little to no need for any additional fuel, thus eliminating almost all cost of bringing resources \u0022halfway to anywhere\u0022 and letting the spacecraft budget go to crafts that actually stay in space and ferry resources away from arbitrarily large momentum sources. I am not sure how they could be customized, but having them availble as colony buildings would make launch vehicles obsolete for specific orbits, but that could be combated by giving players incentives to keep launch capability on other orbits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nSmall mega habitats\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nGigantic colonies, spinning in one way or another. Halos, cyllinders, or more exotic shapes. These could litter the skies of interstellar shipyards and house the engineers who work on yarding all those ships. Due to economy of scale they could house them more economically than smaller colonies, and due to being in space getting to any object on a similar orbit uses barely any energy, in the end possibly allowing players to daisy chain orbital facilities with very fuel-light shuttles ferrying everything between the residential habs, industrial habs, recreation habs etc. to pump out ridiculous numbers of finished products.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nEnergy solutions\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nA dyson swarm. Being able to set a bunch of shipyards to build a specified design on repeat and send it off to a low orbit of the closest star, with parts allowing for wireless transfer of the energy by the means of a weak laser to a power socket sattelite/colony that forwards the energy as a strong laser beam to a distribution station that splits it back into small beams powering the shipyards and expansion projects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nWorld eater swarms\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nOre is great. But you know what\u0027s better? More ore! Being allowed to coordinate asteroid mining drones to graze as a herd would streamline the transport of the ore to places where it\u0027s to be used. And maybe, if planets had limited resources, a mode of operation where a swarm of mining drones sucks out all the juicy ore out of the rock and stone of the planet \u003Cstrike\u003Elike a true dwarf would\u003C/strike\u003E\u00A0would be simply delightfully terrifiyng to the unwitting other players who had not yet reached that system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last few options would require automated operation of vessels, from launch to deployment. From what I recall routine missions are to be automatable, but all that separates a routine mission from a non routine one is frequency so it\u0027s kinda hard to tell wether deployment of world eaters is planned as routine, but I hope it is. Anyways, this all seems to crystallize into one idea - managing a large number of vessels at once. That would be a cherry on top of whatever else is in the KSP2 cake.

Going from them to the smallest of megastructures isn\u0027t that much of a stretch, especially when looking at the colony at the end. Also, each megastructure could be represented by a simple possibility. Like the dyson swarm I described - just the means to automatically direct a vessel to a specific orbit, produce the vessel on repeat and send power wirelessly\u00A0 None of these sound like something impossible to accomplish for beggining stellar colonialists. Very similar situation with the grazing world eaters (in the asteroid mode) - automatically gather resources, prioritise the resources closer to herd\u0027s center, deposit resources and get fuel from some service storage ship, take resources from a service storage ship, refuel it and deposit resources at a processing plant and refuel yourself. These all sound like simple bits of automatisation we could play around with to accomplish our goals in KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rutabaga22","CreatedById":221143,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-04T00:40:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224151309\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208828\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221656886507\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022219098\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KarolOfGutovo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, KarolOfGutovo said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe colonies and interstellar ships shown in the trailer are quite massive.

These colonies don\u0027t have the resources or infrastructures to build megastructures. Again, I believe that megastructures do not fit the near future theme of KSP 2, large projects like that wouldn\u0027t be done when you are colonizing a system, I get you can build large colonies, but that\u0027s nowhere near a dyson swarm or Grey goo.
