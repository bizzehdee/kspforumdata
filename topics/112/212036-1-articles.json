As you get closer to the sun, solar panels become more effective. With the high isp of fusion drives, and nuclear reactors versatility, theres a chance that electric space tugs will be completely made unviable towards the end of the game which would be a shame. Solar electric propulsion spacecraft are highly interesting to design due to the high area needed. Two parts I believe could make solar electric propulsion viable for even late game cargo ships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst the propulsion. We need a very high isp drive. that also doesn\u0027t displace plasma thrusters or dawn engines. There\u0027s two electric propulsion designs that can get this very high isp needed to justify these space tugs.\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003EMagnetoplasmadynamic thruster have isps up to 100k, and has terrible electrical efficiency. These engines may be too good for ksp2 if we wish fo rthe engines to be balanced however, this type of engines have relatively very high thrust, which could easily displace the plasma thrusters gimmick. I think there\u0027s a better candidate\u00A0for our very high isp electric drive however. Pulsed plasmoid drives create a torus of ball lightning and then shoot them down its nozzle. These also get isps to 100k and don\u0027t\u00A0necessarily\u00A0have as high of thrust compared to MPD drives. For in game stats, these would be essentially\u00A0souped up dawn engines, similar thrusts, but way higher isps in the ballpark of the 50k range, their main downside would be there terrible electrical efficiency, making these things powerhogs.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ENow we need a late game source of power, this one is simple. There are many designs for solar panels that are incredibly light weight, there\u0027s one main downside though, these tend to be incredibly flimsy, meaning that you would have to construct these in space. Procedural solar panels would be the clear solution here, these would have incredible energy to weight ratios, but with two main downsides. These things would have lower kw/m^3 ratio compared to standard solar panels, meaning that you need much higher volume. The main downside though is these things would disintegrate in atmosphere/with high thrusts. This would practically necessitate\u00A0orbital construction, making you need very large arrays of solar panels.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SolarAdmiral","CreatedById":107350,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-15T06:09:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224232375\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022212036\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221676437749\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022222150\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Strawberry\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n55 minutes ago, Strawberry said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EMagnetoplasmadynamic thruster have isps up to 100k, and has terrible electrical efficiency.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI expect the plasma engines we\u0027re getting will either be MPDs or Vasmir (Also magnetoplasma).
