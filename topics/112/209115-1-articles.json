It was small, I didn\u0027t like the building placement, etc. I feel that Ksp 2 should have a way to alter the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Not like kerbal Konstructs, that didn\u0027t have the greatest UI and a butt load of other problems. I\u0027m thinking of making it something you find out about very early. It would be the exact same system as building a colony, but you would have access to more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKsc\u003C/abbr\u003E alike parts, the ability to move \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003Eksc\u003C/abbr\u003E buildings, and the ability to terraform the ground around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKsc\u003C/abbr\u003E. We have seen the ground around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003Eksc\u003C/abbr\u003E in trailers is dug out into artificial islands, so terraforming the ground around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E doesn\u0027t seem improbable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pgabrielmnecraft","CreatedById":222096,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-26T00:01:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think there will already be a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003Eksc\u003C/abbr\u003E in ksp 2 greater than in ksp1, you can even see it in some youtube videos, such as the demonstration of the new ksp2 clouds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-26T01:01:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe terrain deformation (while awesome) is not currently being slated for initial release.
