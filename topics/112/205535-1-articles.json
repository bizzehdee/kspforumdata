Al Worden from Apollo 15 has said the sky was \u0027awash with stars\u0027 in the view from the far side of the Moon that was not in daylight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, from\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://briankoberlein.com/blog/can-astronauts-see-stars/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eanother\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0article: \u0022The origin of this misconception is usually traced back to an interview with the crew of Apollo 11, where (it is claimed) Neil Armstrong said he couldn\u2019t see stars in space.\u0022 But, \u0022Even in space, the stars aren\u2019t overly bright, and our eyes can lose dark adaption pretty quickly.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo why did Neil say he couldn\u0027t see stars when on the Moon? It\u0027s because he was looking at the bright surface of the Moon just seconds before, in sunlight stronger than that on a clear noon on Earth. He\u0027d lost his dark adaptation. It can take thirty minutes to get full dark adaptation, but only seconds of bright light to destroy it. Even at night on Earth, with no bright objects in the sky, I can step out of a well lit room onto my very dark porch, and not be able to see a single star.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re dealing with two separate effects here, one with cameras, and the other with the human eye. I think this is the source of the confusion. Cameras wash out stars when A) their exposure isn\u0027t calculated to capture them, or B) when their optics aren\u0027t able to because of design choices. The human eye cannot distinguish them when it has A) lost dark adaptation because of bright light, or B) they\u0027re actively looking at something bright.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, should these effects play into KSP2? Well, is the viewpoint we see the stars from intended to be an in-game camera or human eye? Probably neither. So these effects shouldn\u0027t really occur. If it\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0supposed to be a camera, the devs should probably include other camera artifacts like lens flare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd anyways, if it\u0027s simple to implement (and I already knew it was, thanks) then it will be an easy mod to make.

Al Worden from Apollo 15 has said the sky was \u0027awash with stars\u0027 in the view from the far side of the Moon that was not in daylight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, from\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://briankoberlein.com/blog/can-astronauts-see-stars/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eanother\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0article: \u0022The origin of this misconception is usually traced back to an interview with the crew of Apollo 11, where (it is claimed) Neil Armstrong said he couldn\u2019t see stars in space.\u0022 But, \u0022Even in space, the stars aren\u2019t overly bright, and our eyes can lose dark adaption pretty quickly.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo why did Neil say he couldn\u0027t see stars when on the Moon? It\u0027s because he was looking at the bright surface of the Moon just seconds before, in sunlight stronger than that on a clear noon on Earth. He\u0027d lost his dark adaptation. It can take thirty minutes to get full dark adaptation, but only seconds of bright light to destroy it. Even at night on Earth, with no bright objects in the sky, I can step out of a well lit room onto my very dark porch, and not be able to see a single star.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re dealing with two separate effects here, one with cameras, and the other with the human eye. I think this is the source of the confusion. Cameras wash out stars when A) their exposure isn\u0027t calculated to capture them, or B) when their optics aren\u0027t able to because of design choices. The human eye cannot distinguish them when it has A) lost dark adaptation because of bright light, or B) they\u0027re actively looking at something bright.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, should these effects play into KSP2? Well, is the viewpoint we see the stars from intended to be an in-game camera or human eye? Probably neither. So these effects shouldn\u0027t really occur.
