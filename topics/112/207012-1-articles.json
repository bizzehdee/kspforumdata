Decoding signals and reading the information would reveal the location of a hidden planet for beyond Eeloo. On that planet there would be ruins of an ancient civilization that may have created the Kerbals. (This is all I remember some of it may be wrong.) In one of the KSP 2 feature videos we see a tutorial animation with a scientist looking at a map of the Kerbol system, and there is a drawing of a planet that could possibly exist beyond Eeloo.
