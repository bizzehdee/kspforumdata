Each part should contain its own page\u00A0\u00A0with details to its specifications and perhaps a bit of lore (company that built it, silly facts about it, the stuff in the tool tips, etc). Each biome should also have a bit of data about it as well as the celestial bodies as a whole. This could be done via having the whole wiki written out and each facet of it (whole pages and sections of each page) hidden until a condition is met, where the data then appears as if it were added in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nI feel this kind of in game reference would serve both as being useful and fulfilling to fill out. We wouldn\u0027t need to go to the internet to find things like the height/characteristics of an atmosphere for a planetary body since we could just send a probe to it with a barometer/thermometer and let it fall through the atmosphere while relaying the data back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Upon data transmission we could look into the wiki and have something like the following graph appear:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Kerbin_Atmosphere_T\u0026amp;P.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022108.27\u0022 height=\u0022720\u0022 width=\u0022665\u0022 src=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/a/ae/Kerbin_Atmosphere_T\u0026amp;P.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nNow I dont know how many of you have played with kerbalism since its 3.0 update came out where science is done in a continuous and gradual manner as opposed to the one click and its done way but I personally like it. I think this should be possible if the base game is going to have continuous monitoring of background resources anyway (I believe thrusting while warping/not focused was confirmed, correct me if I\u0027m wrong) . This might be over reaching but I believe implementing a similar system of continuous data collection could be fun, challenging, and would allow for sensible impartial data completion. For instance, the graph above could partially fill out for the atmosphere heights where data was collected/transmitted. If you sent a probe to Eve and it burns up at 75 km down, you would only see the 75 km - 90 km portion of the atmosphere and the rest could remain blank.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nAnother example, maybe once a gravity scan is done we could see something like a diagram of the boundaries of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E of the scanned body with the altitude of things like\u00A0stationary orbits placed in tables\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nParts, like engines that have been researched, could have wiki pages with\u00A0a table of ISPs and thrusts for each acceptable fuel type or a list of compatible nozzles (if KSP 2 goes full KSPIE)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nI feel this kind of dynamic info source could bring a new type of life to the game. A more earnest adventure of discovery. And maybe when every entry is filled out we can say that\u0027s when the game is finally \u0022beaten\u0022 and all the accomplishments have been fulfilled or something. Ultimately creating a form of goal in a career mode (beyond filling out the tech tree), something to constantly strive for, where a form progress is traceable,\u00A0tangible, and applicable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nI\u0027m not a great\u00A0programmer, but personally this doesn\u0027t seem like it would be THAT hard of a task to create and would bring a lot to the game. It would give players a \u0022direction\u0022 without being a guiding hand, it would give us reference to know whats going on without giving spoilers to things we haven\u0027t attempted yet, and it would make science finally feel like we\u0027re doing something more than just filling out a dumb tech tree that when it is completed then science loses its entire appeal and becomes unnecessary weight to any future craft...

Though I will say, having to do so does create some more challenge to building a rocket and having to do so has changed the way I build. For instance thermometer/barometer\u00A0need to go through the whole range of altitudes for full science points, whereas mystery goo or surface samples could still be an instant collection. I just think adding some more intuition building into the process could be more involving and fun.

I just would really like to see science fulfill a more discovering role than that of a chore to get the next tech node. It will still have that purpose, but after the tree is filled it means there will be a purely fun aspect of science. If you bring it along to help gather data it can help your approach to a planet or help you discover some nuances to the kerbol world (non-story based lore). Perhaps on approaching a planet and doing a surface sample of it and its moon it could be revealed that they are made of similar content and\u00A0 at one time a collision cause a piece of the planet to break off forming the moon, similar to our story on earth so far. It would make it feel like we\u0027re having a more active and immersive\u00A0role in the universe to me. And if none of this interests the player then they don\u0027t need to bring science, they can still build and fly, just the details of the worlds they explore will remain somewhat hidden.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-17T14:18:55Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2020 02:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by mcwaffles2003\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-17T19:33:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree that there needs to be a reason to do all the science outside of just unlocking a tech tree.
