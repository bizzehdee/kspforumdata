So basically Jools rings would be modelled after this, they would be very sparse and the biggest particle would be maybe 10 m. So going in Jools rings will just look like floating through an disc of dust with a few tiny rocks floating in the distance\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laxez","CreatedById":216956,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-03T12:20:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the idea of having asteroids of different types, shapes and compositions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for putting rings around Jool, I would like to point out that already a planet in the first chapter of KSP has an asteroid rings, I am referring to Dres, which although few, has many asteroids orbiting around it, it is possible that this feature will be inserted in KSP 2, but I\u0027m not sure, given the Dres rework shown in some videos.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally I think that the Kerbol system is more of a tutorial system and that some features such as rings or asteroid belts are preferable in another system, we already know that Glumo, Gurdama and Ovin have rings. Feature that the developers seem to like a lot ahah.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy guess is that these planets are not all part of the same system, but rather that there is more than one planetary system, but I could also be wrong. We ourselves inhabit a system with 9 planets of which 4 with rings (it is even assumed that Rhea, Saturn\u0027s moon, has its own ring system), so my only guess is i hope there are more than two planetary systems in the game, that\u0027s all haha.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurthermore it must be considered that the asteroids of the rings are really small if not made of dust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe also already know some celestial bodies with particular shapes such as Skut, which can be a moon with a very unstable orbit or an asteroid with an orbit like Halley\u0027s comet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any case, yes, I would like to see something special for asteroids in general as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
