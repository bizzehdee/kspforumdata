That fits perfectly with kerbin having a 426 day year, giving a year with 71 6-day weeks\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA full Minmus orbit is ~50 days. If you divide that by the year that\u0027s a bit rough, resulting in 8\u00BD months, but if you round it down to 48 days that results in 8 6-week months and a final 5-week month\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you have a system that\u0027s convenient and makes perfect sense that kerbals would use, such that \u00271y 285d\u0027 could be expressed by \u00271Y 5M 7W 3D\u0027,\u00A0\u00271Y 5M 45D\u0027, or\u00A0\u00271Y 47W 3D\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-10T14:59:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMonths were based on lunar cycle, doesn\u0027t mean they should. Currently, months and weeks are artificial. The only thing that is certain is a year. And I\u0027m not sure why would I need to know which month it is. Missions last either days or years, saying that my probe is in flight for 6 months, 2 weeks and 4 days would make it even more confusing. It\u0027s not needed in space. Heck, martian rovers count their time in Sols, because the time between two sunrises is different than on Earth. What would they base their month on? Phobos? Deimos? Then, a mission that is going for 217 days?

Based on position of the planet in space. But weeks and months? For interplanetary, and soon, interstellar species, with no 5-day work schedule or harvesting season? What\u0027s the benefit? It just adds confusion. And again, how important it is to know which day of the week it is on Eeloo? Take a look how different civilizations had different calendars. Some had shorter or longer weeks, some based their year on the Moon. What we have now, works for us, yet it\u0027s still not perfect (most months have 31 days, not 30, one has 28 OR 29.
