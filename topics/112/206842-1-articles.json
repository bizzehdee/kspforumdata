You might need to launch multiple missions at different times of day/year (depending on where your destination is) to ensure a steady supply of resources.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving a bunch of automated ships flying around also seems like it could seriously increase lag, but I don\u0027t know a lot\u00A0about coding, so it\u0027s possible this isn\u0027t the case (or that the devs have a solution in mind).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vl3d","CreatedById":219348,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-23T18:32:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n100% I would prefer seeing ships and space traffic. And of course they should have the same flight plan that you had when you first did the mission - if you want something faster or better you do the flight again improving the ship and course (and now you would probably have 2 ships doing transports). But I think it\u0027s important to automate transports not just for rockets, but any type of vehicle we design. I would not worry about lag except if you crash into that automated transport. Other than that it could be on rails with only the external image rendered. Other games solve the issue by making objects non-interactive (you fly through them).
