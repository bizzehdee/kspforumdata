In Oxygen Not Included, the background animations in the menu are real messed up, but the actual game runs totally fine. In the Spider-Man remaster on Steam, there was a bug where some 2D visual elements overlapped each other but those two examples are about the only ones I can think of at the moment. My understanding was that most engines just kinda work with whatever goofy resolutions you give it (albeit with occasional bugs), but I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s wrong. So I had been assuming that, even if KSP 2 doesn\u0027t explicitly support 32:9, I\u0027ll just force it into that resolution and it\u0027d mostly be OK.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
