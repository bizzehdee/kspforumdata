It\u0027s often hard to tell apart the islands of Laythe or craters on Tylo; one region is the same as the next. Having consistent names for all these places would also give the community a sense of continuity when they share stories of where they\u0027ve been or what they discovered. Having proper names for landforms is a lot more convenient than having to refer to \u0022the big island\u0022 or \u0022that little archipelago west of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, you know, the wiggly one\u0022.\u00A0 The major landforms would be custom named by the developers, while smaller ones could use a random name generator like KSP1\u0027s waypoint naming system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AtomicTech","CreatedById":210823,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-20T17:59:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would be helpful, especially for hunting for that one spot for the colony!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-20T18:01:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot a bad idea, it would help with passing the general locations along to other players.

A renaming function would fix this, but even if there wasn\u0027t one, I think the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. In almost ten years of head canon, almost no fan consensus has emerged about what to call specific places, aside from the canon biome names. The one exception may be the mohole, which was canonized in response to fan consensus. So I don\u0027t think people will mind if the landforms are named in advance by the devs. It also gives the devs another creative channel, as it\u0027s an easy way to world-build, and many of the labels could be humorous, based on easter eggs or in-jokes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n____\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a bit of a tangent, but landform names being revealed as players discover them would tie into the exploration system. My hope is that planets and moons won\u0027t be detailed at the start, and will only become visually interesting when players actually reach them. Exoplanets and exomoons initially won\u0027t be visible in the map at all, and once discovered would only present as indistinct spheres. Direct telescopic observation from Kerbin (or within the same system, for exoplanets) would reveal rough shapes and colors. Only when a player gets up close will the landforms of the planet appear, at which point they would be given names. From there, the player can do more detailed scans to find biome boundaries, resource deposits, and anomalies.
