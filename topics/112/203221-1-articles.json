But if you just take raw prismatic constraint, it\u0027s going to cause problems when you\u0027re hitting transition from one rail section to another. You know how kerbals some times freak out when they transfer between ladder sections? Imagine that, but at high speed, and now instead of a single kerbal, you have an entire craft with all its physics riding on the rail. Yeah.\u00A0 Krakens galore. So you have to handle that somehow, and Unity/PhysX doesn\u0027t really provide you with a native way to do that, so you\u0027d have to write your own sub-system for it.

Part of my last job was evaluating Unreal physics for \u003Cem\u003Ea project\u003C/em\u003E. Obviously, the olden PhysX setup is almost as bad as Unity\u0027s, but they managed to screw up Chaos as well. Seriously, Roblox engine has better physics than what Epic managed to get into U4/5. To be fair, they are still working on it, and it might still improve to the point where it\u0027s fully competitive with custom solutions, but it wasn\u0027t there last time I saw it, which was recently. And yeah, I have discussed it with Epic\u0027s engineers. I don\u0027t think they like me much anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, modern Unity does support Havok, which is the best of the bunch. It used to be a step above PhysX, but they have put in a lot of improvements recently. I have reasons to believe a lot of that was inspired by the work of Box2D\u0027s author, who is actually a go-to resource on modern game physics implementations. As far as I can tell, Epic is trying to do the same thing with Chaos, but Havok had an earlier start and did a better job. So as far as what you can get as middleware, that\u0027s your best option in my professional opinion. Unfortunately, unless there have been some major reworks, KSP2 is probably still going to be on PhysX, so we\u0027re probably not benefiting from that at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of that aside, implementing a good rail system for a modular game like KSP would suck on all of these. Havok would suck the least and Chaos would suck less than PhysX, but none of these solve all your problems out of the box. You would still have to write some clever custom systems to make it work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-25T07:57:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223993996\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022203221\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221624534927\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002268648\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Master39\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 hours ago, Master39 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think in the podcast they mentioned something like that\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, now you mention it, I seem to recall that too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-25T12:28:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223994734\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022203221\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221624593630\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou would still have to write some clever custom systems to make it work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs someone else said once, game engines are like toolboxes and it\u0027s up to the devs to make it work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-25T18:10:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223994890\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022203221\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221624624113\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182413\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bej Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Bej Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs someone else said once, game engines are like toolboxes and it\u0027s up to the devs to make it work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanguages and frameworks are your tools.

Unity falls somewhere in between. It\u0027s pretty flexible,\u00A0but it can still be hard to build something if you don\u0027t have the right parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have access to solver and can create custom joints, making good rail system is pretty straight forward. In Unity, I don\u0027t think I\u0027d be able to make necessary changes to the constraints themselves. Instead, I would probably do something similar to how you\u0027d set up a vehicle. You still rely on the engine for managing traction forces from contact points and use them to create hard kick if the suspension bottoms out, but you compute the suspension forces by doing ray casts to figure out wheel displacement. That sort of hybrid approach of relying on engine\u0027s physics and custom forces tends to work out pretty well. Unless you\u0027re making a high quality racing sim, at which point, you just don\u0027t make it in Unity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would probably end up using similar approach to do rails. First assign collision materials to rail part and train carriage part so that they don\u0027t actually collide with each other. Other parts you use to build a train could still collide with rails, of course, but that\u0027s on player to build around that. Next, ignore the actual geometry of the rail and simply use the rails to generate a smooth spline to follow. Finally, generate forces on train carriage to follow the spine. This is where custom solver comes in. Ideally, you want a single solver so that all your forces are up to date, but with a custom solver at this stage, you\u0027re only one frame behind, so the only way this is likely to go horribly wrong is if the train already collided with something, generating a huge force spike, at which point it\u0027s probably ok to just derail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-25T18:51:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoesn\u0027t this have a lot to do with the geometry of the end of the rail sections? For instance, if they\u0027re built like IRL railway expansion joints but with the tapered edges also sloped away from the direction of incoming vertical load, would that not make the solvers job much easier since there\u0027s no \u0022hard right angle\u0022 lip between rails that aren\u0027t perfectly aligned?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr if you\u0027re using rails that are round, just have the ends of the rails taper at a relatively gradual slope to a smaller diameter, and then when building those two tapered sections overlap. Surely the solver wouldn\u0027t come up with a wacky solution for that situation, provided that the rails don\u0027t also have \u0022same vessel collision\u0022 turned on for both of them. I guess you\u0027d need two \u0022channels\u0022 for SVC in that case, one to handle the rails NOT colliding with each other, and one to handle the rails FOR SURE colliding with whatever carriage is riding on the rails.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe 2 channels for SVC would be handled similarly to how a little 2d physics simulator program called Phun has multiple \u0022channels\u0022 for collisions, including one for particle-based fluids.
