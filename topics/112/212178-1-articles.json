Another interesting colour addition can be an advanced color option, wich enables the possibility to choose every color singularly, for exaple, you could color the bottom of a spaceplane black and the upper side white and blue, for an old-style aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTalking about technical additions, I think that there are a bunch of useful additions and changes: for example you could make it that, when you save something, it adds a \u0022version\u0022 of it, the one you just made, so that, if you regret your choise, you can get back to the better version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA last addition I think that could be very realistic and make everything better is to male it so you can control your probe from a spaceplane or a base, and it could be even better if there were different command levels, like:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Mk1 command pod or cockpit-\u0026gt; no drone control\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Mk1 probe controller-\u0026gt; only action groups\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Mk2 cockpit or size 2 command pod-\u0026gt; thrust and action groups\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Mk2 or size 2 probe controller-\u0026gt; thrust, action groups and single part control\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Mk3 cockpit or size 3 command pod-\u0026gt; thrust, action groups, single part control and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Mk3 or size 3 probe controller-\u0026gt; thrust, action groups, single part control and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Land base drone controller-\u0026gt; full control\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey could connect to the standard probes and function with extra crew, that controls rhe probe another if there is no connection between Kerbin and the vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also think an important addition for spaceplane or airplane builders would be the possibility to regulate the landing gears from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or even in-flight, so that it isn\u0027t necessary to make some strange things anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually I think that it would be very interesting to make the new water launch site finally useful with some water parts for boats and submarines and physic corrections like control surfaces not affecting the vessel while in water and intakes functioning underwater.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheOtherDave","CreatedById":32305,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-22T06:30:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModern remote control hardware doesn\u2019t really vary in size when you add more things it can control.
