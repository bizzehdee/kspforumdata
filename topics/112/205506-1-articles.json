Kerbals on ladders including hatches should be treated as not colliding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThinking about how to do that I had the idea that each situation needs to limit velocity changes, then it occurred that this might work as the more general case of permitted velocity modifiers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dont know how this works in KSP2, whether devs have found a way round the \u0022kraken\u0022 as it is commonly called I can see the same ship collision toggle already exists in advanced tweakables but it struck me that the velocity of a craft could be locked to prevent physics bugs like that unless the velocity change comes from a trusted source i.e. a whitelist of velocity modifiers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike engines or atmospheric drag or bonafide collision. So only when an engine is firing can the velocity change, only when collision is between two otherwise unconnected surfaces can velocity change likewise drag. All other krakenesque anomalies could be ignored.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would require a check on the velocity change source to see if it can be added to the craft velocity. You could have this only operating under specific circumstances like engineering or ladder, or maybe it could be an ongoing kraken blocker, I dont know how badly it might affect the frame rate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the velocity change was discarded and only became apparent when the conditions met the rules of the check then when a kerbal lets go they might get pushed, if they were already colliding. Currently getting a kerbal out of a hatch already gets them a push and often they get stuck and then pushed which is like slapstick comedy!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-04T18:30:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2 is being done from scratch by professional developers.
