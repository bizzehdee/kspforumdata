Do not repeat the same mistake Squad has made in KSP1. Instead of motor torque curve zeroing out at max speed, use constant motor torque and a resistance torque curve, maxing out at max speed to value equal to motor torque.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Baleine","CreatedById":131757,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-23T23:33:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that rover wheels are already implemented. But I think your suggestion is worth considering if they did it the Squad way \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;p\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/971609041_P.png\u0022 title=\u0022;p\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
