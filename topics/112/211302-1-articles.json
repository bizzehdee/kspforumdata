But if I did, you just agree in chat and each player does their best to hold up the bargain, physically transferring resources to another players base or vessel. That process of physically producing and transferring resources is at the core of what the game is about--building and flying--and I personally wouldn\u0027t want to see money even in single player because it kind of defeats the purpose of the game. It would be like if you could just \u003Cem\u003Ebuy\u003C/em\u003E components in factorio rather than setting up automated crafting.

One of two things happens: either the resources are magically and instantly transferred, which breaks the whole point of a game thats about physics and space travel, or the trade is not enforced immediately, and just lingers until it\u0027s satisfied. This would be the case for IOU\u0027s. And what happens if it\u0027s not satisfied? What if a player reneges? Do the trade contracts come with negotiated breach clauses? Are there clawbacks? Maybe its just me but I just feel like we\u0027re getting into a very different kind of game than KSP actually is in spirit.
