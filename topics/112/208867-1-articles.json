In my modded playthroughs, interstellar is almost at the end of the tech tree, and I unlock pretty much everything else before going to the first new star system. After getting to new systems, most of what I do is just set up progressively larger infrastructure to be able to hop to the next system, and by itself that gets to be boring because there is no new challenge because all the tech makes things easy. To counterbalance that, I make sure that the warp drives only unlock after two to three star systems so that it feels like I am working towards something and the gratification of getting places more easily is larger.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo things I think need to happen is that interstellar technology should improve and planetary technology should improve after reaching new systems. The first interstellar mission should be clunky and slow, with a relatively inefficient engine and lots of separate parts to deal with the drawbacks of the technology (really really radiative parts with no good shielding for example). Eventually though, interstellar vehicles should be well-oiled, compact machines that travel tens of times faster than the first generation ships, have much higher dry/fuel ratios, and are much more capable at managing heat and radiation. This would give interstellar travel meaningful progression beyond the first flight, and I always wanted to see a ship powered by a fifth-generation Daedalus engine.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, you should not have the perfect tech for planets by the time you finish exploring the first extrakerbolar system. Ultra-high-thrust engines should only really be developed once you have landed on Ovin and brought back some science. Better versions of everything from solid fuel to fusion engines should be discovered by visiting specific planets in the late game. New types of parts, like lava-capable hulls, should emerge from environments that cannot be found in the Kerbol system. These examples are not the best, but stuff like that could go a long way to adding late game progression.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ember12","CreatedById":217583,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-07T00:18:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe devs have said that there are engines unlocked after interstellar engines, so there will probably be a bunch of other stuff too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-07-07T00:18:36Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2022 12:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Ember12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-07T02:31:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you do want to hold back the last couple of giant crazy engines until you had explored a couple of other systems, maybe also super efficient reactors and final tier colony modules, but I don\u2019t think its wise to just keep adding arbitrarily more broken tech because that also will take the fun out of the game. There are other potential incentives though. For instance we know boom events will increase your populations, so it might be if you want to keep growing your colonies to crazy sizes you still have to get out there and discover new worlds.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a big part of the reason Im hoping there are pretty tight mechanics in terms of colony habitation, population size, and resource output.

If the game is just about the tech tree the fun only lasts until you get that last crazy engine. You\u2019ll try it out a few times for funzies and that\u2019ll be it. Thats part of the reason so few players ever even go interplanetary in KSP1. There are no deeper mechanics to the game so most players complete the tech tree and start over, never bothering to explore further.

I\u2019ll only say I think rewards that aren\u2019t on the tech tree are critical as well and have a much greater potential to extend deep gameplay because they scale better. For instance: should a player who visits \u003Ci\u003Eall\u003C/i\u003E the planets and moons in two systems receive the same rewards and complete the tech tree faster than a player who visits just a couple of planets in each system? Or the opposite? Should you need to colonize some? How are those relative rewards balanced and managed? Any way you stack it the tech tree is \u003Ci\u003Efinite\u003C/i\u003E and cannot respond elastically to these questions. You need some other non-finite reward to drive exploration even after the tech tree is complete.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-07-07T04:20:12Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2022 04:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vl3d","CreatedById":219348,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-07T08:26:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso remember that not all players will have the same progression regarding resource exploitation.
