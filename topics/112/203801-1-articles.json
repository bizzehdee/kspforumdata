A game with interstellar\u00A0 travel and new planets. A game I cannot wait for! But I have a suggestion. I think KSP2 should have cameras. In the real world astronomers, scientists, and space guys use telescopes to observe celestial bodies and stars. A lot of the information we have about space is from observations. But I think KSP2 should have cameras. It would make a lot of sense for science progression.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf KSP2 has cameras though, I mean telescopes there shouldn\u2019t just be one variant. Today astronomers and scientists observe the heavens with all kinds of spectrums. Gamma, visible light, ultra violet, infrared. And many more. So. I would like to suggest there shouldn\u0027t be just one variant of telescopes (or space cameras). There should be many. And each variant would specialize and observe things in a different spectrum. Of course you wouldn\u0027t unlock each variant in one node. I meann, X-Ray and Gamma telescopes would be a problem after but I think you know what I mean. So now we have gone over the variant, I would like to explain the game mechanics.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese telescopes or space cameras would be used to earn science points by making observations, and maybe even make discoveries in a story mode ( I won\u0027t go too deep into this)! I will provide some examples of what science reports the cameras could turn out with. Also, these telescopes could possibly zoom in on planets far away and even take reports on them. Like seeing Jool from Low Kerbin Orbit, or observing Gurdamma from Kerbin.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEXAMPLES (below):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbol Example (inferred):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbol is very hot. It would definitely burn a fried egg. The R and D guys could use this intel and make new parts that don\u0027t burn easily.\u00A0Jool System (High Above) Example (visible light):\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJool is very green. And Laythe it blue. Tylo is grey. Vall is bue. But where is Pol and Bop? They must be small.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGardumma Example (visible light):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nZooming up on Gurdamma and it\u0027s very pixelated and blurry. It seems to have water and is rocky. Maybe it is habitable?
