However, what we haven\u0027t seen is a radial, trussless variant, and I think this is very important. On the Copernicus-B, this tank isn\u0027t fully surrounded by the truss. Instead it\u0027s connected to a \u0022saddle truss\u0022, which leaves one side of the truss open so that the tank can be jettisoned after use. This allows the craft to carry a single inline drop tank, whereas drop tanks must traditionally come in radial pairs to balance center of mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ujdWyfe.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002228.73\u0022 height=\u0022152\u0022 width=\u0022529\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ujdWyfe.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are also a few related designs that instead use a \u0022star truss\u0022 to attach four drop tanks radially.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022DrbBHHP.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002261.83\u0022 height=\u0022371\u0022 width=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/DrbBHHP.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it would be a huge missed opportunity to not include a \u0022bare\u0022 variant of the hydrogen tank in KSP2. The version we\u0027ve seen so far looks great for inline usage, but doesn\u0027t seem ideal for use as a drop tank.\u00A0 We\u0027ve even seen a saddle truss in KSP2 already, here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022sATGzIB.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002267.50\u0022 height=\u0022506\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/sATGzIB.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s no good way to use this in combination with the existing KSP2 tank, but a trussless variant could easily be attached to the inside via a decoupler or docking port. Such a variant could perhaps have slightly less mass but no inline attachment points. It could also be fun to have a star truss available for usage, though I imagine the applications of this would be far more limited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s entirely possible that this is already in the game, but we\u0027ve seen quite a few craft using LH2 tanks and I feel like we likely would have seen it by now. To my knowledge we haven\u0027t seen any part variants in general, so I\u0027m wondering if that system even still exists in KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"i dont know how to forum","CreatedById":223379,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-17T01:08:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ci7yAH7.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002230.19\u0022 height=\u0022314\u0022 width=\u00221040\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ci7yAH7.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis craft from the new trailer shows radially attached hydrogen tanks, and they\u0027re still enclosed within a truss, so it seems like I was right that there is no bare variant currently in the game. It also seems to have structural panels instead of radiators, but that\u0027s a different topic. I think this craft is a good example of where a bare variant would be nice, the truss structure here feels out of place for radially attached tanks, especially if they\u0027re drop tanks (I can\u0027t tell if they\u0027re attached to decouplers or not here).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-17T04:33:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd can we get those spherical geodesics in foil too plz?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-17T08:46:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224233294\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211884\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221676608395\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd can we get those spherical geodesics in foil too plz?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI say its decent chance we get. note its not an paint job but another texture and bump map, but we had that on some tanks in KSP 1.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
