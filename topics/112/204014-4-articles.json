Or at least that\u2019s my understanding of it. Essentially, the reaction going on in the NERV produces less energy than a small nuclear explosion per unit of fuel, which is enough for the pulse engine to have a higher isp than the NERV. In terms of bombs vs liquid fuel, the packing density makes less of a difference than the material that you use. Remember, NERVs heat up regular fuel via a small amount of nuclear catalyst, whereas the Orion engine contains fuel that is almost entirely fissile material, packing a much higher energy density than the fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing to note is that as you get into fusion engines, those engines will rapidly outpace the isp of the Orion and the NERV, because fusion creates a lot more energy than fission per mass of reactant (at least I think so).
