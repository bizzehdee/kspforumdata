Would it behave exactly like liquid fuel rockets with more solid fuel = more delta-V but fixed thrust, or more segments = more thrust with the same burn time as for real SRBs? Are we including fuel shaping to control the rate of combustion and so the thrust curve, and is that on a per-segment basis or controlled by the nozzle for the whole booster?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MetallicHydrogen","CreatedById":220221,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-20T10:38:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my opinion I would like the burning style to be toggled in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, and the booster performing in a somehow realistic way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-03-20T10:48:53Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2022 10:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by MetallicHydrogen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
