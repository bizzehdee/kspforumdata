For mods absolutely. But the base game isn\u0027t intended to be a 1 to 1 super realistic replica sim. It\u0027s meant to be balanced as a simplified and fun game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDifferent liquid fuels/oxidizers should only be included if they have significant enough differences to meaningfully effect gameplay. Something like, this fuel has 20% more isp or is 20% lighter alone isnt really enough to bother. And ksp probably isn\u0027t going to have issues like limited engine restarts, or challenges for restarts with half empty tanks, or toxicity of the fuel which would be the main difference between many fuel types. Rockets in ksp mostly boil down to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. All the other finer points of rocket science are glossed over. Also, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s worth the devs time to create multiple liquid fuels if one is clearly inferior. Why add a bunch of new fuels if they are only useful for one or two steps on the tech tree before being replaced by something superior? They\u0027d spend all that time and effort making something we\u0027d only use for a couple missions before replacing and all those parts would sit unused and cluttering up the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E menu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, a large part of the game\u0027s tech progression is going to be into future and alternative engine technologies. I think liquid fuel oxidizer rockets are going to quickly become obsolete in terms of best \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E or best \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, and kept useful by their fuel being easy to produce. They\u0027re going to be the budget option, not the best but ok. Which is why I think they went with methane, as it can be easily made anywhere with water and nitrogen or even harvested from atmospheres or gas giants. And frankly if the team had that much time on their hands, I\u0027d much rather the devs spend it adding more possible future engine techs, where there could be more gameplay variance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo with those restraints, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E being the only stats that really matter, not devoting so much time and effort to something that would be outright replaced by another liquid fuel, ideally something easy to produce in many environments so it doesn\u0027t become completely obsolete due to new engine techs, are there any fuels that are different enough to include.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt most I could see setting up 2 or 3 different liquid fuels. They\u0027ve said they\u0027re going with methane for the basic fuel. Hydrogen might a possible alternative to include, as it has some significant differences. I think their challenge might be making Hydrogen different without making it worse. Maybe they could justify kerosene. But I don\u0027t think it\u0027s different enough from methane to matter for any reason other than, historical rockets more likely used kerosene.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drakenred65","CreatedById":154503,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-18T18:56:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do agree this should be a mod or maybe a difficulty setting they add in Later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tend to agree that having say G/LOX tanks then V/LOX \u00A0then \u00A0K/LOX \u00A0tanks and so on needlessly clutters up the tech tree and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.
