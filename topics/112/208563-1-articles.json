I like doing side corridors or layouts with multiple paths on stations and bases, and just fun or weird structures/designs with trusses and beams, and I very often think of how much I would like this feature. If it creates any weird issues, just have it as a part toggle, a la rigid attachment and autostrut. I heard that this is something the devs have mentioned at some point, so it seems like a decent possibility we will get this; fingers crossed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ryaja","CreatedById":221431,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-30T23:42:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224144040\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208563\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221655056559\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197197\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Barrackar\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 6/12/2022 at 11:55 AM, Barrackar said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVehicles in KSP1 are saved as a part tree using a \u0022root\u0022 part.

Can cope with either compression or tension (ie. struts) or shear to tie parts of the tree together and allow resources to flow but force transfer is limited to only the plane they are designed for. Limits the compute as it can take out feedback loops. Might help with giant stations and colonies as there would be only very limited situations sub-sections of the massive craft would impact each other otherwise they are just floating along together.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe know craft building is changing even the sub-assembly system that has been shown already allows for multi root craft where the roots are always distinct.
