Yes, giving a story to follow might help some players know what to do next, but I reckon for many more players it would stifle their creativity to \u0022have\u0022 to do certain things at certain times when really all they want to do is fire an Orion pulse engine at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or melt Duna\u0027s ice caps with a metallic hydrogen torch drive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dresoccer4","CreatedById":141944,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-03T21:58:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224027898\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204636\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221630704699\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002227914\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n27 minutes ago, Vanamonde said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe know very little about the specifics yet but there has been no mention of a system like this.
