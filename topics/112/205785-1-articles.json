Each context taking a bit to load then set up and render to screen each context shift taking a noticeable amount of time even when the contexts are close.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP should have a tabbed UI - more \u00A0like a productivity app less like a game. \u00A0Each tab holding enough situational data running to allow fairly rapid switching of contexts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor instance docking 2 ships, each would be running in its own tab so you could switch effortlessly between them. \u00A0Machine spec\u0027s dependant you could have a tab open for each crew member of a crafts IVA (or one for each camera if we get those) and switch at will.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMap view could be a tab instead of a switched view. \u00A0Further it would open additional tabs for zoomed in views of other bodies you encounter with on your journey. So you don\u0027t need to zoom dance all over the map view. This could lend itself to a Mission View that tiles the views into one tab once configured.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think as the game get vast even on the scale of KSP1 vastness it might be away to help players stay on target.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
