is a bit puzzling, especially because you mentioned how you tend to notice the dissonance in the game. I think there still dissonance in the piece since it\u2019s also a bit of a \u201Cjazz-ie\u201D piece. Here\u2019s my best analysis right now, but I\u2019ll dig into it with my keyboard tomorrow:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe the lead instrument some kind of vibraphone. It\u2019s possible it was played with harder mallets with way less yarn than usual making that xylophone-ish sound. The bass in this sounds like a double-bass typically used is symphony orchestras or jazz bands. Like most symphony stringed instruments, these don\u2019t have frets so there is a possibility that the bassist played a microtone but this in this case it\u2019s unlikely that this is actually what you think you\u2019re hearing. From what I\u2019m hearing your probably hearing dissonance, and it\u2019s most likely a tritone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor simplicity let\u2019s say it\u2019s in the key of C, (I can\u2019t check right now since I don\u2019t have my keyboard on me). What you\u2019re hearing is probably the\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003Edouble-bass playing their high F, still assuming this is in the key of C, while the vibraphone is playing a C and whatever other notes their playing in the chord. This would create a tritone or a Cmaj11 chord (C major 11th) assuming every note is covered by the vibraphone or another instrument (which it isn\u2019t). The vibraphone and the bass are maybe playing some variation of the Cmaj11 chord but I\u2019ll really have to check this and look into it more tomorrow when I have my keyboard. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAnyways that\u2019s my best explanation as of the moment. I\u2019d also probably be able to deduce something better if you could give me a time stamp, and once I figure this out on the keyboard, but that\u2019s still my best explanation.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BowlerHatGuy3","CreatedById":222738,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-06T22:25:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of my favorite pieces of KSP2 music is at the end of the Celestial Bodies feature.

It\u2019s probably the strangest sounding piece so far and I love it.
