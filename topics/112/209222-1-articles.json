Online - big online sandbox servers with random people unlike normal multiplayer where its private. you are allowed to do whatever you want and there is a text and voice chat feature so you can scream at people. basically GTA online\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Custom online - same thing as online servers but you can create them and add your own goals or mission scenarios\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Hardcore - VERY realistic mode, real money and government funding and public reputation, missions can fail randomly and kerbals need food water and oxygen to survive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. International mode - like hardcore but multiplayer and you can work together with your friends or not your choice\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Space race - choose between too ideological rivals, Kapitalism or Kommunism, they each come with their own ups and downs that will influence your funding and the technology you get, the goal is to beat the other space program to the edge of the solar system, the game ends by tallying up your space achievements and whoever has the most wins. can be played against an AI or friend\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Science career - a game mode where your funding is influenced by how much science you do\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. Colony mode - play against a rival and try to colonize every planet in the solar system and beyond whoever has a larger population of colonists wins\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8. Doomsday mode - the clock is ticking before and an asteroid hits kerbin and ends the world, the asteroid is too big to be destroyed so you have to get at least 1000 kerbals off kerbin and on another planet before the asteroid hits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n9. Crime mode - you are up against a rival and your goal is to hinder his space program as much as you can and vice versa. bonus points for stealing, if your opponent is more far down the tech tree than you than you can launch an operation to steal a craft with technology you dont have yet, once you recover it you will unlock that technology without having to get science points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n10. Custom mode - Maybe people could make their own custom game modes to play, similar to how making history lets you create custom scenario\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni dont think the devs probably have enough time to make all of these and thats ok but im sure some could fit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-08-04T08:52:07Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2022 08:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by awsumguy76801\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-04T09:11:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best way to ensure that anyone can get their game mode is to open it up to modding access, because the devs will never be able to create every game mode that someone wants.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I would like to see a Capture the Flag game mode where players can start on any celestial body and the two teams compete to discover the other, trace things back to their starting base, reach it and bring the flag back home.

This probably wouldn\u2019t be in the base game but it would make a sick mod and you would get tons of community challenges from it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BertramsMom","CreatedById":222468,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-10T19:34:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah I really think that some of the game modes you listed would be fun...
