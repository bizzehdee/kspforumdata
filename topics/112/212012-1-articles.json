The pursuit of science was a huge motivator for me, personally. I\u0027m not saying that the game lacks a sense of direction - I\u0027m just proposing a new layer to the game. The KSP universe is so quirky and intriguing, as-is, so it seems ripe for a story/clue scavenger hunt and would offer their wonderful writing team the opportunity to add depth to its universe.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NutellaSandwich","CreatedById":207876,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-15T00:05:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224232135\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022212012\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221676387018\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022225508\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SoulCandy\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, SoulCandy said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m just proposing a new layer to the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, in that case, totally agree!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
