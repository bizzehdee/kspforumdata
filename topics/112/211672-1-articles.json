I can understand from a game development standpoint they seem like they would be quite difficult to add to the game, however, there are other aspects of special relativity that could be added that I think could be quite interesting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, as I previously mentioned, relativistic doppler effect (i.e. redshift/blueshift) could make stars in the front of the spacecraft\u0027s moving direction appear more blue and those behind appear redder. There is also a really interesting aspect of high speed travel in relativistic aberration, in that the angle of stars in the sky appear to converge at higher speeds, effectively changing the view of the sky. Think of approaching hyperspace in Star Wars, where the stars seem to stretch out as they go forwards, only in reality the stars would appear closer together in the direction you are moving and further apart behind you. I think that this could be a really interesting consideration to add to the game, and one that seems a lot less challenging than having different \u0027clocks\u0027 on each spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese effects would only be noticeable at the really high speeds, and perhaps not necessary to add to the game depending on the gameplay of interstellar travel, but still an interesting suggestion I think. I realise that someone else could have also mentioned this previously, but it occurred to me recently how interesting it would be to see in this game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-01-23T17:17:56Z\u0022 title=\u002201/23/2023 05:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 23, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by t_brown\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zeekzeek22","CreatedById":223169,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-24T15:54:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs cool as it would be to have an engageable level of relativity involved in the game...my guess is that in KSP2, light moves instantaneously, and there is no time dilation.

I absolutely understand the reasons.
