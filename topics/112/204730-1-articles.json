I was playing a game on Roblox called Space Sailors and I noticed that the rocket\u0027s engine sounds got quieter as the rocket exited the earth\u0027s atmosphere. Then I remembered KSP doesn\u0027t have that (or stock real plume). I thought it would be a good suggestion to implement the gradual sound increase or decrease (due to pressure) as a optional\u00A0setting or just a game feature (you know what I mean).\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-07T16:41:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a mod for that in KSP. I don\u0027t like the idea of silent engines though- while it might be \u0022unrealistic\u0022, it also helps you to know that they\u0027re actually working and it would be too quiet otherwise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BekfastDerp13","CreatedById":214450,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-07T16:58:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s why I said that it could be a setting that you could toggle on and off.
