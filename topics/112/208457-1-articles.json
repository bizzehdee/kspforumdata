Those colonies at first won\u0027t have enough kerbals and you need a boom event to make more, or do you? What if all you needed to do was bring a freezer unit full of frozen kerbal sprouts! these baby kerbals are ready for incubation and all you need to do is unthaw them. You can\u0027t bring enough kerbals on an interstellar colony ship, so use sprouts! Just add water!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-05T01:01:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the aesthetic of this suggestion, and the way it is implemented! Water as a resource to create new kerbals from sprouts is a good use for a common resource, and overall works well without adding a new resource or having a complex system for reproduction. Devs, if you have time to change things up, this one is definitely worth adding!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ryaja","CreatedById":221431,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-05T05:01:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, Kerbal spores.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
