This post will focus on these two engines, what\u0027s wrong with them, and what can be done to fix them. If you don\u0027t care about the why feel free to skip to the end and get the what I think should be done.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reliant engine is one of the earliest engines science mode gives you access to, and it happens to be one of the hardest to use. The reliant main\u0027s gimmick is that it has no thrust vector, in no way is this communicated to the player in an easy way. The description and name fails to mention anything about the lack of thrust vectoring, despite this being critical information for a player (especially a new one) to know. This engine can also often be unlocked before you get wings or side decouplers, meaning that a new player can unlock it easily before they can unlock ways to get around its gimmick. What does this engine have to make up for its general unintuitiveness? Compared to Swivel, it has a good bit going for it, around a third more thrust, and 15 more isp at sea level. These advantages get thrown out of the window when the vector engine gets unlocked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Vector engine while not the most powerful engine, is the most overpowered engine. It outclasses both reliant and the swivel engine with ease. It has far higher surface isp then the reliant engine, with a whopping 295 compared to reliants 265. But at least reliant has higher thrust right? Vector has a whopping 1000 kn of thrust at vacuum, this is nearly double the thrust of the kickback \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E. On top of all of this, it has the highest thrust vectoring of any engine. The combinations of these stats make it far more powerful then its two brothers, so what can we do to fix this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first changes I\u0027d suggest is to make reliants gimmick more clear, first off a rename. The name reliant doesnt really suggest that it doesnt suggest that it has no swivel, so why dont we rename it to \u0022Swivelless\u0022. This reflects the lore of it being an older model of the swivel engine, and makes its main gimmick clear from the beginning. I\u0027d also suggest upping the thrust to around 250 to 350, this would allow it to fill the role of essentially a liquid fuel \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E, high thrust, with okay efficiency. I\u0027d also suggest making it available slightly later on the tech tree, probably around the same time you get 2.5 meter parts, this way players get there hands on it when they\u0027re ready to play with it. The Vector engine has one simple change to make the engine not overpowered, drastically reduce its thrust. The vector engines thrust should be reduced to somewhere in the ballpark of 100 KN, meaning that in order to use it you need to partner it with a high thrust engine. To compensate for the reliant being available on later on in the tech tree, this engine should also be available far earlier, about the time you\u0027d unlock reliant in ksp1. These changes would mean that the Vectors high gimbal but low thrust, and Reliants lack of gimbal but high thrust would make these two engines be wonderful partners to one another, and give these engines distinct niches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SolarAdmiral","CreatedById":107350,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-31T21:27:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t mind the Reliant\u0027s name, it fairly portrays something older, more established.

Early game you make do with what you have, comprises have to made. Latter on it\u0027s a matter of choosing the right engine for the job. At that point the reliant is nothing more than a dumb liquid booster. The vector is just silly from a balance perspective. It\u0027s just the right amount of out\u00A0 of wack that it has to be on purpose, unlike the wolfhound that got nerfed real quick.\u00A0 When I play more or less stock, fair. I find even into mid game I am often just short on thrust or isp on a rocket. It forces me to think smarter, and make hard choices. Or do strange things to solve a problem. Given that I think the balance is the one thing that was thought long and hard about. If you find there\u0027s a part you aren\u0027t finding useful, ask yourself if it\u0027s really the part you need.

An keep the challenge of working with what you have and thring that don\u0027t quite meet your desires in the early game.
