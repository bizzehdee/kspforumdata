I believe that KSP was made to be as sandbox as possible, even with the DLC parts belonging to rockets from NASA, ESA and the Russian space agency that have been using the same rocket since the 60\u0027s are added. the futuristic parts you speak of are part of a possible near future, but none of those components have ever been made so far.
