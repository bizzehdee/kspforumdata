It will probably be ignored or simplified in favor of putting the time and effort into more relevant tasks.

I can\u2019t remember where that was said, but I think it was part of a question about implementing n-body physics where they said they would keep a simple \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E model.
