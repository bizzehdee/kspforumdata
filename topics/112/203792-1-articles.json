I think failures that are theoretically salvageable rather than total loss of vehicle, or at least failures that result from pilot error/calculated risk would be a neat thing. Like, say every part starts out with 100% chance of working properly, but then using it wrong increases it\u0027s odds of failure. Trading paint between your space shuttle and your space station increases the odds of thermal protection failing, landing on the nozzle of your engine maybe reduces efficiency or alters it\u0027s thrust vector or just gives it a chance to blow up. Maybe pressurized parts could have their reliability effected by pressure cycles, like real aircraft, so the first flight of your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E is perfectly safe but the 10th runs a certain risk of decompression. I think an engineer should be able try and make in-situ repairs on parts either pre or post-failure with the former being most effective and that colonies could do more involved repairs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a system like that in place you could intentionally roll the dice with part failure for some in-game benefit. Maybe Bill can retrofit the NERV to give higher thrust/efficiency in order to make that burn you miscalculated, but at the risk of a meltdown. Or you could increase signal range on an antenna by cannibalizing radar equipment, but in doing so you lose altimeter readout and ranging for rendezvous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully I\u0027ve managed to get this across well enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcwaffles2003","CreatedById":180102,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-13T17:34:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it could be a fun game mechanic but not one I see entering the stock game.

I for one have used rocket engines as \u0022legs\u0022 at the pad for when I don\u0027t have launch towers or just forget them. Punishing them by breaking their engines because they are now fragile would just ruin the experience for too many, just so they can\u0027t land on the moon on their engine.\u00A0Which will probably result in them falling over anyways. Now if they design their lander with multiple engines and just want them to be \u0022legs\u0022 for landing... why stop them? Its rather absurd, but it does make the game more interesting and opens more doors to more interesting designs.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the game is too forgiving in regards to taking damage/collisions, having a mod that reduces part integrity across the board would result in more or less what it seems like you want. Smash during docking = catastrophic failure. Such changes would come at a price though, like no more boats, so it should stay a mod.
