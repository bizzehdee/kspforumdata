Essentially, the cost difference between the composer making the track electronically and making it with live music is small enough that it would be easily covered by game sales. Did I get that right? If I did, then the problem is that it isn\u2019t about the total game sales to cover it, but instead about additional game sales generated by the live music. I for one don\u2019t think you could even make a difference of 0.1% in game sales by having live music, which you would need to cover the costs, and those are optimistic costs. It comes down to a few factors.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, the player base isn\u2019t going to change on the music alone. You and I, and nearly every other person who buys KSP 2, won\u2019t make their decision based on whether the music sounds live. The gameplay takes top priority, and then the visuals come second, and then the rest of the experience is a nice-to-have. Second, KSP isn\u2019t one of those games that really benefits from live music. Titles like Elden Ring and Silk Song are trying to show off their polish and massive effort in all areas of the game, and if the music can be made more polished, it will be, especially since the authenticity of the music lends a lot to the experience. KSP, most indie games, and a lot of sci-fi big budget games use electronic music because it doesn\u2019t really clash with the game in the same way as with hand-crafted fantasy worlds.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be great to have a 2001: Space Odyssey level orchestral feel to the space exploration, but I think not enough people care enough for it to happen.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Strawberry","CreatedById":222150,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-05T03:39:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHonestly as long as there is more then 5 songs Ill be happy, if theres unique songs for each solar system Id be very happy, if each planet had a song then Id be extremely happy, and if rusk and rask both had there own pieces that complimented each other Id go supercritical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superluminal Gremlin","CreatedById":221533,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-07T00:48:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want rask and rusk\u0027s theme to be palindromic\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmaybe rask and rusk\u0027s theme is palindromic to a really cold planet\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni would be kinda cool\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
