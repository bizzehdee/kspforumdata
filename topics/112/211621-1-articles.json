Possibilties range from no change (resizable and you can move navball) to fully customisable (a mod could conceivably replace all in flight UI elements). Would be cool from a retro ksp/ accessible ksp/ unusual monitor shape perspective if it was the latter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-21T11:03:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill there be toolbars at all?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lithobroken","CreatedById":224716,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-21T16:25:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope so, its a convenient way to interact with mod content.
