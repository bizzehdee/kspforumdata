Even with the KSP2 improvements to the physics engine (and due to\u00A0 \u003Cs\u003Emy\u003C/s\u003E our very limited knowledge about the technical capabilities of it), I think simulating a mass driver (or mass-driver-like) launch system poses significant (software) engineering challenges.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can make mass drivers in KSP 1, just usually not at the scale required for a lot of situations, so its possible just not super useful in KSP 1.

The latter could also conceivably be achieved with \u0022around-the-corner\u0022 technologies, while the former is still mostly a pure pipe dream in terms of actual implementation. On top of that (and as has been pointed out), modeling one as any kind of interactive physical object rather than a purely visual stage prop is pretty much out of the question, so its actual use would basically amount to triggering a cutscene\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:/\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png\u0022 title=\u0022:/\u0022\u003E. To me that idea just seems kind of at odds with what the game as we know it is all about. And lastly, what you get for having one , i.e. a cheap and easy trip to synchronous orbit and only synchronous orbit, doesn\u0027t seem like anything particularly unique or valuable to me.\u00A0 Just having fully automated supply missions for on-orbit construction projects would provide far more gameplay value without creating a stark discontinuity in\u00A0 the whole conceptual framework IMO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nElectric mass drivers OTOH,\u00A0 as a cheap and easy means of delivering mined\u00A0resources from various low-gravity extraction outposts to Kerbin or orbital construction projects, seem much more within the plausible scope of this game to me.\u00A0 And they would actually solve a real gameplay problem, which is how to deliver\u00A0various types of remotely located Unobtanium\u00A0to the places where they are needed without flying a separate mission every time.\u00A0 They would also obviate the need to provide resource-return fuel at every mining outpost, at the price of transporting the parts there and constructing it in situ. I also don\u0027t think the argument that they would break the physics bubble is valid either, at least not for the toy-sized Kerbolar system and the no-atmosphere, low-gravity bodies where I would envisage their use.\u00A0 Orbital velocity on Minmus is around 170 m/s, and on Mun it\u0027s around 650 m/s.\u00A0 So a 10g mass driver would need to deliver its acceleration for only 1.7 seconds on Minmus and around 6.5 seconds on Mun to launch its payload to orbit. For Mun that would mean a length of around 2.1km, which is pretty unwieldy but still smaller than physics radius, but on Minmus it would only be 112.5 meters, which is totally doable! And of course the max\u00A0 G tolerance of Kerbals in their command pods as well as other parts\u00A0is actually 50 rather than\u00A0\u00A010.\u00A0 At 40g, a Munar orbit-capable mass driver would only measure 0.5 km, and a Minmus escape-capable one would measure only 50m.
