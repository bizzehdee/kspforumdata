That is, if something isn\u0027t working-as-expected, it can be difficult for end-users to determine if it\u0027s actually a bug or oversight, as opposed to an intentional game design feature that players might not be able to reasonably expect. Speaking personally, I\u0027d still consider the latter a bug, just that it\u0027s a bug in the documentation and not the program code.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tstein","CreatedById":223854,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-02T13:57:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224226197\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211814\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221675201544\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022212496\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022poopslayer78\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1/31/2023 at 6:45 PM, poopslayer78 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d imagine some of the people buying the game on day 1 will be very motivated to improve the game and provide meaningful feedback in the form of bug reports and suggestions.\u00A0 It also sounds like there will be an in-game bug reporting tool as one method of providing this feedback.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould it be possible to provide some concrete direction and coordination for players who want to look for bugs?\u00A0 This could come in the form of written documents listing testing methodologies or templates for overachiever bug reports.\u00A0 I\u0027m imagining something of equal or slightly deeper technical detail than a dev blog, but certainly not a 10,000 page IEEE document.\u00A0 Another related aspect could be providing a sort of living \u0022wishlist\u0022 or \u0022coverage map\u0022 of areas of the game that have fewer play testing hours or more suspected bugs, which is updated regularly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like to clarify that this would not be like a closed beta, with more \u0022professional\u0022 testers or require any kind of special privileges given to players.\u00A0 I\u0027m instead asking for some more concrete direction and guidance which would allow anyone highly motivated to find issues to be as useful as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be sincere, if in the first day\u00A0 we do not have the forum flooded with\u00A0 complains of bugs\u00A0 the launch will be a great success.
