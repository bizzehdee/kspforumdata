What I am about to write is probably wrong in many ways.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf I understand correctly, each frame is calculated in high-dynamic-range HDR mode,\u00A0 which has the max range of brightness values. This HDR image is calculated in 16 bit, which means each pixel can have brightness values between 1 and 2^16 = 16500. This is transformed to a low-dynamic-range (LDR) image to show on the screen, which basically cuts off the lowest and brightest values (and does some squishing \u0026amp; log transformation). The trick to simulated eye adaptation is determining where it should take this slice of the HDR\u0027s brightness values. The LDR needs 255 different brightness values, the amount of brightness values of a computer screen. If it has less than 255 brightness values banding artifacts occurs, there are jumps between the different brightness values.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo what\u0027s shown on screen can be a slice of the calculated brightness values: 255/16500 = 1.54% the brightness values of the HDR. (This is optimistic because of the log transform: more detail is needed for the darker values of the LDR than the brighter values -\u0026gt; For the LDR you actually need a bigger slice of the HDR values or artifacts will occur.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOur eyes can see 24 stops brightness difference at any one time, that means the brightest thing you can differentiate is 2^24 = 16 million times as bright as the darkest value you can differentiate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe want to be able to see sunspots and other cool details when doing a flyby over the sun (as opposed to the sun always being overexposed, even when it fills the screen), and we want to be able to see the milkyway/ the dimmest visible star. I read the dimmest star we can see with our eyes is 6 trillion times dimmer than the sun. So we need to calculate brightness values for stuff 6 trillion times brighter than the darkest thing. Then select a slice of 16 million big out of those 6 trillion values, because that\u0027s the range we can see at any one time. That slice is only\u00A00.00027% of the calculated values. This is a way smaller portion than the optimistic 1.54% slice we could select without artifacts out of our 16bit HDR image.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy Conclusion:\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe cannot have completely realistic lighting range in game, a 16 bit HDR image does not offer enough detail.

This HDR image is calculated in 16 bit, which means each pixel can have brightness values between 1 and 2^16 = 16500. This is transformed to a low-dynamic-range (LDR) image to show on the screen, which basically cuts off the lowest and brightest values (and does some squishing \u0026amp; log transformation). The trick to simulated eye adaptation is determining where it should take this slice of the HDR\u0027s brightness values. The LDR needs 255 different brightness values, the amount of brightness values of a computer screen. If it has less than 255 brightness values banding artifacts occurs, there are jumps between the different brightness values.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo what\u0027s shown on screen can be a slice of the calculated brightness values: 255/16500 = 1.54% the brightness values of the HDR. (This is optimistic because of the log transform: more detail is needed for the darker values of the LDR than the brighter values -\u0026gt; For the LDR you actually need a bigger slice of the HDR values or artifacts will occur.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s off but not that far off:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://knarkowicz.wordpress.com/2016/01/09/automatic-exposure/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://knarkowicz.wordpress.com/2016/01/09/automatic-exposure/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur eyes can see 24 stops brightness difference at any one time, that means the brightest thing you can differentiate is 2^24 = 16 million times as bright as the darkest value you can differentiate.We want to be able to see sunspots and other cool details when doing a flyby over the sun (as opposed to the sun always being overexposed, even when it fills the screen), and we want to be able to see the milkyway/ the dimmest visible star.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe can\u0027t normally see black spots, not with our eyes alone, unless you have a huge chunk of atmosphere magnifying and also attenuating the sun (i.e. only during sunrise or sunset, and yes, this damages the eye anyways). In any other condition, the brightness just overwhelms the spots. We can, however, see all the way down to zodiacal light when there\u0027s no pollution, that bit is correct.

Finally, yeah, I think the objective side of the thing is all cleared up as one follows the discussion, and what we\u0027re left with are technicalities and subjectivities.

We could give each other small sectors of the sky, without reference, orientation data, or context, to actually see how much we can identify, if we can identify anything at all. At this point I\u0027ll still die on the hill that neither of us, or anyone in this thread, would correctly identify constellations in those circumstances.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-11-29T05:39:38Z\u0022 title=\u002211/29/2021 05:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 29, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by PDCWolf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
