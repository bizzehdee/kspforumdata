But can\u0027t seem to find it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe point is, there are features I really like in KSP1 that I just don\u0027t see\u00A0making the cut for KSP2. Do you have any? Mine are specifically:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nSettings: sometimes it\u0027s fun to just read through the Settings config file and see what all can be tweaked. It\u0027s very in-depth in KSP1.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCustom suits: including the degree to which we can change their look in the configs, helmets on and off, EVA pack or parachute or both or neither, visor up or down.\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nEmphasis on the visor. Something I felt we should have been able to do since the game\u0027s 1.0 release we couldn\u0027t do until almost the end of development.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCustom flags: seems probable that this will be a feature in KSP2, but I could see it getting overlooked.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSurface Experiments: specifically from Breaking Ground. Another feature that felt obvious but made it late to the game. What\u0027s more fun than recreating Apollo?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKerbal Inventory/Construction: a piggy-back off of Surface Experiments, sure, but\u00A0Intercept keeps saying \u0022the game, at its core, is\u00A0about building and flying rockets.\u0022 EVA construction is very convenient and fun, but also very extra.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll add more as I think of them. I know I\u0027m missing some of the more \u0022fringe\u0022 features that I actually quite like but they aren\u0027t touted as major features/improvements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-09-10T16:23:31Z\u0022 title=\u002209/10/2021 04:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 10, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Ahres\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nirgal","CreatedById":211448,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-10T18:24:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah I\u0027m always a bit concerned when I hear the devs say something like \u0027the game is about building and flying rockets\u0027.
