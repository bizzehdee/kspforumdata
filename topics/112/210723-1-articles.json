This way both ends of the structure would be always fixed on each part, I think this would work better with moving robotic parts.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAllow multiple connections between the structure bases. Maybe this could be a tweakable feature for the player to choose between up to six connections nodes. With this solution it would be possible to create geodesic structures.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA tweakable option between fixed or free rotating base would be nice. Maybe the player could even choose which\u00A0axis should be free and which should be fixed.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMake struts physical objects, and with higher crash tolerance. This would make possible the creation of roll cages around rovers, keeping kerbals safe.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStruts mass should be relative to how long the strut is.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-22T12:31:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat reminds me a bit about the old eva strut from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E.
