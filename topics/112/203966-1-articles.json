So its possible you wont be able to play the game with max graphic settings with giant multi-part crafts, but you should be fine playing the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlus, if Unity should be able to optimize the game enough to at least let it be playable on decently weaker machines. That doesn\u0027t mean the game will run fantastic, but it should at least run.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
