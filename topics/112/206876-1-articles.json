First, if one player is on while another is off, the online player could grind all of the easy contracts and leave the hard ones to the offline player. That is unfair. Also, I think the devs said that players would control a Kerbal, or something along those lines. If someone makes a multiplayer crafts mod kind of like Luna, then you can set up your own rules. A stock space race would not be the best gamemode in my opinion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Catto","CreatedById":137773,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-13T04:37:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthere SHould be multiplayer gamemodes, maybe just not like this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
