This part would function by having the top side have a mass limit, and when deployed, it would rotate 90 degrees, extend the top side and a counterweight out, and then begins rotating. This approach would come with a mass limit for the top side, and the counterweight would have a high weight leading to less mass efficiency. The main advantage of this approach would be that it fits nicely on a vertical rocket and requires no orbital assembly, while the downside would be a lower amount of support for kerbals, and increased weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LHACK4142","CreatedById":208897,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-22T03:09:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*agrees with 5-note Eridian chords*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-22T03:12:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224188993\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210205\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221666408194\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022208897\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LHACK4142\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 minute ago, LHACK4142 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*agrees with 5-note Eridian chords*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Eridians would just make a rigid Xenonite structure before dealing with messy snapping ropes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
