The goal is to increase the depth of the technology tree and create incentives to explore other celestial bodies. To do this, the game would have non-astronaut engineers and non-astronaut scientists who would work at the launch base itself in Kerbal.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey should be signed for an initial cost and also with an annual maintenance cost (career mode). Based on the reputation of our space agency, there would be more and more talented engineers and scientists to sign up. Scientists should be dedicated to projects that would unlock a technological branch: fuels, engines, structures, materials, communications, etc. Ideally, each scientist would have a specific vocation for a specific type of technology. Once the technology was developed, the engineers would be in charge of designing a first version of a part model (mk I) that was indicated (engine, structure, antenna ...) that could be improved in successive perfected versions (mk II, mk III ...) with higher capacities. Each version could be aimed at reducing manufacturing cost, increasing reliability, efficiency, performance...\u003Cbr\u003E\nTherefore, each scientist would dedicate himself to developing a single technological branch indicated to him, which would take time and would require certain data that would be collected thanks to the exploration. The more scientists, the more simultaneous technologies could be developed, but the higher the cost. Engineers, from each unlocked technology, could design various types of parts and could also improve existing parts. The more engineers dedicated to a part model, the less development time and the better results. Each piece would have a maximum limit of improvements. To make a piece, exotic materials could be needed that would have to be mined in other celestial bodies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pickleo","CreatedById":212094,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-29T20:28:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I feel would be nice is condition exclusive parts/modules on systems or planets becuase of their native conditions and materials. But I feel like you might just be able to farm parts by using time warp if you have a system where you get science from those little manually placed gizmos on planets and cash flow of some sort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
