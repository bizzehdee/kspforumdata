to the concept of a stage, but goes beyond mere launch and gets into the different logical sections of a craft well into a mission.\u00A0 The idea of being able to assign a label to these ELEMENTs and have that reflected in the staging list (though ELEMENTS aren\u0027t necessarily a simple linear stack later in the mission several undockings/dockings later) I really like the idea of labels within the stock staging list.\u00A0\u00A0 The more I think of it, the concept of labeling ELEMENTs, then be able to assign ELEMENTs to a stage (within logical reason by way of order order of decouplers and dock ports) like multiple radial ELEMENTS in symmetry that would still be in the same stage, for example.\u00A0 Again, an ELEMENT just being all the parts between a given set of decouplers/dockingports, whether the ports were mated in the editor or not an whether they\u0027ve been undocked/docked in flight or not\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
