The game should totally do that. Preferrably, completely disengage the internal aerodynamic calculations when the vehicle is outside the atmosphere so it wouldn\u0027t eat any unnecessary resources.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, I think I heard somewhere that the shuttle did flap the elevons around, but not when the control inputs were applied, of course, only passively. It was just because they disengaged the hydraulic actuators after leaving the atmosphere.
