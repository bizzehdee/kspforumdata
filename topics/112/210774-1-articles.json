Games that tend to have wildlife you interact with tend to be first person outside of a vehicle as that is where those one to one animal interactions tend to work best, ksp is a game to where youre in a vehicle the majority of the time and is third person. All controls are geared towards controlling yourself instead of interacting with your surroundings as that is what you will be doing in ksp, which means that there isnt really any controls to pet an animal or something like that. I dont feel like you could incorporate animals in a way that feel organic to the ksp experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LHACK4142","CreatedById":208897,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-25T04:36:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIsn\u0027t weather semi-confirmed already?
