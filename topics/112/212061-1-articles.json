I saw a new Parts Manager window, and it seems like a useful tool for managing your crafts. It, however, currently is too big, it has half of its height dedicated to list of parts types. I am afraid that more than three parts will not fit the screen. I\u0027ve got an idea that same tabs that are used in parts catalogue can be reused here. It will help with window size and will also be more intuitive, because the same icons and order can be used for the parts manager. It can look something like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bNmsNAO.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002285.92\u0022 height=\u0022770\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/bNmsNAO.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vl3d","CreatedById":219348,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-16T19:23:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm... not a bad idea.
