When I\u0027m looking at my contracts in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, I should be able to see how much each contract is worth and when the deadline is, so I don\u0027t have to keep exiting back to Mission Control to figure out whether adding extra capabilities to my spacecraft is the best use of time and money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ember12","CreatedById":217583,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-25T04:07:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you can already see contracts from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Flying Kerbal","CreatedById":171547,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-25T04:21:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, you can see what the contract is, but the original poster\u0027s correct, it doesn\u0027t show how much it\u0027s worth or the deadline.\u00A0 For that\u00A0 information, you must exit the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and pop into Mission Control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI actually agree with Austin1, it is annoying you can\u0027t bring this up when building a rocket, having to leave the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E just for a few seconds is something I find irritating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-25T05:51:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes it really matter? We don\u0027t know how the devs are going to do the progression for KSP2. All that was said was the career and science modes from KSP1 was scrapped and being replaced by their own progression system. It may include contracts, it may not. There maybe funds, there may not. (More than likely not. I\u0027ll explain below.) It may require science, it may not. We just don\u0027t know.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only thing that was said about the new\u00A0 progression mechanics is this; there will be no game mechanic induced fail states.

Presumably in a game where you might want to shuffle a few dozen kerbals into an interstellar colony vessel there would be some interface for crew management. My guess is these systems were still WIP as of last fall and they didn\u2019t want to get too far our over their skiis in public screenshots.
