I know I\u0027m not the only one who has clicked a button in the app menu only to have a different button appear under the mouse pointer which then receives the click.\u00A0 \u00A0People with very fast computers won\u0027t notice this issue so it is recommended to devs always include GUI testing on slower machines and slower net connections (where applicable). But not enabling elements until layout has settled is the standard solution to this issue that always works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) A mod accessible common pop-up window manager so popups can be arranged more intelligently.\u00A0 Like not popping up right under the only other existing pop-up already open. This also would resolve focus and click-through issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Irreversible \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003EPAW\u003C/abbr\u003E options like \u0022remove from symmetry\u0022 should either have a complimentary \u0022add to symmetry\u0022 or have a confirm dialog. And as noted in 1, should not be clickable anyway until the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003EPAW\u003C/abbr\u003E layout has settled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) The \u0022mental index\u0022 information should be prominent, not buried. Example, when looking at the list of alarms, the craft name for each alarm should be right there in the list, not buried such that one must either type the name into the title when creating the alarm, or edit the existing alarm and scroll down to see the craft name. But the point is general and the alarm app just an example; important flow information up front, not buried (or even inaccessible)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
