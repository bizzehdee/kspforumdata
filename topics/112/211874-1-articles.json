Entertainment boosts productivity and money, hospitals reduce colony deaths and allow babies to be born, a school generates money, and turns those kolonists into more developed roles at the cost of happiness, offices massively boost money at the downside of happiness. warehouses increase resource storage, ect. Feel free to smorgasboard ideas. Another thing is laws once it\u0027s big enough. You can certainly run well without them and they come with downsides but they provide bonuses. They are completely optional. Ones could be water-recycling, forced school, forced work, ect.

Colonies as you suggest implementing them would overstep these pillars and introduce management gameplay that does not need to be there. The only thing colonies need to do is collect resources and provide a place for players to launch ships - they shouldn\u0027t need to turn the game into a task of finding what ratio of entertaining buildings to research buildings to maintain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"greenville","CreatedById":225289,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-04T20:49:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, i thought about that.
