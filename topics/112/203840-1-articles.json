The most important thing a gameplay system/mechanic can do is give the player the opportunity to make meaningful decisions that impact their gameplay experience, single resource systems can easily do this while the current system does not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have to disagree with the premise of your argument. Having 3 currencies is not inherently more challenging than having 1 currency, adding these \u0022multiple constraints\u0022 is only guaranteed to add complexity, and complexity is not the same thing as challenge or difficulty. Nor does complexity inherently facilitate meaningful gameplay decisions, which is THE most important thing any gameplay system should do. While complexity, when done correctly and in the correct situation, can add these types of things to a game, more often than not the only thing it adds is unneeded tedium or clutter. I would argue the current career system does nothing to facilitate any kind of interesting or meaningful decision making. In many ways a single currency could be set up to be far more difficult or challenging than a 3 currency model, and present the player with much more meaningful decisions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAllow me to illustrate; what can you do with funds? Build vehicles, that\u0027s pretty much it and, if you turn it on, buy part unlocks. What can you do with science? Unlock techs. That\u0027s it. What can you do with reputation? No seriously anybody know what it\u0027s for??? Lol ok you use it to apply the policy things or whatever they are called which give various bonuses to your space program. Each resource is really only used for a single thing with no real overlap aside from turning on purchased part unlocking. This means the only real decision you need to make is \u0022do I save this resource or spend it now\u0022. If we consider the real world for a short moment, research costs money, in fact R\u0026amp;D costs are typically far far higher than manufacturing costs. Not that I think realism is a good argument to justify a game mechanic but consider the decision that has to be made, how much money do you devote to increasing production vs how much do you spend on developing something new. A single resource system would add more of this type of decision making to the game; having to decide how you want to allocate your resources, spend more building rockets, spend more researching new tech, or spend more now to add bonuses that increase how quickly you get more resources. This very very basic example where you just merge all of the resources to one without changing any of the other systems would still add some meaningful management decision making to the career experience, something which is currently very very lacking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother good example of this is the system in Kerbal Construction Time, one of the mods I typically can\u0027t play without now. For those that don\u0027t know it makes things take actual time; building vehicles, unlocking techs, and upgrading facilities is no longer instantaneous. It has a single resource that you can spend in a huge variety of ways, increase the production rate of rockets or increase the production rate of space planes, add additional production lines so that you can build multiple things at once, add and increase the science point reward you get for building vehicles, increase the speed at which new techs are unlocked etc. By adding this single resource to the game it gives the player a ton of choices that have a meaningful and tangible impact on their gameplay experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-07-23T22:11:10Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2021 10:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Akira_R\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kspnerd122","CreatedById":199169,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-26T14:08:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeres how I feel it should be, 1st off, players start off with similar tech to what we have now, however, players who want to unlock new technologies will need to go to places and examine things such as ruins of abandoned kerbal bases on the mun and minmus, on duna, the remains of a old rover, etc. pretty much, you find a anomaly, and then set up a outpost to examine it and get more technology after a few months to years.

I tend to agree there should be no more than 2 currencies. Technically speaking because parts will likely have resource costs (ore, uranium, fuel) you could even get away with zero.

It also incentivizes building colonies because the less enthusiasm you\u0027re spending on parts the more you can devote to research. The question for me is whether we want do ditch the idea of science experiments entirely? The other issue is what happens after the tech tree is complete and you\u0027re building almost everything off-world?

This might allow for different goals like landing on Eve or building a colony on Duna to have fine-tuned and tailored rewards, either in the form of tech unlocks, minerals, rare fuels, etc. While a really well balanced set of goals and rewards could be fun I worry this would be too inflexible for most players, as they\u0027d basically HAVE to do specific missions in a somewhat specific order in order to progress as they wished.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDifferent aspects of these could be swapped around or augmented.

Right now increasing reputation unlocks more ambitious and further flung contracts, but given that they\u0027re all random and no one particularly likes them its a bit of a moot point. Still, if there is a set\u00A0of more and more ambitious goals how are they being unlocked? Is it linear? or a tree? Or are there different levels?
