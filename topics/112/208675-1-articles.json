Duna would have approximate detail, Jool would just be a green sphere, and Eeloo\u0027s orbit isn\u0027t visible at all until the tracking station is upgraded. Once these places are visited at an appropriate distance, (not just skimming the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E) they appear in the map view as normal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
