The main question is, how do we make this physically possible, afterall ksp2 is a game that focuses on things being physically possible. This is the concept I came by to explain it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEarly on this planet was similar to Laythe, a moon with oceans heated by tidal heating, around a large gas giant. But then over time it got closer and closer, and the core got hotter and hotter. The tidal heating started slowly but steadily began heating up the surface, causing more and more water to evaporate.\u00A0 This high amount of rain causes the moon to undergo an intense rain cycle, where water boils in high amounts from the surface, radiatively cools down in the upper atmosphere, before raining down to restart the process. The planet is constantly surrounded by rainclouds, and the surface is hot, with active volcanoes and high amounts of fog and humidity. The constant intense rain causes massive amounts of erosion, water now goes down clearly defined paths, with rivers carving out intense canyons to deliver the water on what were high mountains to the oceans. The planet is nearing its end, but if it\u0027s the runaway greenhouse effect that it\u0027s undergoing currently, or it getting consumed by its gas giant will kill it first is unknown.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vl3d","CreatedById":219348,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-04T08:51:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRain.
