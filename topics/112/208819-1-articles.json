On top of that, resource scarcity always exists for development, even after release. Live service games have to carefully plan what they want to focus on for updates, and working on one update feature means delaying or cancelling another.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my personal opinion, it is not fair to expect the developers to put in such a complicated and expensive feature because the cost of putting in that feature is many other \u00A0 relevant features being delayed or never included. For boat parts, I think that feature has enough value and is easy enough to make that it is worth adding, and I think the same way for wind and a weather system. But if it comes to the level of Sea of Thieves, then that is too much. Same for boat parts, I\u0027d love to see them, but if suddenly a whole system of water flooding parts was added and there were other good features that could be made instead, it would not be worth it for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is not to say I would be unhappy with these changes; I would love to see realistically simulated waves and wind, and my computer can run it, so no complaints here. I would just not expect the developers to make that feature because I know that the cost is probably too large. There is a difference between wanting something and expecting it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-11T08:00:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224151888\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208819\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221657040492\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022219348\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vl3d\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/5/2022 at 7:01 PM, Vl3d said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou mean like in this 4 year old game?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xeQqWMDw7WU?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022Sea of Thieves - Fighting the Storm\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou really must have liked what happened with cyberpunk seeing how much effort you\u0027re putting in replicating it with KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vl3d","CreatedById":219348,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-11T11:09:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224153705\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208819\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221657526446\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002268648\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Master39\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Master39 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou really must have liked what happened with cyberpunk seeing how much effort you\u0027re putting in replicating it with KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh yes, I have ruined Cyberpunk and I will ruin KSP2 with my posts on the forum talking to the same 20 people about multiplayer, gameplay and graphics suggestions.
