Honestly, the ease at which people learn KSP is just all over the place, is what experience tells me, with no head or tail as to what factor really help or deters. Know a numbskull who took to it like a fish takes to water, while I know of someone else whom I would have expected to do very well but effectively ragequit forever after two hours. As long as the tutorials helps the most amount of people, the better, but you\u0027ll always lose some players no matter how well they are crafted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-12-14T20:56:27Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2021 08:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Axelord FTW\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TLTay","CreatedById":184633,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-14T21:17:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think there are many people who are born with an understanding of how to adjust orbits or do orbital rendezvous.
