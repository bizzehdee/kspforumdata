A surface colony on Venus wouldn\u0027t exactly be easy to make, as it would have to contend with extreme weather.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s what I suggest. On Duna, you couldn\u0027t rely solely on solar panels, since sandstorms could form. On Eve, you have to contend with temperature, pressure and possibly acid storms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA floating colony on Jool (assuming the atmosphere could be chlorine) can withstand unbelievably powerful winds, and an oxidizing atmosphere. Even planets with little or no atmosphere would not be as safe as it would have to deal with radiation and possible asteroid rains (On planets like Dres this would be frequent, since they are in an asteroid belt, or even moons that are inside the rings of some planet). Also on Jool, colonies on its moons would have to face the radiation that Jool itself possesses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA good way to prepare is to predict what might happen, with weather stations being built. Weather balloons could also be launched.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis could bring a significantly greater challenge to building colonies.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-11-25T13:22:26Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2022 01:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Dragorans\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EPrecision changes\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-25T14:50:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese changes would be cool and I would like to play with them\u2026 as a mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first reason is that a lot of these require extra background computation, and things like dynamic weather systems are very intense to model.
