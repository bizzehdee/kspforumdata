I think that the game would lose a lot of it\u0027s lego-ness that I love so dearly. To be fair, it could definitely be useful in reducing part count and making rockets a bit more custom, but again, I think the \u0022slap-it-all-together\u0022 nature is somewhat diminished when using procedural tanks and boosters. Also, a big challenge in KSP1, and likely again in KSP2, is being able to build what you can with the parts on-hand, and that is also messed up a bit when procedurals are introduced. If, however, they have limited presets (similar to those structural tube pieces in KSP1), or can be limited by what tech level you are at, I could get on board with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as SRBs go, however, I think and interesting solution would be to instead add solid fuel sections that can customize the burn time or thrust to a certain degree.

My thoughts about procedaural parts:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Vehicle structural integrity is part-based; the connection strength between parts. So if we are able make very long procedural fuel tank, it would still be a very sturdy part because it is a single part. I am not sure if the devs would want it this way because they seem to like wobbly vehicles a lot.
