Wubslin has a point that gameplay between players involving tension is fun (I personally want to play like that and would like some features in line with that) and shdwrld has a point that adding features specifically for that sort of gameplay is not what KSP is about. So, to propose a third option, the game could have tools which are useful for the core gameplay experience but can be creatively adapted to use for other things. Currently if I want to make a weapon, I can make an unguided one, and with the new explosions in KSP 2 I could make something more destructive than a mk. 0 fuselage. However, the options from there are limited. Here are a few examples of features that could be suitable for both gameplay and inter-player conflict\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) mining tools causing damage to parts. This is a good feature to have for regular gameplay to avoid having players put fuel tanks and other things in the way of their mining lasers, and it could be used to damage other players\u2019 parts. No guidance however.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) trajectory planners. We know that baristochrone trajectories will be part of the game. If speeding up and then slowing down can be calculated, then permanently speeding up can also be calculated. This is useful because when sending probes to recon other systems, you do not need to slow down while flying by, and it will help to keep accelerating. Additionally, this planner can target craft with a sufficiently powerful probe core.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthese are relatively bad ideas but you can see that some features could fit into the stock game and be used for conflict without being designed for it. I already think that with the new technologies presented in KSP 2 there is more than enough opportunity for creative destruction machines, but I also understand wanting some more tools to be able to use.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ember12","CreatedById":217583,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-02T18:38:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can make a guided missile, with stock
