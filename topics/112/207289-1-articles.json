I had an idea: what if Kerbals constantly talked about random things during their mission (probably with Chatterer or something similar), creating audio logs similar to these for us to read?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love games with little mechanics that make everyone seem interesting and unique through conversation. Even management and strategy games can pull them off sometimes (for whatever reason, the main one that comes to mind is the Bitbook system from the mobile app Tiny Tower, where all the tower residents would post on a Facebook analogue about the tower, eachother, and themselves). My idea is something where a massive list of pre-written conversations creates audio logs between the kerbals on the ship or in the colony, as well as including Mission Control sometimes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would include a little layer of fascination and intrigue to your experience of your kerbals, making them feel as if they were actually there doing things, and potentially even giving them personalities to which their responses in the conversation stick to. This would make KSP2 feel so friendly and immersive, I feel. Combo\u0027d with a Chatterer analogue, it could make for some interesting vibes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven more so, the conversations don\u0027t have to be random talking about mustard on sandwiches (I swear that was an actual conversation in one of the Apollo logs), but also context-aware stuff, like talking about upcoming maneuvers, relaying descent information to Mission Control, or spotting celestial bodies out windows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s an example of what an audio log for a Jool mission might look like, as well as some notes to let you guys know how I think it would work:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Starts with a random filler conversation, using the crew names to input the participants)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E[1034:04:19:16]\u003C/b\u003E Jebediah Kerman: I think it\u0027s interesting how we don\u0027t really know who\u0027s out there.

This would add a lot of life to the game, as it feels like your space program is actually doing the things you are doing, planning the same maneuvers and executing the same planned or unplanned burns.

I mute the ambient sounds, game music, and patched out all other sounds because I find them annoying and I don\u0027t want to go deaf. (Listening to the same frequency all the time, you can become numb to that frequency.)

If it were just text \u002B random gibberish, the only difference would be in the audio log, which you likely wouldn\u0027t be able to read unless you opened its menu, nor would rely upon or be distracted by if something happens. Although, human speech is still an interesting idea.

The amount of text and audio that would have to be transcribed to different languages would be enormous. I don\u2019t think I know of any game except maybe Hades that translates that much text, and forget about audio entirely. However, if it were to be implemented, I think it would completely change the game and add a whole new dimension to the world.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re right about this, I completely forgot languages were a thing.

There is still a bunch of typical situations and operations that dialog would have to be written for. That is if you real want to use a real language. If you continue to do the reverse Spanish gibberish, you really don\u0027t have to worry about the different spoken languages.
