( or on purpose destroy it )\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen it would be nice if there was a server side insurance system that detect damage from an external source and then help the player get a refund.. Lets face it rockets and fuel is expensive and sometimes allot of money and time is invested in example a space station.\u003Cbr\u003E\n( and ofcourse the possibility that players can transfer money to each other so we can buy example fuel from each others supply depots. Personaly i would find it interesting to offer a refuel service in space for x money ).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BekfastDerp13","CreatedById":214450,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-19T13:40:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like this idea.
