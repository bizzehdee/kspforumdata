On nicely designed planes with powerful engine, I can hit Mach 1 or even 2 without going at full throttle, which emphasizes aerodynamic plane design.

Fortunately, we have that in real life, using electricity to convert air directly into thrust.

These would serve as both highly energy efficient (though energy intensive) and fast electric engines, capable of acting in any atmosphere (maybe have a ramjet style one that can work in thin atmospheres at very fast speeds, or just have a single plasma thruster with all those niches) with high efficiencies and no need for fuel. Plasma aircraft engines could also easily serve as an advanced RAPIER engine which can use any fuel (no need to carefully manage ratios of oxygen and jet fuel anymore!) and can air breath, however at the cost of electricity consumption.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-07-16T02:14:10Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2022 02:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Strawberry\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BowlerHatGuy3","CreatedById":222738,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-16T04:13:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224155199\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208752\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221657932283\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022167617\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JadeOfMaar\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, JadeOfMaar said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are no pure ramjets, though.
