But also don\u0027t underestimate how habitable the larger universe might be. Every solar system will have a habitable belt at the right distance from the sun. Our sun\u0027s extends from almost Venus\u0027 orbit to almost Mars\u0027 orbit. There\u0027s a good chance any main sequence or even red dwarf star with planets has one or two inside it\u0027s habitable belt. Also keep in mind that earth\u0027s atmosphere wasn\u0027t what it is now when life arose. Compositionally it was similar to Mars or Venus. Early life itself turned the CO2 into Oxygen. Life might be possible in conditions very very different than we are used to. Even on earth, life exists in almost every environmental condition. From tropical rainforest, frozen tundra, deep ocean vents, and dry deserts. So life could be possible on worlds much drier, much colder, much hotter, much wetter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I would be super interested in, is seeing different kinds of life.
