Liquids have three main design advantages that I know of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- ease of shutdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- burn control by proper fuel mix measurements is adjustable, rather than having to ensure the solid fuel is uniform enough to give the correct burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the fuel tank being separate from the combustion chamber, allowing the tank to be lighter. It only has to withstand fuel pressure, not combustion pressure. This is somewhat offset by the need for fuel pressurization, pumping, and other support equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, they are much harder to design well, because they tend to rely on 10 different things all working perfectly, instead of 2 or 3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocketry history has been made time and time again with both types. Many unmanned launchers today use solids at some point in their stages, the shuttle and some proposed manned future launchers use them as first-stage additional boost, and the SpaceShip One \u0026amp; Two designs by Scaled Composites use a hybrid liquid oxidizer/solid fuel rocket for their manned launches. I\u0027d say both can have a place in your KSP program even if you\u0027re trying to fly missions in a very non-Kerbal way!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlong the same lines, if you\u0027re really serious about launch safety, keep track of your total number of launches and fatal ones. If you can manage fewer than 1 fatal accident per 70 launches, you\u0027re doing better than the shuttle did (2 out of 135.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
