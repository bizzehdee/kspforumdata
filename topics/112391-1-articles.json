The debug menu can be used to spawn new *specific* contracts (I frequently use it to get the \u0022Explore Minmus\u0022 one, which absolutely refuses to show up on its own) but unfortunately I don\u0027t believe there\u0027s a way to use it to just spawn a random contract. I suppose it\u0027s not a problem if you only ever do one mission at a time, but I\u0027d love to see a mod/cheat/config edit/whatever that changes the way this works, or at least raises that upper limit to more like twenty or thirty for those of us who use KCT and KAC and like to multi-task."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T06:05:32Z","Content":"As always, back up your files first.\n\nGo to GameData\\Squad\\Contracts\\Contracts.cfg, find AverageAvailableContracts value.
