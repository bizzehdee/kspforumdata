In reality, you\u0027d want even more than that, because the 1.64 number assumes that they\u0027re pointed directly at the Sun, and none of them are shaded at all from any part of your spacecraft. Usually you won\u0027t have that ideal unless you do a lot of manual fiddling. So I\u0027d say play it safe and get like 6 of them, it\u0027s not like they weigh much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso: Any particular reason you\u0027re using the 2x3 instead of the 1x6? I almost always use the 1x6, mainly because they\u0027re good at putting as much of their area as far away from the main body of the ship as possible, which means that they\u0027re less likely to get shaded by their own ship. Plus I can densepack them closer together without having them collide with each other.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrDude","CreatedById":134194,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T00:16:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen Building you can right click on the items in the parts menu and it will give Charge units per unit time (sometimes seconds sometimes minutes). Tally up all the draws you plan to have running simultaneously (including probe cores and SAS). Once you have a units per second draw, pick solar panels up to that task with a little more for battery charging. Note that you should only count the panels that can see the sun simultaneously (so single square panels on opposite or 4 sides of the ship - only one counts). Be conservative since based on your positioning the panels may only get a fraction of their power so you want either to have it easy to align your station to the sun, or allow enough light to be caught at all angles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen guesstimate (or research how to find) the amount of time your planned orbit will be in darkness.

Panel performance varies with distance to the sun, the nominal output is accurate for a panel near Kerbin\u0027s solar altitude and pointed directly at the sun. Output drops off with distance from the sun as well as angle to the sun. In practical terms, you\u0027re only rarely getting full output from panels, without actively keeping the panels aligned perfectly (including for rotating panels, as they only rotate on 1 axis).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn orbit around Kerbin, a couple of the Gigantor XL arrays is what you really want for a lab, and I personally prefer 4 of them in a \u002B shape, so that I don\u0027t have to worry about the orientation of the lab (with 2, you\u0027ll have no output if they are close to perfectly end-on to the sun).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget to bring enough battery for the long cold dark nights, and eclipses. I like about 5\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015310k of battery for a Kerbin lab. Minimum is probably about 4k-ish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, basically if you\u0027re going to Duna or beyond, make sure you have too much panel at Kerbin. And, wherever you\u0027re going, too much is just a tiny amount of extra fuel getting there, too little is a major pain or even a failed mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T09:24:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs I\u0027ve notice recently beware of ecplises, espectially around Duna.
