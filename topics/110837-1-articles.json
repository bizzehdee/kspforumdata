There was plenty of fuel left so I sent it to Minmus. I collected some science and put it in the processing lab but I don\u0027t have enough power to run the lab. I have two **OX-4W 2x3 Photovoltaic Panels** but they can\u0027t keep up. How do I know how much I am generating and how much I need?\n\nI turned off all the lights and the SAS but the lab needs a lot more power than I expected.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T00:17:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 12:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Invader Jim**"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T00:14:31Z","Content":"Yeah, the science lab is a real bear for electricity when it\u0027s researching. Turning off lights won\u0027t help you much (their power drain is tiny), nor will SAS (it doesn\u0027t use a lot of power unless you\u0027re actively spinning around).\n\nQuickest way to determine energy needs is to look it up on the KSP wiki, e.g.:\n\n[http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Mobile_Processing_Lab_MPL-LG-2](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Mobile_Processing_Lab_MPL-LG-2)\n\n(5 EC/second researching)\n\n...compared with the energy from the solar panels:\n\n[http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/OX-4W_3x2_Photovoltaic_Panels](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/OX-4W_3x2_Photovoltaic_Panels)\n\n(1.64 EC/second at Kerbin\u0027s distance from sun)\n\n...which says you need slightly more than 3 of them to keep up. In reality, you\u0027d want even more than that, because the 1.64 number assumes that they\u0027re pointed directly at the Sun, and none of them are shaded at all from any part of your spacecraft. Usually you won\u0027t have that ideal unless you do a lot of manual fiddling. So I\u0027d say play it safe and get like 6 of them, it\u0027s not like they weigh much.\n\nAlso: Any particular reason you\u0027re using the 2x3 instead of the 1x6? I almost always use the 1x6, mainly because they\u0027re good at putting as much of their area as far away from the main body of the ship as possible, which means that they\u0027re less likely to get shaded by their own ship. Plus I can densepack them closer together without having them collide with each other."},{"CreatedByName":"MrDude","CreatedById":134194,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T00:16:22Z","Content":"When Building you can right click on the items in the parts menu and it will give Charge units per unit time (sometimes seconds sometimes minutes). Tally up all the draws you plan to have running simultaneously (including probe cores and SAS). Once you have a units per second draw, pick solar panels up to that task with a little more for battery charging. Note that you should only count the panels that can see the sun simultaneously (so single square panels on opposite or 4 sides of the ship - only one counts). Be conservative since based on your positioning the panels may only get a fraction of their power so you want either to have it easy to align your station to the sun, or allow enough light to be caught at all angles. \n\nThen guesstimate (or research how to find) the amount of time your planned orbit will be in darkness. Make sure you have more than that time periods amount of power draw in the batteries. That way when in shadow of the planet and or moon your draws will be fed by battery, then be fed by your panels with a little extra planned in for charging the batteries.\n\nThat should do it.![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T00:16:33Z","Content":"MODULE\n\n {\n\n name = ModuleScienceConverter\n\n scientistBonus = 0.25 //Bonus per scientist star - need at least one!

That still wasn\u0027t enough when I had 450 data to process - it ran out at about 70% complete so I had to wait for it to regenerate."},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T08:20:54Z","Content":"Something that must also be considered is how close the craft will be to the sun on its mission. Panel performance varies with distance to the sun, the nominal output is accurate for a panel near Kerbin\u0027s solar altitude and pointed directly at the sun. Output drops off with distance from the sun as well as angle to the sun. In practical terms, you\u0027re only rarely getting full output from panels, without actively keeping the panels aligned perfectly (including for rotating panels, as they only rotate on 1 axis).\n\nIn orbit around Kerbin, a couple of the Gigantor XL arrays is what you really want for a lab, and I personally prefer 4 of them in a \u002B shape, so that I don\u0027t have to worry about the orientation of the lab (with 2, you\u0027ll have no output if they are close to perfectly end-on to the sun).\n\nDon\u0027t forget to bring enough battery for the long cold dark nights, and eclipses. I like about 5\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015310k of battery for a Kerbin lab. Minimum is probably about 4k-ish.\n\nSo, basically if you\u0027re going to Duna or beyond, make sure you have too much panel at Kerbin. And, wherever you\u0027re going, too much is just a tiny amount of extra fuel getting there, too little is a major pain or even a failed mission."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T09:24:04Z","Content":"As I\u0027ve notice recently beware of ecplises, espectially around Duna.
