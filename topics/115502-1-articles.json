I am having a very difficult time getting this spacecraft into orbit. My plan is to get it orbital, refuel it in orbit, fly to laythe land a refuel there, then fly back to kerbin with all the science! I am assuming if it can get orbital on kerbin it should be able to get orbital on Laythe. Currently I am trying to get it into orbit without a full load of fuel, since it will be refueled there. My question is, is there something I can do to reduce the drag? did I do the \u0022rapier-spike\u0022 correctly? Is it just horribly underpowered? pics as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/UN3IY\u0022 alt=\u0022UN3IY\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/zqhpfgzz06fduuj/Aquarius%20MkIIIa.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/zqhpfgzz06fduuj/Aquarius%20MkIIIa.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BaneOfPilots","CreatedById":61884,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T21:36:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Hm, I can\u0027t seem to make the album for imgur.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T21:38:48Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 09:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BaneOfPilots\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"renevatio","CreatedById":147770,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T21:42:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHopefully this works\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/UN3IY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/UN3IY\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"soulreaver1981","CreatedById":38542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T23:08:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Epro tip go to 1.0.4 and start over.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"renevatio","CreatedById":147770,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T04:34:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWent to 1.0.4 and got within 250 m/s of orbit. Surely someone with better piloting skills should be able to make this thing orbital. Its payload isn\u0027t that much.
