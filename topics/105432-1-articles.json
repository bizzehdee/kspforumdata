So many complaints about 1.0, no one complimenting the new aerodynamics model, the hard effort in creating it, or anything happy in general. Despite looking at these forums depressing me, I personally enjoy the new patch. The new parts are amazing, and fun to play around with. The interiors are just superb, nothing else to say about them. I for one am just happy about the fairings because of their stellar looks and good functionality, despite their mass, which is greatly offset by the new practically no-drag atmosphere. I just wanted to say thanks squad for all of your hard work! Hope we can get a few bugs fixed, but a lot of content and new things to play around with! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T23:59:12Z","Content":"Nah.\n\n I\u0027m enjoying the changes so far.
