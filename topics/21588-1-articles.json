Because the area behind the KSC runway is not perfectly flat, it tends to want to take off and set new air speed records instead. The wings are flipped upside-down so, according to the SPH lift indicator, they provide the necessary downforce. After that is was just a matter of dialing the power down to prevent catastrophic failures: The XL-1 and XL-2 used large booster which were simply too powerful to make for a survivable run.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
