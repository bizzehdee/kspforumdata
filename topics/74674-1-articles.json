You do need giant engines to lift the massively-overpowered and overweight orbiters seen in KSP. Realworld spacecraft have on-orbit deltaV of perhaps 300m/s and most of that is needed for de-orbiting.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell that\u0027s true, I normally try and take more fuel than I\u0027m gonna need.
