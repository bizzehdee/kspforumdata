The only mod I used is the Mk2 Expansion that is actually where this SSTO shines, it can go to orbit because of the Two-State Air Intake and the ESTOC engine parts. This is also is a VTOL ONLY SSTO, because only uses the engine in close-cycle mode, 2 airbrakes and 8 vernor thrusters to land after a reentry.\n\nAlso if you want to proof that it can go to orbit here\u0027s a [Small Imgur Album](http://imgur.com/a/OeBNW)\n\n[DOWNLOAD](http://kerbalx.com/Overlocker/Photon-Torpedo-SSTO)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T15:46:54Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 03:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Overlocker**"}]}
