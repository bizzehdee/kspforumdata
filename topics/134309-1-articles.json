But I always felt something was missing. As interesting and exciting as it was seeing mission highlights, when I built my rockets, I always wondered \u0022Why did he do that? Why not do something else?\u0022 and \u0022I wonder how he designed that? What engines did he use?\u0022 and so on. But obviously that\u0027s far too much to cram into a 20-30 minute episode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut after having played RP-0 for a while, I figured \u0022Well, surely others are wondering the same?\u0022, and so I gradually decided that since noone\u0027d done it, perhaps I should be the one? I\u0027ve watched some streamers of other games, and find I always gravitate towards the livestream format of players who know what they\u0027re doing and basically think out loud as they\u0027re playing, so you get to learn why they do as they do, and sometimes also figure out some of the finer nuances of very complex games. And RP-0 is very complex.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo obviously, a livestream would be the answer, and indeed this series is sort of a re-livestream, but I take far too many breaks to livestream, and I never set specific times, so livestreams just aren\u0027t an option. Also, I don\u0027t want to restrict it to people who are watching, which noone will be since noone knows me.\u003Cbr\u003E\nInstead I\u0027ve just recorded myself playing, trying to make my thoughts audible, and this is the result. No editing, no missing that one vital bit I thought noone would care about. Just a rather meticulous guy playing a very complex game and explaining why he does what he does, and what measures he takes to fix his mistakes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI apologise for the poor microphone quality. There\u0027s a fair bit of background noise, so I set up a noise gate filter, but I might have to fiddle a bit more with it, because sometimes it eats a bit of the speech.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EThe game\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is RP-0 on normal difficulty, but with all game options turned off, so no reverting, no respawning kerbals and having to pay entry costs etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve set myself the restriction of playing only with American engines (since I normally play with Soviet engines and design around their philosophy), and while I have a ton of mods, I won\u0027t (read: will only very rarely)\u00A0be using anything (such as Saturn V tanks, interstages etc.)\u00A0but procedural parts for most of my rockets. Probe cores and pods are an exception. But you\u0027ll probably still find my rockets somewhat resemble the real life counterparts to some degree thanks to RO and TestFlight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe goal? Getting as far out there as possible eventually! I take things one step at a time, focusing on select space programs with well defined goals before moving on to the next ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this thread I\u0027ll post updates on the missions and links to the videos. Because I do videos, I won\u0027t be posting screenshots. I\u0027d tried to get GameFramer KSP to work, because it\u0027s a lovely addition to my own mission log, but sadly I had some issues where it\u0027d record the small bits of video and the highlights alright, but would fail to note down things such as max altitude, speed etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMission log:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YauwWoZO7qMTdKOs6Te68RKRn_tbZA38KqtXXapkluk/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YauwWoZO7qMTdKOs6Te68RKRn_tbZA38KqtXXapkluk/edit?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBootnote: I realise this format isn\u0027t for everyone, and I don\u0027t aim for it to be.

This program is likely to continue for a while after getting orbital capabilities too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause of the recent changes to the TestFlight-config for the WAC Corporal, I have to adjust the design of the first sounding rockets. Gone are the days of 2 minute burn times, it\u0027s been reduced to the more realistic 50s. So we design the first of the Mjolnir series of sounding rockets for the task.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur first mission has the goals of breaking the Karman line and getting thermometer and barometer data from Earth\u0027s lower and upper atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the changes immediately cause\u00A0issues because the TWR is much higher than I\u0027m used to, which means we run headfirst into a very high dynamic pressure on ascent, and the massive drag makes our rocket wobble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually, by the time we get to the Mjolnir 1b, we\u0027ve fixed our design issues. We also realise that we won\u0027t get higher than about 80km, due to the low delta-v.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo we design the Mjolnir 1c, which should be able to reach 250-300km, provided nothing goes wrong. But we\u0027re also going way above the intended burn time for the WAC Corporal, deciding on 75s, which gives us nearly 3k delta-v.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe SR 4-mission is the first to use this stretched design, and the mission goal is to pass the Karman line, get into space and get thermometer and barometer data, but it suffers from early engine shutdown. The same happens with the SR 5 and the SR 6, but eventually I notice that the data units we collect for TestFlight aren\u0027t being persisted, and I opt to go with \u0022Parts always have maximum data\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat gives the SR 7-mission, still using the Mjolnir 1c, a much better chance of success. However, 21s after lighting the WAC Corporal, it suffers a loss of thrust. But fortunately it has so much TWR that it can continue its flight, and we definately won\u0027t see any high dynamic pressure here. Of course it loses a lot of delta-v to gravity instead, but it makes to 152km, and we consider the mission a success nonetheless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nParallel to this, after we got the first science, we started researching Early Supersonic Flight, and bought into the X1 Cockpit as well as the XLR-11. This allowed us to design the Y1 plane for the X1 program, which took quite a while of fiddling around with B9 Procedural Wings. Eventually we found what we consider a pretty good design and went to test it, where it performed well above expectations, and should set the stage for some nice records in the next episode. Why not now? Because it took time to research, and because I\u0027ve not sunk many build points into the SPH, it\u0027ll take quite a while to build as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVideo (My microphone was muted for the last hour, so I had to do post commentary):\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/hBErAZZbPxg?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-16T09:07:30Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2016 09:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by a_schack\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EVideo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-17T02:12:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks great!

Three actually.\u00A0First surprise was that KSP crashed after 15 minutes. That turned out to be because it was trying to address memory above 16GB. Oh well, interesting limit. Lowered RSS textures and tossed out an unneeded mod, and that should be sorted. Second surprise was that sound was missing from the first 15 minutes too. Turns out that was me unticking audio from the first bit in the video editor, so it\u0027s re-rendering with audio now and will be uploaded once done. As for the last surprise... well, read on. At least it\u0027s a positive one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe immediately start working on where to go next. As we can pick up the strategy \u0022To Boldly Go...\u0022 and get 15k for each new biome we transmit science from, we do just that and set about getting science from them. Because we\u0027ve exhausted the use of a barometer for now, it\u0027ll just be temperature readings, but that\u0027s ok too. We\u0027ll get some science and some money while passing time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe SR 8 is a Mjolnir 1c like the SR 4-7, but this one\u0027s angled slightly east and, if successful, will get temperature readings from the lower and higher atmosphere as well as lower space for both shores and ocean. In order to get science from the desert and possibly mountains, we take an exact copy of that, also angled east, and start building it in Vandenberg as the SR 9. Finally we build\u00A0a completely upright Mjolnir 1c for the SR 10 mission\u00A0at Kodiak in order to catch the poles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat should take care of getting us more science and the money from our new strategy, but we want more. We want to break records. We\u0027ve only just made it into space, and that\u0027s with a rocket which is pushing the envelope with regards to burn times, so it\u0027s a bit unreliable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for the Mjolnir 2, we take a different approach. We base it off the Mjolnir 1c, but we widen it at the bottom and stretch it a bit, so we can fit 3 WAC Corporals (with 3 Tiny Tim boosters underneath), and make sure it won\u0027t surpass the rated 50s burn time. This however means it has oodles of thrust, and the TWR is through the roof, which again means we\u0027ll suffer from silly amounts of dynamic pressure - to the tune of over 80 kPa. This means that, if all\u0027s well, it won\u0027t even get to more than 350km despite having the delta-v for far more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s where the Mjolnir 2a enters. It\u0027s a stretched Mjolnir 2, which lowers TWR and ups delta-v at the cost of risk, as we set it up for a 76s burn time. But sims show it\u0027ll at least get to 530km if it survives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a fit of random ingenuity, we decide that a hybrid might be a good idea to get even further up - and hopefully be more reliable, though we don\u0027t hold too high hopes. So a Mjolnir 1c without boosters or fins\u00A0as an upper stage mated to a Mjolnir 2 as a lower stage. That should make for a nice spectacle. The risks are high though, even though we stick to the 50s burn time. If one engine on the Mjolnir 2 stage fails, we\u0027ll get asymmetrical thrust, and it\u0027s likely to all end in tears. We\u0027ll take our chances though. We call it the Mjolnir 3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow can we get around this then? By mimicking history! A Mjolnir 1c - again without boosters or fins - sitting on top of a completely newly designed A-4 stage with enough fuel to hit exactly the 70s rated burn time. We\u0027re rather conservative here, but this is untrodden land. The Mjolnir 4 is born, with its highly innovative active spin stabilization \u00A0system (ASSS(tm)). Sims show that it just barely fails to hit 2000km, so if we want to get further than that, we\u0027ll either have to push it beyond the design limits, or wait until we get the NAA-75-100.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe end our design workshop here, because while I could just go on and on and on designing, I am supposed to fly them as well. At least, the game thinks I should!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBetween this and launching them, an update for TestFlight was released, fixing the annoying bug we encountered with not getting data units for the WAC Corporal. See the release notes for 1.5.3, to see what it was. I hacked my savegame to give myself a bit of the data units I should\u0027ve gotten, but it turned out I valued them rather pessimistically. A single launch with a 60s burn gave us 800 du, but oh well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was time to launch the SR 8 mission and get science from the shores and the ocean, but sadly we suffered an early shutdown and only made it to 60km. We did get temperature readings over the shores in both low and high atmosphere though, but it we still classified it as a failure.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe re-made the mission as SR 15 and put it on the highest priority, and when it was launched on Day 157, it was after all a success. We did suffer an early loss of thrust coupled with some weird biome behaviour, which means that we didn\u0027t get temperature readings from space over the shores, but we got all the oceanic readings we needed as we got to 173km, breaking both altitude and speed records in the process. We decide to not send up any more Mjolnir 1c rockets for temperature readings from Cape Canaveral.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust prior to that, we launch our first plane for the X1-1 mission. The mission is simple: Get to above 15km and maintain a speed higher than 350m/s for a minute in order to satisfy the contract. We\u0027ve already proven this in simulations, and it goes without a hitch, and we touch down with the aid of parachutes right next to the strategy office.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plane\u0027s recovered with KCT for a swift turnaround, so we can send it on the X1-2 mission, but we run into a known problem: When editing it in the SPH, it\u0027s outside the building, and we can\u0027t see it. Thanks to some input from the KCT thread (see page 82), we hack our savegame a bit more, so we can refuel our Y1 plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nX1-2 will be a mission of unknown quantities. We figure that since we still have about a minute worth of fuel left after getting to 15km at a 45 degree climb, it should probably be able to get to 25km - at least 20km. So we set off, and with the magic of Autopilot Module Manager do an easy climbout. And we climb and climb and climb. And as we get past 15km we see that 20km is easy, and so\u0027s 25km. But we keep climbing and we keep picking up so much speed that even when our engines cut out we\u0027ve made it to well past mach 2 (727m/s)\u00A0and we keep on climbing until we reach 44km. After that it\u0027s just about trying to control it using our subsonic rated wings and control surfaces. We somehow manage it, and when we get subsonic we turn around and head back towards the KSC. Sadly our dive was very, very steep and we dared not push our poor control surfaces too much, so we just didn\u0027t have the altitude to glide\u00A0the roughly 70km back. The plane splashes down on the water using parachutes again, but this time we recover it normally, as we decide to put an end to our X1 program - we simply can\u0027t see a way to improve on this resounding success with the current hardware at our disposal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoing forward, short of waiting for the X15 parts, I can only see two ways of pushing this further: Either we stretch it, but I\u0027m uncertain how much more we\u0027ll get from that. The alternative is to launch it on top of a rocket, but that will almost certainly require me to invest in the supersonic wings and control surfaces, and they cost 10k each. It\u0027ll also present some interesting challenges as it\u0027ll have both a center of drag ahead of the center of mass, not to mention a (at least slightly) offset center of mass due to the tailplane. I might do it, or I might not. It\u0027s also worth noting that the X1 cockpit isn\u0027t rated for more than mach 3, and we\u0027ve already made it to mach 2.5. And we had an awful time trying to control our dive as we dropped from our 44km altitude. By we in this case, I mean our fly-by-wire system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut that concludes it for this part. Since I\u0027m on vacation, the updates will probably be pretty frequent over the next week or two, after which it\u0027ll settle down with\u00A0a slightly slower pace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-17T17:30:42Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2016 05:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by a_schack\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"a_schack","CreatedById":158392,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-19T15:39:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEpisode 3: Getting into orbit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/kmuFl2iIQ-4?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore we start worrying about getting into orbit, we still have a number of sounding rockets still to go up using our new designs. We\u0027ve designed the Mjolnir 2, 2a, 3 and 4, and they\u0027re all in the build queue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst up is SR 11, which is a Mjolnir 2 with the goal of getting up to 340km. While we do break our existing altitude record, we don\u0027t get close to our goal as all three engines set out over the duration of the flight. Hardly a surprise with the WAC Corporal. The surprising thing is that we have enough spin on it that the uneven thrust doesn\u0027t make it wobble much, so we do get to 212km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n20 days later it\u0027s the Mjolnir 2a - the stretched Mjolnir 2 - to go up on the SR 12 mission with the intention of getting above 500km. This was flown yesterday, so the latest updates to Realism Overhaul, namely that you can get a major fault after a small one, were not implemented. So despite us losing thrust on two of the engines and the third shutting down, we just made it to 506km, which means a successful mission!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally we unlock Early Orbital Rocketry, and it\u0027s time to go and design our first orbit capable launch vehicle. We decide to have a design contest with ourselves instead of just using the first orbit capable rocket we can design. The reason? Well, there are a couple. First off, I\u0027ve mainly been playing with the soviet engines and haven\u0027t actually used the NAA-75-100 A-6 before, so my usual design might not work and so I want to test a few different ones. Secondly, rated burn times have been reduced for these early engines, so I can\u0027t use my normal design here either. And lastly, I want to test out a few different types.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe first design the Phantom 1a\u00A0candidate, which is based off how I used to design my first orbital rocket with the RD-103 as a booster with some liquid upper stages and one or more Baby Sergeant kick stages. This turns out to be a terrible mess, which ends up with an A-6, AJ10-37, AJ10-27, another AJ10-27, an 11x Baby Sergeant Cluster, 3x BS cluster, 1x and finally 1x Baby Sergeant. A total - when including ullage, separation and everything else - of 38 parts across 20 stages!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the horror that is the Phantom 1a, we make the Phantom 1b candidate. This one\u0027s meant to be simplicity itself, and that\u0027s what we eventually achieve. An A-6 booster with 3 upper stages; AJ10-37, AJ10-27 and finally XASR-1. We choose the XASR-1 for the kick stage because it has better isp than the AJ10-27 and we don\u0027t need the thrust. A measly 32 parts in just 7 stages. And even better, it has both excess delta-v and doesn\u0027t run for the full rated burn time, making it less susceptible to failures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe were supposed to make another candidate, the Phantom 1c, using radial boosters with Vanguard x405 engines, but after seeing how simple and easy it can be done with the Phantom 1b, we decide to not bother.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo instead we test fly the Phantom 1b. I\u0027d imagined it\u0027d take at least a few flights to dial it in with MechJeb Ascent Guidance, fiddling with turn end and turn shape parameters, but my default parameters of 160km and 40% just work perfectly, and it gets into a highly eccentric orbit without any issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo we re-christen it the Phantom 1 and set it building, prioritising it over anything else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the 251st day of the first year, the time has come to reach our first major milestone - hopefully! Mentally we\u0027re prepared to write off the first couple of missions as the engines are still quite untested, and we\u0027ll probably be needing to break them in. So much to our surprise, astonishment and pride, the very first attempt at putting an artificial satellite into orbit goes off without a hitch. The excess delta-v means we achieve an orbit of 186x1828km, and after the mandatory celebrations, we set up about doing temperature scans and gathering telemetry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an almost afterthought, we design\u00A0the Mjolnir 1d, which is a stretched Mjolnir 1c with the upgraded XASR-1 engine which will be used for the SR 16 mission. The goal is to finally get those temperature readings in lower space above the poles, so we\u0027re off course building it at Kodiak. We could\u0027ve just sent up another Mjolnir 1c, but the miserable reliability of the WAC Corporal caused us to wait until we got the XASR-1. I dare not think what WAC stands for...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn this high note we end episode 3 and mentally prepare for the next stage of our budding space program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"a_schack","CreatedById":158392,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-22T19:19:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEpisode\u00A04: The challenges of sounding rockets\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/k8wdN0-4tkk?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022459\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the highs of our first orbit, we get back down to earth - literally.

Due to a number of factors including me wanting to do it with the simplest and most elegant rocket, and the entirely new form factor (short and fat as opposed to long and sleek), we run into a whole range of issues.

We name the launch vehicle then Mjolnir 1e and\u00A0build 3 of them for the SR 17-19 missions, and set about launching them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSR 17 goes off without a hitch, much to our astonishment, and we bring back lovely science data from space. SR 18 also just works and burns for the full duration with excellent stability and we pick up science from the upper atmosphere this time. It eventually splashes down off the coast of Florida somewhere in the dark... and then, while rolling over in the water, decides that this world is a much too harsh place and promptly explodes...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo we build another one for SR 20 and change the mission statement of SR 19 to be to get bio science from the upper atmosphere while much head scratching takes place in mission control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn between SR 17 and 18, we launch SR 16 from Kodiak on the Mjolnir 1d rocket.

The reason being that we design a modular launch vehicle which will be able to handle payloads ranging from 1.5t to 5t and probably more. The benefit is obviously, as it\u0027s modular, that we won\u0027t spend that much time designing rockets going forward - at least not until we unlock the next engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut before we start the design and testing process, we launch SR 25, our last sounding rocket for now. Mission: To grab radiation data from low and high atmosphere as well as low space over the poles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur\u00A0base 5t LV consists\u00A0of the Borr A3 lower stage and the Alpha A1 upper stage. The Borr A3 is based on a core stage with 2x LR79 engines and 3 radial boosters with 1 LR79 each. Plans are that it can be adapted from 0 to 4 boosters depending on upper stage. Our initial upper stage, the Alpha A1, is using the LR105. While technically not an upper stage engine, it looks to be the best there is for it currently, beating out the LR91 due to having nearly twice the\u00A0burn time. Thanks to my flawed memory we also purchased the LR91 because I thought the LR105 had less thrust, but oh well. We expect to design further upper stages based on the Agena for lesser payloads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving\u00A0quickly tested the Borr A3 Alpha 1\u00A0in simulations and finding it just worked perfectly as is, we set about designing the Mani 1, the rocket that will have us impact the moon.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks to new technology, the probe and the TLI combined weigh just 1.75t, considerably less than the 3t we\u0027d expected. We stick it on top of a slightly adjusted LV, the Borr A1 Alpha 1A. The Borr A1 is a Borr A3 without the\u00A0radial boosters and the Alpha 1A is a slightly shortened Alpha 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this should just be it, shouldn\u0027t it? Well, no. Due to the design we have over half the delta-v on the upper stage while also having quite high thrust to weight ratio on it. This causes issues with the ascent\u00A0profile, and we spend a fair amount of simulations on screen trying various ascent profiles, and then go and do even more offscreen before finally deciding on the rather unorthodox profile of coasting for 45s before igniting the second stage. It turns out to work really well though, and will get us into a pretty circular low orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn total we spent nearly 4 hours on something that can be wrapped up in a few lines, but there you have it.

Before launching Mani, our lunar impactor, we set about designing Mani 3, our lunar orbiter. It\u0027s mission is to orbit the moon with a periapsis below 150km (the limit for in space low).\u00A0This requires an uprated TLI stage to carry the extra weight as well as smaller lunar orbit insertion stage. As we\u0027re still restricted in terms of avionics, we\u0027re using the Able avionics unit, which sadly uses quite a lot of electricity, forcing us to also carry a more of that. The total payload (TLI, insertion stage and probe) comes in at 4.7t, which is perfect for our Borr A3 Alpha 1 launch vehicle. We do two quick sims to make sure it\u0027ll get into a proper orbit and set it to build. It\u0027s much larger than the Mani 1, so it takes about twice as long to build. But we buy into a lot of tech node research, giving us a couple of further upgrade points, cutting build time a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut finally it\u0027s time to launch Mani 1. Fortunately, we\u0027re right on the moon\u0027s orbit when it rolls out, so it\u0027s just a question of pressing launch! It\u0027s a tense experience as we unleash the LR79s and the LR105 for the first time, but thankfully the ascent goes off without a hitch, though we cut off the upper stage a bit early and end up in a 144x209km. We use RCS to just boost ourselves to a 167x324km orbit and start planning our TLI.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe get a pretty good and rather swift TLI, but it\u0027s very sensitive with regards to delta-v, and we have a lot of thrust on the AJ10-104D towards the end, but that\u0027s why we carry RCS. It\u0027s still cut far too short though, but we make a manuever node to burn the rest of the fuel, ending in an impact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this is where it all ends in tears as the AJ10 shuts down before managing to spool up, and we eventually end up far too short to even intercept the moon. Even all our RCS won\u0027t save us, and the Mani 1 is relegated to space junk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe wrap up this episode by building the Mani 3, an exact replica of Mani 1, and prioritise it over Mani 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
