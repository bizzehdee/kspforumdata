Internal Pod shots are far and few between.. I have a set of about 50 photos that show different angles,none of them perfect... but they should all help in making a kerbal version of it. If you recall, they really did have stuff all visibility in that cockpit, I need to make it a bit better so it\u0027s actually worth being in IVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe door right now is open to suggestion. That door needs to be uniform all the way through the ship and ideally on a flat surface all the way through. So what Im doing now, as you guess correctly is getting the door in a good position - then it will be merged with the other mesh after texturing etc. Usually I say it\u0027s good enough for me and release it, but nah not anymore I just can\u0027t do it. The experimental packs sure, they are just a bit of fun but after seeing helldiver and a few other modders here making such amazing looking mods, I thought it was time I tried at least one really nice looking mod with all the bells and whistles, and as I have discovered.. it\u0027s a long bloody process, especially if you are still learning about it all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ere: Internal spaces? mate, I made sure 2 kerbals fit snugly inside in their seats, with enough room to exit the seat, turn around and walk through the door. Some people might find it a pain in the ass to have to actually go in and out of the ship to EVA, but that\u0027s just how I\u0027m doing it. I don\u0027t like kerbals just magically popping up on top of the cockpit when EVA is activated so I\u0027m also going to try and find a way to stop that also.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ere: interfacing with LLL pods, hmm that\u0027s a good point.. I sort of didnt think about that as I as intending on doing a proper pod for it, which is mostly done now to be honest. As far as intergrating the doors, I was thinking about a small plugin that opened all doors on the craft at once, just a small thing that would make sure the passage to the cockpit is open at all times when you EVA. As far as Ports, we\u0027ll see. I was thinking of making a more permanent coupler on the top of the truss for the pods, and then cut it out so it doesnt interfere with the roof of the pods, but thats subject to actually being done yet, so it\u0027s just a thought at the moment. A little bummed out no one is using the mono hover wheel, jesus that was a pain to make.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll go check out the mission reports now, will give me some inspiration to get some more work done on it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the Serenity...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, im sorry to say but before you guys get to play with it, I want to print it out, paint it and have this monster 3-foot model sitting on my desk.
