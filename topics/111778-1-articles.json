I know you\u0027re working on a Let\u0027s Play with this save, so I can only assume you want to be honest with your save as much as is possible. Go through and record fuel, RCS, and oxidizer amounts in the tanks, and the identity of the crew in the vessel, then build a brand new copy of your ship and launch it. You shouldn\u0027t have to actually fly it, but make sure it\u0027s not clamped to the ground. To make your life easier, fill only the seats in the new vessel that are occupied in your broken vessel. Save the game and go into the sfs file. Find the new vessel and copy all of it from its first PART to the last brace of the last PART. Paste this over the corresponding section of the broken vessel. Do not delete the new vessel yet. Don\u0027t mess with either vessel\u0027s flight state information or ORBIT information at all. You would then go through and edit the new vessel\u0027s crew identities to match the original (Find all of the Kerman\u0027s and change their first names, basically.) Edit any fuel tanks to the correct amounts. At this point you should be able to load the game, end the new mission normally, and your existing mission \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E function as intended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETA: Or better, because I wasn\u0027t thinking clearly, build the new ship in a completely separate savegame, then it won\u0027t mess up your hiring/firing in your Let\u0027s Play.
