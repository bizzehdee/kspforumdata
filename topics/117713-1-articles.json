I would stay away from motorcycles or scooters. I\u0027ll admit, I\u0027m biased. My dad rode in a motorcycle gang when he was younger, he had all sorts of stories about his friends dying gruesome deaths. My wife is a physical therapist who specializes in neurological injuries (brains and spinal cords). 80% of the patients she sees who are under the age of 65 were on a motorcycle. We aren\u0027t helicopter parents, we let our kids ride bikes around the block and climb rocks and trees and all sorts of stuff. But we\u0027ve already decided that the one thing we will veto is riding motorcycles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Enjoy the outdoors. Go hiking. Find swimming holes. Take up fishing. Go camping.

Yeah, the more I look into it the more I get put off motorbikes, purely for safety reasons. It\u0027s a shame really, they seem cheaper, cheaper to insure, more fuel efficient, easier to park, and incredibly cool - motorbikes might as well be sclupted from a solid block of coolness, whereas borrowing my mum\u0027s grey Daihatsu Sirion wouldn\u0027t be quite the same. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Kind of hard seeing as all the land nearby is privately owned and/or covered in mud and dog/horse poo, but I think I will try again at getting the best out of living in the countryside. Their are two available rivers, one used for the very rich to pay vast sums to fish trout and the other used to drown shopping trollies, so camping seems the most possible of your suggestions. I know a few people who might want to go camping as soon as they get back from various holidays, so I\u0027ll ask them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Flymetothemun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Flymetothemun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow do manage to explode a candle!?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpent hours trying to figure out, which probably didn\u0027t do much to help my science grade that term.

Haven\u0027t had a major incident yet, although there were some close shaves. To be fair some of my mates haven\u0027t been so lucky, and usually the fault was not with them but with the other party involved. So the point about being more vulnerable is not one to take lightly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think what aided me in keeping out of trouble (apart from a good dose of luck) was that I was well-versed in general street craft by the time I got onto one, and I got a totally underpowered one to start off with, which meant I couldn\u0027t really do anything too silly even if I had wanted to. By the time I got onto a more powerful bike I had learned some additional respect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBikes can be a heck of a lot of fun, but you really need to develop a sixth sense to watch out for all the numpties on the roads, and there is very little room for error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you have to also ask yourself, apart from getting to/from school, where would you go, and would wherever you go be better than where you are (for now)?
