Eventually I edited the save file and changed the Minmus contract to Mun. In these crazy pre-manouevre-node days, it\u0027s really quite important that the game gives you those first, since it\u0027s about the only thing you can eyeball.\n\nJust look for \u0022explorebody\u0022 in the persistent.sfs file until you find the one for Minmus (\u0022body = 3\u0022), and then in that section, change the body number from 3 to 2. I think there\u0027s five occurrences within the explore contract, so be sure to get them all else you\u0027ll get a weird mixed contract ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nHappily Jeb is now on his way to a free-return Munar flyby."},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T16:29:43Z","Content":"You can decline any contract you haven\u0027t accepted and another one will immediately replace it. Usually, a mission of the same prestige / difficulty will be generated in it\u0027s place. Since Mun and Minmas are probably going to be in the same difficulty class (1, 2, or 3 stars) you can decline a Minmas contract and have a chance that a Mun one will replace it."}]}
