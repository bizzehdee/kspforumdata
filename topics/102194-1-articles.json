The only control that is reversed is the left right in linear mode. I could try a few things to try to fix that but I didn\u0027t felt the need yet... it\u0027s not so bad controlling it this way. A big advantage of an upward facing okto pod is that a \u0022one-click\u0022 mechjeb mode exist to automatically adjust the level.\n\nConcerning the balancing and counterweights. Around 0:48 in my video, I almost touched the ground. Just before that I was going in a straight line (let say between 0:46 and 0:48) but the rover was slowly falling on the left despite SAS. After, when I did manually correct the level of my rover, the Advanced Inline Stabilizer was strong enough to bring my orientation back to normal. My conclusion from these observations is that \u0022automatic\u0022 SAS does not use the full power available from the stabilizer. (Or there is some other phenomenon involved that I\u0027m not considering, like counter steering or whatever...)\n\nAlso, during my tests with the Small Inline Reaction Wheel, I found it was not as forgiving when you add a kerbal\u0027s mass. So... with all that being said, I think balancing in itself is not a bad idea. That way, the SAS is not working against a fundamentally flawed rover, it\u0027s mostly working against centrifugal force when you\u0027re turning.\n\nThe most important downside to the ballast I think is the ground clearance. You could lean much more on the left side without the ballast in the way.\n\npwlnw, We don\u0027t even see a reaction wheel in the first picture! Style AND function? The whole package? Is there a hidden reaction wheel or that prototype crashed and burned soon after \u0022launch\u0022?\n\nAnd finally... yes... I wish I could hold some magic key so I could use the mouse to steer or something (without mods). Analog controls would be awesome. I do know some mods exists for that but... but... I wish all the good mods were stock! I want KSP to be more awesome... awesomer?\n\nThank you everyone!!!!!!!!!! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-20T01:34:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2015 01:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by noorm**\n  \nMore stuff... more...
