Can confirm the described issues with the craft as provided.\n\nCan fix(?) the issues with three simple(?) changes.\n\n1. Enable Autostrut-Grandparent on each of the SRBs.  The first test flight the SRBs sagged into the core on decoupling and lots of things exploded ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n2. Set the bottom thrust limiter on the RBDCs to ~70%.  This forces a \u0027nose out\u0027 decoupling (same as offsetting the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E would).\n3. When decoupling, ensure that you are flying mostly prograde, or aero forces will push the \u0027lower\u0027 SRBs back into the stack.  This is probably the most important bit from my test flights.  If I let autopilot run \u0027dumb\u0027, it would be a few degrees off prograde at that point in flight, and cause issues quite often.  If I briefly toggled \u0027hold prograde\u0027 before and during decoupling, it was smooth every time.\n    1. Kind of not surprising considering the decoupling is happening right around max-q for this craft and flight profile.  Normally this type of event would be programmed into the autopilot to compensate for such issues (throttling down and/or maintaining prograde (which isn\u0027t really a thing on a real gravity turn; you always point prograde)).\n\nNote I switched off autopilot and turned on stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E \u0027hold prograde\u0027 a few seconds before decoupling.\n\n![1khT7NY.png](https://i.imgur.com/1khT7NY.png)\n\nNo collisions with central core.  A couple SRBs collided after jettison... which is perfectly Kerbal.\n\n![dVnoAPU.png](https://i.imgur.com/dVnoAPU.png)\n\nIt does appear that the RBDC lacks some decoupling power at that particular scale and dynamic pressure; the engines aren\u0027t giving things quite the push that they need to in order to fight aero forces fully.  In my test craft the decoupling was happening much higher up, at much lower dynamic pressure (pretty much vacuum), so the puny engines were plenty.\n\nAs a bit of a more drastic \u0027test\u0027 you might try patching/editing the RBDCs to increase their thrust and fuel a bit, or adjusting the thrust/fuel scaling factors.  I feel the part works fine for my uses and craft designs, but perhaps it needs adjustment for other specific cases or play styles.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 minutes ago, Starwaster said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The issue that I\u0027ve always noticed with that decoupler part is the typical squishy KSP/Unity connection coupled with the long lever arm when the decoupler is scaled vertically.\n\u003E \n\nYou know, I never even thought of that issue (the RBDC thrust and its single joint on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E)... but that would explain quite a bit of the off-axis thrust that I see on jettison with those parts.
