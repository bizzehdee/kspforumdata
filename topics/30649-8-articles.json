I don\u0027t want to rely on Kethane for anything more than scanning functionality (and detecting interesting deposits). What I want to do, is add a new plugin, which would require Kethane to use, along with a modified set of parts to use the new functionality. aha... I think I\u0027ve got it... Add new part classes, which inherit the current classes, but are able to use additional Kethane function calls... hmmm... I think I\u0027ll try that later!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother question is, what would be the potential benefits of landing on a scanned hex? What I don\u0027t want is players not being able to collect a sample, just because they didn\u0027t land on the correct hex, but there should be some kind of benefit to it. Maybe add a flag to the sample, so that if the lander lands on a scanned deposit, it is marked as \u0022interesting\u0022, doubling the science points? Something along those lines?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should also add, there will only be a scanner for rock... There\u0027s no point in scanning for liquid or atmosphere, as its pretty obvious where they are, and it seems that there is no way to limit where a deposit will be generated. So in the case of Laythe, a player could be really unlucky, and find that all the interesting rock samples are only available if Squad was to implement submarines \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E:sticktongue:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe parts from Jareth look really nice!
