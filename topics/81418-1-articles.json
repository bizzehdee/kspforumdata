Here are my overall design goals:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Snacks are a resource that kerbals consume at a fixed rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Snacks would not be stored in new parts, but each crewable module would be able to carry a certain amount of snacks based on it\u0027s crew capacity. Therefore inter-planetary craft would need extra space in order to sustain their Kerbal\u0027s snack requirements. Snack capacity should be substantially higher when crew are not present. My idea is that an uncrewed hitchhiker(or other vessel\u0027s with spare capacity) would store substantially more snacks than a crewed one. Hitchhikers would be the \u0022cargo\u0022 vessel of choice to replenish snacks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Snacks are not entirely required. Kerbals without snacks simply are grumpy and do not perform as efficiently. Kerbals will not die from being without snacks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunctionality I\u0027m considering adding:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Reduced science transmission and recovery, reduced contract completion science/reputation/funds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Accrued reputation slowly decreases based on the number of Kerbals without snacks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The Kerbals mutiny and randomly toggle ship features off in an attempt to get you to replenish the snacks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Kerbals have reduced(slowed) maneuverability on EVA to simulate their protest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Contracts are generated for vessels that are running low on snacks. Bonus points if you get to them before they run out!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESnacks v0.1 Alpha\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Snacks are added as a resource to every moudle that can carry crew 50 snacks for each Kerpacity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Snack capacity of non-command modules is 200 snacks for each Kerpacity. Some modules may have more or less depending on built in snack compartments, or lack of space!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Kerbals consume about 1/2 snack per day(Kerbin day). However since snacks are randomly consumed through out the day(about twice a day), you cannot predicte with certainty how many will be required for a given mission. There are a few extra twists here as well. Some Kerbals may sneak an extra snack at snack time, others may forget to eat if their stupidity is too high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-If you deprive a Kerbal of snacks, the next time he attempts to eat snacks, your reputation will go down by 1 point. Each subsequent time the Kerbal is deprived your reputation decreases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t ran into any serious issues thus far. I\u0027ve tested on my regular save with 15 mods and it plays well together. The only caveat is module manager appears to load new resources to saved vessels when the vessel is loaded. So if you start to get messages that Kerbals are without snacks, load the vessel and they will start eating their supply(the debug log lists which vessel is without snacks). I\u0027ll try and get this fixed shortly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/tgruetzm/Snacks/releases\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/tgruetzm/Snacks/releases\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s still lots of work to do.
