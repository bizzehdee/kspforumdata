I was wondering if there is a mod somewhere that allows you to edit and rearrange the\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Estock\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0toolbar? For example, delete the stock rescources button and move the Alternate Rescource Panel one up\u00A0there? I have tried blizzy\u0027s toolbar but I do not like the style and many mods don\u0027t use it.
