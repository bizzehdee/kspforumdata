However, as Squad stated previously, part of the intent for career mode is to serve as a tutorial for new players. This makes it a bit too easy for more experienced players, and I find that I rarely actually have to worry about funding when designing ships, since parts are cheap and funding is plentiful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould anyone suggest an existing or in-development mod that aims to make the economy harder, perhaps by reducing mission payout, harder missions, or more expensive parts? If one doesn\u0027t exist, I might just go in and crank up the cost of all parts by, say, 10x.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, could anyone suggest a good tech tree mod that makes for a harder progress that you think might work well with the new economy system? I remember there was a tree floating a while back (called traditional tech I think) that made it necessary to start out with planes and rovers before going into space. That might work well with the mission system, since most early missions require testing parts in atmosphere, which could be done with reusable planes to save on cost, while collecting the funds necessary to build an expensive disposable rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T17:46:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIIRC, using the later versions of ModuleManager you can actually do a blanket part cost adjustment by a certain multiplier.
