Whenever I needed to perform a manoeuver that I had no knowledge of, I\u0027d turn to MJ to see how it was done. I\u0027m also quite a fan of pressing \u0027Engage\u0027 and walking off for a drink/whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think MechJeb is also quite a useful tool to use when developing new craft. Since it\u0027s extremely difficult to manually fly the same path to orbit every single time with a new design, use of MJ removes quite a bit of uncertainty in the results. This allows you to ensure each launch of a new craft and its variations is a \u0027fair test\u0027, thus speeding up development.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the beauty of it is that when you feel like a bit more of a challenge, you can just press \u0027Off\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kwikshot","CreatedById":39562,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-14T10:38:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah really I used it to visualize how to actually get into orbit, as I felt like the tutorials I read didn\u0027t make it massively clear how it works.
