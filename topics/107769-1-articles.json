After a long break, I started over in 1.0 and had a great time. Now in 1.0.2, I can\u0027t even get a Mk1 with a Mk16 and the smallest possible booster rocket to land without something exploding. There is also no way to stage off the booster in a new game when no parts are unlocked, let alone hope to return with some science equipment. I love accuracy and realism, but I also don\u0027t like taking all the fun out of it either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas this the intended change and is it going to remain like this?

Starting in 1.0.2 parachute opening takes a bit longer to reach full drag, and the default values are tuned to the mass of the mk1 capsule. Landing anything heavier, like a capsule with an engine still attached (not unreasonably so if you\u0027re early career and want maximum recovery value) takes a little more than 500 m to bring the craft down to terminal velocity. My first flight in 1.0.2, I lost a doubled up capsule into the ocean that way! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince then I set all my chutes to deploy at 1500 m or so, haven\u0027t had any incidents since.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moonfrog","CreatedById":76295,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T12:08:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo reccomendation would be to change the default value of parachutes to open to at least 1000 metres or 1500 of the ground. solve the early game problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
