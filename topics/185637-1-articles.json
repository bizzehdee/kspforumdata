It\u0027s a contract where you have to ferry a tourist to their destinations and back. I keep thinking that I need to launch to a particular altitude but each attempt achieves nothing in the way of completion. I haven\u0027t unlocked multi crew pods yet so I\u0027ve had to stack two pods to carry the pilot and tourist. Any ideas how to fulfill this contract?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWallace\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-19T16:38:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome screenshots of the contract and your attempts would help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you 100% believe you completed it, then it could just be bugged.\u00A0 It happens.\u00A0 You can use the Alt-F12 menu to complete the contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-19T16:39:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo idea, can\u0027t see the contract or what you\u0027re doing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-19T17:42:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe precise wording of the contract is very important. Where are you required to ferry the tourist to? Kerbin Orbit? Suborbital on Kerbin?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"W.W.
