Originally I was just going to edit the part files themselves, but then I realized that I\u0027d have to re-edit them every time I updated, thus I started looking into MM configs. I looked around for some pre-made ones but couldn\u0027t find any so I\u0027ve thrown together a few and figured someone else might be in the position I was in and want some configs without the hassle of making them themselves. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo that end, I\u0027ve uploaded them for people to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://filebin.net/mkdgsp0mah\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Edownload\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E. They\u0027re really very basic hack jobs, mostly just copy-pasta with a tiny effort put into balance. Obviously I only have the stuff I use in there, and I\u0027ve been collecting them as I discover things that aren\u0027t implemented so there\u0027s a whole lot that aren\u0027t included. Given their ad-hoc nature, I\u0027d be happy for some input with regards to balance (does the amount of ablative shielding make sense given the probe\u0027s mass and size? Does the antenna\u0027s range make sense given its cost, design, and original purpose?) and things I\u0027ve missed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf nobody\u0027s interested, no loss to me, I want them and that\u0027s what I really care about. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
