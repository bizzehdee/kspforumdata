I\u0027ve just simulated it via HyperEdit a bunch of times, but I\u0027d like to do the actual mission. It\u0027s only mildly cheat-ey, with KW Rocketry, Kerbal Joint Reinforcement (SoS - Sick of Struts), and TweakScale used only on the landing legs and one SAS module.\n\nIf I drop it straight down from 100km, it\u0027ll tumble a bit in the mid-atmosphere, but that\u0027s not a problem (chutes right-side-up it before landing) except for the stupid Telus-LV that keeps overheating. Adjacent parts (2000C max) don\u0027t even come close to overheating. Tried putting a small heat shield below it, but doesn\u0027t do much good with the tumbling.\n\nWithout the mobility enhancer, my Kerbal can\u0027t get back up to the pod. The Telus-LV is attached to a modular girder segment coming off the bottom of the vessel.\n\nHints for keeping this stupid thing cool? Can\u0027t they make it out of tungsten or something?\n\nCheers,\n\n-BS\n\n![dFPleUm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/dFPleUm.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T06:24:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 06:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by barfing\\_skull**\n  \nAnswered"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T04:16:01Z","Content":"A quick fix suggested in some other thread was to change its thermal mass modifier to 4.0 in the part.cfg file. Copy the modifier line from almost any of the Aero parts.\n\nOtherwise you will need to put enough airbrakes at the top of the craft to keep it pointed retrograde and then protect it inside the sonic shockcone of something like that heatshield."},{"CreatedByName":"barfing_skull","CreatedById":126825,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T06:23:49Z","Content":"Thanks....I think the airbrakes worked to keep it upright through the descent, and the Telus-LV didn\u0027t explode. Attached them to decouplers just like the parachutes and everything else that\u0027s not needed to get the ship back in orbit. I\u0027ll keep the thermal mass information somewhere in my skull.\n\nCheers,\n\n-BS"}]}
