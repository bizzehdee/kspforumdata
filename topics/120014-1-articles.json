The refueling bases DO have an engine and will land themselves once released from the orbiting mothership. To pay for this, I want the refueling bases to fulfill \u0022new surface base\u0022 contracts. The question is, do I invalidate the contract once I dock my new surface base to my previously-launched mothership?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELikewise, if I launch a new satellite, and dock it to a previously-launched transfer stage, does the \u0022new satellite in orbit around XXX\u0022 contract get invalidated for the new satellite?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did have a similar problem when trying to get credit for returning to Kerbin from the surface of Eve; I docked the final ascent stage of my Eve lander to a mothership which tugged it back to low Kerbin orbit, and when I landed my final Eve ascent stage, I didn\u0027t get credit for recovering a vessel from the surface of Eve \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E So I\u0027m wondering if the same annoying crap applies here.
