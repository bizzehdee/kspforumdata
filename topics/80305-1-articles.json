I have a gtx 660, and a self clocking 3.9 - 4.1 Quad-core processor. Should I be using CUDA to get the maximum capabilities, or should I be letting the processor do all the calculation work, and let the GPU just handle graphics? Just wondering what is the best set-up.

It\u0027s butter smooth with 600 part count ships, which are pretty common for me. My 1k\u002B ships were probably in the 10-20 FPS range.
