For the more literal/traditional \u0022health\u0022 aspect, it makes use of a health bar system, which seems to be a bit more comprehensively/rationally integrated than with some other mods I\u0027ve looked at in the past.

It rewards you for setting up uninterrupted relays for comms from and to other bodies and specific locations. Trying to set up 3-4 relay satellites in a perfectly stable orbit for unbroken comms, indefinitely, is practically impossible in the long run without some mods to help with things like resonant orbits, but if you like a realism related challenge, it\u0027s fun trying, and certainly possible to eyeball it to last for a hundred years or more, with a bit of skill and planning.\u003Cspan\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/155465-most-112x-near-future-technologies-august-26/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ENear Future Mod Series\u003C/a\u003E - This might not fit your criteria of realism but seems worth a mention.

Firstly I feel this is taking realism too far for me, I want realism within the setting of Kerbal Space Program, and feel this is taking the game too far from what it was actually envisioned to be. Secondly it expands the distances involved to such extremes, you need to very carefully think about what other mods you might be using with it. The game will just be completely broken without quite a few essential mods to compliment this, and with a lot of mods you might not have thought of that completely mess up the game with this installed as well. That being said, it\u0027s certainly one of the more impressive modding achievements, and at some point I plan to make a second modded version of the game, purely centred around this one, for a completely different KSP experience.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E related realism mods - Similar to the previously mentioned \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E, these are such extreme overhauls in general, that you are locking yourself into a completely different modding ecosystem, which would invalidate many of the suggestions I made above. Again, not claiming these are in any way flawed or inferior, just with realism turned up to 11, you are playing with such fundamental alterations to the core game\u0027s design, that you need to re-evaluate your mod choices purely from that perspective.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOther Parts Mods - These are not excluded because I think they are invalid choices for improved realism, or that I am biased towards the Near Future series (I thought I ought to include at least one example), but because there are so many to chose from, and preferences are inevitably very subjective. It\u0027s worth noting that if you try to add them all, your game initialisation can quickly exceed ten minutes (or even with just one or two of the larger ones), and this will also translate to much longer scene changes in the game. In this scenario, it can take a lot of work to get your parts list to a readable state, probably requiring a couple of utility mods just to manage this.
