Also i wanted to know what is possible, and how good my own construction is. So i came up with this challenge:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild a spaceplane with the smallest possible turnradius and the highest turnrate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo test your designs, do the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the turnradius, just perform a Looping. Start in level flight with speed and altitude of your choice. Note that for all of the following, the velocity vector (The yellow circle on the navball representing where you are going) is the reference. So start with your velocity vetor on the horizon, then perfom a loop, taking three screenshots. One when you are starting the loop, with the yellow circle at the horizon. One when you are at the top, and one when you are level again. From these screenshots, you can read out your altitude at the bottom of the loop, then at the top, and at the bottom again. The difference from these altitudes should be double your radius, so take the smallest one, divide it by 2, and you got your turnradius. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the turnrate, start again with your plane straight and level, and do a 360-degree turn. To get good and comparable results, it is important that you maintain altitude and speed approximatly the same (\u002B/- 500 m; \u002B/- 20m/s should be close enough), so that you can read out your sustainable turn rate. Again, take three screenshots, one at the start, one half way through, and one at the and. Then compare you MET\u0027s, and take the time it took for your craft to make the turn. Divide 360 by your time, and you got your turnrate in degrees per second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease post the two screenshots you used for your half loop in the radius-test, and the three screenshots of your rate-test, so that we all can confirm your performance \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf someone can think of a better way to measure the results, feel free to post your idea of this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will make a leaderboard for all of your entries in each category, and then think of a way to combine these into a ranking for both rate and radius.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are my own results:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurn radius:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/3073/screenshot18b.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot18b.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img685.imageshack.us/img685/5664/screenshot19k.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot19k.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started at 1132m, the top of my loop was at 1562, and stopped at 888m.
