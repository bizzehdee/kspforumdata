(If you don\u0027t believe me, try it. Design any rocket you like, shut off all engines below 70km, and see if you can get a stable periapsis over 70km.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not to say an orbit is totally impossible. There are a couple strategies that might work:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) As others have suggested, you could shut down some air intakes while still in the atmosphere to trap a precious little bit of air that could be used later up in space to restart the engines for a small circularization burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) If you could build a jet craft sufficiently fast to coast all the way out to the Mun, you could use a gravity assist slingshot around the Mun to circularize your orbit at a nice high altitude. (This was a very clever strategy pioneered by QuesoExplosivo on my recent Hands-Free Mission Challenge. See \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94490-The-Hands-Free-Mission-Challenge?p=1432732\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1432732\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94490-The-Hands-Free-Mission-Challenge?p=1432732\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1432732\u003C/a\u003E and look at the cool trajectory change in the 3rd picture.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3) The rules don\u0027t seem to expressly forbid having Jeb get out and push. Once you\u0027re already up in space, the small thrust of his spacesuit maneuvering pack could easily put the finishing touches on an orbital trajectory.
