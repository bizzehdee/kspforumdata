If so, the problem could be going too fast too soon, gaining extra heat from aerodynamic heating. It could equally be getting too horizontal too soon. What altitude are you getting to before failure, and what is your surface speed and angle of prograde above horizon at that point?\n\nIf TWR spends much time above 2.0, below about 35km, throttle back to control it (the NASA Shuttle had to do this, it\u0027s very realistic), or lose some thrust (e.g. Mainsail core \u002B 2x TwinBoar, instead of 3x TwinBoar).\n\nDo you see any of the visual representations of supersonic effects and/or aerodynamic heating at any point?"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T11:35:03Z","Content":"Someone suggested to attach wing parts on overheating parts, like this:\n\nA makeshift radiator:\n\n![2vEzsrg.png](http://i.imgur.com/2vEzsrg.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Paul G","CreatedById":101883,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T11:42:29Z","Content":"I read on a 1.0.2 tips and advice [thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122485-UPDATED-FOR-1-0-2-The-Complete-Compendium-of-Tips-and-Advice%21) that the orange tank overheats easily and that a lone strut should be placed on it to help with heat absorption.\n\nPaul"},{"CreatedByName":"BurningLegion","CreatedById":142799,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T13:58:18Z","Content":"Have you considered putting thrust limiters on your Twin Boars to keep TWR from rising too high? I find the sweet spot is about 1.38. It keeps you from losing speed due to air resistance, and slows overheating due to engine heat.\n\nYou can also place wings to help radiate heat before it gets to the decoupler. Delta Wings work the closest to best."},{"CreatedByName":"Keymaster89","CreatedById":100480,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T08:33:28Z","Content":"Hey guys!\n\nThanks for the answers! i tryied with the wing-radiator and a less Falcon Punch approach, and this time i get to orbit unharmed!\n\nSOLVED!"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T09:19:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Sounds to me like you\u0027re curving them into the air stream, which screams all sorts of problems.
