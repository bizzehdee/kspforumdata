I did not care much for it either. However, I came to appreciate what I assumed you deliberately implemented as an elegant solution; simply closing the window eliminated the audio alert and did not de-warp you. I for one actually like it the way that it is, though admittedly I may be in the minority. Not to mention that it is very unlikely that everyone will happy. Especially with such a popular, borderline essential mod. A toggle-able option is probably the only way to make \u0027everyone\u0027 happy.\n\nTotally separately, the audio alert and de-warp feature stopped working for me. Sometime after the 1.2.1 update I think. I updated to the latest version off of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E today and [x] Science! no longer pulls me out of warp like it used to when new science is available.\n\nKeep up the good work.\n\nCheers,\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-06T04:41:32Z\u0022 title=\u002211/06/2016 04:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Stratickus**"},{"CreatedByName":"Athox","CreatedById":171419,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-10T23:29:58Z","Content":"I don\u0027t mean to bring up an old issue, but all i could find mentioned ANYWHERE (googled for days) about \u0022Splashed down in Kerbin\u0027s highlands\u0022 was in this thread, which specifically mentioned PRE-1.2 biomes (and the location was very vague, as in \u0022near badlands\u0022... thx mate).\n\nThe Field Research mod doesn\u0027t have any locations for splashed highlands in the config, so that particular contract will never appear.
