I\u0027ve lived in cramped quarters for months before out at sea, which ultimately is the same thing this system is trying to simulate. Yes its uncomfortable, yes it isn\u0027t very pleasant, but to think I\u0027d just up and \u0022stop working\u0022 especially when that work brings me back home, is paying the bills, and is what I signed up for is ludicrous to a retarded level..\n\u003E \n\nFor some reason, living space needs to be \u0022turned on\u0022 with the \u0022Start Habitat\u0022 option in the context menu.

Effectively by EVAing a kerbal, you can reset the hab timer for the rest of the kerbals in a ship.
