The first tests showed that there just wasn\u0027t enough fuel to hit the required speed. So I went two staged, basically the same set up with a decoupler and the same conical solid booster underneath. My intent was to give it some speed and altitude, ditch the stage and let that final stage do its things. It didn\u0027t all go to plan.

I also added radiators to the SPN in an octagonal formation so that the top was completely covered and it spiralled back in a conical fashion. Help radiate the heat and be somewhat aerodynamic. My plan was somewhat successful, the rocket was able to survive a lot more drag/heat reaching a whopping 1900m/s before succumbing to inevitable destruction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I decided a redesign was in order.
