I can build them (i know the physics and how to build a craft that can perform the task), but the flight itself is a stuttering intricate maneuvering. And often, the physics snippets have such great gaps in between that the craft will disintegrate for whatever reason.\n\n2GHz i7 8GB Macbook Pro here. Dedicated GPU.

More importantly what is \u0022high part count\u0022 for you? If you can use 200 parts it should be relatively easy so I assume you have much less? Using a procedural wings mod might lower part count quite a bit since stichting wings out of far to small parts means a lot of parts where proc wings could give you the whole thing with maybe 2-6 parts total, also procedural control surfaces ^-^\n\nNormally I would also reccomend the [thread=107273]UbioZur Welding mod[/thread] as this can reduce part count (and increase rigidity) quite significantly.\n\nThe only game option I know of that could help with that is reducing the \u0022max physics delta time per frame\u0022 or whatever it is called. Basically this runs the game more slowly accross the board because things are calculated in smaller steps.\n\nThat might help reducing the physics lagg between frames, though it will not increase game speed in general."},{"CreatedByName":"Old Foxboy","CreatedById":141736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T15:35:27Z","Content":"thanks, the delta physics maybe an option. I\u0027ll try that.\n\nThe mods seems to be great, too. (Didn\u0027t knew that there was a welding mod - great!) Too bad that Squad didn\u0027t include real big wings. The bigger stock ones are simply too limited and don\u0027t leave enough room for building alternatives. You\u0027re basically thrown back to the 0.9 wing building blocks in many cases."},{"CreatedByName":"Old Foxboy","CreatedById":141736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T06:12:09Z","Content":"Okay, as for the physics: Nice try, but it becomes incredibly slooow motion, like using 2 seconds for every simulated second, so i put the slider back to about the middle where it becomes playable.\n\nSeems i have to pull back on the \u0022fancyness\u0022 sliders a big time ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Murdabenne","CreatedById":142825,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T02:42:20Z","Content":"FYI, Welder mod does not work with 1.0.x (it is being updated)"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T03:20:40Z","Content":"Oh i am waiting for that welder mod too. Flying a single ship is no problem but when you want those ships to dock at a space station the part count goes over 500 and the lag fest starts as always... I am restraining myself from building something big as much as possible untill the mod becomes available for 1.02 yet my minmus base allready started lagging after passing 400 parts. Not unplayable but annoying still."}]}
