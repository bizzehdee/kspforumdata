But I brought a crap ton to do. 3 Satellites, 3 Rovers, a landing pod. I just like to pack as much as I can into a mission. Maybe its because I\u0027m not so experience in interplanetary flight that I don\u0027t want to make the effort 3-4 times to the same place when I can just do it all in one shot. However the downside to my \u0022DO EVERYTHING AT ONCE\u0022 strategy is that I rarely test all of the components individually. I just sort of send them and hope everything works according to plan XD (which it normally doesn\u0027t)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anywho, what about you guys.
