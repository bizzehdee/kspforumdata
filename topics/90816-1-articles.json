Have the launcher launch the KSP executable and then hide its own window or minimize itself, but remain running. When the KSP executable stops running, the launcher will check the logs. If KSP exited normally, the launcher executable does nothing and closes. If there are errors, it will automatically send the log to Squad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know this would swamp them with error logs, but if they can write up something to parse and sort the errors for them, they would at least get a better idea as to what is causing the errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launcher could also possibly send a list of the folders in the GameData folder so they have an idea of what mods are being used. They could then also use this to filter out people who are playing only stock if they wish to eliminate problems caused by mods and fix the core first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I do realize that Unity itself has its own problems, but perhaps this would benefit the Unity devs as well if Squad find a common Unity issue and sends them the error reports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think for both Squad and Unity devs, they could easily use this to find the top 5 or 10 issues causing crashes, and then start working on the #1 issue, and work their way down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a workaround for people starting the KSP executable directly, it could check if the launcher is running, and if it isn\u0027t, then if could start it in the background.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
