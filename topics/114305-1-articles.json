It\u0027s not that much more than a Mun trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you want is just enough RAPIERs to get off the runway and up to speed, just enough oxidiser to lift the apoapsis out of the atmosphere, a nuke or two plus as much LF as you can carry.

Because of Duna\u0027s thin atmosphere and my awful TWR I\u0027m spending a lot of time in Duna\u0027s lower atmosphere because I can\u0027t pitch up a lot without losing speed.
