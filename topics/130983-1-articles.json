Apparently it was just released like a week ago. It\u0027s a space trading/combat/exploration game/simulator like Elite: Dangerous\u00A0but with much more complex systems modeling so you\u0027ve got a lot more instruments you\u0027ll have to watch in order to fly your ship properly. Oh, and it lets you build cities and\u00A0spacestations, and you can even customize the appearance and performance of your spacecraft with colors and different parts (hulls, wings, engines etc). You can also configure your ship\u0027s functions to your liking (number of cargo bays, number of fuel tanks, number of crew and so on) and tweak your weapons to get exactly the kind of performance you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI bought it today (I think it was 23\u20AC or so) and I\u0027m really liking it so far. The graphics look quite dated but the deep\u00A0gameplay more than makes up for it. I can\u0027t believe everyone on the internet isn\u0027t talking about this game yet, all I found were a few articles. People are starting to make videos about it though (Scott Manley also made one yesterday), so it\u0027ll most likely start rapidly gaining popularity over the next few days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/cgAVyXffSsU?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-29T18:37:26Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2016 06:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainKorhonen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-29T19:00:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLovely.
