Construction is necessary because KSP consists of a lot of planets/moons with nothing to do on them. Kerbals have little use in KSP, and the planned resources system although useful runs the risk of being minimalistic ala Kethane. As well as this construction would allow the players who have explored Kerbal system with a new task and occupation that so far mods like Kethane and Remotetech have attempted to fill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat construction solves:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESomething for Kerbals to do and a necessity to bring them instead of probe cores.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFully implement a resource system.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAllow players to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ccolonise\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and expand their space program.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the question for discussion is what to construct? \u003Cstrong\u003EFirstly, fuelling depots\u003C/strong\u003E. It has been previously suggested that the KSC should have ability to refuel ships within a certain distance, rather than clicking \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cend flight\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. So why not move this off-planet? Constructing a depot on a planet or moon that allows you to crossfeed fuel into any nearby ships would allow people to do exactly what Kethane simulates, run larger interplanetary missions and maintain extra planetary exploration. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESecondly, new Space Centres:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENew tracking stations would be implementable with a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cfog of war\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 similar to Remotetech \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 building new tracking stations further afield would give you more information and ability to control remotely probes and ships. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENew runway allows space planes to land and refuel on planets with atmospheres. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENew launch pads allows a landing, refuelling and launching spot for rockets. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENew VAB allows construction of rockets on other planets (think different sizes dependant on cost).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENew SPH allows construction of space planes (will not function without runway).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOthers: use your imagination - naval landing pads for example, rover construction lab, boat construction lab for full implementation of the exploration aspect.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EGenerators to power the buildings, miners to generate fuel.

This would make hitchhiker containers, transporters etc necessary. It makes it important to take Kerbals and look after them, establish colonies. If you implemented Kerbal requirements later this would force you to establish colonies with food supplies etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBlueprints \u003C/strong\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Maybe blueprints are bought with science points. More you research more you can build? Or more you earn. Blueprints are placed on the ground via a top-down screen allowing you to plan your base without causing lag.

When you land on Mun you can EVA Kerbals, click blueprint screen and then top-down view place your building blueprint. Then you need Kerbals and materials, when it is ready click build and Kerbals stand around the blueprint, hammering etc till it is built. Now rockets can be refuelled here. If you build a VAB you can now build and launch rockets here \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 imagine the deltaV requirements for missions are much lower as you are on Mun! Imagine a spaceplane runway on Laythe!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo reduce lag you could make it maximum of 6 blueprints in a construction area, this means bases have to be specialised.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may brainstorm more ideas later, please tell me what you think.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-29T13:16:37Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2013 01:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Synapse\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EChanged to discussion - do not suggest\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Synapse","CreatedById":72502,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T13:11:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EConstruction\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2Orbital construction and construction on other celestials [9] [10]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeen this on what not to suggest.

But I\u0027d definitely like to see a bit more depth in the way of EVA activities. Maybe attaching cables or fuel lines. I think they\u0027ve got a strut \u0022gun\u0022 planned, where you can reinforce large structures after docking them. So that\u0027ll be somethin\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for surface-bound fuel stations and things...you can already build a lot of that stuff and they do have resources and gathering planned(though we don\u0027t know any specifics, I don\u0027t think). So that\u0027ll all be good. It\u0027ll be nice when we get surface structures that look like they were designed for surface bases, rather than just using spherical rocket bits and a lot of creativity to make bases look cool. I imagine a lot of that stuff is planned, but may well be a few patches away. Especially since they\u0027re working really hard on getting career mode at least somewhat functional for testing in the next couple patches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know about the blueprints thing. I mean, I guess I can see it working...maybe have mining vehicles that you launch to a planet or nearby asteroid then storage rockets and rovers which you use to ferry the resources about. Instead of science points, it\u0027d probably just be funding. I think everything\u0027s going to run off of funding and your kerdough, or whatever they call the currency...which will increase via completing missions and increasing your PR level by not failing as much. But that aside, I wouldn\u0027t mind having to mine resources in space and use them to build structures on other celestial bodies...I just don\u0027t think that\u0027s what they\u0027ve got planned. I think it\u0027s probably just going to be building parts that you combine to make your own buildings, then launch them to those celestial bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
