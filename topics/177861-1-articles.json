I can\u0027t tell since when it\u0027s been here. I installed Alarm Clock way way back, and more recently Kerbal Engineer, but I can\u0027t tell for sure whether it started after that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been coping with this for a good while now, but as missions get trickier, taking me further away from Kerbin, it stopped simply irking me and has begun to make me almost rage-quit a few times (competely messing up with a few crucial burns by happening at the exact wrong second...).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anybody know where this comes from?
