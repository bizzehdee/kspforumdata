By the end of April, I had landed on all planets, so it was the time to start thinking about a bigger Eve landing. This thread is the story of that mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1. Planning\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy original idea was to build a simple lander without fuel lines. Quick sketching with a spreadsheet revealed that a simple four-stage lander would have 11300 m/s of delta-v, which would be almost enough for a sea-level landing. When I started building the lander in VAB, its general shape turned out to be very unwieldy, so I had to start over from scratch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went for the standard Eve lander design: a core with 2-3 vertical stages and 9 pairs of asparagus boosters. By then, my standard command pod was no longer just the Mk1-2, but a Mk1-2 with a hitchhiker. I decided to check whether the lander could carry 2.5 tonnes of additional payload, and the numbers worked out. I ended up with a design with almost 7 tonnes of payload, a Skipper in the upper stage, an KS-25x4 in the lower stage, and 18 LFBs in the boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/jltsiren/ksp/eve_ship_0.jpeg\u0022 alt=\u0022eve_ship_0.jpeg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith asparagus staging, I had 12300 m/s at my disposal, which was more than enough. Switching to three layers of onion staging reduced it to 11800 m/s, which was still acceptable. I chose onion staging for its simplicity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the lander weighted almost 1600 tonnes, I decided to forgo landing struts, and land directly on the LFBs. This had the drawback that the crew could not walk below the engines, so I had to build more complicated ladder arrangements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/jltsiren/ksp/eve_ship_ladders.jpeg\u0022 alt=\u0022eve_ship_ladders.jpeg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo reduce the part count, I went for a minimal set of parachutes (18 drogues and 36 radials), which put the landing speed to 15-20 m/s. I had to do a powered landing, but the margins seemed high enough for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the flight tests, two problems emerged. The ship started to rotate during the ascent, forcing me to add more struts. This made the ship rigid enough to stop rotating, but the frame rate decreased noticeably. The separation of the first booster set tended to result in explosions, because the decouplers actually pushed the boosters away, which is almost never the desired behavior. After experimenting with different sepratron arrangements, I found one that was acceptable. The boosters would still collide with the rest of the ship, resulting in violent shaking, but the ship survived.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally I added some RCS thrusters for rotating the lander in orbit, and decided that it was ready for action.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-21T21:07:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Preparations\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t want to build a lifter for the lander, because the part count was already over 300. The lander had to reach Eve under its own power, possibly with the help of a set of boosters. Quick calculations revealed that it was borderline possible to reach Eve orbit from Kerbin without refueling, assuming that the TWR didn\u0027t fall too soon. Choosing onion staging over asparagus staging helped with that, and the lander became my first single-stage-to-Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/jltsiren/ksp/eve_ship_1.jpeg\u0022 alt=\u0022eve_ship_1.jpeg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I had to refuel the ship at Eve orbit. Because I needed almost 40 orange tanks of fuel, I either had to send a fleet of fuel tankers, or do several kethane mining trips to Gilly. I chose the latter approach, which turned out to be quite time-consuming. Launching the fuel tankers would probably have been faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/jltsiren/ksp/eve_tanker.jpeg\u0022 alt=\u0022eve_tanker.jpeg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore the plan was to match the orbital inclination of Gilly in a highly eccentric orbit, with apoapsis beyond Gilly\u0027s orbit, and wait for the kethane miner to complete five refueling trips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/jltsiren/ksp/eve_ship_2.jpeg\u0022 alt=\u0022eve_ship_2.jpeg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe margins were quite low for a sea level landing, so I needed a separate deorbiting stage.

Therefore I had to do some tests to determine how hard the deorbiter could push without causing any problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/jltsiren/ksp/eve_test_2.jpeg\u0022 alt=\u0022eve_test_2.jpeg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe answer turned out to be 400-500 kN.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt some point, I realized that I had room for seven kerbals, but the lander only had a crew of three. That seemed unsatisfactory, so I launched a crew shuttle to rendezvous with an interplanetary ship orbiting Kerbin, refueled the ship, and launched to Eve at the best speed, ignoring all launch windows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/jltsiren/ksp/eve_ship_3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eve_ship_3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPiloting the normal-sized ship next to the big lander was fun.
