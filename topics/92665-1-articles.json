Since then I\u0027ve been wondering on how to get started, and whether a beginner like me (no coding or modelling skills, some-what advanced image making skills) could do create a pack. I\u0027m willing to give it ago, but I have one question: how do I even start? I\u0027ve searched the forums for \u0022creating planets,\u0022 \u0022how to make planets,\u0022 and such, but to no avail. I was thinking about using PlanetFactory CE, but it does not seem to be updated to 0.25.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I have in mind is a gas giant, with a smaller gas giant orbiting around it. So, nothing complex. Terrestrial moons would be nice, but sound complicated to create. Then again, I have no clue on difficulty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, I\u0027m wondering where to start creating my planet pack, and what I can use to make them appear in-game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PoorYorick","CreatedById":116759,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-13T03:39:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe hardest part is probably the textures. For gas giants and the like, you can make really nice textures in GIMP or photoshop with some practice and since you have advanced image skills, this shouldn\u0027t really be a problem. For terrestrial moons, I\u0027ve been looking into \u003Ca href=\u0022http://libnoise.sourceforge.net/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elibnoise\u003C/a\u003E, which is what squad used for the stock planets AFAIK and gets really good results, but requires some coding knowledge to set up and use. And for getting them in-game, I\u0027d use Kopernicus, which right now can create new planets and set their orbits and textures. It can\u0027t do terrain yet, but that\u0027s not needed for gas planets anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
