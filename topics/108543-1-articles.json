I never really got into FAR so this is the first I\u0027ve experienced of the plane side of KSP; and I love it!\n\nCurrently going for the fastest design I can manage!

Next stop: Mach Four!! Only 200 m/s short... and a NON exploding craft! Good news though: Valentina survived that horrific highspeed combustion event.\n\nHow\u0027s everyone else enjoying the new model? How does it compare to FAR? Also, has anyone learned how NOT to do that last picture? I can\u0027t really throw a heat shield on, as it would destroy the aero.. but I can\u0027t go much faster without blowing up every time!\n\nAlso: as an aside... does it annoy anyone else that f12 now turns on the Aero Forces Overlay AND takes Steam screenshots.. can I change the Steam key for screen shots? As I would also love using the AFO without taking a screenshot every time."},{"CreatedByName":"OscarWilde","CreatedById":136185,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T07:21:28Z","Content":"So close...

I\u0027m aware it has a few flaws and could stand to be tweaked a little, sure, but it\u0027s such a *huge improvement* over the old aero! I love that wings can stall now.

Now that the capsule-flipping issue is fixed my only remaining complaint is anything with fairings seems to need fins, even with MechJeb guidance. Best part for me is (unlike FAR in 0.90) MechJeb\u0027s aerocapture/reentry predictions work with the new aero. So satisfying to be able send a pod all the way from Mun orbit \u0026 have it parachute down right next to KSC, or do an aerocapture without worrying about having it turn into a (crash-)landing if I come in too low."},{"CreatedByName":"Snarfster","CreatedById":80347,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T08:05:15Z","Content":"Love the aero model.

Seems too much for fast planes, too little for reentry. Or maybe the turbo jets just need to be toned down....hard to keep things from blowing up without feathering the throttle a lot. Also, the temperature gauges make my plane look like it has the bar pox after a while. Thinking maybe they should be replaced with a single gauge somewhere that tells you the temperature of the hottest part, and have all the little ones be an option that can be *enabled* using F9. \n\nOther than that, I like it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T08:12:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 08:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sidereus**"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T08:14:36Z","Content":"I do!\n\nI can\u0027t believe the amount of whining in other threads about what some constant should be set to, and comparing some value that they think is too high to the old soup-o-sphere.\n\n\\*part occlusion: two side by side pieves have more drag than two inline pieces, unlike the old model.

I\u0027ve been tweaking it all night to try and get a couple extra m/s and it\u0027s so much fun. It may not be \u0022real life\u0022 but it is a HUGE jump from the old model, and it made the game infinitely more fun!

Extending the brakes all the way out and just watching the speed dive as I come in for a landing (sometimes) feels very *star-wars-esque;* or at least very futuristic!

It is how Squad chose to make it and I have to adapt, though that was a bit easier for me as I used FAR in previous versions. When some things are plainly wrong, like flipping with heat shield attached, that needs to be fixed. Anything else I just have to adapt. Kerbin is not Earth and I don\u0027t expect it and its atmosphere to behave exactly like Earth. It is realistic, but not too much so that you have to spend extended times going through numbers and fixing it. When something is wrong with a craft and you have basic understanding of physics you can intuitively fix it. Keeping it somewhat realistic and fun in the same time is what I like from games I play and it is what I get from KSP and atmosphere model in it. When I finish my current career I may again switch to FAR, but for now I enjoy it like it is."}]}
