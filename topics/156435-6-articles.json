I really need to figure out how I\u0027m gonna do my rate meters/velocity readout bezel that will fit around the Navball. That\u0027d be the only thing left up in the air. Man, the Russian LEDs that I was looking at look GREAT, but dang, they are expensive! It\u0027d cost me nearly $100 to have enough shipped for the project. I feel like it\u0027d be WAY cheaper to figure out a small SMD PC board with SMD LEDs soldered to the edge (basically, anode on top of the board, cathode on bottom of the board, with pads right up to the edge. I can get SMD LEDs at bulk prices... I feel like that would likely be cheaper, and probably look fine, IF I can find the right shape SMD LED.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that, I just need to create the scale for my vertical velocity meter, create a bezel for the DSKY, create a bezel for the Auxiliary Digital Readout, and build the \u2206V Carriage Meter, and the instruments will be complete!

Worked on the remaining meters. I\u0027m doing some steps in batches, to streamline. I will be doing the single edgewise meter separately from the remaining three dual edgewise meters, as both it\u0027s internal construction, backlight mod configuration, and even the scale itself has been done entirely differently. I also, unfortunately, discovered I may need to reprint that scale. I made 2 minor errors. The movement configuration text that I copied off off of the original meter faces is placed too low to be visible, and the color gradient for Atmospheric Density covers the entirety of the face width... The only things that would be illuminated in the aqua color would be the text and scale tick marks, and two small vertical strips at either end of the color gradient. I\u0027m not sure where I went wrong with the measurements, but I also realize I never test fitted the early paper printout, which is sad, as I could have caught this early on. Now I\u0027ve wasted a print opportunity with the Nekoosa Synapse XM synthetic paper, and I only have a few sheets of the stuff. I don\u0027t wanna re-print until I can fill an entire sheet. I\u0027ll probably assemble it with just a paper scale, and get the mod built up, and then re-label it with the Nekoosa synthetic paper at some point in the future, probably when I start printing nomenclature tags for the control surface. It\u0027s a small bummer, but it is what it is...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for progress today, I have the proto boards installed on all three dual meters, and started the tedious preparation of the front face of the second of the factory backlit meters. The one I finished had that step done ages ago, and the two non backlit models faces were just straight up cut off and replaced with smooth polycarbonate, which has no face features to even be removed. The one meter has a center ridge that is higher than the rest of the face. I have to slowly snip that off, then file the ever so slightly tapered front face into a flat (side to side), even curve. If I don\u0027t do that, the scale will have unsightly lumps and warping in the surface, as it\u0027s stretched tight over the curve. No pics, cause it\u0027s the same old stuff that\u0027s already\u00A0been covered in past posts, and I\u0027m now focused on getting all the steps done as fast as possible, as opposed to re-documenting every step. Today, I will be busy with other things all day, so I might not get back to this till Friday. I\u0027ll probably finish that front face modification, drill and tap holes for securing the scales and the two meter\u0027s replacement face plates,\u00A0and if I have time, solder all the remaining LED modules. I likely won\u0027t do more than that, as my Friday afternoon is also occupied. I\u0027ll have the weekend free, so I\u0027ll see how far I can get then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-27T16:04:07Z\u0022 title=\u002201/27/2021 04:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 27, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by richfiles\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EI\u0026#039;m alive...

This one had a gradient scale and two entirely\u00A0separate illumination zones. I painted the edge of the polycarbonate first, and fed the printed scale into place and secured that. I built up another LED board, similar to the other meters. Again, each LED has it\u0027s own resistor (on the other side of the board) for even current limiting and thus even illumination. I tweaked the angle of the LEDs to center and evenly space them as best as possible.

I took measurements, made modifications, and slowly but surely drew a usable meter over the old scale, and made sure to mimic the Apollo meters as best as possible. Then I realized my multiple mistakes and started almost completely over. D\u0027oh!\u00A0One thing I had considered was cutting a small segment out of the metal piece that supports the scale plate. It would permit the backlight to shine closer to the center, and allow me to increase the size of \u0022Vertical Velocity\u0022, but with adjusting the spacing between letters, and pushing it outward a bit, I think I\u0027ve got it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221d7ZnAy.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022566\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/1d7ZnAy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy current scale revision is shown below. I think I have everything figured out, as far as backlighting goes. The entire internal structure is mounted on a sheet of blank FR4 PC board material, so what I\u0027ll do is just drill a few holes in it, mount LEDs and resistors, and design it to shine onto the back of the scale.\u00A0For the logarithmic scale, I used an old slide rule, measured out the ticks with a regular ruler, and then converted the ratio to something that looked good on screen. It\u0027s not perfect, but it\u0027s close enough\u00A0to actually\u00A0convey the shift in orders of magnitude. I really had to tweak with the text size and space between characters to make some of it fit. Originally, both LEDs were gonna light together as a warning light to indicate decent was too fast for landing, but adding another terminal to the rear and cutting\u00A0a wire trace would permit the two to light independently. I considered duplicating the Contact Light that will be on my DSKY here as well... Honestly, I just had a blue 8-10mm LED sitting around (I forget the exact size, but it matches the RED), and on the Lunar lander, the Contact Light\u00A0lit up blue. It was the only instrument that lit up in that color, and was pretty prominent.

That blue is so beautiful! I love it! I have not reached the point yet, but there will be a tube (likely just black heat shrink) around the red and blue LEDs. This will prevent light spill from the backlighting, or spoiling the colors. Another option I could take, since I am satisfied with the size, color and brightness of the red LED, is to simply think heat shrink tubing slightly past the curvature of the blue LED, and make the opening beveled, so only 8mm of the blue LED is seen... Yeah, I think that makes the most sense.

I didn\u0027t mount the meter before, I was just test fitting it. I attached the LED wiring to the rear plate first. I had to drill out extra holes to accommodate the additional lighting circuits. Initially, it only had a pair of incandescent lamps that illuminated the front of a metal plate. This was just two terminals. Now I have backlighting, Rate Warn, and Contact Light, along with a ground for all three. I used some scraps of the copper board I used in making the light shields for my edgewise meters, and made terminals, because I could not find my terminals.

I still need to mount an intermediary diffuser between he LEDs and the diffuser plate.

Early tests show this should work quite well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI almost don\u0027t want to post this final image, just cause it looks so bad, at least in comparison to what the final product will look like, but this is where I ended:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022rvkcdhX.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.67\u0022 height=\u00221116\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/rvkcdhX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPart of the reason this looks so very bad, is because this is just a paper label, and the intermediate diffusers are not installed. There\u0027s a ton of light spill from the edges, hotspots, and it\u0027s overall WAY too bright, due to it being missing the extra diffusers. There is also no cover plate for the meter\u0027s center, and the Indicator LEDs are not installed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet to come, installing the intermediary diffusers, drilling the indicator LED holes in the main diffuser plate and installing those LEDs, printing the GOOD looking scale on the Nekoosa Synapse XM synthetic polyester based paper, and figuring out how I am securing the scale to the meter. That last bit is entirely up in the air. I\u0027ve considered gluing it to the diffuser plate. I\u0027ve also considered leaving \u0022tabs\u0022 around the perimeter, and drilling a bunch of holes on the edge of the fiberglass plate, and strapping it down like a drum membrane using nylon floss. Haven\u0027t decided yet. Glue is easy, but I don\u0027t know if it\u0027ll hold forever. That Nekoosa synthetic paper is definitely strong enough to be held taught by tabs...

I then print the scale sheet, and cut out a square shape, and put holes where the four cover plate screws go. I cut a second sheet of diffuser plastic with a hole like the diffuser plate, to fit around the meter movement assembly. It too would be cut to match the square shape and the holes that line up with the cover plate mounting screws. I would sandwich the rigid diffuser plate between the lower diffuser sheet and the scale sheet, and the scale sheet would then screw to the two front mounts of the meter movement. The two sheets secured tightly from the four corner screw posts should tightly sandwich the rigid diffuser plate between, and screwing the scale down to the meter movement assembly makes sure it is tight at the center too, and flush with he top of the assembly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nB: The second method will likely still have me mount the scale sheet in the same manner, but would skip an extra diffuser layer sandwiching the diffuser plate. Instead, I would make a new diffuser plate altogether, this time mounting it to my mill (lathe would be better, but mine is not set up, and I can cheat with the mill). What I would do is mill out half the thickness of the diffuser plate, just at the center where it mounts over the meter movement assembly. By halving the thickness there, I make enough clearance for the plate to mount solidly and securely to the meter movement, without it being thick enough to interfere with the pointer\u0027s movement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOption A is the easier method, but it puts 4 diffuser layers between the LEDs and the viewer\u0027s eye. Not sure if I want that much light reduction. Each layer softens hotspots and spreads the light, but also dims it by a little bit too. Option B takes more work, and is slightly inconvenient because my lathe isn\u0027t currently set up, and my mill needs the space around it cleaned up a bit, plus it requires me to do some wonky tool mounting to do properly. As for the diffuser plate itself, I got *plenty* of material, so I can even afford to botch a few till I get it perfect. That\u0027s no big deal. All the diffuser sheets and plates are salvaged from my Grandmother\u0027s old TV... Sadly, it was being stored in a trailer parked beside my father\u0027s barn, and a sheet of snow \u0022avalanched\u0022 off the roof last winter. The impact of all that snow against the trailer knocked the TV over and shattered the LCD. Unfortunate too, as it was a really nice TV. At least I\u0027m reusing it\u0027s parts for a good purpose. I\u0027ll likely use more of the diffuser plate as the backing for the horizontal control surface as well. It\u0027ll make something nice and solid to support the illuminated legends for the various controls. That\u0027s something I\u0027ll get to when I finish the instruments and begin that stage of construction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"richfiles","CreatedById":129946,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-05T13:26:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWent in a slightly different direction today...\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis was my first real day off in nearly 2 months...\u003Cbr\u003E\nGot my work done, got my sleep in, and yesterday morning, I actually woke up early.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tTSi4oy.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.67\u0022 height=\u0022900\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/tTSi4oy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EI still question why they didn\u0027t just make the digit the full height of the module, and stuff that tiny little chip inside the bottom half of the \u00228\u0022 instead of having it sit below...\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway,\u00A0I wanted to test the HDSP-960 smart LED displays that I had bought \u003Cem\u003Eall the way back in May\u003C/em\u003E. First off, I wanted to verify they all actually worked, which they did! I also really wanted to give the seller positive feedback before the response\u00A0window closed. These are some pretty specialized and uncommon parts, generally only seen in very high end gear, or in military or aerospace applications. I wanted to test before giving feedback, but if good, I absolutely wanted to give the best feedback for making these available.\u00A0The cost of these parts was rather high... About\u00A0$10 a digit. That really adds up when you have an 8 digit display, but the visual of the HDSP-960\u0027s 4x7 element matrix just looks too good for the role of a singular readout.

At first, I thought I had things wired wrong... I was fine... I had just misread the datasheet, and it turns out the binary inputs are active high, but the decimal point is active low... Go figure. I had the binary wired so a switch turned on would output a 0, which is why when it displays all 0s, the relevant switches are all on. All binary lines high is a blank state, which explains the lack of digit displayed.\u00A0I also could not get the latch data line to work... Normally, you set the data on the binary input, then pulse the latch data line, and it updates the display to reflect and hold the new data. Once I got it to finally light up, it would update the display as soon as I changed data, and not when I pulsed the latch data input.\u00A0That one was entirely my fault... I was initially powering this with a 5 volt, 400mA power supply... \u003Cem\u003ENOPE! \u003C/em\u003EThese are toasty little power gobblers. It\u0027s easy to forget that these are NOS...

I notice with all pixels on, the current per pixel calculates to\u00A09.57mA, while with only 15 pixels on (the number required to display an eight with a decimal point), the current draw calculates to\u00A0only\u00A06.86mA per pixel. This tells me that between 15 and 21 LED pixels, there are an additional 2.71mA of losses, per pixel.

Since the bottom half of each module is ceramic, what I may end up doing, is to use\u00A0an aluminum block behind them as a heatsink, and add a bit of thermal paste, to help draw out that heat, through the block, and\u00A0into the aluminum front panel.

Literally \u003Cem\u003E\u0022have you tried turning it off, then on again?\u0022!!!\u003C/em\u003E I\u0027m noticing that the latch buttons and the pull up resistors I\u0027m using are all resulting in an unusually high voltage for ground (1.41v), and that is definitely not normal... Yet these are the SAME resistors I used yesterday, and the SAME resistors used on the SAME breadboard to pull up the data bus signals as well, and those pull down to \u0026lt;1v when low... I\u0027m actually starting to suspect the \u003Cem\u003Ebreadboard itself\u003C/em\u003E might be defective... It\u0027s the same breadboard I used as a teen, back in the 1990s, and it\u0027s warped and old, and the portion I used for the latch pushbuttons is a different area than what I used before... Interestingly, the black module loaded characters just fine. Anyway, I either need to retire this old breadboard, or build a buffer circuit to make sure my low signals are 0 volts and my high signals are at 5v, and that there\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eno ambiguity at all\u003C/em\u003E in the signal integrity. It\u0027s just frustrating to have issues like this, and know 95% it\u0027s probably just worn out tools, and have that lingering 5% wonder if I\u0027ll end up finding an error \u003Cem\u003Ethis time\u003C/em\u003E if I just do a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Equadruple\u003C/em\u003E check...\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is probably one area where building from mental plans probably doesn\u0027t help... If there are any errors in the construction, actually having it laid out of paper would certainly help with troubleshooting... A design like this though, I almost never put to paper though... It\u0027s just frustrating when things don\u0027t work... This doesn\u0027t actually happen to me often, so it\u0027s easy for roadblocks like this to feel really intense...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00228A2J0Nh.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.67\u0022 height=\u00221018\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/8A2J0Nh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, the way this is configured, there are 7 data bus lines (the number only digits only use 5 of the 7 bits). Each of the eight number digits has it\u0027s own unique\u00A0Latch Enable signal (this is the signal I\u0027m having issues with on my test setup right now). Furthermore, the black alphanumeric module has 2 address inputs to select which of the four digits to update, and it has a Write Enable to write the new digit to the display. This comes out to a total of 18 digital signals to control this... And of course both the\u00A0Arduino Uno and Pro Mini have only 14 Digital I/O... D\u0027oh!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis leaves we with a minor dilemma... Do I upgrade to a bigger variant of the Arduino to control this, or slap together some jellybean logic to reduce my pin count. Either way requires that I order parts, and there\u0027s no real benefit to one method vs the other. An Arduino Mega might be necessary to have up to 18 Digital outs, and still have room for serial, but that really feels like overkill! In that sense, I feel like some jellybean logic would make more sense:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I feed 3 Digital I/O to the inputs of a 74HC138 3-to-8 decoder, I can decode three address lines into 8 individual one of 8 outputs. If I feed those eight outputs to a bus buffer chip with one Digital out feeding the Enable, then I can stack some functionality... The 3 address digital outs will feed the two address inputs of the black alphanumeric module, and the three inputs to the decoder chip. One digital out will go to the black module\u0027s Write Enable, and when activated, will load a character from the 7-bit data bus\u00A0into the address selected by the first\u00A0two bits of the three\u00A0address Digital outs. The second digital out will be the Latch Enable, and will activate the enable chip connected to the output of the 3-to-8 decoder chip. That will pass one, and only one selected output to the one selected numeric display, updating just that one digit. This two chip solution compresses my Digital out requirements to: 7-bits for the data bus, 3-bits for the address bus, and 2 select outputs. That\u0027s only 12 wires, and even leaves 2 Digital I/O free for serial communication. With only 2 chips, I\u0027ll be able to get an Arduino Pro Mini to be able to handle all the I/O to control this display.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s another thing... I think having clean 0v/5v signals from a proper controller will clean up these weird unexpected mystery voltages that I\u0027m seeing, trying to mess with breadboards and pull up resistors, and what not... At least I hope so. Those digits were expensive! $10 per digit! I don\u0027t want to have some kind of fault that damages them. They already get pretty toasty, so I made sure to keep the rear clear, to allow for a heatsink to make contact with he rear of the displays.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso... one more thing...\u003Cbr\u003E\nI might have found unobtanium!\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf this works, it will require hand grinding to make it fit, but I found some hemispherical lenses meant for LED backlighting. I have no idea if they will show digits clearly through, or if they were a waste of $10... But the idea is, if I grind the sides of these lenses to form 10mm wide rounded rectangular lenses, then I may be able to place them over the displays and magnify the digits, like an old school bubble lens display. Again, no idea if it will actually work or not, but I\u0027ll give it a shot. It was a $10 gamble... $1 per lens is better than $10 a digit!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-07-08T20:51:29Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2021 08:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by richfiles\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tsaven","CreatedById":138869,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-10T00:22:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMan, this whole thing is just unrealistically good.\u00A0 You\u0027re making us all look positively lazy by comparison.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"richfiles","CreatedById":129946,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-16T10:45:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting development in something that has sat on the back burner even longer than any recent developments! Waaaaay back in 2017, when I did the diode ROMs for the DSKY units readouts, I decided I needed a 4-to-16 decoder to take a simple 4 bit value and decode it into a single output to send to each character select of the ROM... I found some \u003Ca href=\u0022https://assets.nexperia.com/documents/data-sheet/74HC_HCT154.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E74HC154\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0chips that would do the logic decoding,\u00A0but forgot about the basic issue of driving the LEDs. A digital logic chip won\u0027t put out enough current to light the whole display. I figured that I could do a simple transistor amplifier, but basic transistor amplifier\u00A0circuits are inverting circuits, meaning high signals become low, and low becomes high. This complicates things, as now the 4-to-16 decoders outputs would be inverted, which is not what\u00A0the diode ROMs require to be driven.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust so happens, I came across a sale at a surplus parts supplier I frequently buy from, and they had packages of\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://assets.nexperia.com/documents/data-sheet/74HC_HCT4514.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E74HC4514\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0chips for a very good price. I was unfamiliar with this part, so I looked up the datasheet. The chips I had previously bought were active low outputs, which is how the diode ROMs were built to be driven... The problem with the 74HC154 chips, is that when you add a transistor driver to those active low outputs, they will become\u00A0active high driven outputs The datasheet\u00A0revealed that\u00A0these 74HC4514 chips have\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eactive high\u003C/em\u003E outputs, meaning when fed into a single transistor inverting amplifier circuit, each driven output will become... \u003Cem\u003Edrumroll please...\u003C/em\u003E active low!

The inputs are latched! I removed the latch information from the truth tables, as it made certain parts not line up, and the purpose of the tables above is for comparison of just the outputs, but basically, these new chips can latch the data on the four input lines (A0-A3). This means that I can now run these chips on a bus, just like the velocity display chips, instead of have dedicated lines for every single input of every diode ROM. Now, since the chips have latched inputs, I can send data over the four wires, to all the diode ROMs inputs at once, and then select just the one that I want to latch with a single latch signal. If I had 4 diode ROMs, the old chips would require I have 16 wires to control them all (4 wires per ROM) and all those wires would have to be held in their states. Now, I need only 4 data lines and 4 chip selects to enable the latch on each. That\u0027s not bad, and quite frankly, after learning how straining the velocity readout\u0027s latch selects were, I\u0027m actually glad this chip makes this\u00A0so much simpler!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-07-16T10:46:08Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2021 10:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by richfiles\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cyberKerb","CreatedById":28891,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-10T12:52:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey Rich, something for reference / idea on using your Navball\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed5730025992\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/homecockpits/comments/p0ifbg/finally_got_the_first_two_axes_of_my_f4_phantom/\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"richfiles","CreatedById":129946,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-03T02:43:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh man, so he rebuilt the ball...

The digital oscillator I have is old enough to be considered retro tech, but it\u0027s a high enough resolution output that even the tiniest filter capacitor will certainly make the output smooth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"richfiles","CreatedById":129946,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-11T05:24:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022clO0RaT.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002275.09\u0022 height=\u0022856\u0022 width=\u00221140\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/clO0RaT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think I\u0027ve found a promising power amplifier circuit for powering the Navball.

Turns out it caught the attention of an individual with far more extensive analog design experience than I have. They got curious enough about the project that they seem to have taken a genuine interest in coming up with a solution... For the fun or challenge of it. So far, the guy has already reworked the 1977 circuit into a modernized circuit concept, has run the circuit in a SPICE simulation to confirm operation, and verified it can be put together with commonly available modern components. The most expensive part is likely to be a transformer... 120vac primary, 230vac CT secondary. I suppose just a 230/240 to 230CT for other regions of the world. That\u0027s probably only a $20 part.
