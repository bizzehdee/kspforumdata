If you don\u0027t want to do that, download CCleaner and get rid of all the junk on your PC with that. Furthermore, delete any unused games or applications you have and don\u0027t use.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf none of this helps, please try resetting your PC as stated above and see what happens. If the problem isn\u0027t resolved, I\u0027m afraid something might be wrong with your motherboard or CPU perhaps, and you should go on a more advanced support forum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
