Whichever receiver has the superior orientation will soak up almost the entirety of the power in your network. The other receiver(s) will only get what the primary receiver cannot due to orientation, which is usually a small fraction of the total and will never be anywhere close enough to equal to give you balanced thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the thermal receivers can absorb an infinite amount of power, you can\u0027t count on saturating one to fill the others either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can use onboard reactors, but for the most part you will be extremely disappointed in the thrusts provided in comparison to microwave power. Antimatter is an exception but fueling a spaceplane with it on the ground is either a logistical nightmare or a bit cheaty, depending on how you get antimatter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing you can consider doing is using plasma rockets. These use megajoules to run and can actually be saturated. The smallest ones I believe use around 3 gigawatts max. You should be able to get 6\u002B gigawatts from a microwave network easily using either receivers or a thermal receiver paired with a generator. Excess power that one plasma engine cannot handle will be shunted to the other, and as long as you have enough to fill both you won\u0027t have asymmetric thrust problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, this is finicky. It isn\u0027t something you want to try in an atmosphere. One engine has a habit of flaming out before it realizes that there\u0027s enough power in the system for both it and its brother, among other such problems. This can easily spin you out in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Donziboy2","CreatedById":74984,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-07T18:48:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deredere\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Deredere\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can use onboard reactors, but for the most part you will be extremely disappointed in the thrusts provided in comparison to microwave power.

I\u0027m considering things like TAC Life Support or even B9 aerospace.... maybe even deadly re-entry. Hell, with max out tech trees and AM \u002B Plasma... I don\u0027t HAVE to use aerobraking at 100Gs. I just do it because it\u0027s fun, fast, and easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich would you all suggest I consider adding to my KSP for fun, complexity, and possibly difficulty?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Steve\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane has it\u0027s uses, there are many mods that have it as a dependency, like Modular Kolonization.

Honestly, the only problem I have with TACLS is that the moddles are just horrible. Guess I can always grab a re-skin... or something. But yeah, this sounds good. I won\u0027t even have to make any big changes. Hell, my warp tugs are only out on missions for up to a week at a time (Kerbin time). Usually only 3-5 Kdays. Only thing I\u0027ll really have to work with is an AM shuttle/Launch Pad fueler... Minmus mining/fueling base (which is pretty darn pointless at this point, I\u0027ll probably decomission it entirely) and Moho/Eeloo science base.
