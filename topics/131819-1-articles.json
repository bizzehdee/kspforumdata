After about four weeks of work (and more beforehand creating the spacecraft model, which was initially unrelated to the film and I have been working on since late last year) the project is finally complete. I present \u003Cem\u003EATLAS\u003C/em\u003E, inspired in part by some of the unused concept artwork for \u003Cem\u003E2001: A Space Odyssey.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Hope you guys enjoy. The deadline is Monday, so any suggestions prior to that point are very welcome since there\u0027s a bit of time left to do tweaks. I used Blender 3D as well as After Effects for this project.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/2XcAle1uLVs?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-11T00:36:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAwesome!

My one tip is that the spacecraft looks too, I don\u0027t know, CG? maybe just a filter over it could make it look more gritty and realistic.
