I was thinking it would start you out with around $1,000 or so depending on ship costs, and you\u0027d build up from there. It would rely on landing on other bodies and would be landing-funded, for example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elanding a probe: $100\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elanding a kerbal: $500 each\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Escience parts: $50 each\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand so on. I also though it could add some colony based parts like Hab parts and water tanks/collectors. I bet it\u0027d be fun with somekind of life-support mod.
