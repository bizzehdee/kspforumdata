NOW, the mining takes forever with hot drill and I have to turn the ISRU on and off. Why does Squad think we want to be HVAC designers in a rocket game!!! So my question is, what can be done to my existing ships, or do I need to trash all four of my existing mining ships and build new ones and launch them to the planet systems they serve...... I\u0027m thinking the \u0022solution\u0022 is to limp along with what I\u0027ve got in place, finish one last planned Duna landing, then quit playing....

Full size ISRU, fed by six drills, on an 9% ore patch on Minmus, with Level 4 engineer (don\u0027t have Level 5 in career yet). Six Gigantor solar panels with their passive radiators didn\u0027t do squat. One medium-size Thermal Control System was close - the ISRU starts cold and low efficiency, gets to 100% efficient at 1000K, then overheated to around 1100K and 65-73% efficiency (nighttime and daytime, IIRC). So I\u0027m guessing two of those medium TCS will be enough to stay on 100%, for part count of 2 and 0.5T mass. Maybe one medium and 2-3 smalls, for part count 3-4 and mass 0.35-0.4T.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that surprised me - I\u0027m used to solar panels clipping through each other and cargo bays without problems - the extending TCS radiator caused some hellacious explosions when intersecting with both solar panels and cargo bay doors.
