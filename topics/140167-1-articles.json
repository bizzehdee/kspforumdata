I\u0027ve since installed ampyear to try to find the power hungry culprit but ampyear shows me that i have over 200 electrical charge compared to consumption but yet the timer showing how long i have power left still keeps going down and batterys keep dying. My only work around is to use the power cheat but ruins immersion for me. I have tried for 2-3 days and many hours to fix this with no luck as yet. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UnanimousCoward","CreatedById":109698,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-20T16:02:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should probably post this in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/140070-112-realism-overhaul-v1101-may-18/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ERealism Overhaul thread\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-20T16:07:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2016 04:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by UnanimousCoward\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ECorrect link\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-20T18:14:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222592482\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140167\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221463753756\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022164503\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gooner\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Gooner said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;snip\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis might seem obvious - but this is definitely happening in 1x time right?
