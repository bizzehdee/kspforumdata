If the center of lift (or center of pressure) is above the center of mass, then the rocket will be unstable. Also remember that the old method of ascending to orbit no longer works.

My method of ascending to orbit is as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Vertical until rocket hits 65m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.
