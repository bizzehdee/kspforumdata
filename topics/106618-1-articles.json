Right around 10k meters up from launch, the rocket will tumble end-over-end, no matter what I do, or change. I\u0027ve checked everything I can think of: weight distribution, where thrust is actually being applied, RCS, no RCS, fins, no fins, solid boosters, liquid engines, every possible combo of thing I could think of.\n\nI did have ONE rocket that mostly flew stable, but I can\u0027t figure out why it does, or why all the others do not. At first I thought maybe the rockets I was building with the AI pilot were wonky (and they still may be), but even manually piloted rockets have this problem. Any ideas?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T23:07:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 11:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sacheverell**"},{"CreatedByName":"quietghost","CreatedById":117566,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T17:38:23Z","Content":"Try adding some fins to the bottom of the rocket. If the center of lift (or center of pressure) is above the center of mass, then the rocket will be unstable. Also remember that the old method of ascending to orbit no longer works. If you try to pitch over to 45 degrees at 10km, you will lose control of the rocket no matter where the Center of pressure is. My method of ascending to orbit is as follows:\n\n1. Vertical until rocket hits 65m/s\n\n2. SLOWLY start pitching over the rocket, gradually adjusting towards horizontal.\n\n3. During this process, manage the speed to be slowly increasing the entire time.\n\n4. By an altitude of 17-20km, you should be 45 degrees off the vertical and going about 500m/s\n\n5. Keep adjusting towards horizontal. Use your horizontal velocity to push your apoapsis up, rather than vertical velocity.\n\nHopefully this helps!"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T17:39:15Z","Content":"Post screenshots of your rockets, but remember that 1.0 included an overhaul of aerodynamics; you need nosecones and such now.

If you\u0027re using the old 2:1 standard odds are you\u0027re overspeeding in the lower atmosphere.\n\nWhat flight-profile are you flying? The NuStock aero doesn\u0027t like violent maneuvering so if you\u0027re doing the old \u0022straight-up to 10km, pitch-over to 45\u0022 maneuver you\u0027ll tend to pitch-pole the rocket. You need to follow the prograde marker which means starting your turn earlier and doing it more gradually.\n\nDo you have a bunch of greebles located high up on the rocket? Goo cannisters and such? That\u0027s going to push your center-of-drag in front of your center-of-mass and that could cause instability.\n\nWithout more details thats all I can think of as common mistakes.

Are you getting a lot of Mach effects (white blurry lines) at 10K? The turbulence is probably knocking you into a tumble.\n\nAlso - a quick example of a rocket that will get you to Munar orbit and back, although it\u0027s nowhere near enough for a landing.\n\n![GrCcUzm.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/GrCcUzm.png?1)\n\nFlies pretty well. LV-T45 plus fins for stability in the atmosphere. SRBs thrust limited to 75%. Launch using SRBs only, start your gravity turn once you hit about 200m/s and make it a very gradual turn - no more flying up to 10K and pitching over 45 degrees.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T18:16:54Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 06:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KSK**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sacheverell","CreatedById":18314,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T18:16:36Z","Content":"Answering as many of these as possible:\n\nYea, I was doing the ol\u0027 \u002210k then turn\u0022 routine, and realized after a bit of looking around that the old way isn\u0027t flying anymore (pardon the pun). TWR, honestly not sure, but given what I\u0027m hearing, likely way too high. Will look into that! Center of mass is pretty much centered, but I\u0027m betting this has more to do with the new atmos not being a lake anymore, and actually being atmos.

Reduce that unwanted lift\n\n2. Counteract that lift.\n\n3. Move the center of mass higher.\n\n1. Lift above the center can be caused by wide payloads. Not much to do here other than making the payloads smaller.\n\n2. You can counteract the lift by moving your center of lift below the center of mass with fins at the bottom. The farther below the center of mass and stronger the lift, the more stable the flight.\n\n3. Finally, rockets with long individual stages can start out stable but become unstable. This is because fuel drains from the top first, lowering your center of mass below your center of lift. You can pump fuel in flight (from the bottom of the active stage to the top of the same stage) to keep your center as high as possible."},{"CreatedByName":"Clipperride","CreatedById":149816,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T01:21:32Z","Content":"Having the CoM too far back can cause problems too. Think of a dart or javelin, both have a weight at the front. As the rocket will rotate around the CoM (the old analogy of thinking of a model hanging from a piece of string at the balance point/CoM is helpful) if it is too far back any slight movement at the back from gimbeling engines, will cause a large movement at the nose. If your still deep in the atmosphere (say at 10km) the resistance hitting the edge of the rocket from this large nose movement can send you tumbling.\n\nI\u0027m rarely travelling at much more than 300m/s when reaching 10km. Try a lower TWR for the first stage, with fuel to take you a little above 10km. When you stage you can set your second stage up to really start to rocket along (sorry couldn\u0027t resist that one!). I also generally find my rockets behave better with the RCS turned off till 15-20km.\n\nI\u0027m lucky in a way as I have only played since KSP 1.xx came along and so haven\u0027t had to relearn anything with the new realism."},{"CreatedByName":"nigelvn","CreatedById":143368,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T15:44:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m lucky in a way as I have only played since KSP 1.xx came along and so haven\u0027t had to relearn anything with the new realism.\n\nI do not completely agree upon that...
