I have NFE installed, so it\u0027s configured for that.  I put a couple of extra stock radiators on there - attached directly to the Rontgen, but it doesn\u0027t cool down any faster than it does when the radiators are shut off.  Unless I have the engine going, it doesn\u0027t seem to cool much at all when the reactor is at 100, and even then, it\u0027s insufficient.\n\nHow do I cool this thing off more quickly?  Obviously since it\u0027s in-atmosphere, any deployable radiator won\u0027t work.\n\nI don\u0027t know of any other mods for the current KSP version that provide better radiators.
