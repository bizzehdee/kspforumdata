This computer has heat issues like you would not believe and power requirements about 3x what a normal computer has. I had to put in a 1.25KW power supply to be on the safe side and it produces more heat then most electric space heaters. When I was in college I did not have to turn the heater on untill halfway into winter because the computer was heating my room on its own. Got to be a nightmare during the summer because my room did not have AC. I had to open the window and the door and run a fan to suck the AC in from the hallway.
