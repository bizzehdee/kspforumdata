At least back before Al Gore began his crusade, even some scientists actually reported through National Geographic that one volcanic eruption releases as much chlorofluorocarbons into the atmosphere as man, in the industrial capacity of the mid 1990s, could release in 300 years. Yet modern supporters of man-caused climate change never address these two issues. There are other factors that are also ignored that easily fall into this category - such as the shifting of the Earth\u0026#39;s axis since the great Indonesian earthquake. According to JPL\u0026#39;s website, there have been about ten earthquakes that have shifted the Earth\u0026#39;s axis between five and twenty centimeters. May not seem like a lot at the surface, but in astronomy and related space sciences, this is huge.

I will use this example - if a room is a non-smoking room except for grandpa, everyone will still smell like smoke even though there is only one smoker present... This is simply another way to rid the world of capitalism pure and simple. Solar energy and wind power are neat from a novelty perspective, but cannot sustain a modern and developing society in the manner that fossil fuels have (What about all those eagles and Canadian geese who are killed by windmills?).

There is this corresponding belief that the world is overpopulated, which is simply not true. We have no idea what the \u0022tipping point\u0022 is on Earth. Everything is based on the work of Thomas Malthus, from the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. His theory was flawed because of several reasons: 1) he did not consider the role of disease and pestilence on the human population; 2) he based his theory on the idea that agriculture was as fully developed as it ever could be; 3) did not consider the application of technology to overcome some of the issues faced by population. With all the famine in Africa and southeast Asia, there potentially is plenty of food, yet the United States, Canada, and most of Europe actually pay farmers NOT to maximize their production. Fresh water issues? Again, Israel has nearly perfected desalination; this is the answer to the world\u0026#39;s freshwater \u0022shortage\u0022 especially when it is coupled with reclamation technologies used here, within the United States (this is a newly emerging technology developed within the last twenty years). \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFifthly, it is about population control and global wealth redistribution.

This will be no diiferent, with the demise of coal reserves and depletion of forest we will see pan evaporation rates go up, this will have tragic consequences on some areas, but other areas that are now waste lands will see an increase of biomass, if humans step out these areas will remediate CO2 in a few hundred years creating new coal beds. The problem howver is that humans disallow forest recovery, and just about every parcel of land that humans employ undergo soil carbon loss. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere are things we can immediately do to stop CO2 rise, one of them is to stop the burning of forest for clearing land, and the other is look to replace firewood as a source of cooking fuel.

Both are easily done, trees are a valuable commodity, even trees cosidered waste have value in the building industries, but also brush can be ground and tilled into local soils pevent aerosol production. Better is to maintain a moratorium on the destruction of primordial forest. Even dried wood can be chipped and used for soil carbon. \u003Cbr\u003E\nCoal by itself is not the primary cause of pan evaporation rate declines, in south east asia its the aerosols of wood and wood that is converted to charcoal. The problem is so bad that in the region NW of chernobyl, scientist studying the behavior of farmers who had higher levels of bone strontium found that the cause was not so much drinking the milk or eating the crops, these lost there transferable radioactivity after the first season. The problem was they would till the chaff up and burn them roots and all, very easy to prepare the soil for the next season, but they burned soil minerals and then they breathed the radioactive strontium. Compositng would have lost the minerals for a season but would have kept soil carbon and soil minerals on the earth. CO2 problem is a complex issue it gets into legacy issues that were not so important when population densites were low and people lived 40 years. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis takes us to the core psychology of the climate change deniers, because the obvious truth out there is that social status symbols like hummers, lot corn-fed cattle dinnerrs at expensive restaurants, and big airconditioned houses, and of course we need a quad core 3.8 ghz cpu with a 250 watt gpu to play ksp all contribute to global warming. So then what we have are vested interest in opinions, which as we can see in this thread are boistered by books from popular authors. I see that alot because i live in a town that oil built and so no self-respecting male wants the gov telling him what to do with his 8 mpg ford duely that he uses to commute to his job as the company plumber. Of course that lincoln arc welder he carries in the back once every three years could be equally well carried in a rental, or 4 cylinder tacoma. The word progressive takes on a negative connotation because the alternative is that climate change deniers are wantedly embracing legacy problems to the point of economically risky behaviors. This is what happened in 2008/9 financial crises when many deniers ended up bancrupt trying to commute after oil peaked at 4.00/gallon, and the two of three companies that made these monsters went bankrupt. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut climate science does not pour from popular books and ex-spruts (political drips) it comes from the peer reviewed primary literature, the amount of literature in support has grown astronomically since 1980, several publications can from indivuals supported by hostile industries who found it implausible to deny the effects of anthropogenic climate change. Most people had expected global warming, more than currently observed. This undermined the models in two ways.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. CO2 and gases in general do not like sea water, however CO2s solubility goes way up in cold rainwater and snow and inversions in the winter arctic concentrated CO2 in the sea ice as a reserve that forced CO2 into the arctic ocean that eventually found its way to the sea floor of the pacific and at such high pressures CO2 is quite soluble, and sodium carbonate in sea water is converted to sodium bicarbonate, acidifying the water. This CO2 enriched water dissapeared until recently, as it has begun rising up in the Pacific Northwest and spoiling shellfish fisheries. So this hidden reserve was found.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis gets to the heart of the climate change denier problem. CO2 rise could never be predicted based on the known anthropogenics, could it be predicted at all? Of course the climatology was never previously asked if you double the concentration of an atmospheric gas, whereall will that gas go. Even though the climate denier\u0026#39;s science is far from perfect, they demand that the peer reviewed literature be perfect or they would not believe the theory. We can say the same thing about gravity, classic physics and relativistic physics. The deniers fail to understand that science is not an object, like something an engineer deals with, its a process. If we look at the CO2 level problem this way it was never a problem but a scientific challenge. It is still a challenge because we know the gas went down, so where will it come up next. You can protect a fishery using industrial lime enriched water, but its of little use after the fishery is dead. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. The second issue was that even though CO2 levels that were evident predicted a temperture rise that rise was not evident. At the same time odd regional behviors were being observed, the most evident of which was that regions with intermediate climate were having long periods of hot dry weather weree interrupted by periods of cooler weather with more frequent decadal rainfall events, this includes the two historically severe el nino events that occurred in the late 20th. One key finding was the high altitude jet trails, and increases aerosol production over south, southeast asia and china where lowering the pan evaporatotion rates and lowering surface water tempertaures in specific areas. So basically at times and seasons were aerosols were low and incident angles were vertical lots of humidity accumulated in the atmosphere and increased the chance of decadal storms, surface rain water and secondary rains cooling reagions. At other times when aerosols where high the normal cloud rainfall patterns failed to materialize causing historic droughts, heatwaves, and forest fires increasing the levels of aerosols from dust storms over Africa and smoke particulates elsewhere. Since it was obvious that heat trapping did not have to result in a linear correlation with temperture, but could interact with other variant factors manefesting itself predominately in climate change. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis another core misunderstanding of climate deniers. When you apply energy or trap energy in a system, te trapping force only alters the dynamic equilibrium of the system. In this system there is water, air and a whole lot of space beyond the atmosphere to radiate. Instead of heating what else might happen. The level of thermoclines may increase, this has been observed in some areas of Asia. This would increase the strength of typhoons over asia, increase the surface water temperatures as has been seen in the gulf of Mexico, it could icrease circulation of water and wind into the arctic and increase transglobal energy dissipation. So we see that that afford faster energy transport out of the system can allow for a lower equilibrium temperture. Typhoons and equitorial/polar energy transports are ways the system is trying to cool itself. So now i have cut through the denier BS we are back to the topic that seeded this post.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-19T18:23:29Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2015 06:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"micr0wave","CreatedById":136352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T19:31:15Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027PB666\u0027]If we are talking about geological time frames as with snowball earth, its a maatter of increasing solar output that eventually does the trick.
