Semiconductor manufacturing, due to the extremely small sizes of the components (the latest Intel process, I believe, utilizes transistors just 22nm across), necessitates a cleanroom environment - any contamination during the production process will destroy a chip. The best cleanroom in existence, naturally, is the vacuum of space - far better than exists on Earth, and much easier to maintain. This effect is especially pronounced at higher orbits, where the Earth\u0027s atmosphere drops off, though even LEO might work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, zero-grav - processor manufacturing is somewhat limited by the size of a silicon wafer that can be created, and (I believe) that one of the primary limiting factors for THAT is structural strength - silicon wafers are INCREDIBLY fragile. There\u0027s a certain minimum thickness required for a given diameter of wafer, to prevent it from cracking (and thus being ruined) from gravity acting on it during handling. In a zero-g environment, the only limitation to the size of a given wafer is what the machinery is designed for, rather than structural issues. Bigger wafers, naturally, lead to productivity increases - you can produce more chips out of a single run of the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, the nature of semiconductor manufacturing - a small amount of raw material can, under ideal circumstances (which don\u0027t exist on Earth) produce an incredibly large amount of product, and the margins are good on the product itself - most of the expenses in semiconductor manufacture occur from the construction of the manufacturing facilities (constructing a terrestrial semiconductor fab for modern chips can run well over a billion dollars, and a good chunk of that comes from building what amounts to a giant cleanroom). A hypothetical space-based semiconductor fab could use simple, (comparatively) low-cost rockets to deliver materials and retrieve finished product, due to the low-mass nature of a production run (a ton of silicon can produce, under ideal circumstances, thousands upon thousands of CPUs, and finished CPUs have a value/mass that is much greater than the per-kilogram launch cost of some cheaper rockets (Dnepr, Proton)).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my example of the margins on this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn average CPU (no additional components like heatsink or fan, but I\u0027m assuming it has a thermal cap) weighs about 45 grams. Under a reasonable assumption of 80% efficiency, you get 17 (rounded down to integer value, .7777~ of a CPU isn\u0027t particularly useful, so keep in mind that the actual profit margin may be a bit higher) units for every kilogram of raw material launched (assuming, naturally, that the materials are sent up in precisely the right proportions). Now, at a retail value of $300/unit (arbitrary figure, represents mid-high range CPUs), those 17 CPUs net you $5100. The launch cost per kilogram for a Dnepr rocket is about $3800/kg, which nets you about $1300/kg of profit, given 80% system efficiency. For a Proton rocket, your launch cost is about $4300/kg, which still leaves you about $800/kg in profit. Emergent space-access systems such as Skylon (or even Falcon Heavy) can be expected to drive the cost down further. And, since you\u0027re launching raw materials and not people or expensive equipment, the cost of a launch failure is comparatively low. Costs can be expected to decrease further once asteroid/lunar mining takes off, as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaturally, this is a paper calculation, and may be affected one way or another by variances that can\u0027t be accurately predicted. Different models of CPUs can significantly affect the margins on this - the most expensive of Intel\u0027s i7s retails in the range of $1100/unit (and the most costly Xeon for 3 times that), which pushes the margin through the roof.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know, what do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-12T23:17:28Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2013 11:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by NGTOne\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T23:44:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t consider semiconductor production in space yet, but I think if prices drop sufficiently, it might just become reality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, you can make stupid high quality superalloys in space. Due to microgravity, the molten alloy will mix evenly. And the lack of Oxygen makes production more efficient, as you lose no material to oxidation. You can mine the materials you need from near earth objects - including the fuel to haul the materials back - and in the end, make your production fully independent of supply missions from Earth. If there are workers in those orbiting factories, they would obviously need to be sustained though, thanks to the proximity of LEO to earth\u0027s surface, you don\u0027t need any people there, you can just control it remotely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T05:44:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking about that also.

Wavelength of the UV light they use to create masks is part of the limitation for size of the components. With ion beams, you could potentially go to a few nm. Of course, things get really weird at these scales. Semiconductors become very non-classical.

Since semiconductor mass-production began in earnest, wafer sizes have increased from 25mm diameter to 300mm diameter, and the industry is looking at adopting 450mm as the next standard. You can cut many individual elements from one wafer, and having one big wafer rather than a bunch of smaller ones increases your process speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason semiconductor fabs are so expensive on the ground is because you have to create a GIANT cleanroom - imagine building a hermetically sealed building the size of a warehouse and you get the picture. And, no, gravity doesn\u0027t pull ALL contaminants downwards - the kind that are the most risk for contamination during semiconductor manufacturing are the kind that like to float around and have to be drawn out of the facility using extensive HVAC.

We do have a couple of research foundries at my place of work (using older process nodes) and I am knowledgeable in the fabrication process flow. Unfortunately I\u0027m away on travel right now so I can only respond with my phone, but if I was in front of my computer, I would be able to give a more detailed response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will start off by saying that what makes a foundry (particularly commercial foundries) so large and expensive is not the clean room environment, but of the equipment within the clean room. We\u0027re talking giant furnaces, chemical vapor deposition machines, photo lithography stepper machines, photoresist spinners, plasma dry etch machines, acid wet etch baths, etc... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing to remember is that all of this equipment is expensive so fabs make money by producing large volumes. So a foundry must be running 24/7 to make money (three shifts) and they do things in a massively parallel and pipelines flow. That means they have a large quantity of these very heavy machines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s limiting semiconductor technologies today are things like light wavelengths used in photo lithography (as Eltham mentioned), getting your crystalline structure defect density low enough, quantum tunnelling through the MOSFET channels and the fact that your device sizes can be measured in tens of atoms. The reason moving to 450mm size wafers is hard is due to the fact that the machinery is expensive and it is difficult to grow a \u0022defect free\u0022 silicon boule that is big enough. On average, the boule need to be 50% wider than your wafer size. Other issues are the fact that the wafer must meet a certain flatness and roughness spec. I don\u0027t really see how a zero-g, neat vacuum environment would help with those issues. If anything, it could make things worse, since you tend to use gravity to help you grow silicon and make wafers. Admittedly I\u0027ve now gone from device fabrication to material growth, so I have gone a little off track. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of fabrication, you would need to contain your wet acid baths, you would need to hold your wafers with nanometer alignment accuracy without the aid of gravity (so no traditional flat wafer chucks) and you would need a method of vapor deposition that doesn\u0027t require gravity. Not to mention all of the heavy, expensive machinery. Also, we actually can make 450mm wafers that are structurally sound and they can meet the specs, but making the device fabrication machinery accurate enough and affordable enough is what\u0027s preventing industry from jumping to 450mm wafer runs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will add that it might be interesting to see what effect zero-g has on material growth (aka the silicon crystalline structure) as well as epitaxial growth at the research level.

As you probably know, Intel uses a tick-tock development cycle where tick is when they shrink an existing architecture design down to a smaller process node and tock is where they design a new architecture in the existing process node. It was speculated that Intel may switch to a tick - tock - tock development cycle due to the time it takes to shrink process nodes.
