Used KAS parts (ground pylon and then the tubes) to connect the pad to the rocket, and now I can build. HOWEVER, two attempts to build a rover resulted in the rover first appearing about 1km up, and then falling to the ground. The second, it appeared near the launchpad but a bit in the ground and fell apart. I was concerned the pad and rocket, being connected, were causing wobbles which were somehow throwing things off. I disconnected them and the pad promptly exploded!

Took a rocket launch pad to the moon and dropped it next to my rocket. The rocket fell over, but was otherwise fine. Went to build with the pad - of course - no workshop - so nothing happens. Used KAS parts (ground pylon and then the tubes) to connect the pad to the rocket, and now I can build. HOWEVER, two attempts to build a rover resulted in the rover first appearing about 1km up, and then falling to the ground.
