It creates the throughput to make a home computer a super computer. I don\u0027t understand why these don\u0027t exist. I\u0027m pretty sure that mixed optical and electronics could be useful as they could be do calibration work and potentially get around other issues. Especially to start with. It would add a massive single core which would basically be good for this and other games like it. Or it could be an entire system that is handed off too from a basic system and then allows the base system to stay in super low power mode. It could be easily driven by a gpu or other chips.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith microled coming out it should give the ability to massively boost existing computer power. And give the nature of optical it can be processed in a million way to utilize the throughput. Including specialized output from the optical. You can easily separate and drop down the data to send back to another component or similar. And various things with a driver being able to switch bitdepth/color or other things could be used to control data on top of physical paths for light. It should allow increasing attributes to be used in order to process information on top of any actual traditional gate logic being built. Part of one idea would be to use bit depth along different color lengths. This could change the speed of the wavelength to either change the timing to swap datas arrival time or to do similar to make it fold in data like a deck of cards potentially in many many ways. Optical should hypothetically bring in an era of basically unlimited software and hardware combinations and functionality. The limit will be actually thinking them all up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMicro led driving at 500ns would be 1 petabyte of througput. 1ns would get you half of an exobyte of througput. This at 32 bit. It seems like we are already at the point this is better than pure electronic. I\u0027m assuming it a matter of effort to design sufficient means to utilise and control it. Which we should have. I randomly think of enough things separately. If enough are made up you could combine things to control data however you want. There wouldn\u0027t be a lot of things needed to be developed to do this. Could a mirror with a synced microled light be used to manipulate the data at a node? Or does light not combine in that. Are there any ways reflections and angling can get it to effect the output? If it can be done even in the smallest way you can use it to manipulate data. IE, you have a 32bit or other reduced stream(or increased) and then have it reflect at a node with different light to effect the data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could paralleling and shift the data into colors(frequencies)/depth or whatever else and use this to recombine to process higher bit depth information. It can be increase or decreased to any size and utilized as many times as needed. If you can add a synced(or purposely unsynced) reprogrammable light at each node you can hypothetical process anything. You are basically folding and shifting data into itself in a way that get the results. This can be done to the point it acts like gates or in different manners with more predictive simple software with the data preconfigured sufficiently. All can be used at once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey were looking at this back in 1989. This has to be more feasible now. If not it should close. It has to be at least useful for enhacing existing suptercomputers or networks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, to deal with output data and size of software you could easily use logic to compress data with logic similar to encryption. with the speed of optical computers you could unpackage or package large streams of data into small packets and live unpackage on either end or store. Let alone if you aren\u0027t worried about live data and have time to allow it to run longer to increase the data size or run the software in chunks. You could literally waiste nanoseconds of throughput to sequence the software in a way it could be controlled with light frequencies and have it run in many layers in order to get it to run and control the data output. I wonder if this would help with physics. If you don\u0027t need the calculation every second you could layer like you do with OS and other computer layers and simply have it arrive on time. Frequencies or color shifts could be time with hardware that can make it change layers or arrive between layers and be used in different ways by read sensors or other utilizations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m assuming the current issues are either cost or security. I don\u0027t think raw ability to process is the limit atm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne easier method of getting data to components is to shrink down the color bit depth going to a smaller component. This can be done in many ways. Including ignoring other data and having data in the needed spot and treating a higher stream as a lower one. You might even be ableit o have variable data. And anything within x-y depth on the higher bit stream would still be treated as x in a lower bit. This could also be done in many way. An alternative is to actually separate the data into a smaller stream and send it to the component. Optical should open up computers to basically infinite combinations. Unless you build one that does all of it. Then you just need software to choose what to do. I\u0027m pretty sure all methods can be combined to boot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can also use things like heat and calibration methods to help or add new ways to control the data flow. And any bad processing can be used. You don\u0027t need accuracy as you could use a subsystem or other things to shift and make it automatically do what it should at any given node. Or you can purposely do this to process in various ways. This in itself could be a massively power way to do this to do similar to gates or other higher bit depth changes. Another is to do complex geometric processing. If you know what it should be and shift it you can do real live geometry. Say you have a cube design with read sensors representing real positions. It could even use ambient light(assuming you can predict and control the proper outcome.) and then shift to the correct data for a circle. The hardware could be put in actual geometric positions to get real data. And increasingly complex patterns could be layed over each other. the shifting could also allow improper positions so you can get read/write heads that should share a space both working. This could also allow other shapes that are inaccurate to be used to layer processing more efficiently potentially. Assuming you even need to do that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt minimum to make such a reflector you could use the equivalent of a triple diode with two inputs. Or some way to get lossless read head and redo the image with a new microled. Basically what they do with electric signals. redistribute it. Not sure if that is useful though. Could you combine frequencies if accurate enough and layer them and use that. If a read head can deal with the logic at the end or you know what the logic should be it might not matter. In fact having both would give more ways to process information. combined and non combined light could add more data per moment to utilize making even more throughput. which can then be used or sacrificed during use. Parallelizing things gives infinite ways to separate and combine data. And bit depth can be near infinitely increased or decreased and used or sacrificed for the sake of various tasks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYea, I now this is a bus. This would be processing on a bus! Anything else can be added into it giving far more processing overall and in much more complex/robust combinations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if quantum ever comes out and can send data faster across space with no physical connection this could expand it more. Assuming it sends data faster. There was that method where they are supposed to sink up over a distance live. Assuming that has no lag. that could lead to ways to process geometry and other things that is impossible now. Maybe literally do what are currently impossible calculations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe this concept could be used:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/26qYrSNYJXM?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe simplest application would be filtration methods. This could be combined with various recombination methods. This could do something like parelelize then use the led method to modify on single sections of data and then recombine with programmability. You could also try to make the filters programmable. That could also take the place of using synced up microled with reflectors. Assuming that even works. Which if you can recombine light it would have too in essence. Although if a read head method could be used it could be combined if it doesn\u0027t sacrifice anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould this game get full physics with such throughput?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt could also get rid of the need for expensive video cards. Unless you want one to drive the microled programmable nodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could also use the color depth in a single color or across colors. This could be used to different effects as the data might arrive a split second later. This could then read and sequence and retransmit. Assuming that saves time and the subsystem is fast enough or another method used. You could also scale color depth into a single color or spectrum to change various aspects of the data. This could pair with distance for static arrays or whatever other trick could be applied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlot could be done with data structures in the bit. and it could be adjust in many ways to control or change data.

Why avoid it when you can use a subsystem to help utilize it(or really good alignment.). You could take expected results and modify it to whatever you want. Unless I\u0027m missing something(which is easy). I was assuming you could employ asymmetric means to get data or processing you couldn\u0027t otherwise. Optical may lead to an increased means of processing information if you don\u0027t restrict yourself to just the normal logic we use in electronic and treat optical as a new beast. Why stick with simple point to point processing when optical allows more?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m assuming radically new things can be done at this point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure what signal to noise ratio is for light.

If you can get more bandwidth then yes that would be fantastic. Optical hypothetically could do this by the driver being more powerful or by splitting the data or other things. Or I\u0027m assuming. I\u0027m assuming also that this for initial users might be worth the extra cost. Particularly if you could increase current servers or supercomputers massively. Unless it would already be cheap enough for home computers. I would kind of hope the diverse means I mentioned to process would allow cheaper means to get home versions earlier as the increased adaptability of optical may allow earlier cheaper methods with sufficient overlap in design. Plus a wider more interesting means of new adoption on all sides. If you can just switch out nodes for instance it\u0027s a lot better than buying whole new boards. So, it may come with new versatility in upgrading. Or even changing out the hardware per software run if you want in the extreme if desired. Especially when you hit limits in various direction like frequency and space of the optical device to get certain results. Although more means should exist to make alternative too because of all of this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd since were assuming 32bit at a varied nanosecond response time you are getting more than 32 bit from a normal computer. Although that could allow it to be used on older computers. The same with smaller bit ranges. With sufficient design changes and parallelizing or other methods this could be applied to much older computers for fun. the same end results could even be achieved for the most part depending on where and how you offload the processing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bit depth would only matter if you are doing a very direct simulation of a current computer somehow with optical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, fun note: Board designs could change also. You wouldn\u0027t need static boards. You coudl change multiple aspects of boards and use them all in varied intermixed ways. You could have solid board with permanent parts, solid boards with adjustable replacable parts. You could have partial boards that stick together and are stiffened to allow interconnecting for various reasons like physical distance for optical or similar for electronics. You could have flat boards or even use the interconnects to make them bend on purpose into shapes. You could then also have variations like lego blocks of various sizes and shapes making 3d patterns etc. Both 3d boards and 2d boards could be used to make 3d processing shapes as you could use nodes with different height optics or have the board have the light paths to varied effects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd as you develop node technology you can take every single tiny quality and use it to process. You don\u0027t have to be stuck to one thing at a time. Unless you have to be. If you are stuck to one at a time you can inter switch them with software if it\u0027s useful for different applications at the different times or split them do to at the same time. Depends on how much redundancy you want per node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd optical can utilize space more than electronic potentially as you can use accuracy and distance to compute potentially. If you can swap the data between colors/frequencies while retaining the data you can easily use space for both accurate methods or inaccurate methods to deal with physical space constraints/computes or other issues.. Many other issues as it can be used for compute itself. Basically everything an be used to compute. No matter how stupid or how small or insignificant. And the more it\u0027s combined with the more useful any one thing can become. The combination of the potential of accurate and inaccurate data can also have wide applications. Very wide applications! 8d The difficulty should be figuring out all the methods of compute and then utilizing them. One of those is using calibration for cheaper parts to get starter boards for home use. IE cost!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could also start to radically start incorporating other means like audio processing or anything else every conceived. It doesn\u0027t have to keep up to be useful. There could be uses. So, we could get back to far more than just optical and electronic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-08-28T17:59:16Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2020 05:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-28T17:13:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223845585\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022196564\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221598631554\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002210883\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nuke\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n53 minutes ago, Nuke said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n64 bit is about a lot more than a fatter address bus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, but 32bit works just fine in most other aspects.

You could literally throw a rock in your computer. You hit it with light and other things. You read and calibrate from many angles. You use that to run various things through to get end results with reads. This could be used for many thing. One being fun things like DnD. Specialized toys for table top. although that would be one of a million applications. Rocks, btw, are heavily laden with materials. So, instead of having a specialized device you can pick something up from your yard and check it for usefulness(easy when attached with some electronic subsystems or other sufficiently advaned optic or other computer methods). Different rocks different materials and results. It could literally be a switch for endless applications. Especially if you are using more than just light. Sound/vibration, temperature and many other things could be used. It\u0027s just a matter of what needs to be done to get to sync with the optics level. which can be done with many different read/write nodes to the rock. You could paralelize them to sync sufficient data. Or with multiple rock to fill in the blanks depending on use. There are endless ways to do this. Optics is the return of a lot of potential compute methods as it\u0027s very physical in nature. Ironically as it\u0027s presumed not to be physical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-08-29T09:53:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2020 09:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
