However, as a result of their low power tests in vacuum, they have largely come to the conclusion that while such effects might be responsible for a little bit of the thrust in the more powerful tests (done by Shawyer, the Chinese team, and the Cannae teams), in general some effect that we don\u0027t currently have a good way to explain IS occurring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo they have two split efforts going on in the path forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first effort is to continue working on the low power rig to achieve \u0026gt;100 microNewtons of force on a semi consistent basis (think 4/5 attempts) so that they can pass it over to the Glenn Research Center for them to independently verify the thrust. Glenn has less of an ability to detect the forces involved and it was judged that it wasn\u0027t worth upgrading their facility for this purpose especially since the test thruster SHOULD be able to to output at the required levels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second effort is to produce a thruster that accepts an input power more in line with the other teams. Instead of 30-60 watts, they are looking at a max output of just over 1.2 kilowatts. What exactly happens if they DO achieve similar results is something of a matter of speculation. I believe the ETA for completion of this is sometime in the middle of the year, but I\u0027m not 100%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoctor White has a lot of \u0027unconventional\u0027 theories attempting to explain how the thruster works. If his theories turn out to be true, then things are pretty great as far as space engine techs are concerned as well as a few other interesting possibilities. I am not a physicist so my understanding of the theory and its implications could be flawed. But keeping that in mind, the TLDR is basically: All energy pokes at the local quantum vacuum plasma (think spacetime but not). Matter is a lot of condensed energy that pokes at the QV plasma \u0027hard\u0027. The effects of this \u0027poke\u0027 on the QV plasma manifest themselves as gravity. Something about what the Q-thruster/EMdrive/Cannae Drive is doing is poking at the QV plasma \u0027more efficiently\u0027 than its energy levels would normally be capable of in another form.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs part of attempting to provide experimental evidence for this theory, Dr White replaced the charged capacitor ring from the micro warp field interferometer with a Q-thruster and took a bunch of measurements recording what they believe to be a signature that verifies that somehow the Q-thruster is warping space within itself. Not by a whole lot, but in line with his theory. Tests concerning the interferometer are considered a separate but related field of experimentation to ongoing activities with the thruster.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"crazyewok","CreatedById":97592,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T16:06:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Crook\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Crook\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s interesting, thanks.
