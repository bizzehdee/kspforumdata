When it gets close to the countdown time it comes out of warp, sees that it\u0027s a little early, goes into 2x physics warp but then never comes out of it. Needless to say even 2x physics warp can be pretty fatal with large launchers in the first moments of ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso posted on github.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-11T00:10:18Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2015 12:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by futrtrubl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T01:57:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt seems to be ignoring the \u0027use RCS for rotation\u0027 toggle during the landing guidance, and the \u0027use RCS for small maneuvers\u0027, like they\u0027re both on by default.

No matter what, every lander acts the same. Set for target and let it rip. MJ orients properly, sometimes does a plane adjustment, warps to de-orbit burn point, comes out of warp, makes a minor correction and starts its descent. Up until it comes out of warp to make a correction, it is smack dab on target (within a few meters). But once out of warp it makes some type of adjustment and then start landing. At this point (post-warp, post-adjustment), MJ puts the lander down some 15-50km away from the target. Really strange. I\u0027ve seen this behavior once in a while but it usually appeared to be something related to a very high crater wall that to me looked like it was interfering with proper readings. That was fine and understandable. This, however, has just really been weird. No idea when it started since up until now, most of my landings had been single craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BARCLONE","CreatedById":76024,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T16:34:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESarbian,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust installed #428.
