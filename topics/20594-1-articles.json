I added a few fuel tanks to my \u0022Rover X\u0022 rocket, which has proven quite capable of putting a mini-rover on both moons of Kerbin, and swapped out the upper stage engine for a NERVA. (And then, after a little more testing, stuck lander engines on the extra tanks for a little more kick before firing up the NERVA for transfer.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first hint of trouble was when I realized my phase angle was all wrong for transfer to Duna. Like, almost 100 degrees wrong. Well, I\u0027m already in orbit, so there\u0027s nothing to do but turn up time acceleration as far as possible and wait... and wait... until my launch window finally opened. And then wait a little more, for my optimum ejection angle. But after something like 5-10 real-time minutes, I was finally on my way!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanets, it turns out, are surprisingly small and hard to hit from a distance. My overhead plot showed my first attempt was going to be an overshoot, so I dialed it back until I got a nice \u0022capture\u0022 icon. Well, not \u0022capture\u0022 precisely, as I knew from munar landings that I\u0027d have to brake into orbit. And then I actually got out there, with Duna and Ike catching up from astern, and discovered that I was \u0022low\u0022. Really should have zoomed in and checked that predicted path earlier. But okay, we\u0027re here now, let\u0027s see what I can do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually managed to brake into a highly-inclined, nearly-closed hyperbola around Duna before I ran out of fuel. Well, damn. Almost. But wait! I\u0027ve got a pair of propane tanks and small thrusters on the rover itself. Let\u0027s fire those up... okay, ditch the heavy, useless NERVA and empty tanks, \u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E fire those up, and see if we can at least close the orbit. Okay! Can we circularize it? Yes! So now I\u0027ve got a rover whipping around Duna at about 30km up, and am wondering if I can actually land this thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[i\u0027ll post some pictures here later, when I get home.]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost. I almost did it. Maybe if I wasn\u0027t coming in so fast and shallow, or if I\u0027d kept holding down the button after killing my horizontal velocity, or started the braking burn just a few seconds earlier; I honestly believe it was as close as that. Or if I had remembered I had a quicksave before I despondently closed down the program. But I didn\u0027t, and I didn\u0027t, and so that rover slammed into the rust-red crater at somewhere between 40 and 20 meters per second. BAM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe next time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John Bedlam","CreatedById":36337,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-27T17:16:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDuna has an atmosphere just barely thick enough for aerobreaking, you could have spent a lot less fuel on slowing down if you\u0027d gotten your periapse to about 12 kilometers high.

Aerobraking through the atmosphere will capture you into an elliptical orbit. From there, just a a little bit of fuel will let you raise peridun up out of the atmosphere if you wish to remain in orbit, or you can pick a landing point and set right down immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-27T17:24:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry parachutes. they work wonders. also, did you deploy your gear? on kerbin i had to abort a rover and it came down to the ground at 42 m/s (gear down) and survived.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Zoom","CreatedById":8333,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-27T17:39:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, the problem (the main one, at least) with my transfer orbit is that I eyeballed it from the system-scale map and didn\u0027t zoom in to check the details until I was too close and (almost) too late. I had to use all the fuel I had left in my NERVA stage just to convert my wide-and-low flyby into a closer pass. Once I switched over to the rover for final orbit and/or landing, I had \u0022enough\u0022 fuel; I just left it a little too late to do my final burn, and couldn\u0027t kill all of my velocity with the time, altitude, and thrust I (didn\u0027t) have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Yeah, I saw the chutes on Pathfinder and was planning to \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Esteal\u003C/span\u003E copy that idea. Didn\u0027t make it into this revision. And no, I didn\u0027t drop my gear; probably should have.
