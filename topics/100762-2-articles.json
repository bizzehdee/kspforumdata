I\u0027ve been a little busy lately, with taking over maintenance of CLS and creating Wikis for both Ship Manifest ans CLS. Also, Ship Manifest has been taking priority the last several days, with a few bugs to squash and a recent request for an interface to gain access to the Crew Transfer process by a part developer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have some working code, but nothing to publish yet. I just finished the basic requirements, and am now starting to code the bones...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T07:34:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 07:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Papa_Joe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Maars","CreatedById":125934,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T14:39:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAppreciate the time you took to reply!
