I knew I should have put some solar panels on it, but space was limited and I wanted to try out the new fuel cell that R\u0026amp;D had recently cooked up. Last time I trust those guys!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe launch went off without a hitch, as did the long flight over to Kerbin\u0027s furthest moon. After taking an orbital temperature reading, I even stuck the landing on my second attempt, not bad for an amateur with only 4 Mun landings under the belt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i67.tinypic.com/2ir6hqr.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u00222ir6hqr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI took my surface temperature reading and after only being planted on this new moon for a mere few moments, it was time to blast off and head home, though I\u0027m not sure if you can call the Dawn\u0027s liftoff much of a \u0022blast\u0022, more\u00A0a zephyr.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt took every bit of thrust that little engine had, but eventually we escaped the Minmus gravity well, and we were on our way home!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i63.tinypic.com/ztz11v.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022ztz11v.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is where the problems started. I noticed a little later than I should have that\u00A0the miniaturized \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E tank my fuel cells were running off was very quickly drying up. So, knowing that I would not have enough fuel to perform a normal deorbit procedure,\u00A0I did what any sane Kerbal would do\u00A0and put myself onto a trajectory that would just barely skim the top of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, to begin an extremely drawn out degrading orbit from a ~4,000,000 km Apoap down to a 68,000 km Periap\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i68.tinypic.com/30ihq1i.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u002230ihq1i.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith roughly 0.1% of the fuel load remaining in my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E tank, I had done almost all that I could. With the last remaining dot of current from my probes battery, I deployed my landing struts and armed the chute, crossed my fingers and bit my nails. I no longer had any control and the rest would be up to fate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i66.tinypic.com/vrd26p.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022vrd26p.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i66.tinypic.com/25q98xc.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u002225q98xc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i63.tinypic.com/iyogeu.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022iyogeu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith each orbit bringing me a fraction closer to home, after streaking across the skies of Kerbin almost 15\u00A0times over the course of 2 days, my little probe warming up more and more with each slightly lowered pass, my Apoap finally found it\u0027s way below Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and begun the final, nail-biting, totally uncontrolled descent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i66.tinypic.com/x29e0i.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022x29e0i.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was very nervous having had no choice but to arm my chute days earlier,\u00A0far above the reaches of the atmosphere. And\u00A0with a contract worth over 400,000 Funds\u00A0riding on this probe and it\u0027s two thermometers arriving home\u00A0safe and intact, stakes had never been higher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt turns out maybe those R\u0026amp;D guys aren\u0027t so bad after all, because the chute they had provided\u00A0worked exactly as described, waiting until the last possible moment and giving just enough time to slow down enough that it wouldn\u0027t rip itself to shreds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i63.tinypic.com/ea2hqu.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022ea2hqu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so ended the saga of a re-entry from orbit with no control over the probe other than what had been planned 2 days prior on the last remaining spark of the probe\u0027s battery.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i63.tinypic.com/214aut3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022214aut3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn closer inspection by the recovery vehicle, it was found that the landing struts had melted off during the final re-entry, but no other damage was found. The thermometers were recovered and the KSP boffins were paid their due and promptly spent it on a new Mission Control building and a rather large party.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR: I\u0027m hella proud that this actually worked and the thing didn\u0027t just burn to a pile of ash.

I didn\u0027t know about thrusting forward with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, so I did \u003Ci\u003Eeverything \u003C/i\u003Ein space using a reliant so my launch vehicle was\u00A0so heavy that it would probably make the top 100 most kerbal spacecraft ever. And to top it all off the only demo probe core is a stripped down stayputnik so I did the entire thing with no \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E. If your wondering why muna 27\u00A0was the first landing and not muna one, it was because the demo does not allow quick saving or\u00A0reverting. So any way, muna 27 was my first mun landing ever. But in its extended mission, Muna 27 ReTurn, which was to test if engines could be used as heat shields, (I had yet to send a kerbal to space) it ran out of fule with a apo that still intersected the muns orbit and a peri of 65 thousand. I was able to preserve one solar panel for the first few passes, then I lost it with 5 orbits to go. So the only thing left to do disable the reaction wheels and hope my battery\u0027s would hold out. (I did not know how to arm a chute) in the final grueling reentrey, I lost all but two of my 8 batterys. On\u00A0the last 0.03 electric charge, I deployed my chutes with risky status and bolth deployed successfully.
