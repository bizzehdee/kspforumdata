So, one of my hobbies in addition to KSP is the creation of a fantasy world, and I was recently inspired to make my world a moon of a gas giant instead of its own planet. However, after reading \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/96599-if-laythe-was-real/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethis thread\u003C/a\u003E I realized that I might have daily 50 foot tidal waves if I do that. So my question is, can I position my moon in such a way that it avoids this? I had planned to have five other large moons in the sky, with this world being the fourth of the six, but I\u0027m open to changing that. Would placing it farther out lessen the tidal effects of the other moons? Would placing it closer to the gas giant\u0027s gravity well have the same effect? I am planning to have this world tidally locked, by the way, so I believe that should eliminate tidal waves caused by the planet itself, even if it makes for some weird oceans. Any help on this would be appreciated, so thank you in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-27T08:31:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://astronomyonline.org/Science/TidalForces.asp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://astronomyonline.org/Science/TidalForces.asp\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI assume you want to keep it simple and not take into account for the influence of different bodies. Looking at the formula, just keep the distances large. You can\u0027t do much about the masses and radii since density is a feature of the the material which is rock (2.5 to 3.5 g/cm\u00B3) or iron (around 8g/cm\u00B3) or a combination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t use KSP as a guideline.
