Does anyone have any idea why this is? Does spaceport have issues I\u0027m not aware of? It drives me crazy having to run around to ten different places and crawl through 50-page form threads to grab the mods I want after every update.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hoojiwana","CreatedById":57079,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T20:47:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESpaceport is terrible for showcasing your mods, terrible for finding new mods, is filled with terrible craft files, has a habit of corrupting uploads, has a habit of breaking connection on larger downloads, has dodgy legal terms, and is a buggy mess for uploading and updating.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T20:52:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022hoojiwana\u0022 data-cite=\u0022hoojiwana\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESpaceport is terrible for showcasing your mods, terrible for finding new mods, is filled with terrible craft files, has a habit of corrupting uploads, has a habit of breaking connection on larger downloads, has dodgy legal terms, and is a buggy mess for uploading and updating.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why I don\u0027t host my mod on Spaceport.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T21:19:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDamn ye Hoojiwana, there\u0027s nothing left for anybody else to say!
