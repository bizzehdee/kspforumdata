I hate it with every cell of my being because it always clutters up my workspaces with duplicates of the same craft! This is opposite to KSP 1, because it doesn\u2019t Autosave at all! It requires you to save every time while in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. It\u2019s easier to use, but you must keep manually saving all the time!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;\u0022\u003EMy idea:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy idea is to have the best of both worlds! Instead of having to keep manually saving or cluttering your workspaces, why not have a system that first needs you to manually save once, and then automatically Autosave in that same workspace, forever? Efficient, but less tedious!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;\u0022\u003EBenefits:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis system allows players to design huge crafts without worrying about the clutter (It may not be a problem for other players, but it is for me!), all while still saving the craft without becoming tedious. Plus, players can launch crafts the don\u2019t want to save, like little experiments or those \u201CFlea\u201D rockets at the start of KSP 1 Career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope you like this!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTechieV\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Filed.Teeth","CreatedById":178610,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-28T06:59:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAutosaves as they are are annoying.
