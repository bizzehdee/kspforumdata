You can add, remove, and edit the nodes of a part to see how things will fit together, then output your new values to cut-and-paste into the real CFG file. Reload KSP and see your new part nodes in action! This is also very useful for fixing old parts that don\u0027t have their node connection directions set correctly. One click of a button and your old parts will connect again!\n\n![zJrzFQL.png](http://i.imgur.com/zJrzFQL.png)\n\n[Download](https://github.com/Felbourn/NodeHelper/releases/download/1.4.0.0/NH.1.4.0.0.zip)\n\n[Source](https://github.com/Felbourn/NodeHelper)\n\n[![88x31.png](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-06T03:11:17Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2019 03:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Felbourn**\n  \nnew version"},{"CreatedByName":"Felger","CreatedById":76828,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T06:33:34Z","Content":"This tool is awesome, glad to see you\u0027ve gone and fixed it up!"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T07:25:59Z","Content":"Thanks marce and Felbourn ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T07:31:01Z","Content":"Holy wall of expletives!
