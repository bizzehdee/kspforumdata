It\u0027s a lot less efficient to put the rocket into a retrograde orbit by flying west, and you\u0027re wasting several km/s of delta v.

I kind of have difficulty imagining how Squad would do subassembly in a way that\u0027s radically different to how mods do it. But I suppose at the minimum file structures and that sort of thing will be different so I\u0027ll do a new guide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESubassembly aside, I did consider updating these rockets. The main update I\u0027m thinking is to get rid of all the RCS systems on the boosters and replace them with reaction wheels for control and a pair of R24-77 pointed retrograde as deorbit engines. In fact I\u0027ve already got a Nova with this new setup. The lift performance is a tiny bit better but most of the benefit is in the fact that it uses something like 30 less parts. I\u0027m still wondering if that\u0027s a worthwhile change though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone actually ever use the RCS systems on these boosters for translation? Now that we can steer with reaction wheel we don\u0027t need steering authority from RCS any more. And with a pair of R24-77 for deorbit you can translate retrograde fine too. So really the only thing that\u0027ll be missing from the new build is the ability to translate forwards and sideways. But the only use I can think of for that is if you\u0027re actually attempting to dock a payload to something with the booster still attached.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
