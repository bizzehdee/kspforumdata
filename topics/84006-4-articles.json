Love this mod! Gundam 00 is probably my favorite in the franchise so combining that with KSP is pure awesome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been running across a bug however. Whenever I turn off the throttle my GN particle supply goes to zero. This has only been happening with the Condensor and Tau engines. Has this been happening to anyone else?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goro san","CreatedById":142387,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T14:02:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny news on 1,0 compatibility?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jivaii","CreatedById":75048,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T03:20:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Goro san\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Goro san\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAny news on 1,0 compatibility?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s been updated and is working just fine from what I\u0027ve seen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shantaboy","CreatedById":136313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T03:23:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThink it would be possible to make it generate a GN Field for atmospheric reentry, since that is now standard in KSP, because I remember that epic scene from episode 2 where all the HRL guys are freaking out seeing them dive into the atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DestinyPlayer","CreatedById":143980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T06:21:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs the maximum amount of GN drives going to be configurable?
