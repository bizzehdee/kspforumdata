That\u0027s kind of like saying when you listen to music in a foreign language, the words are irrelevant if you don\u0027t speak that language. I think that art can be a highly error-prone method of communicating, and the message intended by the artist could be highly relevant, not at all relevant or even nonsense. The meaning of the words sung in that foreign tongue might seem irrelevant to your enjoyment of the song at the time, but it is entirely possible that years later you learn to speak that language and find out that the words in one of those songs had a life-changing meaning that would have drastically altered your appreciation of the song, if only you had been able to accurately receive the message that was being sent.\n\nAliens could drop off a greeting card in the form of a painting. The message could be anything from \u0022Guess what?

In pretty much none of the works out there that is the case. Works carry an arrangement of messages, which are not only intentionally or accidentally added to the work by the maker, but also spring from the background, frame of reference and experience of the viewer. RainDreamer was mostly much spot on. The meaning of art is in the eye of the beholder, yet claiming it simply is what it is is equally true.\n\nFor exactly this reason, guessing at the meaning of the work in the OP is a somewhat futile exercise. Everyone is right and everyone is wrong.
