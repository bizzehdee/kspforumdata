If I knew what your life was like, I would be willing to hazard a guess as to the nature of this drawing, but right now I lack the proper context to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EI\u0027m quite proud of that metaphor, by the way, even though I \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Ereally\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E shouldn\u0027t be...

As someone who (obviously) isn\u0027t an artist, I\u0027ve often wondered how many others would be able to receive the message I was sending. 1%? 10%? 50%? Certainly with more skill in drawing and art in general the number would have been higher than it is.
