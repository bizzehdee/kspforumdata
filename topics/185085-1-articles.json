Turns out the trick is to get a forward \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, which I did by clipping two full ore tanks into the cockpit. The monopropellant tank at the rear of the orbiter is empty, it\u0027s just there as a lightweight structural piece \u003Cs\u003Eand because it looks cool\u003C/s\u003E. The shuttle, which I named Echo V, just about manages to launch 4 Kerbals and a full Rockomax Jumbo-64 tank (formerly the orange tank, but there are multiple orange tanks now...) into a 100 km orbit. To make for more interesting viewing, I decided to test it by launching all components for a space station into a 125 km orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could upload the craft file if anyone\u0027s interested, but I imagine there are plenty of better shuttles out there. I\u0027m mainly just happy that my many attempts over the past few years have finally paid off. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/RUnjILH7wzk?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-03T19:45:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice classical shuttle build.\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003EFun to watch and great achievement.
