The cause of these delays is a gate lockout due to a malfunction in the state of the art \u201CCassandra\u201D satellite network designed to monitor Seyllin\u2019s solar output and stability, which occurred shortly after 0840. The monitoring facility on Seyllin I initially attributed the cause of the error to a \u201Ccommunications glitch\u201D and state that service will be resumed shortly. In fact, backup copies of telemetry from the network revealed that a significant energy blast had been detected halfway between Seyllin I and the Type-O blue giant it orbits, spiking to impossibly high levels in all fields, including subspace, gravimetric and electromagnetic. According to the data, Cassandra\u2019s last recorded transmission was that the star\u2019s entire magnetic field had realigned towards the explosion. We now know that the Cassandra probes were destroyed by the vast waves of charged particles and EM radiation released from the star. The fact that Cassandra was able to roughly triangulate the location of the energy blast before being destroyed has been the greatest help of all during this investigation, as without Cassandra\u2019s telemetry, it would have proven impossible to determine the cause of the main sequence anomalies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBased on this, it seems that some sort of CME occured.

Scope Chief Editor Lars Kiormen releases an emergency bulletin to the public, warning of an impending plasma wave en route to Seyllin I, that will completely annihilate the planet. The bulletin itself stated that this would happen within the next hour, and concluded with a heartfelt goodbye to the Scope employees still trapped on the planet, this was then followed by a Scope commentary questioning the legality of the Federal detainment of their employees. The bulletin was almost immediately decried by CONCORD, who denied the existence of any countdowns, but they were too late to prevent the outbreak of mass panic on Seyllin I, as riots and stampedes broke out as soon as the story broke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat... was not wise.

The wave is big enough to engulf the ENTIRE PLANET and destroy it. Rest in peace, 500 million people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNews after this point is no longer time-stamped, so I shall simply have to do the best I can with the records. It appears that shortly after this point, a prison outbreak occurred, which forced the Navy to re-task valuable dropships to prevent a mass-breakout of high-security convicts. Panicked citizens were outraged at this news, sparking a fresh wave of riots. Crowd control methods are failing by this point, and armed troops have been posted at most dropship gangways to prevent terrified civilians from overfilling the ships. News is also received from the Intaki Syndicate, of yet another main sequence anomaly nearly destroying a station. At this point, the University of Caille, realising that the plasma wave\u2019s cover was blown, decided to issue a direct appeal via the newsfeeds for anyone in the position to send them useful data to do so. This decision, whilst opposed by the Federal government and by CONCORD, has proven invaluable since, especially the CreoDron magnetic field data, which was vital to developing a working explanation of what happened at Seyllin. This was further reinforced by Sanmatar Shakor\u2019s announcement that the Thukker Caravan which was reported missing earlier had been completely destroyed by another similar main sequence event, bringing the total up to four recorded events. The disaster came to a head shortly afterwards, with the navy pulling out shortly before the final destruction of Seyllin I by the massive plasma wave, which occurred at midday. The initial reports indicated no survivors, backed up by the complete lack of any fluid router contact with the planet. This was later corroborated when, before the CONCORD/Federation Navy blockade was lifted, a Serpentis vessel that had been stranded inside the system during the final evacuation reported from the former location of Seyllin I that the planet was completely destroyed, before contact was permanently lost. It has since been assumed that the unfortunate vessel was caught up in the debris field that was present shortly before the remains of Seyllin I coalesced back into planetoid shape. It was also at this point that the Sisters of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E issued their now infamous prediction that a series of topological defects would shortly begin to manifest themselves throughout the cluster, successfully predicting the first natural wormhole formations since the collapse of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, apparently stuff just went downhill after the announcement. Dropships were re-directed away from the disaster to the prison riot, meaning that less people could be evacuated in the end. Armed troops have to prevent overfilling of the dropships. The University of Caille asked anyone that could give them information about the disaster to send it to the university.\u00A0 Everybody pulled\u00A0 their ships out shortly before the noon destruction of Seyllin 1. The CreoDron (drone manufacturing company) data ended up being quite valuable to finding out what happened. A Serpentis Corporation vessel reported that Seyllin 1 had been destroyed (the wreckage was likely crushed as Seyllin 1 reformed into a planetoid).
