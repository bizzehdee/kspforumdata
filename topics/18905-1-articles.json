After 12 testing casualties and a few minutes of research on Wikipedia KASA (Kerbal Aeronautics and Space Administration) unveiled the first colony. The Athena can house a total of 53 Kerbals, 40 housing units are equipped with centrifugal gravity, has eight fuel engines and an ion engine powered by the solar panels that usually power life-support and plumbing, and the entire station has a focus on induced gravity research. It currently has 27 inhabitants and orbits at 2000 KM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe front of Athena:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/b5YgX\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/b5YgX\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe captain on a routine EVA:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/i258p\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/i258p\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERequires Damned Robotics, MechJeb, Orbital Construction, and Deep Space Mission Pack.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-09T08:16:04Z\u0022 title=\u002209/09/2012 08:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 9, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by undragonslayer7\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apothecarian","CreatedById":47761,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-09T22:40:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis looks awesome.
