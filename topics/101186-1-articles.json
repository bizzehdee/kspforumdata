I\u0027ve been doing this for a few weeks now and I have 10 or so solid designs that I want to display right next to the runway as I take off, for prettiness sake.

A plane graveyard or a decomissioned model museum or something along those lines?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cirocco","CreatedById":100285,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T23:22:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENah, my old design don\u0027t get placed next to the runway, they smash into a celestial body of choice at several km/s. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Othuyeg","CreatedById":105454,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T23:25:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suggest downloading Kerbinside and using one of the fancy bases for this.
