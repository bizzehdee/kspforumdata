Basically, without the KSP forums I never would have taken the plunge to actually start learning this stuff, everyone here has provided me with extremely useful info on KSP and where to start with adding my own parts to the game. So first off, thanks for being the most awesome community I\u0027ve ever encountered on the net. But what I need to know, is where can I go for a similar community focused on learning blender? I recently discovered Blender Artists however the forum seems to be infrequently used, and to be honest I\u0027m not sure people have the time to answer the questions that are stopping me in my tracks since most people on there are far from absolute beginners. Does anyone know of a community that are regularly active?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should clarify the particular issue I\u0027m having is unrelated to anything I\u0027m making for KSP so I didn\u0027t think it would be right to actually directly ask for the solution to my problem here, instead I felt it would be more appropriate to ask for some pointers on good communities to join whilst I continue to learn the tools. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, on the off chance that anyone does know the answer I will leave a small description of my issue here, but specifically I\u0027m looking for a better place to take my blender related issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am using a large cube as an activator to pass over an object which I\u0027m using cell fracture on, The action of the box is perfect prior to simulation, and I have the game logic wired up for the action to behave correctly during simulation. However despite all this when simulated the box begins animating correctly and then skips to the final scene of it\u0027s animation in a single frame upon contact with the object using cell fracture, whereas it should pass evenly through it activating parts one by one. I have the shards from cell fracture set to a collision sensor and detecting specifically the material of the activator. The activator itself is set to rigid body, with actor and ghost enabled, with the collision bounds set to box. Both the objects are in separate layers. I have tried dropping the physics substeps but to no avail so it doesn\u0027t seem to be a performance related problem. Just in case there is anyone around who knows the solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
