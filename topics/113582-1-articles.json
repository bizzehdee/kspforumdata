Even when there is nothing in the way and the distance is just a couple of meters apart.\n\nis there a tutorial on youtube or any other tutorial as to how to connect struts in space?\n\nChris"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T09:09:07Z","Content":"Which attachment point are you using, the round one with the handle or the rectangular one with the triangular bit sticking up? The round one is used to connect pipes, and only works when the two attachment points are facing approximately towards each other."},{"CreatedByName":"Bogeyman","CreatedById":136919,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T09:21:25Z","Content":"The triangle one. I know that the round ones are for pipes for liquids. That works. But I have problems with the triangle ones for fix struts (forgot the name of it)"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T17:05:33Z","Content":"Ah, yes. There are some limits to the angles, as you found out. I tend to restrict them to less than 45\\* off of straight."},{"CreatedByName":"HvP","CreatedById":146104,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T18:20:45Z","Content":"You didn\u0027t mention if you were trying to connect them to different parts on the same ship or to two different ships. The KAS struts can only be attached to parts that the game identifies as the same ship.
