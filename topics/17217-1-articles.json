It\u0027s possible within the limitations of the game, so it\u0027s fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, other than using the debug thing, you can directly edit part files. In general the best things to do are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Find the FuelConsumption line and set it to 0, meaning an engine no longer uses fuel and you need only attach it to one small fuel tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Find the Thrust line and set it a very large number, meaning the engine can effectively lift millions of tons of rocket up in the air on low throttle, which is weird\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
