Awesome. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously I wanted to get it back when it was in beta stage but didn\u0027t have the money, I literally bought the game with the first paycheck I got from my new job (I\u0027m a Network Operations Center technician at a datacenter in SE Wyoming). Since then I\u0027ve been playing almost nonstop, I\u0027ll even play it at work during the after-hours standby shift. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said I\u0027ve been lurking on the forums to pick up tips on how to rocket, but I figured I should at least introduce myself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee you space cowboys!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T22:55:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forum Auriga_Nexus. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"carneyvich","CreatedById":147880,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T23:56:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewelcome!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T16:18:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERumour has it that Bill has some experience in kind a bullriding.

They need someone there 24/7 on a just-in-case basis, but as long as no one calls and none of our servers explode there\u0027s literally nothing to do once you\u0027ve patched systems and run backups, and these are 10-hour shifts.
