I did the raw model in it\u0027s expanded or opened state with the animations in their finished positions. I was able to get it into the game successfully (awesome resources ftw), but I\u0027m running into another issue. The model will load in it\u0027s opened form, then when the animation executes, it instantly reverts to it\u0027s closed state and then starts the opening animation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone know if there is a way I can fix this to where it will load into the game at the beginning of it\u0027s animation, besides redoing the model and animation?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to keep it brief, but I can provide more detail as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: The reason I modeled it in it\u0027s finished state was that it was easier for me to have a dish fold up rather than model it in it\u0027s folded state and animate it opening.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rich","CreatedById":17874,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T07:48:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry putting the following into the part \u003Cem\u003E.cfg\u003C/em\u003E, where you include your animation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E[COLOR=#333333]animSwitch = True[/COLOR]\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"schfitzen","CreatedById":66593,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T09:44:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Rich. The model was actually executing in the correct order, but I did manage to solve it after fumbling around with the import setting for longer than I care to admit. What actually solved it was changing the default take animation (not the actual animation) to start at 0 instead of -1. I\u0027m feeling pretty dumb that it ended up being such an easy fix, and sorry for a waste of a thread :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
