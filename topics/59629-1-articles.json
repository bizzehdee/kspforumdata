Handling 50-60fps on KSP would definitely be a very, very expensive, but good computer. Many people have to turn down the settings to play KSP non-laggy. This causes the graphics to be less desirable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve listed several methods on how i think it could be a literal game-changer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1. Multi-core support!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrankly speaking, KSP on multi-core computers are so laggy that some may get 1-3 fps. Currently, KSP can\u0027t do anything about it as multi-core support is decided on the unity team.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Better ocean handling\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOceans are just grids of animations stitched together. Since about 300 grids are being loaded, the enormous amount of animation definitely will cause some lag. I\u0027ve figured a plan on how to improve it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XkHmZvF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XkHmZvF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ocean tiles for beige,green and blue will be translucent. The area where the grids will be loaded will increase until 10km, then it will start to shrink until about 30km, where the ocean becomes a translucent body altogether, and all the grids unload. If the craft splashes down, the area where grids will be loaded is about 2km in radius around the craft, where beyond the point, it slowly fades to the background.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Smoke trails\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving seen several launches, i noticed that smoke trails of rocket engines do not appear until about an altitude of 10km. Where smoke trails gradually appear, until a height of 30km, where the trails gradually disappear. However, if a camera is focused on a rocket at an altitude of 5km, and is zoomed out from a distance of ~2km, the smoke trails appear as a streak in the sky, which can be done by cropping a sprite and blurring it against the background.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, solid rockets have more noticeable smoke trails, beginning from launch and disappearing from 25km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJet engines have constant smoke trails.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmoke trails do not need to be groups of smoke bubbles lumped together. They could be just a really large image altogether, stitched with the engine flames.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if you don\u0027t understand me.

Problem is, the ocean is a \u003Cem\u003Esphere\u003C/em\u003E -- you can\u0027t divide it into square grids. Doesn\u0027t work. But yeah, something of this kind already exists, AFAIK. You\u0027d have to talk to a dev to be sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Smoke trails like that... well, how does it react to the camera being rotated? Is it animated? How will it possibly cope when you have a hundred engines running? Will there be issues with how a whole lot of them overlay on each other if they\u0027re translucent? How does it react to sudden engine shutoff -- would the entire trail simultaneously disappear? The present implementation is not the best, no, but I think it works a lot better than a static or even animated image.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
