Been a lurker for a long time. I apologize if this post/rant/thoughts are in the wrong thread but I honestly don\u0027t know where to post this and figured General was good enough.\n\nFirst off, the good by my humble opinion. \n\nKSP is amazing! The idea is so cool, the game play is fun and addicting. There is a steep learning curve and depending on how technical you want it to be it can be really steep, but that is a good thing because it just means there is so much to do and going on in the game. Everyone knows this already who is in this thread so I won\u0027t bore you with a game review. Just wanted to show how much I really like and want to like KSP. I love space stuff...grew up watching the original ST and SW and every other show space related and in awe of NASA and all they did/do. To date this is the only and first real simulator for space stuff that is fun that I know of....excluding all the fantasy game stuff out there. KSP for the most part can be played realistically.....with MODS....\n\nNow the bad and what I feel like is pushing me away from playing KSP (no this isn\u0027t an anti mod rant so please bear with me)\n\nThe updates have been really cool and great! and had I never installed a MOD and been drawn into that whole realm, KSP would work for the most part flawlessly. The game by itself plays great..doesn\u0027t run out of memory and doesn\u0027t crash. But there in is the problem...it would just be another game and I would\u0027ve grown tired and bored of it soon enough. I realized early on after getting the hang of the basics and making my space station and exploring the mun and minimus that I wanted something more real and true to life. Why am I bothering to learn the DV required to leave kerbal and all these other stats and figures and math for something that is......FAKE, made up...you get the point. While if I was learning the REAL DV required to leave earth\u0027s atmosphere and the stats and figures for all the other solar system planets, I would actually be learning something REAL, tangible and pertinent to real life. The idea of learning the actual flight characteristics for the Apollo 11 mission and trying to fly it is amazing! exciting! \n\nNow that I know that is possible...I no longer want to play KSP at all because I don\u0027t want to fill my head with all this BS about kerbal stuff...the mun, minmus etc. I want to learn real information. I want a real simulator not a GAME with kerbals from some imaginary planet, solar system. Damn! I really want to learn what it takes to plan, build, fly and do a mission to mars! not minmus. \n\nIt\u0027s so frustrating to me, to think that KSP wasn\u0027t made this way in the first place. Why did they make a fake world??? did they think it would appeal to kids better? What about getting kids more interested in space and the real solar system. Big missed op here. My two cents.\n\nBut back to my problem I am ranting about this here to everyone because I just feel like I have to vent this in the hopes they make actually hear enough complaints from people and do something about it. Not holding my breath.\n\nI can\u0027t play KSP right now because it just isn\u0027t fun to me playing the fake game now. I have to play RO or RSS but they aren\u0027t working for the moment with v1. I gotta hand it to all the people helping out trying to get it working. I wish I knew coding I\u0027d pitch in because for me that is the only way to play KSP right now and I haven\u0027t played in weeks now. Withdrawls...\n\nI suppose I could go back to .90 and play but I haven\u0027t bothered to download the old mods. That brings me to the other problem I have...MODS. I could never play the game again vanilla knowing now what cool mods there are, just wish the game didn\u0027t use so much memory. I\u0022m almost resigned to just leaving KSP for about 5 years and when the next tech comes into play for computers maybe it won\u0027t be an issue to play KSP with all the mods you want. Can you imagine how beautiful and amazing and fun KSP would be if you could install all the mods you wanted??? lol\n\nOk I\u0027m rambling, I do that...why I\u0027ve been a lurker for so long. I apologize for the long post, I\u0027m not going back over to edit it. I hope I didn\u0027t offend anyone, but I\u0027m sure I did. I hope there are others, a lot of people, that feel the same way I do about having KSP reflect the real world and real science.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nTLDR I can\u0027t play KSP vanilla anymore and wish they would make KSP to reflect the real world and real science.

It\u0027s a completely different game that you would really want, and it\u0027s free! It also has a vivid modding community in case the stock craft are too sparse for you.

It\u0027s a fantastic game with just the right amount of humor and proper science. I know it\u0027s aggravating to learn the math and number for made up things, however you must keep in mind that the *principal* is not too far off. I mean, many of the people who play this game have learned complex mathematical algorithms that without, may never have even crossed their path of interest. These maths aren\u0027t exactly way off base. These are the same calculations that physicists and engineers have to do to figure these things out in real life. That being said, as many others have already said there of course are the RSS/RO mods that make this game immensely realistic, right down to the build time of your rockets chemicals needed for different types of fuel tanks.\n\nI guess the point I\u0027m trying to get at is I feel ya, but don\u0027t let the non-realism get you down. At the root of all the silly stuff lie truths in physics that can \\*somewhat\\* easily be translated to real life.

I don\u0027t want to fill my head with kerbal physics and info that is \u0022fake\u0022 I\u0027d like to be learning real info.\n\nI get it\u0027s just a game to and it will never be completely accurate...that would be too monotonous anyway. But if squad had used the real solar system..the real (or as close to) physics and the real DV and so on...would it have changed the game that much??? You could still have kerbals and all the fun cutesy stuff but really would it have changed the game?? I don\u0027t think so..if anything it would have made it more interesting to geeks like myself and still been appealing to kids and novices...but I think like stated above..applys\n\n\u003E \n\u003E realistic or sim game mechanics are not fun or that unrealistic mechanics automatically equal fun\n\n\u003E \n\u003E He has to decide. I\u0027m sure KSP was never meant as a replacement for Orbiter. If he wants the real solar system he should try out Orbiter.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So you never googled Space Simulator. Orbiter is basically the only Spaceflight Simulator so you should try that.\n\nI am embarrassed to admit that until today, I had never googled or heard of Orbiter. Seriously...lol...but I haven\u0027t played as many games as I did when I was younger...too many other things get in the way. I am downloading orbiter and will give it a go. Hard to believe it\u0027s been around a long time and I\u0027m only learning about it now.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \\*peeks out of a dark alley\\* \u0022Hey, psst, you there...

You don\u0027t need x64 for RSS. Works without it, even with 8192 textures.\n\nI wasn\u0027t aware of unity 5 upcoming to KSP or what that means....I will have to google that as well, but my gut tells me it won\u0027t be earth shattering for KSP...so many let down\u0027s with KSP and x64 to date. But that would solve a lot of problems if KSP were to work as flawless on x64 and x86. fingers crossed I don\u0027t have to wait 5 years for that to come true.\n\nRSS is a part of Realism Overhaul...I\u0027ll check out the link you gave, thanks\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-14T02:19:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2015 02:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lazy8**"},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T02:00:25Z","Content":"In my opinion as a physics teacher: it doesn\u0027t bother me at all that the *numbers* for Kerbin don\u0027t match the numbers for Earth.

I get that there is realism in the game as far as real math being learned and computed...but for me it just isn\u0027t the same. I want to try and fly the Apollo 11 mission or another historical space event (aren\u0027t they all??) but pretending that mun is the moon and that the distance, gravity, DV needed is the same as the real moon....takes away most of the fun, sense of accomplishment and game play for me. I\u0027m speaking for me only (sound like I\u0027m whining now too) The potential is there to use and learn the real values, math, astronomy, physics and really better understand and appreciate all that went into the Apollo 11 mission to make it successful, it\u0027s frustrating that with the potential there I can\u0027t do it. Does that make sense? or still sound like I\u0027m whining?

I\u0027m sounding like I want a completely realistic sim with all the monotony that goes with it but I really don\u0027t. I want KSP just with using the solar system and correct physics etc with it.

My issue with Orbited is simple: It\u0027s hugely outdated and lacks the kind of easily accessible modding that KSP has.
