A few here in the forums had mentioned that orbits about Moho can be \u0027wonky\u0027. I\u0027ll find out soon enough if the same is true in v1.0.2, as I\u0027m preparing another SCANsat mission there soon (right after I\u0027m done with Eve and Gilly). I\u0027ll note that when I did a SCANsat mission for Pol in v0.90, I had no problems holding orbits of 250km and 750km the duration of the lo-res and hi-res scanning. The vessel for that mission was, also, an Ion probe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoPanShabuShabu","CreatedById":91327,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T07:10:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat inability to save is the game getting ready to crash.
