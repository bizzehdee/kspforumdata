Trying to land on an impossibly close-to-the-sun planet that completes a full rotation around the sun in minutes rather than hours, days, or years. Black holes. Floating islands in the sky poking in an out of cloud-cover. Extraordinarily deep marine trenches breathtakingly high mountain tops. Not to mention, all of the numerous combinations of orbital planes, star sizes, planet biomes, etc etc that would force players to radically adapt to their unique scenario.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a thought for a distant future release (or mod).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheOtherDave","CreatedById":32305,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-23T21:03:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting idea!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWRT placing the planets in stable orbits, the problem is that we don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E have a way to know if a system is stable indefinitely.

To be clear, I\u0027m not expecting KSP 2 games to last millions of years \u2014 it\u0027s just that life probably needs relatively stable solar systems to get going, so you don\u0027t want to start in a system that wouldn\u0027t have lasted more than a few thousand years since the kerbals have ostensibly been evolving and living there for millions of years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWRT how numerous and how heavy the planets should be, I don\u0027t know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWRT how to determine whether a planet should have an atmosphere and such, I don\u0027t know, but I\u0027m pretty sure that\u0027s something which could be googled. Also, the \u0022frost line\u0022 is probably worth looking up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWRT generating the planets themselves, back in the late 90s and early 00s there was a website called something like \u0022the super fun and bouncy and stretchy site\u0022 which had a ton of algorithms. IIRC, the algorithm it had for generating planets was roughly:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStart with a sphere\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPick a random plane that intersects the sphere (it\u0027s fine if it happens to go through the center, but don\u0027t make them all do that or your planet will be \u003Cem\u003Eentirely\u003C/em\u003E too symmetric)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nShift the part of the sphere on one side of the plane in a random direction by a random amount (subject to reasonable constraints)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRepeat steps 2-3 probably\u00A0somewhere between 1k-100k times (IIRC, the more iterations you have, the less it matters what the\u00A0\u0022reasonable\u00A0constraints\u0022 are\u00A0in step 3)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t remember if you can start with shapes other than a sphere for moons or asteroids too small to pull themselves into a sphere, but IIRC\u00A0it makes pretty nice \u0022raw\u0022 planets. It doesn\u0027t account for weathering or cratering, nor do I know any algorithms for figuring that out, other than to say they\u0027ll both at least partially depend on the planet\u0027s atmosphere and age. Also, keep in mind that if there\u0027s going to be an ocean or \u0022long-term lake\u0022, the surface below sea (or lake) level will weather differently than the areas above sea (or lake) level. I\u0027d imagine you could maybe drop it into existing weather prediction software to do some statistical modeling WRT where rain would normally fall, then use that to inform where you model rivers cutting into the surface and such, but I\u0027ve never tried it so I don\u0027t know. It might also help you determine where things like rainforests or desserts would naturally form, too, but it\u0027s not an area I have any expertise in... I just vaguely remember that algorithm. Of course, it only accounts for \u0022height maps\u0022, not different soil compositions and such. Also, I have no clue how to know what a \u0022realistic\u0022 resource distribution would be, nor how to balance that against what\u0027s needed to make the game fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-23T21:07:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224239266\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022212243\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677186227\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002232305\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheOtherDave\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nJust now, TheOtherDave said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWRT placing the planets in stable orbits, the problem is that we don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E have a way to know if a system is stable indefinitely.
