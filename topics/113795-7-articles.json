struting the hell out of it don\u0027t work ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nGood question, this is one that I have never seen people asking before.\n\nOne of the most important things when designing towards being able to pull high G loads is placing your wings efficiently on your craft.\n\nYour main wings are meant to sustain the craft, their lift should be very close to the center of mass, or slightly ahead of it.\n\nIf you place the wings too far behind, you will have to generate a lot of extra force on your elevators, and that overloads the wings.\n\nPlacing them right on the center or slightly ahead of it makes it behave like a fulcrum placed on the center of mass, you can easily tilt it up and down with a very small force on the elevators.\n\nAnother thing is setting your control surface deflection to be as efficient as possible, [you can do that using the method I mentioned on the official FAR craft repository.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121176-Official-FAR-Craft-Repository?p=2060785\u0026viewfull=1#post2060785)\n\nIf you place your main wings correctly the drag on the elevators will be close to negligible, you will not need to worry about them stalling.\n\nThere are a lot of ways to pull high g turns, but it depends on the size of your craft and at which speed you want to fly.\n\nA solution that works often is having a lot of lift, but you will get a lot of drag from that, and extra weight, they can also make it more complicated to area rule.\n\nSo, you will usually want a low aspect ratio profile, as a plus you gain resistance to stall at the expense of lift, so you will be able to pull much higher AoA before stalling.\n\nThus, while subsonic you need control to keep such higher angles of attack, and stability.\n\nThe major stability concerns when doing this is roll, wing flexing should give you some extra dihedral, but be careful with uneven flexing.\n\nTransonic is a problem here, if you go supersonic you have reduced lift, and need higher deflection on your elevators, but subsonic gives you a much greater lift.\n\nWhat happens here is that if you bleed too much speed while turning when barely supersonic you will get subsonic and your wing lift will skyrocket together with the cloud of debris.\n\nThere are some not yet implemented transonic effects, so my advice is just stay away from this region if you can.\n\nWhen at supersonic what you want is to have as much lift as you can with as little AoA as possible, this way dynamic pressure does not kill you but you can still pull relatively tight turns.\n\nBut if you fly supersonic at high altitudes, you will need that extra deflection again.\n\nYou see, there is a problem here, for every situation you will need the control surfaces to deflect differently, that makes it complicated to design a craft that behaves well on all cases without using control mods.\n\nIt ends up that if you want to make a good plane, not just for pulling high G turns, you need to focus on a certain speed and altitude range.\n\nThere are many other things I did not mention here, and the closest you get to the optimal point, the more tradeoffs you will have to make.\n\nEdit: about wing strenght/weight, you always want them to be as light as possible, but enough so that they can keep up with the turns.\n\nThe heavier they are relative to the rest of your craft, the lighter you need to make them, to the point that you can pull insane g turns with a 0.675m drone with your wings close to the minimum weight possible.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-11T12:25:49Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2015 12:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tetryds**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T18:04:15Z","Content":"Keeping a craft together is a trick much like Tetryds said. I am a huge fan of delta wing designs, I use them above all others for several reasons. Most of which are the same reasons why some of the most successful high speed fighters of all time used them. They are strong, when placed properly you wont have to deal with the wing loads that you would with a more conventional straight wing design. There is a downside to the delta wing, you often sacrifice lower speed agility and stability, but you gain high speed agility. \n\nThe thing that is often the cause of a structural failure on most planes in this is to much load on the main body of the craft and not on the wings. You will see the nose flex down or up and it will \u0022worm\u0022 its way through the air. This flex is not good for a combat craft or any craft that is expected to perform at high speeds. Sometimes strategically placed struts will fix this. Other times it requires a complete redesign. \n\nThis craft suffers from that flex issue, two sections behind the cockpit, the wings will flex up and down instead of staying straight. This will cause an oscillation that only gets worse with speed and increase atmospheric pressure till the craft explodes. \n\n![zNGUx0j.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/zNGUx0j.jpg)\n\nI fixed it by placing two struts, one on top and one under the wing at the leading edge attached to the body of the craft, and then hid them inside of the wing by increasing its thickness. This gave the craft a \u0022box\u0022 frame for the strength."},{"CreatedByName":"CrisK","CreatedById":133945,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T22:40:39Z","Content":"Tetryds\u0027s advice is worth following.

Is the Mach cone or whatever it\u0027s called already that narrow that my wings produce more drag? Or am I missing something else here?\n\nYes there is, you forgot one detail, area rule is for transonic drag, right now FAR measures supersonic drag by a composition of hypersonic and transonic drag (may/will change).\n\nYou can imagine hypersonic drag as being generated by a raycast, your large thin wings and bumps on the craft will not be hypersonic drag friendly.\n\nThat is the reason why I did not add a single anti-shock body on my craft and it can easily make it to much faster than Mach 4.2 even though it has around 0.60 m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 of transonic wave drag area.\n\nArea

one.\n\nBut I don\u0027t want to kill this challenge, this second version would come later, there is still a lot to happen here, and we also need to see what people come up with.\n\nNow we know what works and what doesn\u0027t, and we also know how far we can pull it and still have people to submit crafts.\n\nSo, what I am coming up with so far is something totally different, so different that it may end up not even interfering with this challenge.\n\nThe first idea is to have a few possible roles, likely three, each with it\u0027s specific requirements.\n\nMore than one role can be fulfilled by a craft, which would compete on them at the same time.\n\nFilling all of the roles would be extremely hard, and by doing so your craft competes on the special multirole aircraft category.\n\nSpecific role combos can be set, but that would only happen if we had a very big amount of submissions.\n\nAbout mods, I don\u0027t think there should be a distinction between modded and stock aircraft, this challenge showed us that there is no problem with that.\n\nBut of course some mods like FAR itself would have to be enforced, I was thinking about AJE just for the realism boost, it\u0027s not hard to move to it since stock improved so much.\n\nEngine choice would not be a problem, you should be able to pick any that you wish.\n\nIf the requirements are set right the engine choice will be just a design decision, some categories will fit certain engine types better, naturally.\n\nFor scoring, I am still unsure, but I am thinking about dropping a point score system and using something else.\n\nI also think that the player skill can count, it\u0027s a challenge afterall, but it\u0027s very hard to get subjective judgment like this.\n\nIt could be that I could fly all of them myself, but that wears out quickly, and something like this is very complicated to judge.\n\nThe last one I made where I had to fix the crafts myself had to be put on hold simply because I did not have time to work on all of them.\n\nHalsfury suggested challenges, but amount of completed challenges gives preference to people with more playtime.\n\nA possible solution would be having two or three scenarios per role, and instead of having a better craft completing the missions are just extra requirements.\n\nWe would end up having lists of capable airplanes, without defining which is better or worse.\n\nBut this is something that still needs a lot of thought.\n\nThe idea is to start simple, and as more people submit their crafts more roles can be added, it would be cool to include propeller fighters, bombers, etc. on the future.\n\nOr make new challenges for them."},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T21:12:11Z","Content":"Here is the

drag, right now FAR measures supersonic drag by a composition of hypersonic and transonic drag (may/will change).\n\u003E You can imagine hypersonic drag as being generated by a raycast, your large thin wings and bumps on the craft will not be hypersonic drag friendly.\n\u003E \n\u003E That is the reason why I did not add a single anti-shock body on my craft and it can easily make it to much faster than Mach 4.2 even though it has around 0.60 m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 of transonic wave drag area.\n\u003E \n\u003E Area ruling blinded you to the other effects, it happens, don\u0027t
