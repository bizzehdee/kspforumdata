I am a huge fan of delta wing designs, I use them above all others for several reasons. Most of which are the same reasons why some of the most successful high speed fighters of all time used them. They are strong, when placed properly you wont have to deal with the wing loads that you would with a more conventional straight wing design. There is a downside to the delta wing, you often sacrifice lower speed agility and stability, but you gain high speed agility. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing that is often the cause of a structural failure on most planes in this is to much load on the main body of the craft and not on the wings. You will see the nose flex down or up and it will \u0022worm\u0022 its way through the air. This flex is not good for a combat craft or any craft that is expected to perform at high speeds. Sometimes strategically placed struts will fix this. Other times it requires a complete redesign. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis craft suffers from that flex issue, two sections behind the cockpit, the wings will flex up and down instead of staying straight. This will cause an oscillation that only gets worse with speed and increase atmospheric pressure till the craft explodes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zNGUx0j.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zNGUx0j.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI fixed it by placing two struts, one on top and one under the wing at the leading edge attached to the body of the craft, and then hid them inside of the wing by increasing its thickness.

fulfilled by a craft, which would compete on them at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFilling all of the roles would be extremely hard, and by doing so your craft competes on the special

not be a problem, you should be able to pick any that you wish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the requirements are set right the engine choice will be just a design decision, some categories will fit

else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think that the player skill can count, it\u0027s a challenge afterall, but it\u0027s very hard to get subjective judgment like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could be that I could fly all of them myself, but that wears out quickly, and something like this is very complicated to judge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last one I made where I had to fix the crafts myself had to be put on hold simply because I did not have time to work on all of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHalsfury suggested challenges, but amount of completed challenges gives preference to people with more playtime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA possible solution would be having two or three scenarios per role, and instead of having a better craft completing the missions are just extra requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe would end up having lists of capable airplanes, without defining which is better or worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this is something that
