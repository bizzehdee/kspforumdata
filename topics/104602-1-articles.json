It is pretty stable in atmosphere, turns well, it can reach orbit with no problem (you can see my fuel left on the image after getting to a 130k circular orbit), it has a regular clamp o tron docking port and rcs thrusters for up-down and forward-backward translations (for turning you have the reaction wheels and control surfaces). It has some solar panels on it\u0027s back as well. It\u0027s main purpose to get a crewman into space and be able to return. It is designed small and relatively light, so you can dock a few to space stations and use it as a personal transport or escape vehicle. That\u0027s about it.
