I often have remote tech so I\u0027ll use its autopilot to do burns for probes that will be out of controll range and the ocasional long burn so I can walk away and do something else but I\u0027m seting those nodes up by hand. RT generaly wont work for anything but following a node reliably so other catagories dont really apply to it.\n\nThe only skill I ever have any trouble with is a precision landing with no targetable landmark. If there is something there, Flag, Ship, Kerbal, I can land directly on top of it if I want to by just following the target indicator in but hiting an exact spot without that is a tad more dicy.
