Trypophobia has a crew of 3, 1 pilot. none of them inside an actual command pod, I\u0027m keeping them in hitchhicker containers for kerbalism reasons, but it doesn\u0027t seem to make a difference; trypophobia has no relay antennas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022d8sqEDd.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/d8sqEDd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lander Clamp, instead, is equipped with two communotron 16. it\u0027s 500 m from Fat Man, and uncontrolled. It can sometimes pick up signals from Cylinder, another manned vessel (crew 6, 2 pilots) which also has relay antennas powerful enough to connect to earth. Clamp has no control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022tu0z4mv.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/tu0z4mv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth Trypophobia and Cylinder have a RC-001S probe core.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow the question is: why don\u0027t Clamp use Fat Man\u0027s HG-5 as relay to connect to Trypophobia?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould slapping a Communotron 88-88 on Clamp (by eva construction as soon as I get back to a manned vessel, because I have to go to other moons too) help? How about a HG-5? Is it better to have both, or just the most powerful communotron 88-88 would do the trick in all situation?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease, don\u0027t link the wiki page on probe control point.

Relay and direct antenna do not stack this way. You are going to need some RA-100s to relay a signal from the outer planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-07T22:14:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless you have an RC-L01 Remote Guidance Unit (the 2.5m version), remote probe control only works for single-hop connections i.e. the vessel being remotely controlled needs a direct CommNet connection to the controlling vessel. Trypophobia can control Fat Man because the two are communicating directly via Fat Man\u0027s trio of 88-88 dishes, however Clamp\u0027s puny C16 antennae are far too weak to directly connect to Trypophobia so it won\u0027t be controllable even if Fat Man relays the signal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe solution is to add a more powerful antenna to Clamp so that it can communicate directly to Trypophobia and be remotely controlled. It might also be able to be remotely controlled by Cylinder, assuming that ship has either an RGU or one of the crew modules (Mk1-3 command pod, Mk2 lander can or MEM) so the pilots can control it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m surprised that Trypophobia is actually able to provide remote control at all, since according to the wiki page the controlling ship needs a relay antenna to serve as a probe control point. Are you sure there are no relays on it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-08T00:10:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224152750\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208878\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221657232061\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199902\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jimmymcgoochie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, jimmymcgoochie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m surprised that Trypophobia is actually able to provide remote control at all, since according to the wiki page the controlling ship needs a relay antenna to serve as a probe control point.
