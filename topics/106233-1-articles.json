It is intended to be completely reusable, using propulsive landing similar to SpaceX\u0027s Falcon 9R. They plan to use the vehicle for suborbital tourist flights in the near future, while simultaneously scaling their hardware into a fully reusable orbital launch system powered by their BE-4 Methalox engine. \n\nToday\u0027s launch went well, with separation occurring flawlessly at an altitude of 307,000 feet (93.57 kilometers). While the capsule safely returned to the desert under parachutes, the first stage ran into trouble (an issue ironically similar to a certain landing attempt earlier this year). The booster lost pressure in its hydraulic systems and was unable to land successfully. \n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/rEdk-XNoZpA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n[**First Developmental Test Flight of New Shepard**](https://www.blueorigin.com/news/press_release/blue-origin-completes-acceptance-testing-of-be-3-engine-for-new-shepard-sub)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Today we flew the first developmental test flight of our New Shepard space vehicle. Our 110,000-lbf thrust liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen BE-3 engine worked flawlessly, powering New Shepard through Mach 3 to its planned test altitude of 307,000 feet... The in-space separation of the crew capsule from the propulsion module was perfect. Any astronauts on board would have had a very nice journey into space and a smooth return... one of our goals is reusability, and unfortunately we didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t get to recover the propulsion module because we lost pressure in our hydraulic system on descent. Fortunately, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve already been in work for some time on an improved hydraulic system. Also, assembly of propulsion module serial numbers 2 and 3 is already underway... We chose VTVL because it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s scalable to very large size. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re already designing New Shepard\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s sibling, her Very Big Brother \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 an orbital launch vehicle that is many times New Shepard\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s size and is powered by our 550,000-lbf thrust liquefied natural gas, liquid oxygen BE-4 engine.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/-YJhymiZjqc?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nhttps://www.blueorigin.com/technology\n\n**Orbital Spaceflight Vehicle**\n\n![boostersystem_04.jpg](https://d3p0rr00ppgdfa.cloudfront.net/themes/site_theme/images/technology/boostersystem_04.jpg)\n\n\u003E The orbital launch system is comprised of a two-stage rocket and capsule that will carry astronauts and payloads to low-Earth orbit destinations. Similar to our suborbital vehicle, the first stage booster will separate and land back on Earth. An expendable second stage will continue to propel the capsule into orbit, toward scientific research and exploration. At the completion of its flight, the capsule will reenter Earth\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s atmosphere and land under parachutes, enabling reuse, improved reliability and lower cost access to space.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T07:02:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 07:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Airlock**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T07:12:44Z","Content":"Its...rather phallic, isn\u0027t it?"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T07:22:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Its...rather phallic, isn\u0027t it?\n\nSuch is the nature of rockets."},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T07:29:04Z","Content":"Impressive for a first flight.
