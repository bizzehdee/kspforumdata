One of my first missions to Jool I landed back on Kerbin near a large mountain with a fjord next to it. To me, the view look absolutely beautiful. After recovering the vessel, I decided that I wanted to go back and look at it some more. However, I couldn\u0027t remember. I didn\u0027t have a screenshot because I didn\u0027t know how to take screenshots back then, so I had no hints as to its location except that I knew that it was in the southern hemisphere. I tried to find it, but I eventually gave up.\n\nHowever, earlier today I opened up Hyperedit and started jumping around, and there it was:\n\n![xl5eU39.png](http://i.imgur.com/xl5eU39.png)\n\nIt doesn\u0027t look as good as my memory made it, but this thing has been bugging me for over a year and it\u0027s good to know that I\u0027m not crazy.\n\nCoordinates are approximately latitude -28, longitude 324."},{"CreatedByName":"luizopiloto","CreatedById":97503,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T16:17:33Z","Content":"It\u0027s close to KSC... fly SE...
