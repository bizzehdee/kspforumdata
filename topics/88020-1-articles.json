But Jupiter as a star would be 5000 times dimmer, so Neptune would receive about 0.02% extra solar energy, enough to change the average temperature by less than 1/20th of a degree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of Mars, the Sun would be about 3 times closer than Jupiter, so Jupiter would contribute less than 0.003% extra energy (light and heat).

If Jupiter was 80 times its current mass, it would be a red dwarf star with 0.02% of the Sun\u0027s luminosity. Assuming its satellites orbit at the same distance, Callisto would receive about the same amount of energy as the Sun gives to Earth. So what would probably happen is a lot of its surface ice would sublimate to form a water vapor atmosphere, with liquid water running underneath, possibly a global ocean. Its surface temperature would be about the same as on Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGanymede would receive a little more energy than Venus does from the Sun.

Coupled with its smaller size, its water vapor would probably be lost to space relatively quickly, and it would become a comet with a thick water vapor ring in its orbit. After a few years there would probably only remain the rocky core at about 90% of Europa\u0027s radius.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIo would receive about 4 times as much energy as Mercury does from the Sun. It already doesn\u0027t have much water, but the high temperature would be enough to vaporize some of the rock.
