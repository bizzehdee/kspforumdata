I don\u0027t know their exact weight-bearing stats but I\u0027d bet that a tracked refinery would roll better than on wheels. If not, I\u0027d say split the vehicle some more, maybe try and reduce the amount of tanks you\u0027ve got strapped on there. Are you landing the refinery fully-loaded or completely empty?It might be worth burning up/venting all the fuel/kethane from the tanks before you try and do anything too massive with it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-01T01:07:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s just during landing that the wheels explode, you could add enough landing gear to the ship to take the landing shock, then fold them away to put the wheels on the ground (or even jettison them to get rid of the weight). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the wheels are getting damaged during roving, you need to make a lighter vehicle for the number of wheels you have.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spatzimaus","CreatedById":57215,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-01T01:36:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are a couple things I can see, both of which come back to the same point: wheels at an angle aren\u0027t handled well by the game. They can\u0027t handle nearly as much stress as a vertically oriented wheel assembly, and they tend to cause steering instabilities (most noticeable on spaceplanes). But also, look at the wheel assemblies themselves: it\u0027s a wheel with a shock absorber setup, and the wheels you see in the SPH are in the \u0022compressed\u0022 position. So lining up the wheels like that won\u0027t work well, because those diagonal wheels won\u0027t touch down when the others do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor reference, here\u0027s my own mobile Kethane refinery:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XELA1KU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XELA1KU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s only a bit smaller than yours (110T versus your 161T), but only has four pairs of wheels (instead of the seven pairs you have), so it\u0027s clearly not an issue of you needing stronger wheels. Now, you might just have the wheels too close together, and it\u0027s exploding from what it thinks is contact between adjacent pairs. Spreading the sets out a bit might help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-01T02:00:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERubberband is the mod with the CAT tracks.
