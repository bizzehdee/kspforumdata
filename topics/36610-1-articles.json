On our now bigger and better Experimental Team, we have a group of over 50 Testers who know exactly what to test for and how to report the bugs that they find, in the most efficient manner possible. Experimental Testing, in the simplest way, is simply polishing the update up with the aid of the Experimental Team, it is making sure that nothing was left over or neglected during Development or QA. By far, the most challenging aspect of this final stage of testing is simply making sure that everything is tested, which is where the Test Scripts come in.\u003Cp\u003EFunnily enough, it would make more sense to call this phase Quality Assurance and the former one Experimental, but there\u0027s no use in confusing everyone even more...
