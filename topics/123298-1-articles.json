I play KSP on a 6GB (of RAM) laptop, and I\u0027m worried that I\u0027ll have to buy a new computer, or venture into the dangerous seas of laptop upgrading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould I be worried?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nothingSpecial","CreatedById":118683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T18:25:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have 4GB laptop and I double this question.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T18:31:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t be too concerned.
