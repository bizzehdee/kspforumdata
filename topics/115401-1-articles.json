They will make your rocket explode for no damn reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP radiators violate several principles of thermodynamics. The most obvious and annoying is that they embody \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwells_demon\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMaxwell\u0027s Demon\u003C/a\u003E, which is kinda impossible in a system such as a KSP rocket. Saying this less esoterically, they expel heat into space at a much lower rate than they suck heat from throughout the rocket into the part to which they\u0027re attached. The heat from the entire rocket thus being concentrated in 1 part causes this part to explode even though nothing else in the whole rocket was even showing a temperature gauge. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can avoid this by spamming lots of radiators ATTACHED TO DIFFERENT PARTS, so the heat of the whole rocket has more places to go and hopefully won\u0027t blow up any single part. And if you do enough of this, then the radators can serve a useful (but exploity) purpose in reducing reentry heating of the rocket by eliminating some of the heat as it\u0027s coming in. However, this shouldn\u0027t be possible because reentry heating apparently works by the process of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_convection\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u0022forced convection\u0022\u003C/a\u003E, which functionally is very analogous to direct conduction. That means that the surrounding air is hotter than the rocket (so heat moves from the hotter air to the colder rocket). Heat only moves downhill, after all. So radiators also rely on being hotter than their surroundings, so heat moves from them into the surroundings. If the air is hotter than the rocket, then radiators should not be able to expel any heat and in fact should increase the severity of the rocket absorbing heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus, the radiators look ugly and take up deck space you need for other things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo all in all, radiators provide no benefit unless used in significant numbers to exploit bugs in both the radiators and the heat model. If you prefer not to play that way, then there is no benefit to using them and in fact their bugs will do more harm than good. Best thing is to avoid severe aerocapture/braking passes so nothing gets too hot to begin with. And know that even if you use very gentle, low-temperature aerobraking, if you have just a couple of radiators on your ship then parts of your ship will explode by the time you reach Ap after the pass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that radiators really shouldn\u0027t be in the game at all anyway. Back in 1.0 - 1.0.2, LV-Ns had a stupidly unrealistic tendency to overheat, which basically made them useless. Nuke engines don\u0027t get that hot in reality, so this was just wrong. However, lots of people don\u0027t know this so starting whining that we needed radiators so they could use LV-Ns again, instead of lobbying to fix the real problem of unrealistic overheating. So in 1.0.4, Squad did both. They removed most of the LV-N\u0027s overheating problems AND added useless, buggy, radiators as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-08T16:56:27Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2015 04:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T17:01:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFunny, they work fine for me, protip, don\u0027t run KSP.exe via a shortcut, click the file directly so KSP can find the Physics.cfg in the folder where it is started, rather than on your desktop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe static radiators will absorb heat from the part they are attached to and radiate it away, which in turn draws heat from the parts the first part was attached to, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe folding radiators act as if they have coolant pipes allowing them to draw heat from your hottest parts anywhere on the vessel, this is the \u0022Maxwells demon\u0022 mentioned above, so it\u0027s not really violating principles of thermodynamics, but then it is just a game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the bug, there is one, but it\u0027s caused by cargobays, try to keep things away from the doors as much as possible \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T17:28:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFunny, they work fine for me...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStrange.

It had 2 small, fixed radiators attached to its 1.25m SAS unit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe image on the left shows it just after emerging from Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere after a braking pass at 40km.

The temperature of the ship is still all cold and no temperature gauges exist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI removed the radiators and did this again.

There wasn\u0027t enough heat, when dispersed throughout the ship, to cause any problems or even register on the displays we have. But there was still enough, when concentrated in 1 spot, to blow up the SAS unit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T18:14:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERepost:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022Radiator panels\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E (the fixed type) assume the temperature of their parent part without noticeable delay. \u003Cstrong\u003EIn effect, they increase the surface area of the parent\u003C/strong\u003E. Compared to fuel tanks of 16t and above, even the large panel doesn\u0027t provide much extra area, though. And anyway, radiation depends very much on temperature: in order to radiate well, a part has to be very hot. Which in this case means that the panel\u0027s parent has to be very hot -- a situation you probably want to avoid from the outset. Still, a panel or two may make the difference between a part going poof, or merely running dangerously hot. But as I said two sentences ago: if a part does not become hot, the panel attached to it will also have little to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022Thermal control systems\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E (the extendable swivel type) gather heat from all over the vessel.

However, they will break if they collide with other parts of your vessel, so you better make sure they have enough elbow room.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, it seems as if the fixed radiators were nearly useless.

The whole heat system is known to spontaneously create heat out of nowhere at times, and parts in closed cargo bays have no way to shed heat. Attaching heat sinks to a bay may increase the likelyhood of such... incidents, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s the radiator\u0027s fault.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-08T18:18:06Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2015 06:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Laie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spinomonkey","CreatedById":102142,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T18:29:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI appreciate all the feedback and you guys have settled some suspicions I\u0027ve had a little while.
