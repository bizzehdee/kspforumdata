The ship is basically a huge interplanetary craft, meant to transport both kerbals and equipment to populate other planets.\n\nIt uses mostly stock parts, except for Mechjeb (required to assemble the ship in orbit, really good pilots may be able to do it without it, i cant) and Infernal Robotics (for hangar bay doors). Aside from those 2 mods, its all stock parts. TAC fuel balancer is not required, but highly recommended since fuel distribution is not ideal.\n\nThe ship is meant to be launched from Kerbin, and assemble the 3 stages in orbit. The command module is the worst module to control, so ideally it would be the first to launch and dock the remaining modules to it.\n\nIts able to carry 260 kerbals, and the hangar is able to fit 12 Mk3 long fuselage, so you can haul a considerable payload. It has several docking ports, both 2.5m and 1.25m, both inside the hangar and on the outside. The ones on the outside can be used for refuelling missions and to upgrade the ship if required. Finally, the ship has 2 ore reprocessing units, to be used for emergency refuelling operations.\n\nLogistics are a bit painfull due to the dimensions of everything. From getting the 260 kerbals onboard, to refuelling its 250000L tanks (its HIGHLY recommended you set up a nice refuelling operation in minmus or any other low gravity moon, otherwise it will take ages to refill).\n\nEach ship save file, includes the module and its corresponding launching stages. The recommended assembly orbit is ~100km. It may be possible to go over 120km for easier time warp, but havent tried it.\n\nI hope you enjoy it.\n\n![34exe84.jpg](http://i59.tinypic.com/34exe84.jpg)![2q8dpww.jpg](http://i60.tinypic.com/2q8dpww.jpg)![2lc8vvn.jpg](http://i59.tinypic.com/2lc8vvn.jpg)\n\n![35b722u.jpg](http://i57.tinypic.com/35b722u.jpg)![10p4wzm.jpg](http://i59.tinypic.com/10p4wzm.jpg)\n\nDownloads\n\n[http://www./download/j6ys7fya97e14uy/Colony_Ship_Mk1_-_Hangar_Command.craft](http://www./download/j6ys7fya97e14uy/Colony_Ship_Mk1_-_Hangar_Command.craft)\n\n[http://www./download/9xede8uog8z7l9y/Colony_Ship_Mk1_-_Passengers_Module.craft](http://www./download/9xede8uog8z7l9y/Colony_Ship_Mk1_-_Passengers_Module.craft)\n\n[http://www./download/pkgub7ty0gmbnul/Colony_Ship_Mk1_-_Engineering.craft](http://www./download/pkgub7ty0gmbnul/Colony_Ship_Mk1_-_Engineering.craft)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T05:10:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 05:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Coyote\\_ar**"},{"CreatedByName":"ExplorerKlatt","CreatedById":107424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T06:12:44Z","Content":"That is absurdly huge!!
