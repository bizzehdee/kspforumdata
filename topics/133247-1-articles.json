I have been a long time lover of KSP, and first of all wish to congratulate all you folks at Squad for making such a great game. Thank you for all your effort it is truly appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question is as an avid Kerbal fan I was wondering if there was any way to purchase multiple keys for the product at a discount? I do not mean to imply that a discount is needed for such great work, but also know that Squad takes very good care of their community. So much so that I thought I\u0027d look for someone else that has asked or mentioned this. I ran a few searches with a couple different keywords and did not have any luck citing it. So my apologies if its here and I missed it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain I love the game and the idea behind it. Myself and my children have gotten many hours of entertainment, and even some education along the way from the single copy I do own. With literally no sign of boredom in continuing to add hours every week.\u00A0 I would like to spread that experience around a bit. I just thought if I could maximize the potential for spreading the love so to say it was worth a few minutes of searching and then typing for sure. I do not believe in any way I could qualify for the educational avenue (Though three of the science teachers (middle and high school) at my local school have shown interest, and that will be the first three I send out as they have received permission to move forward with this on the computers at the school) as many people I have in mind as folks that would enjoy it are in no way related to education, and some have even have turned game playing into a profession (i.e. twitch/youtube personalities). I look forward to hearing your response, and thank you in advance for taking a min to respond.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-01T12:48:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/112459-xxapvxx/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022112459\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/112459-xxapvxx/\u0022\u003E@xxApvxx\u003C/a\u003E, welcome the forums!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a single player game (though multiplayer is planned), Squad has never offered a discount for multiple purchases by individuals, and is unlikely to do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, there are frequent discounts of 25% and 40% off the sale price on the Squad store and at all of the online retailers who offer KSP (GoG, Steam, etc).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy advice in your situation would be to keep an eye out for the sales.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xxApvxx","CreatedById":112459,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-01T12:55:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for the fast response and the information. Should have bought more in the beginning I suppose. I\u0027ll give a shout back to the folks and let them know they are on their own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
