Well, I just think it would be neat if KSP tracked overall statistics such as:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELargest (heaviest) ship on launch pad\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost mass into stable orbit above Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreatest Gs felt by ships\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so on. This idea is based on a thread about what was the heaviest ship you ever got into orbit. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s possible and I wouldn\u0027t hope for it until maybe sometime near or even after release, but I think it would be pretty cool. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonus suggestion!

If you look at your peristence file you will see a lot of stats stored there, that\u0027s it. It\u0027s kinda sad that .20 is so underevaluated, this thing is one of the biggest piece of work implemented to the game, we\u0027re just not able to appreciate it yet by lack of career.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
