Something could probably be altered by radiation that does not have to do with the DNA, but it would be smaller and less common. (I\u0027m not a biologist or a chemist, so I may be wrong) However you are correct for this case as only the pollen will be altered.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E People already do this, actually.

This is because *that* is just where it happens to be the positive point. I can\u0027t tell how big the scale of the first paper is, however, since they don\u0027t seem to note it anywhere, so for all I know that could have a depressingly low sample size that has to deal with chance getting in the way (the second study notes that only about 1-5% of the ones they made actually had mutations at all, and not many of those were favorable; it takes a *huge* amount of corn to get the mutations you want.

Basically everything we eat has been made like this.

Rinse and repeat.\n\nIncredible damage to the genomes has been done this way. Deletions of whole cromosomes, destruction of genes... But it gave us food.\n\nNowdays we have way better method.
