His response was that \u0022[he] wanted to go to space so bad, [he]\u0027d fly with a baboon!\u0022 For three day mission, he could put up with a fair amount. Apollo 11 was only 8 days long, and even the \u0022long duration\u0022 Apollo 15-17 missions were only 12 days long. (He concluded by complimenting the Shuttle astronauts for their work in long-duration spaceflight.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBased on this, I think it\u0027s reasonable to have very low happiness penalties (or none at all) for short-ish term missions (say, a trip to Minmus and back), especially when facilities are limited (when there\u0027s only twelve Kerbals in the whole Center, they all know each other and everybody at KSC knows them as well). This could be linked to parameters like orbital period (if they know they\u0027re going to be back on Kerbin within a week, why be down?). People like to be kept busy, so doing EVAs, science experiments, docking, KAS assembly, etc. may give happiness bonuses, more so if they\u0027ve never been done before, but with some cooldown or rate-based diminishing return (since people like having a little downtime as well). If Kerbals should find themselves in a vehicle which, by some accident (or design failure) lacks engines, fuel, parachutes, or docking ports (required equipment possibly depending on location -- they won\u0027t care about having parachutes or not in the Mun\u0027s SOI), they will probably become very unhappy very quickly!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I heard about some NASA data on a sort of curve relating the amount of space that humans need vs. the amount of time they will be staying in it.
