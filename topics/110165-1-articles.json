Nose very high, like 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 up, puts you into the territory of maximum drag, as well as reducing your rate of descent. The drag scrubs off speed, the reduced rate of descent pushes the great balls of fire into the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve yet to do much with mark 3 stuff, but mark 1 and 2, I can drop Pe to 0 from 75\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC100km circular orbit, with any major issues from heating. I tend to sit the plane flat across the airflow above 50,000m, i.e. nose 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 up, (there\u0027s very little air up there, but there\u0027s enough that it does scrub off some extra speed by being at the most draggy attitude). Below 50,000m, it varies, but pulling up hard works well to scrub off more speed if things are looking too fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntil your speed is down to below 1000 m/s, and altitude below 25,000m, you\u0027re not trying to fly, you\u0027re trying to brake.
