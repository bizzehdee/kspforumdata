(I know.....SSTOs....) in the late stages of a flight or mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPrinciple 2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe aim to reduce the weight as much as possible. It might have the side benefit of increasing simplicity, reducing part count (to under 30, in early gameplay...) etc So for smaller rockets, carrying the interstage equipment and extra engines seems counterintuitive. (This may conflict with Principle 1).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPrinciple 3\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce we have a spaceship with separate stages, we optimise the fuel/engines in each to maximise the deltaV and produce the required \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E (and probably not much more.....because a bigger engine is a heavier engine). Being mindful that a vacuum-optimised engine isn\u0027t great at low altitudes too, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPrinciple 4\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe \u0027set\u0027 the stages to be defined amounts each, so that each stage corresponds with a phase of the mission profile. Eg liftoff from Kerbin is typically 1000m/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E straight up, so we use SRBs for that. Then to orbit needs a reasonable motor; then the next (which might be, eg Minmus insertion) need not be so powerful etc etc. We don\u0027t want to be half way through injecting for Minmus and needing to mess about with staging, leaving a debris fuel tank going half way there too etc. This might conflict with Principle 3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone violently disagree with the above principles? How do you resolve when they conflict? Personally I\u0027ve tweaked and tweaked things on several iterations, generally in the order 1) it needs to do the job 2) \u0027efficient\u0027 whatever that means, ie an 18t rocket can carry a good payload; or no obvious weirdness like taking a million m/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to reach orbit; or having lots of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E left for later/extending the mission(s). 3) fly nice. As in, consistent, repeatable launches not relying on daredevil piloting or luck 4) low cost. If there\u0027s something that can do it for \u00A311k when the previous did it for \u00A312k....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the NCD challenge has taught me - due to its limited funding and grindy nature - you need to \u0022come to the table\u0022 with a decent design in your head, build it and fly it with no real dramas or issues straight out the blocks. So any tips, ideas or discussion is much appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-25T23:00:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni would disagree that liftoff is 1000 m/s straight up, as i generally start turning around 50 m/s with the objective of hitting 500 m/s with a 45 degrees inclination... but then you mentioned caveman. so you flew a lot of small rockets with inadequate parts and no fairings, so you have much greater problems of aerodinamics. in which case it makes sense to launch straight up for a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-26T03:56:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, as my not answer,\u00A0I\u0027d say it is\u00A0\u00A0about the efficiency, reaching the objective with small expenditure of resources.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, there is the catch: you are the one that decide what the objective is and what\u00A0resources are valuable for you.

That lets my 2nd lifter stage burn up after release. The transfer stage described above handles the final part of getting to orbit.
