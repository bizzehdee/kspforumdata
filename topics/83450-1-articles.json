I also cannot find a way to add more EVA fuel in the save files for the kerbal so im kinda stuck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm wondering if there is indeed an EVA fuel parameter i just havent found or if someone could help me figure out how to edit the save so bill can get his ass back into the damn lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-01T09:30:33Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2014 09:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by LRoDgy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M4ck","CreatedById":74138,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-31T13:38:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHyperedit -\u0026gt; Misc -\u0026gt; Refill resources, should work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-31T13:54:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EText editing the persistent.sfs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tVESSEL\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tpid = 9843c2ca0688428aaf3b20072ce5cb1c\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tname = Genekin Kerman\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\ttype = EVA\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\t...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tPART\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\t\tname = kerbalEVA\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\t\t...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\t\tRESOURCE\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\t\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\t\t\tname = EVA Propellant\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\t\t\tamount = 5\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\t\t\tmaxAmount = 5\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr you can send another mission with ladder and train your pinpoint landings (Minmus is a good start).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is also possible to transfer EVA fuel between two Kerbals in command seats.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-31T15:04:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, sounds like fodder for a rescue mission.
