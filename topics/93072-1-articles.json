It was also officially supported with the start of KSP .23\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I have though is in the contruction buildings. At first the camera is centered to the middle of the VAB (which is normal). If I build my rocket without touching the 3D mouse everything is fine. Though as soon as I used the 3D mouse to rotate or move the camera I am unable to place any parts anymore. When I select a part from the part list it instantly plops into the VAB an I am unable to select it or move it. Thus making it impossible to build anything. I can only place parts for as long as I don\u0027t touch the 3D mouse. Once I do I can\u0027t place any parts at all anymore, even if the recenter the camera using the noramal mouse controls. After that I have to either reload the ship I\u0027m building or leave the VAB. But I can still not select any parts that where placed into the VAB while I was using the 3D mouse. I can however still select free floating parts that had been placed into the VAB from before I used the 3D mouse. All these parts are just free floating. They are not connected to any spacecraft. They also vanish if I reload the ship or exit the VAB (which is normal). I can still select parts that are part of my rocket. As long as I built the rocket without touching the 3D mouse. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is 100% repeatable on both 32 and 64bit windows version of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-16T09:30:50Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2014 09:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by T.Lancer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ted","CreatedById":26298,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T11:48:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYupp, this is a confirmed issue.
