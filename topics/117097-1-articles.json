I know there is something not right in the config file but I don\u0027t know what it is. Anybody out there good at programming that can help me?

Its just not getting to the engine. But If I add Xenon gas to the list of engine propellants, the engine fires. and both electricity and xenon are consumed. However I still get no thrust and no \u0022fire\u0022 from the bottom of the engine. If I release from the launch clamps, the ship falls and explodes. My thrust is set for 800 and my ISP is 15000 both in vac and atmo. Fuel ratios are both set to 0.001. I have also given the engine the alternator module so it can generate its own electric charge. My other problem aside from the thrust is the flame effect does not show up on the tail end of the engine. I get the sounds but no visuals. I have tried adjusting the position, but still nothing.
