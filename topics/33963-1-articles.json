When docking was introduced to KSP I raised the question of how it would handle wildly differing inertial momentum. My reasoning? Brace yourself...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay I have a target craft in orbit. And I launch a rendezvous craft a good way ahead of it. I time stuff perfectly so just when my rendezvous craft hits Apoapsis, it encounters the target. Because my rendezvous craft is at nearly 0 orbital velocity at the top of its apoapsis, it should be able to dock in that split second where it encounters the target. And then what?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell as I was soon explained, a lot of stuff would explode into a rapidly expanding cloud of expensive debris. Because the target \u003Cem\u003Ewould\u003C/em\u003E have a very significant orbital velocity, and this velocity would be relative to my rendezvous craft as well, given that it would still be at the planet\u0027s surface velocity when you look at it sideways. Three-dimensional thinking and all that. It would be a good old-fashioned collision and disaster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you think about it, this is similar to the problem posed by a target in stationary orbit right above KSC. My rocket goes up straight and encounters the target - but when it does, the rocket has a really high \u0022upward\u0022 velocity (ie. straight up, needed for a straight vertical trajectory) while the target would be at a really high \u0022sideways\u0022 velocity (needed to keep pace with the planet\u0027s surface). The result would be another rapidly expanding cloud of expensive debris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStuff in orbit is never stationary. It always has velocity relative to \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E and in \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E direction. A geostationary orbit is actually really fast - it\u0027s so fast it keeps pace with the surface of the planet even at a much higher altitude. To picture this, imagine how fast a race car would have to drive at 500 meters\u0027 distance to stay in your field of view while you\u0027re gently spinning your desk chair. It would seem \u0022stationary\u0022 to your field of view, but it would most definitely not be standing still. And if you threw a brick ahead of it from your desk chair, you\u0027d end up with a rapidly expanding cloud of expensive debris (and probably a dead driver, with all the resulting nasty manslaughter charges - don\u0027t try this at home).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK. So where \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E it useful? It\u0027s not for straight vertical launches.

Orbital mechanics are weird!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, it makes sense if you view it from a perspective of kinetic and potential energy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example. Let\u0027s say that at a certain altitude, a spacecraft has 10,000 m/s of combined energy. (Yes, I\u0027m aware energy is in units of Joules - let\u0027s just simplify matters and call it m/s; a Joule is really a [kg(m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E)]/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E. It\u0027s just how how much velocity had to be put into each kilogram to get it to where it is now.) This 10,000 m/s is combined energy, both kinetic and potential. Kinetic energy can be looked at as energy an object has while it\u0027s moving; it\u0027s how much force would be needed to make it completely stationary. Potential energy can be looked at as how high the object is from the ground; a plant on your top shelf would have more potential energy than the same plant on a lower shelf - it would be more likely to break if it got knocked down. As an object falls, that potential energy is converted into kinetic energy using the conversion 1/2 v\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E = gh, where v is the velocity when it hits the ground, g is the force of gravitation, and h is the starting height of the object.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk. So that 10,000 m/s is our combined energy, both kinetic and potential. Let\u0027s assume the fuel tanks are empty; there\u0027s no stored chemical potential energy. So, if your ascent took 5,000 m/s of delta v and you\u0027re in a stable orbit, your craft is going 5,000 m/s. If your ascent took 8,000 m/s, and again, you\u0027ve achieved a stable orbit, your velocity would only be 2,000 m/s. Even though your kinetic energy is smaller, your potential energy is higher, so the delta v required to get there is the same. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, just because the spacecraft is moving more slowly doesn\u0027t mean it needs less delta v. If it\u0027s in a higher orbit, you need more delta v to get it there, even though your velocity is going to be much slower upon arrival.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skykooler","CreatedById":60459,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T00:50:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wayfare\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wayfare\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOK.
