This is not a metaphor - that\u0027s literally how it works under the hood. When you start a mission, you load a\u00A0savegame with some initial conditions defined by the mission author, and the mission objective game mechanics bolted on. After the mission fails or is completed, you quit the savegame and return to the main menu. The next mission you start will load a different, completely unrelated savegame.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, there\u0027s limited potential for something like you envision, via two potential methods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMethod 1: A mission author releases multiple missions that are all thematically tied to each other. Since it is possible for the mission author to constrain the parts available to the player, each mission could be configured to allow more parts\u00A0than the one before it. As long as you play the missions in the order the author intended, you can play an entire multi-mission campaign that way. However, that doesn\u0027t work across arbitrary missions (i.e. you cannot download a mission from mod author A and expect to receive a persistent bonus that helps you in a mission from mod author B). It only works if a single author (or a team) decides to craft a coherent multi-mission campaign.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMethod 2: A single mission can contain multiple tasks. I don\u0027t know if there is a limit to the number of objective nodes an author can use, but the author could conceivably make a single mission that contains an entire series of construction and flight tasks. From what I\u0027ve seen, rewarding currencies like science and funds for completing mission objectives is possible, so you could emulate something like career or science mode that way. Theoretically. Because I don\u0027t know if the tech tree actually works. It\u0027s possible that missions spawn you in a sandbox save by default, in which case you couldn\u0027t make tech progress yourself - you\u0027d still be reliant on the mission author allowing more and more parts as the mission progresses. Also, note that there are two limitations to this. First, in such a mega-mission, you still need to follow the path defined for you by the objective nodes. There may be limited potential for choosing one path among multiple options, but there\u0027s no such thing as being able to pick your next task out of a list like they were contracts, or going back to complete an earlier task you bypassed. Second, while currency rewards can be assigned for completing objectives, you won\u0027t actually see a mission success screen, or any performance scores and awards, until you reach the end of the whole mega-mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
