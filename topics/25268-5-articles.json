It will foster creativity, and you will get much more variation in their rocket builds. I fear that if you limit them to a few basic parts, you will get 15 ships, very similar in nature. Then it becomes a game of skill for them. There is an \u0022intent\u0022 behind every build, and having the tools available fosters that creativity.

So Inoticed this thread a while back, when I was deep in design efforts and other random crazyness with the docking ports (Who really needs 27 space stations... This guy!!!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I see it pop back up and got a grin on my face. It is now version 20.2 and I have to admit... there is a bunch of stuff I never did that is on that list...I know. In fact depending on the grading scale, and the actual penalty level for Kerbal mauling I would have lucked out with a solid (or not so solid) C on this project. Unless the space station thing is repeatable for credit... 27 space stations, baby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am going to make it personal mission to get through all these now, but in a community level I think we should come up with a few more advanced milestones and sticky this thread over to Challenges for a beginners Challenge. (The advanced milestones would replace the essays... because I still don\u0027t like essays). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust to note For my attempts the rules on mods will be a little different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) I will be using a lot of mods (B9, KAS, ISA Mapper, Kethane 5.1, Firepitter, Nuke, Quatum struts, KW Rockets, maybe lazers)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I have Mech Jeb, but will limit myself to info screens (Orbital flight info, Ship mass info stuff like that... no flight asssistance applications)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) I will catalog all deaths in development, and crashes for others to berate me over (I think ridicule is a good replacement for loss of grade points)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Repeated mission profiles have to show relevance to count for more points... 27 space stations don\u0027t count 27 times unless EACH ONE can be shown to be truly needed/useful to the overall program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all I think most of these things should be attempted/completed by all of us at least once. With mods or without. I myself have so many tested to death launch models that I basically always use Mech Jeb to hoist them to orbit now, because I can\u0027t be bothered. I think it is time to get back to basics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlacrity Fitz\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FizziksGuy","CreatedById":63006,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T20:34:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fuller\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fuller\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi Dan,\u003Cp\u003EI saw your interview in PC Gamer about a week ago and just wanted to say thank you for making me aware of this game.
