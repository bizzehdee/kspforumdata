Navigating at and around the Mun is feasible manually, but even as close as Minmus the delay start throwing you off. Around other planets any manual direct control is next to impossible.\n\nWhile Remote Tech does include a flight computer, apart from very simple burns and \u0022Execute Maneuver node\u0022 it\u0027s not very useful, as it\u0027s built only on countdown clock.\n\nSo, what we got is K-OS, which is a pure brilliant mod. The problem with K-OS is that it\u0027s complicated. For me, often too complicated to be fun. Debugging scripts is in general not something I enjoy, and doing it while i\u0027m supposed to have fun playing a game even less so.\n\nWhat I would love is a \u0022click and drag\u0022 version of K-OS, or perhaps just a more advanced version of the RT Flight Computer. I\u0027m not looking for something super advanced such as Mech Jeb. I don\u0027t want something that play the game for me. I do want to do the planning.\n\nI\u0027m thinking a syntax such as \u0022When X Set Y Until Z\u0022, where you can choose the options from a dropdown or similar. These commands would then stack in a similar fashion to the current flight computer, executing one after another. With the \u0022When\u0022 and \u0022Until\u0022 statements being optional, you could built quite advanced programs in a very simple fashion. Imagine this as a launch sequence:\n\nSet \u0022Heading: 90,90,90\u0022\n\nSet \u0022Thrust: 100%\u0022\n\nWhen \u0022Altitude: 5KM\u0022 Set \u0022Heading: 70,90,90\u0022\n\nWhen \u0022Altitude: 10KM\u0022 Set \u0022Heading: 45,90,90\u0022\n\nWhen \u0022Apoapsis: 75KM\u0022 Set \u0022Thrust: 0%\u0022\n\nSet \u0022Heading: Prograde\u0022\n\nWhen \u0022Altitude: 72KM\u0022 Set \u0022Thrust: 100%\u0022 Until \u0022Periapsis: 75KM\u0022\n\nNow, I can\u0027t remember my numbers, but you catch my drift. \n\nA mod like this would give many of the simpler benefits of K-OS (No loops and advanced logic), but this is something that would take a minute to set up, and any idiot could do it, unlike K-OS.\n\n(I am aware that this specific example would be quite easy in K-OS as well, but it was the best I could think of on top of my head)\n\nNow, i\u0027m sure someone thinks \u0022Just make it yourself\u0022, and I probably could. But it would never get done. I know myself too well, and this project would be stuffed into a dusty corner of my dropbox folder in a matter of days. I am very well aware that this is not a small, simple, mod request.\n\nSo, instead I hope that there are other people who have thought \u0022K-OS is just brilliant, but it\u0027s just too much work when i\u0027m supposed to have fun and relax\u0022, whom actually ENJOYS writing code, and whom also happen to think that this is a good idea.\n\nKindest Possible Regards,\n\nSimon"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T14:56:55Z","Content":"Not what you asked for, but another option for automated control is [Smart Parts](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64227) which can fire action groups or stage based on triggers (altitude, proximity, resources, etc).\n\nIf RemoteTech had altitude/speed triggered commands instead of just timed commands, that\u0027d be pretty cool. However the RemoteTech people have rejected such ideas in the past - RemoteTech provides simple commands, and if you want more, upgrade to kOS.\n\nI do think a Flight-Computer style GUI that plopped out kOS scripts would be helpful. In the meantime, there\u0027s a lot of prewritten scripts already: [http://kos.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_toolkit_v3](http://kos.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_toolkit_v3)"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T16:05:25Z","Content":"search around the Add-on Development forums there was a WYSIWIG sort of kOS alternative under development last year at some point.

For me that ended up feeling MORE complicated then K-OS, instead of less. I guess it\u0027s because I actually do know how to code already (I just don\u0027t enjoy it), while this was a complete new way of looking at it. Was very interesting, and with more polish could probably have been completely awesome.\n\nLike Hab136 says, it\u0027s more of a Remote Tech with additional triggers that I would want personally.\n\nI had also looked at Smart Parts before, and it does some of the things I would like, but because it\u0027s limited to triggering action groups and staging it doesn\u0027t really go far enough.\n\nAnyway, thanks for your replies guys, I will keep crossing my fingers that time, skill and inclination will spot this and think to themselves that this is something the game really, really should have ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
