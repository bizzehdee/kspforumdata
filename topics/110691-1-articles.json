Sounds easy, right? Here\u0027s the catch:\n\nIt must be a film about landing on another world and it must all be done without leaving Kerbin !!\n\nThis challenge is mainly aimed at the Filmmakers out there (myself included. I\u0027ve wanted to do this for a while)\n\nAnyways, here are the rules:\n\n**Rules:**\n\n- No use of the \u0022Hack Gravity Cheat\u0022. You don\u0027t have the budget for that!\n- You can\u0027t use the \u0022infinite fuel cheat\u0022.\n- You can only use the mods below. Some will put you in different categories though, so keep that in mind.\n- No Rockets allowed. use planes to transport stuff.\n- Editor effects are allowed (green screen, blue screen, whateverthehellyouwant screen, etc...)\n- Have fun and good luck!\n- you can have rockets on your sets/rigs. just make sure to limit them to 10% **MAXIMUM** or your death by angry producers is certain. Fuel is expensive!\n- Ion engines are allowed to burn at 100% thrust. They can\u0027t move anything within the atmosphere... or so they claim (and they can blow up white-houses as an intergalactic greeting apparently)\n\n**Mods allowed:**\n\n- Hyperedit (if you want to. you\u0027ll be put into the Hyperedit category if you do and make sure to mention that when submitting your film/entry)\n- PartPacks in general (no cheaty ones that alter physics \u0027n\u0027 stuff though)\n- BDArmoury and other weapon mods\n- rover parts packs in general (Kerbal Foundries included. You can\u0027t get enough of \u0027em tracks)\n- Camera mods (Kerbcam and Camera tools , unless you want to build camera booms)\n- And, of course, infernal/Damned robotics for articulation of rigs\n- Texture replacer and Environmental Visual Enhancement packs.#\n- KAS\n\n**Categories:**\n\n- Hyperedit movies: Films that used Hyperedit to transport rigs around kerbin instead of Planes and rovers.\n\n- Conventional movies: Films that used planes and rovers to transport rigs around Kerbin\n\n**Scoring system?**\n\n......\n\nhow good the films are, I guess? Oh! I\u0027ve got it! After your entry/In your post, mention a film you liked! How\u0027s that sound? Good? I thought so.\n\nBest of luck to all of you! I look forward to seeing what the film community is capable of.\n\n**Entry Requirements:**\n\n- behind the scenes pics\n- list of mods used\n- the film\n\n**Entrys:**\n\nSoda Popinski\u0027s Entry:\n\n ***\u0022Amazon Women from the Mun\u0022***\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/urzpg2yUexY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nThis is a perfect example!

You can\u0027t leave the atmosphere.
