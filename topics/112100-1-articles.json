Too little, and you need too much of an AoA for level flight and induced drag robs your accent efficiency. Additionally your glide slope approximates a falling brick. Too much, and you have too much wing drag in atmosphere.

First of all make sure tail rudders are only yaw controls and your other controls do not yaw. Its much less critical, but if its a big plane that needs lots of control, I also end up disabling roll on about half the other control surfaces. Everything horizontal has pitch enabled, because it always seems to be the limiting factor. Other than that its about more controls, with more control lift, further out and forward or backwards of the CoM (not CoL). Do you have canards or elevators at the very front, as those really seem to help? The BigS elevators are also really great for being high lift controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for speed, the drag spike really only starts around 290-300, so for a lifter I keep around 270 until I\u0027m ready to level off an go transonic at 12-14 km.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mic_n","CreatedById":27054,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T14:18:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022enough lift\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cctv-africa.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/solar-plane-2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022solar-plane-2.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e1/F104s.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022F104s.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eie: \u0022it depends\u0022.
