At first I was like \u0027Have we forgotten to get the bins out again?\u0027, but then she pointed up at the clear sky. Since there are no bins in the sky, this got me quite interested in what mum was trying to show me. And then she told me, and I saw it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember back when I was a little kid, every night I would come out with my telescope to look at the moon and sometimes other space things. It was cool to observe the lunar landscape, with the valleys and mountains and craters and highlands and ballast flats. At other times I saw the couldy stripes of Jupiter, and the jovian moons. I think I even saw venus or mars once. But I never saw something man-made, never a satellite or space station. That was all I wanted, to see something while its \u0027alive\u0027. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETonight, I saw it. The international Space Station, right there before my eyes. A true symbol of what the world is capable of in space, when we stop fighting and work together on something. Sure, I saw the decommissioned space shuttle at the Kennedy Space Center 2 or 3 years ago, along with a bunch of other cold-war relics. But here was an object, an operational human station that was operational right as I saw it and had people inside right as I saw it. This was the first time I had seen anything \u003Cem\u003Elike \u003C/em\u003Ethat. It gave me a feeling, a kind of emotion, that I had not felt since the Kennedy Space Center, or when first saw the lunar landscape through a telescope and thought \u0027people have actually gone there\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, enough about me, have any of you seen the ISS before?
