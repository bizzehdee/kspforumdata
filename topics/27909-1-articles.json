There could be any number of reasons, actually.

Test work is a very demanding type of flying. You fly a dozen different airplanes every week and you really don\u0027t feel comfortable in them, but you know the systems. But also, it\u0027s a lot of competition in test work. When you get into tactical flying, back in the fighter squadron, you fly only one airplane, stay combat ready and know your guys. It\u0027s a pretty nice way of life. So I came back and I was at George when the space program started in \u002759. The requirement to get into the space program was to have a degree, preferably engineering, math or one of the sciences. I only had a high school education. I didn\u0027t give it a thought. I couldn\u0027t care less about it because to me it wasn\u0027t flying, it was riding in capsules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-21T11:26:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2013 11:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
