This makes for slow feedback particularly when configuring the dead zone and sensitivity of the joystick which takes some back and forth to get right. The input controls should be available in the config menu in game for tweaking and for reference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to completely remapping the controls there are several \u0027quick\u0027 changes to the input controls that are useful depending on what the player is doing. For instance swapping roll and yaw makes sense when transitioning from flying a rocket to a plane (which can happen mid flight) (this is particularly noticeable when using a joystick). Likewise the RCS controls that are best for docking (where I view the ship from behind) are the opposite of those that are good for landing (where I view it from above). There are also situations where it makes sense to orient the camera in a way that makes the navball centred controls counterintuitive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI propose a \u0027quick flip\u0027 option for rotation and RCS controls. A modifier key could be used to swap the direction of any axis, and another key could exchange any two axis. For example Mod \u002B W would reverse the controls for the pitch axis. Another key would allow the roll and yaw to be swapped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother way to do this would be to have a \u0027quick config\u0027 window that would open to flip the controls. The \u0027quick config\u0027 window wouldn\u0027t be as complex as the full input configuration window and would just swap the inputs without reconfiguring them, as well as allowing them to be reset to the default. One advantage of this approach would be that the game would be paused while this window was up but if the RCS thrust were still rendered when the controls were applied it would be possible to see how the controls were configured without affecting the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T05:31:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy only worry here is that this will become confusing \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9 fast.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BrokenPhysics","CreatedById":85559,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-02T09:31:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MythicLionMan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MythicLionMan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI propose a \u0027quick flip\u0027 option for rotation and RCS controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis can already be done within docking mode \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vexx32\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vexx32\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E My only worry here is that this will become confusing really\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9 fast. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eone possibility to prevent that, would be to create these options, but don\u0027t bind them to a key by default.

That way it\u0027s always possible to revert to the original mapping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real source of the confusion is that it\u0027s already a very complex problem. The game currently attempts to solve it by having multiple modes (docking, flight, EVA, rover) and each of these has its own control mappings, but these aren\u0027t enough to cover all cases (for instance plane flight vs rocket flight or docking vs landing). Doing different quick remaps doesn\u0027t eliminate the complexity since it\u0027s just adding even more modes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe one way to help keep it from becoming too complicated would be to make it a part of docking mode. The remapped controls would only activate when docking mode was active and the docking view could show the current mapping and the UI to change it. This wouldn\u0027t work so well for flying an airplane though since that normally isn\u0027t done in docking mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone of what I\u0027ve said here sounds like it would prevent things from getting more complicated though \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.

Did I miss something or are you suggesting that I configure my standard RCS for top down (landing) mode and then configure docking mode for chase view? I guess I could configure my non docking RCS thrusters for top down mode since I only really use RCS for docking or for killing horizontal velocity while landing. The default config is a bit backwards when landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t solve the issue with planes vs rockets (though this could be fixed with yet another global control mode) and it doesn\u0027t help when trying to control something from strange camera angles, but that is a bit of a fringe case.
