It has a service module attached with the fuel tank and engines, attached to the capsule via a decoupler on Stage 1. The capsule then has parachutes on Stage 0. Typically whenever I press Space to fire the decoupler, it also automatically fires the parachute stage. So I either have my chutes open during re-entry, which is no big deal since re-entry doesn\u0027t damage them (but it visually looks wrong), or I wait and re-enter with the service module attached and fire the stage after the effects are gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there something I\u0027m doing wrong with the staging?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of staging, I\u0027ve also had issues during launch where, say I have a 3 stage rocket, and without playing with any settings, the first stage auto-decouples after the tank runs out of fuel, but the second one stops and then I have to hit Space to manually fire the stage. So basically help with staging, yeah.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-16T22:59:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb autostaging. Doesn\u0027t matter if you don\u0027t have a mechjeb thingie on the current ship, as soon as mechjeb is installed as a mod it\u0027ll do that. You have to go into the mechjeb settings and manually turn off autostaging I think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cashen","CreatedById":71281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-16T23:03:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb\u0027s ascent guidance autopilot has an auto-staging checkbox but I didn\u0027t think it was that, since I never use the ascent autopilot.
