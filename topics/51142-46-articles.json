I\u0027ve got 8 GB of RAM but it seems the game engine only uses 4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I first installed the high-res VE (works flawless) and then downloaded the HD-pack. The latter one didn\u0027t function ingame. In the folder, I could saw the images of bump1 and detail1 while having sizes of respectively 417 kb and 2,58 MB, indicating a problem with memory. I replaced the HD-version of duna1.tga with the one of the original VE, but with no effect. Second step was to delete the only other mod I had installed; Keramzit with the procedural fairing. Still no effect. Third and last step I could think of was the deletion of the high-res VE and downloading the low-res VE, and again installing the HD-pack. No result. Anyone suggestions?
