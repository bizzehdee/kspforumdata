I update it only once a second (I would love to update it more often for a better mission control experience) but then once a second there\u0027s a huge lag spike for the mission control windows displaying the data. If I\u0027m dragging the window or resizing it, it\u0027s super noticeable. Or if I\u0027m selecting a drop down menu to view list of vessels to target, etc. The game is fine though, doesn\u0027t lag with this. Same issue with the mod MOCR which does the same thing using kRPC as well. It will freeze and crash once I have 3 or more data windows open. Is there a way to get this data without the lag? I don\u0027t see how it would even be causing the lag tbh if it\u0027s just pulling some simple data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
