Its mostly because I used the opposite of a skycrane maneuver on my .8 ton rover and it BARELY survived (basically adding a burning thing under neath it that separated from the rover). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could do a skycrane, but its really hard for me during landings and stuff like that, so I\u0027m wondering what a Kerbin descent rate of 2.6 m/s with parachutes and no thrust would be on Duna. I\u0027m predicting a 13.0 m/s descent rate, but that\u0027s if I just base it on atmospheric thickness (I am landing in the largest circular crater on Duna).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rover is 3.2 tons and has 13 parachutes (12 radials and one small non-radial) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I correct, or should I expect different amounts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhiterafter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
