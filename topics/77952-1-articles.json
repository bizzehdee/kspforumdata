Immersion in a game is everything; break the immersion, you loose players (aka, customers. Aka, money). It could also add additional rewards to the game, which as every good game developer is aware of, is how a game progresses. Building a video game is all about rewards and discipline, you reward the player for playing the game well, and you punish the player for playing the game poorly. This is basic psychology. Some players will view the newspaper idea as a reward, as there is feedback on the things that they are doing in the game. Some personality types need the reassurance of this feedback, and would help these players stick to the game longer as they are getting rewards that matter more to their particular personality type than, lets say, an additional part that was unlocked.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"megatiger78","CreatedById":114940,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-17T16:05:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking that an article about a rocket \u0022disaster\u0022 (or a regular danny2462 launch.) so you could be asked to choose from a selection of comments (one of them should be \u0022working as intended\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thiagobs","CreatedById":76021,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-17T17:04:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat idea!!!!!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would specially make the reputation system more organic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it is, the rep is only a number that increases or decreases.
