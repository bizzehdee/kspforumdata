Turns out the stainless steel grill was on fire. And the funny thing was she wasn\u0027t using it to cook dinner. We had used the grill the night prior, though, seemed as if we may have forgotten to turn the gas off. At least that was our initial thought on the subject. After grabbing the extinguisher and getting close enough to put out the flames, there was an explosion, focused on the right side of the grill, where the various heat setting knobs were. The right knob was completely ejected by the explosion, and some molten metal (I presume steel since it is a stainless steel grill, but I don\u0027t really know...) was pooled below, having pooled in a two-inch diameter puddle with another inch of slag-like metal sticking out of it. The next knob (four in total; directly left of the ejected one) was partially dislodged, but still hanging on. The electronic starter, broken for years, was also almost completely ejected from the frame, the.... Plastic? Partially broken. The left two knobs were relatively okay, but had scorch marks coming from the tops of the hole they are set into. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe weirdest part was the propane. See, the knob that controls the gas release was in the off position. Yet I could hear the propane leaking from somewhere, promoting me to quickly close the valve manually. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe metal frame showed a weird bubbly effect which I\u0027m going to infer was oxidation caused by the heat of the grill. The frame was also warped on the flat upper surface directly in front of the lid. It was dark, so I had difficulty seeing and confirming this next part, but it appeared as though severe damage was done to the metal tubing stuff underneath the grill. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question for all of you is what is likely to have caused this accident, how long the grill would have had to be on, and what the melting and warping points of stainless steel are. I also want to know why the explosive force was triggered as soon as we used a fire extinguisher. The extinguisher sprayed a white, sandy/dusty powder, if that helps. If pictures help, I brought some of the exploded/ melted metal in for my material science teacher to look at. I can try and upload them from my phone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know much about grilling, but we had steak the previous night, meaning the right hand side of the grill was the one my dad used. So maybe that should give an idea of the heat settings. He also turned it off, as the gas release knob showed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, all!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-03T12:18:37Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2014 12:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Dominatus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ibeinsane","CreatedById":106685,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-03T12:57:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom the description it is a little difficult to tell what happened; The best guess from in the information is as below, probably depending on how confident you are that it was turned off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption 1) Valve left turned on and the flame burned for a very long time. Causing heat deformation of sheet metalwork but more importantly caused melting of joints and/or the valve body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption 2) Leak from valve due to dirt or fault. This left a small flame burning for a long time which allowed localised braised/soldered joints of the (presumably brass) valve body to melt and cause further eventual ignition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe explosion was probably due to rapid pressure changes and thermal shock of an already unstable situation. My guess is that the valve body had melted and the 2\u0022 pool is probably the valve and/or the switch mechanism which blew out as a result of extinguishing the flame and everything cooling down. It is also possible it may have been due to a blow back through the pipes as the flame was extinguished.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMelting point for SST varies but is generally over 1500 degrees C (2700F) which is beyond what I would expect from a propane leak (you would have to burn it efficiently in a torch to get beyond 1500 degrees C.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarping can occur at much lower temperatures and is more dependant on the induced manufacturing stresses so could be as low as 200-300 degrees C. (I have seen cheaper steel trays warp in a standard domestic oven)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect the melted material is likely to be a brass alloy which will melt at under 1000 degrees C.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure how long the grill would have to be on for to cause this but I suspect an extremely long time as the temperature differences are quite small so the extent of melting and deformation you have seen would take some time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dominatus","CreatedById":76870,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-03T13:49:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you. The melted material, my teacher confirmed, is likely some sort if alloy. The brass components (or what I would assume is brass based on it\u0027s color and the cheap function it was meant to serve) was intact with some oxidation.
