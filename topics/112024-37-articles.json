This is like, the singular best thing to happen to me this entire week. You have no idea how freaking happy this makes me - and I nearly lost it to see the LDSD (big inflatable hypersonic deccelerators) parts set up for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E! So. Freaking. Awesome! All the love. Make a Patreon and I\u0027ll probably throw money at you. Though that might not be legal because this is a KSP mod, but also might be if it\u0027s not technically paying for it? I don\u0027t even know. Point is this is amazing and thank you for doing this!\n\n![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif \u0022:confused:\u0022)\n\nParts I\u0027m most happy about:\n\n1. Altair lander descent stages.\n\n2. Deep space long-duration habitat modules\n\n 2b. and their cupolas that look beautiful and aren\u0027t terribly oversized unlike the stock one\n\n3. Hypersonic deccelerators to make big packages on Mars feasible\n\n4. Orion MPCV\n\n5. SLS. Though I am actually using a custom build for the Block I core, which according to [this](https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/10/sls-trades-opening-four-rs-25s-core-stage/) will use 4 RS-25\u0027s, not 5, but will use the CMES core for block Ia and II. But the ICPS and EUS are freaking life-savers. Again, all the love. This may only be #5 but it\u0027s my current project (SLS replica of all the currently planned flights) so I\u0027m pretty freaking happy about it.\n\nWhere\u0027s the add rep button?
