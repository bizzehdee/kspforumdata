Could easily be that you\u0027ve got too much thrust for the size of your rocket. I\u0027ve had issues with craft that were overly SASed along anything other than the longitudinal axis; without looking at your craft I couldn\u0027t suggest a fix one way or the other. Any chance you could post a screenie of the craft you\u0027re trying to launch, or better yet the craft file? Also, are you playing with any mods?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T03:15:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA few things: Do these rockets have a Stayputnik core?

You might need one - tops - and generally that\u0027s to assist a rocket with a probe core that doesn\u0027t have native SAS capabilities as its main command module. Examples are the Stayputnik and OKTO2, maybe the QBE but don\u0027t quote me on that since I\u0027m just going off the top of my head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReaction Wheels, Reaction Stabilizers and Large ASAS Modules (that last one is the only one that was never renamed) all do the same thing any more; the difference nowadays is in how much torque they generate and in their size. Reaction Wheel is tiny/5 kN, Reaction Stabilizer is small/15 kN, Large ASAS is large/30kN. That change came somewhere around 0.21 IIRC, or maybe it was 0.20; I don\u0027t recall exactly. Sufficed to say that it was fixed and now there is no difference between SAS and ASAS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
