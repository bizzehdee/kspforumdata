Then we crash into the mun, throw things wildly into space, and eventually graduate to actually landing on something. (In my case I was able to land successfully on eve before I actually mastered landing on bodies without atmosphere) Then comes docking and space stations. There are two paths to go from there. Either do everything you\u0027ve already done more and more efficiently and perfectly, or try to do something that is just crazy. This thread is dedicated to your first mission that attempted to do the later. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMine was the KSS Nautilus: My goal was an interplanetary cruiser which could deliver a very large payload to laythe and then return and continue operation more or less still in one piece.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img11/8793/nautilus01.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nautilus01.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a prototype of the vessel with mainsail engines.

Unfortunately, my design for the refueling barge was pretty terrible and a nightmare for precise docking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img15/9279/nautilus05.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nautilus05.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, back on Kerbin, testing begins on the biggest payload for the Nautilus - a Laythe naval exploration craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img571/7846/nautilus06.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nautilus06.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the Nautilus finally fully kitted out - Two additional arm extensions were launched as a single vessel. Once at destination one of these will serve as a jool system exploration probe, and the other is an emergency rescue vehicle/possible return craft. Also, as you can see, two landers are connected - one for water and one for land. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img600/4976/nautilus09.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nautilus09.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe pass the mun on the way out of town:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img593/8711/nautilus10.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nautilus10.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the Nautilus has used up a bunch of fuel I move the fuel from the arms to the main body, undock the arms and then re dock the probes. I drop the axillary engines as well as a few other bits. However, the voyage is taking more fuel than I had estimated and I am starting to wish I had made some other parts removable as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img59/6720/nautilus11.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nautilus11.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther issues are starting to emerge as well - the vehicle begins to spin if I use full thrust, so I am having to burn only the three main engines at low power. The main burn takes a large part of a real-life full day and I have to let it running while I do other things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img853/8642/nautilus12.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nautilus12.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally approaching jool. If I want any chance of preserving enough fuel to make going back home an option, I am going to have to rely almost exclusively on aerobraking from here on out. My extremely low thrust to weight ratio makes this almost a necessity anyway. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img29/1267/nautilus13.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nautilus13.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost forgot to bring the solar panels back in during the aerobrake at jool. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApproaching Laythe:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img43/6764/nautilus14.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nautilus14.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to dip all the way down to about 24000 m to be captured at Laythe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img855.imageshack.us/img855/6027/nautilus15.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nautilus15.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESafely in orbit, Jeremiah gets out for a photo op.

For some reason because the craft is below the engines (side hanging engines) the game is thinking they should be delivering zero thrust. Luckily, this part is attached via a docking clamp and not a decoupler - so I am able to very carefully, undock and reconnect the Nautical on the other side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img163.imageshack.us/img163/8296/nautilus18.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nautilus18.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoodbye Nautilus:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img585.imageshack.us/img585/9218/nautilus19.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nautilus19.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding!

In theory this vehicle will return both the pilot and the commander of the naval craft back to the Nautilus. Also, on the vehicles belly rest three of the \u0022worlds smallest rover\u0022 . They are just the smallest probe base with a solar panel on each side.

I\u0027m currently having to decide if I want to try to return the entire Nautilus home (I think it has just BARELY enough fuel to make it, if I siphon the fuel off of the emergency vehicle and what is left from the system explorer) - Or do I send only a few crew back on the rescue vehicle, leaving one or two kerbals with a long wait for fresh supplies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
