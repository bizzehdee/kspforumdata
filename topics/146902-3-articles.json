Music and science have always been my earliest passions, so I still compose music, I still play my French Horn and cornet, and am teaching myself to play the piano and ukulele. When it comes to computers, I do not do as much programming as I once did because it simply does not interest me at the moment (that could change at some point in time).

Find the things you genuinely enjoy doing, then work on mastering the skills needed to get to the level you want to be. Then do them and gain your own approval. When you can take what you have done and look at it and feel satisfied with the results, then you\u0027ve succeeded. At times, it can be more challenging to satisfy your own self with your efforts than it would be to try to meet the demands or gain the approval of others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI know my graphics design is not the best and there are others on this forum that do a better job than I do, but to be honest, I am happy with my level of abilities. I love music composition and I really do not care if anyone ever likes one song I have written; I do not write for others but I write for my own enjoyment. And as far as goes, I write the story as an extension of my own imagination (there will be another chapter coming soon!) and while it is nice to have followers and I am honored by their faithfulness, I would probably still write the story if it were just me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nBe yourself, do what you love, and work on getting really good at it. Seek your own approval and let the chips fall where they may. In the end, everything you do and everything you are will not depend upon the judgment of others (unless you commit a crime and are facing a trial by jury) but between yourself - and if you believe in a superior spiritual being, between you and that deity. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nYour comment, about what good is the journey if you can\u0027t get to the end, well the end is only a small part of it.
