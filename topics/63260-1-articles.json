My idea is that we have one building which takes care of Science and Money, and other that takes care of Prestige and Money. The former we alterady have; the Research and Development facility, in which you invest science and money into new parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what about the latter?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI present you the Mission Control building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EOverview\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What is the Mission Control building? Does it work like the tracking station?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission control actually has two functions. The first, available both on sandbox and career, is that it provides the full log for each flight(Flight Logs). The second is only available on career mode; it is where you manage your space program\u0027s reception with the rest of Kerbin(Publicity).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And how exactly does it work?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, the layout will be somewhat similar to the Science Logs; a small, rectangular screen with an image of Mission Control\u0027s interior, and Gene Kerman(for Publicity window) and Bobak Kerman(for Flight Logs window) will greet you instead of Wernher von Kerman. The Flight Logs look and work pretty much similar to the Science Logs, but instead of selecting planets, you select vessels which you have flied. If you flew a craft multiple times, it will appear with tags such as (1), (2), and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Publicity window, on the other hand, has a somewhat different visual. There will be a newspaper on the lower left corner, depicting several messages which will be pre-loaded from your latest achievement. For example, if you recently landed a probe on Duna, the newspaper\u0027s headlines will be \u0022SPACE PROGRAM LANDS PROBE ON DUNA! Will the next big leap have Kerbals set their own foot on the red planet?\u0022, followed by illegible text below, and a couple of other non-significant news titles, such as \u0022TEA DISCOVERED TO MAKE KERBALS 13% LESS VULNERABLE TO BLINDNESS\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClicking on the newspaper will open the main tab regarding reputation of your space program around Kerbin. A basic summary of your reputation is also given by Gene, in the form of dialogue lines such as \u0022the population seems to mostly support the space program\u0022 when your reputation is high, \u0022I don\u0027t think many kerbals are aware of the space program\u0022 when your reputation is medium or otherwise near zero, and \u0022maybe we should please the crowd, I can almost hear a mob of angry kerbals outside\u0022 when your reputation is deep into the negatives. Of course, there will be more lines, but the main three categories are these; Respected, Neutral and Hated. On the lower right corner is the space center\u0027s bank account, as a way to manage your money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022How do we exactly manage our reputation and income?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere will be two ways to make each of the three currencies with Mission Control. I\u0027m going to describe all of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you know it, Science is gained in the current game by performing experiments with vessels out there using science-yielding parts. However, you\u0027ll now be able to invest in on-Kerbin science experiments. Basically, you exchange money for science. But of course, that WILL end up overpowered if you have insane ammounts of money, thus the science investments are expensive and won\u0027t yield much science. For reference, the exchange is in a 10 to 4 ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoney can actually be earned fairly easily. The first method is through natural donation. Based on your reputation, every time you sucessfully retrieve a craft that has went to space, whether it\u0027s to an orbit around Kerbin or to Eve\u0027s sea level, you\u0027ll recieve donation from the public, who want more exploration. The donations are higher in value depending on your reputation and location(Going to Moho will yield you a lot more money than going to Duna, and landing a manned craft yields more cash than an unmanned one). The second method involves actually asking for donation, in order to fund for deeper projects. The higher your reputation is, the more money you will get. However, if after the donation you don\u0027t build and launch a craft within a time threshold(five days is my bet), your reputation will \u003Cstrong\u003Edrastically\u003C/strong\u003E fall apart for lying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReputation, possibly the most critical currency in career, isn\u0027t actually that hard to gain. It can primarily be gained by recovering a craft that sucessfully made it through a space trip, similar to money. And if that doesn\u0027t work, you can exchange money for reputation. Pratically it works by donating to projects and foundations across Kerbin, whether they\u0027re about developing a faster-than-light warp drive or to save children from starving in poor Kerbin countries. It will boost your reputation through a 10 to 6 ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But what if I need a way to earn money AND reputation in one go?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you\u0027ll need to have a company to aid you in your space race.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EContracts and Sponsors\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn your run to conquering the Kerbin system, and eventually the entire Kerbol system, you\u0027ll need a few other companies to support you by recommending you to the public and giving you a fair share of cash. However, as in our world, no CEO in their right mind would outright give you money with nothing in reward. Thus you need to sign a contract from them, where you\u0027ll complete a task(or multiple tasks, it depends on the contract), and if you accomplish it, you earned yourself a sponsor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContracts work in a similar way to missions. There are three types of contracts: Quest, where you need to accomplish an objective, sometimes with a craft only available during said mission which you can edit; Advertsiment, where you need to advertise a part by making a rocket which stars that part; and Payload, where you need to carry an object to a designated location. The specified part is located in a new section, named \u0027Special\u0027, and is only available during that mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn example of missions from each type:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EQuest:\u003C/span\u003E The Kerbin Global News Center\u0027s satellite has malfunctioned, and they need a new satellite in an equatorial orbit between 125km and 150km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EAdvertsiment:\u003C/span\u003E C7 Aerospace and Rockomax Conglomerate have just announced their new R.A.P.I.E.R.
