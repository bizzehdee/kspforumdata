But it requires first getting to the moon. Which seems to be a waste. There are other paths that can be much more efficient. Straight out from Kerbin but would need a large boost in dv on the last orbit before escape. What is generally the best way? Using the Mun for a sling shot doesn\u0027t appear to be the best way. Sure it saves a bit on Kerbin escape, but then you have to add a ton of dv (usually about 2500 or so) after. Going straight from low Kerbin orbit seems to work better but requires a quick and fast burn to stay on course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust want to know your way, why it\u0027s best. Thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pulstar","CreatedById":57193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T19:43:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDue to the oberth effect burning from a Low Kerbin Orbit is definitely the most efficient way. As you mentioned the problem is that you need lots of thrust but there is a simple solution, you do multiple burns at the periapsis which will form where you burned. Still, depending on where you want to get to you may not have enough time to finish that. Then I recommend doing it the lazy and inefficient approach of getting into a bare-minimum solar orbit outside of kerbin\u0027s SoI and planning a transfer burn from there, at the very least those burns tend to be more accurate so you waste less time saving/reloading.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crush","CreatedById":59094,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T19:51:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen going to the outer planets like Jool, doing a gravity-assist around Duna can save some fuel. But while this might even save mission-time, it costs you real-world time, because a gravity-assist maneuver takes a lot of time to plan and execute.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jason Patterson","CreatedById":44388,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T23:12:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs it safe to assume you know about launch windows and the like? \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz/\u003C/a\u003E gives reasonably good ejection and phase angles for making interplanetary burns. It\u0027s definitely cheapest to make your burn from LKO. It ought to be possible to set up a gravity assist past the Mun that gets you there, but getting the launch window right so that the minimal amount of delta-v gained from your Mun flyby actually helps you is tough. A gravity assist from another planet is also possible, but those kinds of things almost never happen to line up right and you wind up wasting more fuel getting there in the long run.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bothersome","CreatedById":66869,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T01:15:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys, Wonderful answers you gave me. I had suspected the same but was unsure if there were a more efficient method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECatching a moon acceleration would be tricky on the timing. I usually don\u0027t have that kind of dedication to it. Right now I\u0027m setting up a test burn from the very edge of Kerbin SOI (still an orbit but just barely). Then I\u0027m gonna race in and sling away. I set my apoapsis toward the sun so that when I race in at Kerbin, I hope to sling out at about 90 degrees or more to the east (the direction Kerbin is traveling around the sun). If I sling back inward to the sun a little, it will be ok. It just shortens my mission time a bit by not taking such a long way around the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, I\u0027m \u0022trying\u0022 to do this with Ion engines on a 70 ton craft (car and lander). I figure I\u0027ll have to start the \u0022burn\u0022 five hours or so before periapsis. Since I won\u0027t have the time to burn at periapsis. My total burn time (Xenon Gas) on the craft is 9.6 hours. I\u0027ve estimated I\u0027d only need 6.5 to 7 hours worth to make the one-way trip. I used a regular pusher ship with nukes to get it to highest Kerbin apoapsis. It\u0027s still on the way up btw. So I have yet to try the manuever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the answers guys.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
