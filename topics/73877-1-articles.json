Your initial orbit after capture doesn\u0027t have to be too tidy, as that will come as you finalise your rendezvous. The first thing I do, while my initial orbit is still quite large, is to match the inclination with my target orbit at either the ascending or descending node. Once I have done that, I then adjust my orbit whilst at the apoapsis, so that my periapsis matches the altitude of my target orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the orbit at this stage is very elliptical, I will adjust it so that the apoapsis comes down a bit, but not as far as my target orbit. By leaving your incoming ship with a bigger orbit than your target ship, the target ship will eventually catch you up. Unfortunately, if the target ship is just ahead of you, it could take a few orbits to go round and come up on you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring this process you will see the encounter markers moving on each orbit. When they get reasonably close, which should be at your periapsis, you can make a final adjustment to make the encounter as close as possible. At periapsis if the markers showing your encounter on the next orbit has your target ship close, but behind you, burn prograde slowly until the encounter markers are as close as you can get them. Conversely, if the markers show your target ship slightly ahead on the next orbit, burn retrograde slowly to close the gap. Either way, you should be able to fine tune the encounter to less than 5km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext time you come round, when your ships are very close to your closest approach, make sure your navball is in target mode and burn retrograde to kill your relative velocity. After this, it should be a standard approach and dock.

You burn appropriately to put your apoapsis or periapsis at the target\u0027s altitude, then burn again when you get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe additional degree of difficulty comes from the fact that a craft has no sphere of influence to assist you with the capture. This also explains why you get two closest approach markers, whereas with a planet or moon intercept you only get one: With a planet or moon intercept the intercept only happens if you enter the SOI, which generally only happens once. With a craft intercept your orbit will probably cross its orbit twice (unless you burn absolutely perfectly), so you have two closest approaches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, so we set up our burn to the intercept point (either one is fine). When we get there what we want to do is match our orbit to the target\u0027s orbit. So again, this means burning prograde or retrograde (ignoring plane change corrections). It\u0027s just the same procedure to circularize at a higher or lower orbit without worrying about targets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you think of it in terms of \u0022target relative velocity\u0022 (which is what the navball will show when you have a target set), here\u0027s what is happening at the closest approach in the case of intercepting a target that is higher than us. When we get to our apoapsis (at target altitude) our tangential velocity will be very slow compared to the target. So our target relative velocity will be high. When we burn to zero out target relative velocity it means (in this case) that we are burning prograde relative to our own orbit... which has the effect of circularizing at the target orbit altitude!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut once we match orbits with the target, we will still only be as close as our closest approach. So now we perform a few small burns to close that gap. This basically means pointing directly at the target and accelerating. Then turning around and decelerating when we get close, or when we start veering away from it. Depending on how far away you start you may need to repeat this process a few times, zig-zagging your way to the target.

When your navball is in target mode (click the little screen on the top to cycle between orbit, surface and target) the pink markers show your direction to the target and the yellow ones show your motion relative to it. When your close, fire at the retrograde marker until you get to 0 m/s, then fire at the circular pink marker. That will make you move towards your target, although if you\u0027re far away you\u0027ll have to make a lot of corrections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Maneuver nodes are your friend.

Getting to the same place at the same time as the target is done (at least by me), using maneuver nodes and the \u0022intercept\u0022 markers. When you do get near to your target, you burn at the retrograde marker (as mentioned above) to zero out your velocity. When your velocity is zeroed out, you can burn towards your target the way Scott describes in his videos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEveryone always seems to recommend getting into the same orbits, which I find bizarre. For example, If I\u0027m going to rendezvous with a space station in a 150 km orbit, I \u003Cstrong\u003Ewon\u0027t\u003C/strong\u003E go directly into a 150 km orbit. I\u0027ll more likely go into a circular orbit between 80 and 120 km. I will match inclination, but by staying in a different orbit, it takes less time to find a node that will allow me to get an intercept with my target. It\u0027s just a different way of making the rendezvous approach. If you think of the burn as a Hohmann transfer, it makes more sense, to me, to make the burn from a separate orbit (because you don\u0027t perform Hohmann transfers between bodies in the \u003Cem\u003Esame\u003C/em\u003E orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest of luck, keep practicing, you\u0027ll get it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-16T12:10:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2014 12:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by KasperVld\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"O-Doc","CreatedById":95453,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-02T18:48:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WeirdCulture\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WeirdCulture\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eafter a while I all ways forget this and getting bad approaches\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EAfter a whie you can go pro and start combining steps into your burns. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKashua outlined the basic step. follow these and you can\u0027t go wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Depending on your phasing orbit it can take a while to get a good intercept and I usually ran out of patience before finding it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelhester07","CreatedById":96470,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-02T19:36:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mr Shifty\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mr Shifty\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis. Every time you zero out your velocity and then burn towards the target again, you have to flip your vessel 180 degrees twice. Much easier to simply slow down as you approach and nudge the velocity vectors so that you intercept.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither that or you load up with enough RCS thrusters that the TWR off the RCS is greater than your main engines (i have a few ships like this). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome tips I\u0027ll cover that may have been missed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Practice the \u0022advanced\u0022 way of nudging your retrograde to the other side of the target\u0027s retrograde drift.

If your target has a high part count that slows your computer down... drop your target speed to below 50m/s before you get closer than 2.3km. You may otherwise miss your target while trying to decelerate on a low framerate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Did you ever plan a maneuver to go to Mun? Minmus? Duna? While doing so did you notice the little white notches on the orbit path of your target? The one on top is where you\u0027ll be when you cross the target\u0027s orbit path. The one on the bottom is where the target will be. When these line up you\u0027ll get an intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Did you notice the little green notches labled \u0022AN\u0022 and \u0022DN\u0022? These are where your orbit\u0027s plane intersects with the target\u0027s plane. If you thrust \u0022south\u0022 at AN and \u0022north\u0022 at DN you can match your orbit plane to your target\u0027s plane. This makes it a LOT easier to intercept the target. Plan burns accordingly. The quotes are there because the direction for \u0022north\u0022 and \u0022south\u0022 may vary. Plan the maneuver with the purple nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. The smaller the object you\u0027re orbiting the easier it is to rendezvous with something else orbiting it. If you can\u0027t get a rendezvous in low kerbin orbit try it over the Mun instead. Or over Minmus. The low orbit speeds make it super easy to Rendezvous with something there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. When docking two ships with a single docking point control each ship from the docking point and turn them to point at each other\u0027s prograde target (purple) vector.
