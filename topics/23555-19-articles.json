The idea was to EVA over with one of those dismountable ports, then EVA back again with the cable (because for some reason you can\u0027t pre-attach the port to the cable like you can the hook and magnet). The dismountable ports (I had 2 of them, just in case) and the winch itself were all within reach from the capsule hatch as shown here, so I could grab them before letting go of the ladder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TErX0Ly.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TErX0Ly.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis all works absolutely perfectly unless you commit an operator error. That error is to start the EVA, put one of the ports on your back, and then accidentally end the EVA by hitting F when you really meant to hit SPACE to let go of the ladder. This totally hoses the whole system. When you go back outside to try again, you discover the following things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The port you had on your back is gone, eaten by the kraken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. While you can put the 2nd port on your back (that\u0027s why there\u0027s 2), it\u0027s totally dead once you do so. H has no effect and it won\u0027t even give you a right-click menu. It\u0027s like you don\u0027t have a port at all, even though graphically it shows up on your back plain as day.
