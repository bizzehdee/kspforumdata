This is a rational, normal conclusion that many people would have made. However, BERTY\u0027s manipulation of the crew, especially Jebediah, is detrimental to their success. BERTY claims that he is only acting in Kerbalkind\u0027s best interest, but he\u0027s flinging them at planets and moons like cow patties (Sorry, sorry...). If he had a genuine interest in Kerbals, he would have told at least Jeb or Bill the mission and made it explicitly clear that this was a mission with a high chance of failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this is where BERTY fails, people. He fails to recognize that he is just a machine, built to SERVE the crew, not carry out his own agenda.

He\u0027s just a computer, a mess of capacitors and processors. A computer will never understand the moral decisions that go on in every day life, much less over a period of time. This is why he couldn\u0027t predict Jeb up to a point; There are just too many variables, too many ways a Kerbal with EMOTIONS can act.

But he didn\u0027t notice how the kerbals behave after the death of another one, and didn\u0027t successfully calm Jeb down because he doesn\u0027t know how to manage these feelings because he has no empathy because he has no feelings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb sees the kerbal side of this question, affected by his emotions, which BERTY can\u0027t comprehend at the time. He\u0027s a sentient being, so it makes more sense from the view of a kerbal or human to say what he says instead of what BERTY does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConcerning the visit to Bill and Genanand on Bop, Jeb wins. Who the hell cares about just a few more fuel usage when your friend is dying?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the downfall of the USK and the division of the world in countries, I totally agree with BERTY. Everyone has the right to know everything. Plus, this is just a silly greed, only to say \u0022i\u0027m better than you\u0022 and do whatever you want. Not letting anyone know anything about the alien technology only slows kerbality down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yeah, thats my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, off this topic...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECZO, YOU\u0027RE FREAKIN AWESOME!!!! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour story is just amazing, I went through it almost unstoppably and lurked a bit after I finished in chapter 50, just waiting for 51 and 52.
