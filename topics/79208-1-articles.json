And what better place to rack up the Funds and Reputation than the Joolian system? Launching a comprehensive mission there to visit the surfaces of all the moons, leave a probe in orbit around each, and get some good data on Jool\u0027s atmosphere can\u0027t possibly be inexpensive, can it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/joolific.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022joolific.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E That depends on your definition of \u0022inexpensive\u0022, I suppose! Behold the Joolific, on its way out from Kerbin to Jool. 2 Kerbin years from now, it will arrive at the green planet with its massive payload of 5 full-fledged lander craft, 1 sacrificial Jool science probe, and 6 orbital satellites. And it cost just shy of 350,000 Funds to launch, a pittance for such a massive undertaking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blu3wolf","CreatedById":107912,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T19:44:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt seems pretty kerbally... needs more parts hanging off the sides IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T19:50:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022blu3wolf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022blu3wolf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt seems pretty kerbally... needs more parts hanging off the sides IMO.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, it kinda couldn\u0027t because this is what it looked like before the launch boosters were separated:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/joolific2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022joolific2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, the whole thing got into orbit with a pair of massive side-mounted fuel tanks. \u003Cem\u003EThat\u003C/em\u003E is a freaking Kerbal launch stage right there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
