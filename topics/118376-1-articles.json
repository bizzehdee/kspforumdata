I\u0027m thinking about a solid fueled engine that is meant to be used for injection burns, so is there any feasibility in such an engine? If there is, what would it look like? If it\u0027s not feasible, how close can you get to a proper vacuum SRB with a good ISP?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T14:34:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps something like ATK\u0027s \u003Cem\u003EStar\u003C/em\u003E upper stage motors?
