But I\u0027d probably prefer if editor was not changing the symmetry automatically and instead refused to place the part until I choose compatible symmetry. Perhaps allowing me to use subsymmetries, such as x2 or x3 on x6. Or to even allow me to break group already placed in higher order symmetry to several lower order group, such as x8 into two x4.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-18T11:41:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suggest that the whole \u0022auto symmetry\u0022 thing be sent to the pits of hell where it belongs.
