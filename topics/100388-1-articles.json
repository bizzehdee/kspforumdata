Ever since Robbaz back in 2014 rescued Bob from sea-level (and this is where I need to go for unrelated reasons), I\u0027ve always wondered, \u0022What\u0027s the best way to do this?\u0022 So what is the best way for an Eve lander? Asprages? Tall? Wide? Remember, this is a sea-level voyage I\u0027m talking about.![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T02:06:47Z","Content":"May I direct your attention to a thread solely devoted to your question. [The Eve Rocks Challenge](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/95642-The-Eve-Rocks-Challenge). You will almost certainly need asparagus. Wide does not increase your drag (until the next release). Tall makes it harder to land (you need a flatter landing site).\n\nHope this helps.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T03:43:19Z","Content":"You can also try a aircraft design, ive made a 3 stage plane that took off from eve and got in orbit (was left with under 5 RCS for that one, needed to circularize with my docking fuel ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)). This was from a very high spot, so i wouldnt consider it super badass mode, landed on a somewhat flatish zone atop a mountain.\n\nAnyways, planes aside, probably heavy asparagus (and at the bare minimum a very wide landing base, you are free to ditch that once you take off). Aerospikes, despite their very high mass, are actually rather nice here as they are the only engine that works relatively well in atmo as thick as eve\u0027s."}]}
