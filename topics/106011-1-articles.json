How does a NEW player know what the parts he is asked to test do ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am no particular fan of linear progression (such as historical milestone objectives) but in our case I think it would have been better from the start, than the system we have now. Of course this forum would surely be asking to get \u0022automatically produced (magically)awesome missions\u0022 but at least we wouldn\u0027t face the frustration of impossible contract, meaningless tests, non-rewarding contracts and the feeling to grind continuously since the few missions there would have would \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ehopefully\u003C/span\u003E be tailored by intelligent game-designer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut enough badmouthing, this isn\u0027t sooooo bad. The framework is good, the game can keep track of (now) multi-step complex missions or \u0022program\u0022 all with a relative freedom when the contract-generator isn\u0027t being a smartass.
