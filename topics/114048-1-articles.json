Even heat shields won\u0027t save you from that as the ablator cannot carry heat away fast enough.

You have leveled your ksp skillz to 20, you want launch/recovery on Kerbin to increase to level 20. Doesn\u0027t work that way. Kerbin is Kerbin. You learn to launch and land, that\u0027s it. Kerbin is home, your start loc and reentry will almost always be easier than launch.\n\nGet away from Kerbin. Go set up a permanent duna or laythe colony. Dres asteroid mining facility.
