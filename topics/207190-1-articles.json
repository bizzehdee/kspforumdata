With the kids in mind I\u0027m trying to simplify things as much as possible in terms of getting things set up in-flight with minimal adjustment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen using a 3D Mouse in Kerbal (which is actually natively supported) the default state for the device is to control the camera so that you can fly the camera around your craft instead of using the mouse to control it. By hitting Scroll Lock you can toggle the control state to instead control the craft itself, this gives you full control of not only the craft\u0027s orientation, but also it\u0027s translation using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue I have is that the default state is set to control the camera when loading up KSP. I\u0027m trying to keep things simple for the kids so that they don\u0027t have to know a certain procedure just to get the hardware working correctly. I\u0027ve actually completely nullified the camera control with the 3D Mouse so kids don\u0027t send the camera flying all over the place, but it also makes it seem like the controller doesn\u0027t do anything until Scroll Lock is hit. So is there any way to invert the default state, so that Flight Control is what the game starts with instead of Camera Control? I haven\u0027t seen anything for it in the game configs, but thought I\u0027d take a long shot and ask here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny assistance would be appreciated, thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
