I\u0027m not a boat guy, but that stage should be back at KSC within twelve hours (assuming a 23kt speed.) If Space X is planing to make them rapidly reusable, this will kill two birds with one stone. \u003Cp\u003EMaybe they could bypass the rig altogether if they could either find a way to stabilize a ship or make the rocket respond to the ship\u0027s pitch and roll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy do all this when they can just return to launch site?
