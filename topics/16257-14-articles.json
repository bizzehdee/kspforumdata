I am working on simulating a constellation run and I need three of the seven stages to be left empty for a long duration including launch.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also tried this, I wanted an RC rescue ship, but I think this isn\u0027t currently possible. As soon as you add a crewable pod the requirement for crew takes over. I just had one idea, not tried it thou. Make a main RC vessel and then dock (using \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/20503-Plugin-Part-0-16-Erkle-Mods-Warp-Capable-Docking-Clamp-v0-4-released?p=278443\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post278443\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EErkle64 docking mod\u003C/a\u003E) a smaller crewable vessel to it.

It turned out to be a bit more complicated than the simple fix we theorized ages ago. Actually I\u0027d relegated it back into the realm of the impossible, but reading the chatter in the thread motivated me to give it another try.\u003Cbr\u003ENow you can remote control crewable vessels, even when they don\u0027t have any crew (for example an empty pod, crewtank or DEMV rover)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EHopefully fixed compatability with axis controls for throttle.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EI Don\u0027t currently have a way to test this, but I wrote a bit of code that hopefully restores axis compatability to RemoteTech vessels.
