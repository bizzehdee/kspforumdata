Trouble is, whenever I put the cargo bay on, it attaches via the weaker size 2 node instead of the size 3 node and lets my MP tank and cockpit wobble around like a wet fish in space and in extreme cases, just fall apart when I release the launch tower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only way I can see around this is attaching the cargo bay radially (via EditorExtensions), attaching something to the end node (as it defaults to the cargo bay node), attaching the cargo bay inline using the free size 3 node, removing the temporary part and then building the payload. I haven\u0027t tried that, but if that doesn\u0027t work then I\u0027m out of ideas. How can I make make the cargo bays attach via the size 3 node without a time-consuming and annoying workaround? Am I missing something here? Probably, but I\u0027d love to know what - this is frustrating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SP\u002B parts had a similar issue, but the nodes were in slightly different positions, you could tell if you\u0027d attached it correctly because the fuselage would line up. The Mk3 though, the nodes are in the same place so.. yeah.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(also, I found that the Mk3 parts do have the same lifting body hack that the Mk2 parts use, but it\u0027s commented out. Anyone know why?)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheMoonRover","CreatedById":136199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-23T20:06:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I\u0027ve understood you correctly, you could first attach the cargo bay to the part in front, build the payload from the node at the back, then rotate the entire cargo bay so it attaches with the other end (so that the payload is at the front). If you want the payload at the back, just move it to the back again. Either way that\u0027s slightly less faffing about. If you don\u0027t want your payload inline, you can do the same with a random part, which would be just as good/bad as your method, but without needing a mod. Although judging by your signature, that last bit wouldn\u0027t matter to you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy guess: they wrote a test config for the first Mk3 part including the lifting body thing, decided it might not be such a good idea (Mk3 isn\u0027t winglike at all, whereas with Mk2 it kind of makes sense), so commented it out in case they changed their minds. They didn\u0027t, so its still commented out. They then copied that config and edited it for all the other Mk3 parts. I\u0027m probably totally wrong, but what\u0027s wrong with a bit of speculation?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Or you could edit the node position in the config file.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-23T20:12:27Z\u0022 title=\u002201/23/2015 08:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheMoonRover\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
