I never used the 0.151 version but I\u0027ll download it now and see if there issue is present there too.\n\nEdit: Tried v0.151 there is still flickering but it is slightly different. If only occurs at certain camera angles and it flickers in checkered patterns. There\u0027s a lot different between the two so I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s the same issue or something else. I tired openGL mode and the issue is gone. Maybe something to do with directx 12 and windows 10?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-20T01:02:36Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2015 01:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mreadshaw**"},{"CreatedByName":"blackrack","CreatedById":104258,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T09:20:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Aww, that is great news!

I fixed the black sky bug (made worse on planets other than kerbin for some reason) and multiplanet support seems to be going well. There will be a short 1-2s \u0022loading\u0022 time (similar to the one when you switch fullscreen mode) when approaching a planet but it\u0027s not too bad, there will be however a memory spike of about 250-300mb which may just crash your game unexpectedly, that same memory will be freed when you get far away from the planet and the atmosphere unloads. Mapview will only show effects on whichever planet is currently active to avoid memory problems.\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m working on making the celestial objects and the stars actually scatter through the atmosphere instead of just being displayed \u0022behind\u0022 it, this shouldn\u0027t make much of a difference for most of the planets but looking at Jool from Laythe should become completely spectacular, we\u0027ll see how it goes.\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m also working on making the atmosphere height adjustable directly ingame, and on eliminating the artifacts/problems that appear when it\u0027s set to too high.\n\u003E \n\u003E Overall it\u0027s going good but slow because of real-life.\n\nA lot of good news!!\n\nTake the time you need."},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T04:38:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve not been using scatterer for a long time, so I cant really answer that.

In the meantime I\u0027ve sort of cheated it away by messing with the nodes (?) so that at 70000m the post-processing alpha is at 0 so that it isn\u0027t noticeable in orbit. Then I\u0027ve added the astronomer\u0027s atmospheric scattering layer for eve in so that you still get a nice orbital and map view. It works pretty well visually but it has required using the x64 hack so not the best (if you just used the scattering layer without clouds you\u0027d be fine, but who wants no clouds)."},{"CreatedByName":"blackrack","CreatedById":104258,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T17:37:12Z","Content":"\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
