It will stretch, compress and twist - even snap - depending on what and how strong a force is applied to it. So whilst struts do add rigidity to the connection of two parts, how much rigidity depends on how you strut, and how many struts you apply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance if you got two 2.5m tanks connected through two 1.25m docking ports, having 4 struts that just go straight up/down from the one tank to the other won\u0027t be very efficient, and still cause considerable flexibility in the connection if under stress. Configure those same four struts into two X\u0027es or V\u0027es, one on either side, and you\u0027ll get a very rigid connection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: like so:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ztn7FGt.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ztn7FGt.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and the struts will disappear if you decouple or undock the connection the struts support.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-07T07:09:02Z\u0022 title=\u002212/07/2014 07:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Zylark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-07T07:19:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo basically they are hard structures that are rigid and can withstand compression?
