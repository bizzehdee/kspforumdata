It is strange that this \u0022cut\u0022 is so sharp. between the two rendering mode.\n\nIf i want exactly the near plane rendering of shadow in the second plane.

I can sit on the launchpad/runway/orbit and it\u0027s fine.  If i go back to the tracking station then back to the craft, the glitch is gone.  It\u0027s only after throttling it up that it breaks like that.  Sometimes it even goes away after landing and throttling down, without a scene change.\n\nOutput Log \n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/8ze8gaf0io22f0l/output_log.txt?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8ze8gaf0io22f0l/output_log.txt?dl=0)  \n\nModlist as follows.  \n\nSpoiler\n\nKSP: 1.2.2 (Win64) - Unity: 5.4.0p4 - OS: Windows 10  (10.0.0) 64bit  \n\n000\\_AT\\_Utils - 1.4.2  \n\nToolbar - 1.7.13  \n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Tools - 0.8.18  \n\nAllYAllContinued - 0.10.2  \n\nB9 Animation Modules - 1.0.5  \n\nB9 Part Switch - 1.7.1  \n\nB9 Aerospace - 6.3.1  \n\nB9 Aerospace - 6.3.1  \n\nB9 Aerospace Procedural Parts - 0.40.11  \n\nBon Voyage - 0.12  \n\nCactEye Telescopes - 1.2.2.11  \n\nChatterer - 0.9.92.1622  \n\nCIT\\_Util - 1.3  \n\nBAM - 1.2  \n\nCollisionFX - 4.0  \n\nCommunity Category Kit - 1.2.2  \n\nCommunity Resource Pack - 0.6.6  \n\nCommunityTechTree - 3.0.3  \n\nConnected Living Space - 1.2.4.2  \n\nContract Configurator - 1.22.2  \n\nContract Pack: Clever Sats - 1.4  \n\nContract Pack: Exploration Plus - 1.0.1  \n\nContract Pack: Field Research - 1.2  \n\nContract Pack: Kerbal Academy - 1.1.7  \n\nContract Pack: Bases and Stations - 3.6.1  \n\nRover Missions - 0.1.7  \n\nContract Pack: Unmanned Contracts - 0.3.27  \n\nContract Pack: Tourism Plus - 1.5.2  \n\nContract Reward Modifier - 1.0.2.4  \n\nCorrectCOL - 1.5.1  \n\nCrowd Sourced Science - 4.0.1  \n\nCustom Asteroids - 1.4.1  \n\nCustomBarnKit - 1.1.12  \n\nDestructionEffects - 1.4  \n\nDistantObjectEnhancement - 1.8.1  \n\nDMagic Orbital Science - 1.3.0.8  \n\nCapCom Mission Control On The Go - 1.0.2.5  \n\nContract Parser - 1.0.5  \n\nContracts Window Plus - 1.0.7.3  \n\nProgress Parser - 1.0.6  \n\nDynamic Deflection - 1.2.2.2  \n\nEasy Vessel Switch - 1.2  \n\nEditorExtensionsRedux - 3.3.12  \n\nEVA Struts - 1.0.3  \n\nEVA Transfer - 1.0.6  \n\nExtraplanetary Launchpads - 5.7.2  \n\nFirespitter - 7.5.1  \n\nFlexible Docking - 1.0.4  \n\nFMRS (Flight Manager For Reusable Stages) - 1.2.4  \n\nGroundConstruction - 1.1.2.1  \n\nImpact - 1.5.1  \n\nJanitorsCloset - 0.2.19  \n\nJSIAdvTransparentPods - 0.1.13  \n\nRasterPropMonitor - 0.28  \n\nKerbal Attachment System - 0.6.2  \n\nKerbal Engineer Redux - 1.1.2.8  \n\nKerbal Joint Reinforcement - 3.3.1  \n\nKerbalLaunchFailure - 0.4.3  \n\nKerbal Inventory System - 1.4.4  \n\nKSP-AVC Plugin - 1.1.6.2  \n\nKWRocketryRedux - 3.1.2  \n\nInfernal Robots - 2.0.10  \n\nModularFlightIntegrator - 1.2.4  \n\nNavBallDockingAlignmentIndicatorCE - 1.0.1.1  \n\nNearFutureConstruction - 0.7.6  \n\nNearFutureElectrical - 0.8.7  \n\nNearFuturePropulsion - 0.8.7  \n\nNearFutureSolar - 0.7.2  \n\nNearFutureSpacecraft - 0.6.3  \n\nFinal Frontier - 1.2.7.3080  \n\nOuter Planets Mod - 2.0  \n\nPlanetShine - 0.2.5.2  \n\nPoodsOPMVO - 0.3.4  \n\nQuickBrake - 1.3.2  \n\nQuickHide - 3.2.2  \n\nRadio Free Kerbin - 1.2  \n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E Build Aid - 0.9.1  \n\nRealChute - 1.4.3  \n\nRealPlume - Stock - 0.11.4  \n\nRecovery Controller - 0.0.1  \n\nReentryParticleEffect - 1.2.0.1  \n\nDeepFreeze Continued... - 0.23.4  \n\nRetractableLiftingSurface - 0.1.3  \n\nSafeChute - 2.1.6  \n\nSCANsat - 1.1.6.11  \n\nScience Relay - 1.0.3.1  \n\nSETI-ProbeParts - 1.2.2.1  \n\nSigma Binary - 1.6.2  \n\nSmartActuation - 1.0.1.1  \n\nSmartParts - 1.9.5.1  \n\nStageRecovery - 1.7.1  \n\nStationPartsExpansion - 0.4.3  \n\nStationScienceContinued - 2.2.1  \n\nStock Visual Enhancements - 1.2.2  \n\nStrategia - 1.5  \n\nStock Visual Terrain - 2.0.4  \n\nTAC Fuel Balancer - 2.12  \n\nTarsierSpaceTechnology - 6.6.1  \n\nTimeControl - 2.5  \n\nToadicusToolsContinued - 0.22  \n\nTooManyOrbits - 1.1  \n\nTrajectories - 1.6.6  \n\nKerbal Alarm Clock - 3.8.4  \n\nAlternate Resource Panel - 2.9.1  \n\nTransfer Window Planner - 1.6.1  \n\nTweakableEverything - 0.1.19.2  \n\nTweakScale - 2.3.4  \n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Core - 0.3.10  \n\nAsteroid Recycling Tech - 0.9.9  \n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Exploration Pack - 0.7.4  \n\nFreight Transport Tech - 0.6.8  \n\nKarbonite - 0.8.8  \n\nKonstruction - 0.1.12  \n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS - 0.5.24  \n\nMalemute Rover - 0.2.8  \n\nMKS - 0.50.18  \n\nUniversal Storage - 1.2.2  \n\nUnmanned before Manned - 1.2.2.1  \n\nUnmanned before Manned - Challenge - 1.2.2.2  \n\nVenStockRevamp - 1.9.5  \n\nWaypoint Manager - 2.6.2  \n\nWildBlueTools - 1.19  \n\nKerbal Actuators - 1.0.3  \n\nBuffalo - 2.0.8  \n\nPathfinder - 1.8.8  \n\n[x] Science! - 5.6"},{"CreatedByName":"Galileo","CreatedById":150430,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-15T23:07:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 43 minutes ago, Xiyn said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hello.
