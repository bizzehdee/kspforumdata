I\u0027m sure this has already been mentioned, but i\u0027m not reading through another 45 pages to check. What I have noticed with the new ASAS is that, while it will stop a ship from turning/rotating after manual input, it seems not to cancel out the effects of other forces. For example, if I have a spaceplane and I hit W for a second, it will cancel out the movement created from that input. However, because the tail fin puts the CoM ever so slightly out of line with the CoT, the ship experiences spin under acceleration. Rotation from sources like this, such as wobbling, drag, lift(or lack thereof), or unaligned CoMs and CoTs will not be stopped, which is a major problem. Another example of this would be that any deviations of course that occur when rolling/banking in the atmosphere, such as the nose dipping towards the ground, will not be stopped as they are not directly caused by manual input. Of course, I could be completely wrong, but this seems to be case in my game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dlmarti","CreatedById":70037,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T00:53:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Giggleplex777\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Giggleplex777\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETBH, I actually just want the old ASAS back.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept for docking, I would agree.
