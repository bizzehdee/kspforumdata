Aeronautics has always been an avid interest of mine, and this game was quite the welcome addition to my collection. The subforum description says ask for tips, so I will.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow the [FLUFFY BUNNIES] do I get a station really going? I did get a module in orbit with a sputnick head, 2 fuselage sections, 4 clamp-o-trons, gas tanks and jets for rcs, and both nuke and solar energy. I then changed it from probe to station. I have two lift vehicles that seem to work fine, but I am having trouble matching orbits with the station. Hell, I\u0027m having trouble just getting on the right trajectory to go the same way as the station! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd let\u0027s assume I successfully do this. How do I attach new sections to build a station? Do I have to dock from the side? or do I make some weird design rocket with the control unit off to the side, allowing end on docking?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did a search for info on this, but none of the forum posts that resulted were helpful. Also, none of the tutorials I have found on line seem to cover this.

I like to build a station part kind of upside-down, with a docking ring at the nose, and the control module toward the back, with the flight parts attached by ejectable links. That way you\u0027re flying straight ahead for docking, and after attaching the piece, you can throw away everything but the working parts. But there are different approaches.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"X_DARTH_GIZMO_X","CreatedById":57740,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T23:31:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome! hope you find the game Amazing. and the community Welcoming.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
