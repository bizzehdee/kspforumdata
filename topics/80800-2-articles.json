A better question would be to see which mods currently use Hydrogen and have signed up, and it looks like Universal Storage is the one I have. But for the sake of argument, let\u0027s say a new mod came on board that allowed the harvesting of, say, Potassium. Perhaps in relation to the Banana For Scale mod. If that modder said \u0027hey, I want to be part of the CRP and here\u0027s my new resource, and I will at the same time not stomp over other stuff\u0027 then rock on. If, later, someone making the RealWorldBananas mod feels that the Banana For Scale mod has it all wrong, and makes their own mod, I\u0027m not going to even try to stop them. But it may cause people to have issues with their mod, at which point I\u0027d say \u0027sorry, we\u0027re not compatible with RealWorldBananas\u0027, and KSP will just do what it does today... it takes the first one it finds without erroring out, and people get confused. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the same point, if someone said \u0027Hey, here are twenty new resources... oh, but I have no mod to back it up\u0027 I would say \u0027thank you, come see me when you have a release thread\u0027.

If someone were to say \u0027Hey, mod X also uses Hydrogen and has done so for decades\u0027 then we\u0027re in a point where we ask folks why they use the units they do and try to sort it out, but in the end there will only ever be one Hydrogen in CRP. So someone is going to be incompatible. Again, same issue we have today.

Both for gameplay and technical under-the-hood stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt concerns resource abundance within a given domain during extraction and later storage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf on Kerbin there are present Karbonite and Metal, there is a question of how to discern what is extracted and utilized. If player deployes a drill that removes a material from surface of lithosphere, then that material needs to be refined into target resources Karbonite and Metal. But, if there is a container that is filled with this raw material which is then transported to say Mun and converted, there is no underlying mechanism that will remember what that raw material really contains. You use drill from one pack that mines Ore for Metal and Silica, and a refinery/extractor from other pack that produces Karbonite from that same Ore. This is a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could solve this by letting part/plugin pack authors solve this on their own, but that could make a \u0022bad advertisement\u0022 not only for their addons but for yours too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne way to do this without getting yourself too much involved is to define the following.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) All resources are extracted directly in their usable form (ie drill and converter in one) OR,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Refining resources requires that raw resource has a \u0022memory\u0022 of how much of each final resource is present so it can be to be correctly refined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) CRP defines three basic resources from which everything else is refined : Ore, Liquid and Gas. Each is a compound resource which a pack author can choose to use in their addon to make it more real or skip that altogether and opt for direct extraction. This should be a mandatory minimum on which all other resources rely on, it is always present.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) When extraction takes place, all available resources are extracted in RATIOS of total volume available. If a drill removes 40 Ore per minute, and Karbonite and Metal are present in concetrations of K=15% and M=10%, then you get 40 x 0.15 = 6 Karbonite per minute and 40 x 0.10 = 4 Metal per minute. Ratios are determined by combining abundance of all materials for a given place. This can present a problem if a resource is overabundant to a point that a ratio is made worse for all other resources, especially when a new resource is introduced in game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) All resources need to be \u0022registered\u0022 with CRP separately from addons that utilize them. Take Kethane for example. If player has Kethane and Extraplanetary Launchpads, and decides later to replace Kethane with some other resource pack, he/she will effectively remove all underlying resource structure required to keep EL working. So, resources that are currently used anywhere in game must be tracked and presented to player, thus enabling a proper removal of part addons without crippling any other addons relying on a same resource.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) All parts which directly interact with resource domains (ohh, what an expert wording ! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E i kill me sometimes) should follow this guideline : Ore is extracted with Drill, Liquid with Pump and Gas with Intake. Shapes and sizes are arbitrary ofcourse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) All resource extraction parts should either make target resource as their output or leave it to player which resource is extracted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) All resource extraction and refinery parts should respect resource ratios and extract a corresponding amount per unit of time from their respective sources, as described in item 4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) All resource containers that hold Ore, should accept Ore resource from CRP itself, the only resource that is guaranteed to hold target resources in proper ratios. If a resource container holds Ore from several domains (planets, moons, asteroids), container will have a total Ore amount and Ore itself will contain target resources in amounts as they are extracted with Drills. Same for Liquid and Gas containers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10) If new target resource is introduced later in game, all basic resources (see item 3) are updated accordingly, thus enabling player to seamlessly utilize new addons that use new resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11) Please refer to old \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lGlWdyn.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EResource Flow Diagram\u003C/a\u003E for future-proofing CRP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince you are author of Karbonite and MKS/OKS addons, you can take and adapt the above guidelines into yor addons as example for others to follow.

Both for gameplay and technical under-the-hood stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt concerns resource abundance within a given domain during extraction and later storage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf on Kerbin there are present Karbonite and Metal, there is a question of how to discern what is extracted and utilized. If player deployes a drill that removes a material from surface of lithosphere, then that material needs to be refined into target resources Karbonite and Metal. But, if there is a container that is filled with this raw material which is then transported to say Mun and converted, there is no underlying mechanism that will remember what that raw material really contains. You use drill from one pack that mines Ore for Metal and Silica, and a refinery/extractor from other pack that produces Karbonite from that same Ore. This is a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could solve this by letting part/plugin pack authors solve this on their own, but that could make a \u0022bad advertisement\u0022 not only for their addons but for yours too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne way to do this without getting yourself too much involved is to define the following.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) All resources are extracted directly in their usable form (ie drill and converter in one) OR,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Refining resources requires that raw resource has a \u0022memory\u0022 of how much of each final resource is present so it can be to be correctly refined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) CRP defines three basic resources from which everything else is refined : Ore, Liquid and Gas. Each is a compound resource which a pack author can choose to use in their addon to make it more real or skip that altogether and opt for direct extraction. This should be a mandatory minimum on which all other resources rely on, it is always present.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) When extraction takes place, all available resources are extracted in RATIOS of total volume available. If a drill removes 40 Ore per minute, and Karbonite and Metal are present in concetrations of K=15% and M=10%, then you get 40 x 0.15 = 6 Karbonite per minute and 40 x 0.10 = 4 Metal per minute. Ratios are determined by combining abundance of all materials for a given place. This can present a problem if a resource is overabundant to a point that a ratio is made worse for all other resources, especially when a new resource is introduced in game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) All resources need to be \u0022registered\u0022 with CRP separately from addons that utilize them. Take Kethane for example. If player has Kethane and Extraplanetary Launchpads, and decides later to replace Kethane with some other resource pack, he/she will effectively remove all underlying resource structure required to keep EL working. So, resources that are currently used anywhere in game must be tracked and presented to player, thus enabling a proper removal of part addons without crippling any other addons relying on a same resource.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) All parts which directly interact with resource domains (ohh, what an expert wording ! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E i kill me sometimes) should follow this guideline : Ore is extracted with Drill, Liquid with Pump and Gas with Intake. Shapes and sizes are arbitrary ofcourse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) All resource extraction parts should either make target resource as their output or leave it to player which resource is extracted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) All resource extraction and refinery parts should respect resource ratios and extract a corresponding amount per unit of time from their respective sources, as described in item 4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) All resource containers that hold Ore, should accept Ore resource from CRP itself, the only resource that is guaranteed to hold target resources in proper ratios. If a resource container holds Ore from several domains (planets, moons, asteroids), container will have a total Ore amount and Ore itself will contain target resources in amounts as they are extracted with Drills. Same for Liquid and Gas containers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10) If new target resource is introduced later in game, all basic resources (see item 3) are updated accordingly, thus enabling player to seamlessly utilize new addons that use new resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11) Please refer to old \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lGlWdyn.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EResource Flow Diagram\u003C/a\u003E for future-proofing CRP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince you are author of Karbonite and MKS/OKS addons, you can take and adapt the above guidelines into yor addons as example for others to follow.

I just wanted to help you have a proposed consistency in your addons that rely on CRP, thus promoting logic in their utilization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I have to admit i am one of the cats \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I can see you repeated the statement about primary goal. Again i am fine with it, i just wanted to help you establish minimal non-mandatory structure within CRP that will ensure newly introduced resources do not disrupt existing ones during their extraction and subsequent manipulation. Basic Ore, Liquid and Gas raw materials are placeholders that keep things in order enough to help both addon makers and players alike to have some sense of direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, making sure resources are not defined within plugin/pack itself but rather inside CRP is a way to make sure people can switch between resource extraction addons without removing the resources introduced with those addons and not breaking other addons that may be also depending on those resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunny enough i\u0027ve read the topic on Asteroid Resources, it has much in common with i\u0027m trying to say. I guess using common sense inevitably leads to similar if not identical conclusions. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe resource density per site is what i addressed too - there has to be a way to make all resoruces available disrupting each other\u0027s availability (wording is terrible yet somehow still appropriate).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, wether you want it or not, just like all other resource addon authors you took that burden of fixing it to a some degree of functionality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more question : are you willing to reconsider my suggestions (about resource chemistry and previous) if i move/post them in topics for Asteroid Resources and MKS/OKS ? Will they be helpful there ? I\u0027m only trying to help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotally get that you are trying to help, but to be very clear, I have zero intention of attempting to dictate/encourage/etc. anything at all beyond \u0027Don\u0027t crash KSP please\u0027 and \u0027If several mods already have the same resource definition for something, please be nice and reuse it\u0027. Now, for all of this, there will still be just a single definition, so mods will not have to define their own versions if they take this dependency (or they can still do their own definitions as long as they follow rule one, and try to follow rule two). But that\u0027s pretty much it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone wants to begin their own discussions and expand upon this, awesome! rock on! But I have every intention of keeping my goals very very specific. Or, in otherwords, if everyone mutually agrees, for example, on the density of oxygen (which we\u0027re very close on), I\u0027ll reflect that mutual consensus. But I\u0027m not going to suggest what that density should be beyond selecting a default if no consensus can be reached.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Paul Kingtiger","CreatedById":57455,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T00:04:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RoverDude\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RoverDude\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAwesome!
