For cosmetic reasons, the satellite I already have in Keostationary orbit has 4 antenna... antenni??? But if I build a new satellite, which is what I\u0026#39;m planning, should it have more than 1 antenna? A satellite network means they\u0026#39;re in communication with each other, but I\u0026#39;m not sure if this means anything as far as the game is concerned or not. Should I have more than one and pointed in different directions? \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have the funds at this point to blow a little and make something big and fun, like a communication array kind of thing. But I\u0026#39;m really curious, would it make a difference? Would something big with maybe 2 or 3 big gold antenna dishes be better than something small and efficiant and cheap, but only one antenna?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goody1981","CreatedById":153740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T02:44:37Z","Content":"\nI think, unless you are playing with the Remote Tech mod, that you can put as many or as few antennae as you like on it.

They\u0026#39;re giving me not only the orbit, but also the ground position I need to be LOS with. This 2nd contract looks to be I\u0026#39;m guessing maybe 80-90 degrees from the first satellite, which is good. If I need to reposition later that\u0026#39;s fine, they have plenty of fuel. But for now I\u0026#39;m going to do this one, then wait to see if and what the third satellite contract looks like.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI hadn\u0026#39;t thought of using ground stations, but since reading your response I\u0026#39;ve dreamed up half a dozen ideas for making them.
