The result though is that ion drives are to boring to use - start up the drive then return many hours later. For basic KSP that isn\u0027t so bad - you can do everything with Nervas, but for real scale its quite difficult to do an outer planet mission without an electric drive. (there are some wonderful ones in add-on packs). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to have a special delta-V maneuver. The ship needs to be some distance from any object (say 1 million Km). Then you can apply an \u0022instant\u0022 delta-V up to the amount of fuel carried. MechJeb calculates available delta-V so the data is probably available. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would let you do a launch and escape using conventional (chemical or nuke) drives. Warp to 1M km, then use an ion drive.

Low thrust applied over a long period of time leads to different (often spiral shaped) trajectories. As you\u0027re thrusting, your vessel is rotating around the sun, even if it\u0027s not in the SOI of any near planet. As it rotates around the sun, the angle of the thrust relative to your prograde direction will change, and your trajectory will curve away from normal gravitational contour lines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you\u0027re asking for is essentially a high-ISP impulse engine.

Close in to a planet then there is a big difference and setting ion engines to higher thrust WOULD be cheating. If you require a large distance then its not a cheat. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine you are going to Jupiter. You get to earth escape with conventional engines. Then you start the ion drive. The trip takes years, so once you are away from the earth (using Oberth effect WOULD be cheating), it really doesn\u0027t matter if the burn takes 5 minutes or 5 days. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that while real astronauts on a 5 year trip don\u0027t mind waiting 5 days, if you are playing KSP it is REALLY DULL. It means that a correctly designed rocked (eg low thrust) makes for very dull game play - you need to start thing, then set alarms etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor normal KSP it doesn\u0027t matter - you can get everywhere and back (except EVE) easily with conventional and NERVAs. For real scale though, doing outer planet missions really only makes sense with high impulse drives, or you are sending your kerbals on multi decade missions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo a X1000 physics time warp is the \u0022right\u0022 answer, but its technically difficult to do in the game.

They actually run for a substantial portion of the mission. If you\u0027re trying to make ions like real ions, you cannot do it the way you suggested - real ion engines are so very much lower thrust than KSP ions (even before the bump, KSP had ions giving 500 N of thrust; for real ions, 5 N is massive thrust, and in-service designs typically have under 1 N of thrust) that you literally \u003Cem\u003Ecannot\u003C/em\u003E model missions using KSP\u0027s point-impulse maneuver nodes - two-impulse Hohmann trajectories are not achievable, period, and the craft instead follows a radically different non-ballistic trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is bad at this, because all the tools are designed for rapid burns (maneuver nodes in particular are inapplicable to brachistochrone trajectories ion craft have to use in real life; the calculations used for planning those missions are fundamentally different to the system implied with maneuver nodes). Given that the proper way would involve a ton of work to implement a special mode just for long-burn missions, and that only one stock engine would even possibly do those long-burn missions, it\u0027s probably not worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, gameplay does take precedence over realism, but that only applies if ions are an issue and/or useless in stock KSP.
