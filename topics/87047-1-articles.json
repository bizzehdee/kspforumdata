SQUAD might be a bit slow and inefficient, but that\u0027s due to inexperience and a very small staff size. They\u0027ve got a road map for what they want to do with the game and that\u0027ll dictate what gets added. Many of those mods are outside the scope of what they\u0027re aiming to include in a 1.0 release and at least the resource extraction is something that is entirely off the table for the stock game unless they come up with a novel way of implementing it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides that, good luck getting everyone to agree with what they want added to the game. For every person who wants better aerodynamics, there\u0027s going to be a person who\u0027s used to stock soup-atmo and is going to hate seeing it changed.

Although it\u0027s a taboo here by now ever since DLCgate, this sort of method would allow a DLC model also. Of course, that doesn\u0027t make anything for Squad from older users who got the game some time ago - the terms we older users bought by say we get this stuff for free.
