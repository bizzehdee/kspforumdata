The thing about any addon that includes textures is, that it takes up RAM.

B9 comes with a reduction pack that can shave off hundreds of megabytes, it\u0027s placed inside the B9 folder. Simply merge and replace this folder on top of the normal B9 folder in GameData. Alternatively, there\u0027s the B9 mega-reduction pack by attosecond, who has also made a reduction pack for NovaPunch.
