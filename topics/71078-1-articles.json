Honestly, I think that rather than saddle the devs with the expectation to find new music, procure the licenses and include more static tracks in the game, why not add the ability to play tracks from our own collections, similar to the way GTA Vice City/San Andreas did (plop music files in a folder that the game can reference)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, that may introduce another license issue with MP3 decoding in-game, (it\u0027s not really fair to expect every player to understand the details of transcoding to an open format like .ogg), but that would be only a single hurdle to overcome, compared to micro-managing the individual tracks from their end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I\u0027m thinking about this, it might be nice to actually have two independent playlists for flight or construction, extending on the format already present in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#d3d3d3;\u0022\u003EI did a little searching and found a plugin that provides the basics of the functionality, but it\u0027s a little clunky and requires a part to be present on the craft, which means it\u0027s only active during flight, not during construction, which is where a lot of players can actually spend more time during a particular session.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just found \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65726-0-23-Soundtrack-Editor\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESoundtrack Editor\u003C/a\u003E, which goes a long way toward implementing the suggestions above!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-01T18:31:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2014 06:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Deadweasel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-01T18:59:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027d be great if if there was something like a file list specifying what to play in space, in atmosphere, when landed, etc. And if I could add my own music to that list.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-01T21:13:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the game needs the credits music to play in atmosphere (maybe only dense atmosphere)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"szputnyik","CreatedById":84032,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-01T21:55:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESometimes, flashing lights should emanate from an occupied Hitchhiker, and if you IVA into it, this music should play:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/0j0OwPSO-KQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReason: Even Kerbals are bored sometimes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"coolitic","CreatedById":79738,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-01T22:23:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like ksp\u0027s music. but it does get a bit repetitive.
