The Voskhod looked like some sort of alien vessel, unnatural, industrial, dieselpunk-sci fi, I love it. The gemini on the other hand is like a futuristic plane, with its clear front windows, jet like controls and beast propulsion module I believe more ships should be built like it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly was what they achieved, from these ships we got the first space walks (which for some reason are much more fascinating the modern day ones, probably due to the old cameras and the fact they simply \u0022let go\u0022). We also got the first multi crew missions and terms such as mission commanders came, it felt like star trek was getting closer. We got rendezvous and manual dockings which was cool. Voskhod also had incredible life support, this was never used however \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother cool thing was how fast they were created, both crafts were cobbled together in months and both projects completed their goals between 1964-65, you don\u0027t get that type of speed these days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is probably a tonne more stuff to talk about, just wanted to spread my love for these two particular craft. These days we talk more about the iss then the ships that carry us there, most people have forgotten about some of our greatest flying machines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway enough rambling, what\u0027s your favourite generation and why? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-27T01:27:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe generations to come.
