Nvidia in its infinite wisdom and prescience claimed the alt f12 keys for their Nvidia Share Overlay. and since its on top of the ksp display your debug menu wont come up even if you try to open it with hyperedit. assign alt f12 to another key or macro on your keyboard and everything else on the long distinguished list of remapping keys.hehe.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave to change the keybindings on the overlay since I havent been able to find a way to remap the ksp debug menu keys. \u00A0I made mine ctrl alt f12.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are running multiple installs like myself make sure that the target and start folder paths are the same hehe. otherwise really strange things start happening.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
