(Again, going kinda post crazy today)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo with the implimentation of the Fine Print contract system from 0.90 I\u0027m kinda running into an issue with station building contracts. Now first let me say I\u0027m playing the carreer on normal difficulty so contract payouts are set to the deffault 100%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy problem is that I just cannot for the life of me figure out how to efficiently launch a station into orbit while still meeting the budget. Let\u0027s take for instance a simple example of a contract to launch a station into orbit around Kerbin. Now this often comes with requirements such as having a viewing cupola and a research station there. Now let\u0027s say that the place needs room for 8 or so Kerbals as well. (Don\u0027t get me started on those 20 Kerbal ones....)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk so since the viewing Cupola supports 1 crew, and the science lab supports 2 we\u0027re going to need 2 habitation modules to get to the desired ammount of Kerbals on the station. This would total in for a weight of 10.3 tons already and then we haven\u0027t even added any structural pieces to make it look presentable or added any batteries, solar pannels, docking ports etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo launch a payload that heavy I find that I often have to build a verry verry fat rocket to get that thing into orbit and this often outright exceeds the budget straight away, advance and final payout included. For example the last contract I saw for a simmilar task would pay about 30k in advance and 60k on completion but the lightest rocket I could design to lift the payload already costs 140k or more depending on how much margin for error I want to include.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunching multiple smaller rockets and having them build the station in orbit isn\u0027t helping me much either as the total cost usually runs up to about the same number.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo is there any way at all to do these contracts more efficiently so I actually make some money or are they simply imbalanced and should I skip them for now?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-03T21:19:05Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2015 09:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dr-Drunk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T21:10:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, using stock only, I would recommend one of two things.
