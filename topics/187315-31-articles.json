and if I want it - a couple different levels to choose from. \u00A0Same for comms. \u00A0Same for part reliability. \u00A0Same for flight mechanics.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- I like the idea of unlocking different solar systems through career progression.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- A lot of the ideas below assume a career type game, not sandbox.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EInterstellar mechanics\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- A few have pointed out that simply interacting with bodies at the outer edges of the Kerbol system requires lots of time warping - which means ignoring anything else happening closer/faster.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- I like the idea of building towards a pinnacle tech group and building a ship that meets specific criteria for interstellar-rated transport.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- If you just unlocked some tech, knock it together, and launch that is ultimately unfulfilling to me. \u00A0I\u0027d like to see a mix of tech unlock, career progression mechanics, and time/effort being put into presence is space systems. \u00A0The exact criteria are minutiae but you should have to do things like keep a certain amount of presence off-Kerbin for a long time, build different types of installations and operate them ongoing, etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- There should be a difficult block of science/career progression to identify/qualify other systems\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- Once you actually have an interstellar-rated craft, you launch towards another system and that system becomes \u0022unlocked\u0022 for career use. \u00A0Bypassing a need to actually travel.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- Each system you have unlocked in a career mode is a separate \u0022instance\u0022 of your save and each of those \u0022instances\u0022 can be worked on independently of the others. \u00A0They are \u0022time independent\u0022 or something like that, and you begin another instance with the resources you brought with you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EProcedural parts\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- Decrease part count and make the damn things procedural. \u00A0Seriously.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- To me it makes more sense to have limits within the procedural building that are pushed out with science gain. \u00A0Like, you can build X-type of fuel tank only up to Y-size by default. \u00A0Put some time\u002Bscience into it and now you can build it larger, or build it to different tolerances (gravity/stress/pressure/whatever).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- Focus on different types only where it makes actual sense. \u00A0Have different engines for burning LH and RP1. \u00A0Have different engines for atmo and vac. \u00A0Have different tanks for different use cases, not necessarily just for different fuels, like some many mods allow you to switch right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EScience investment\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- Perhaps science can be a time \u002B \u0027science units\u0027 investment and not just take 27 temperature readings and build a dozen types of new and better engines.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- Science unlocks should require a mix of things that include straight time on project. \u00A0You need 30 days, 4 months, whatever to unlock the next node of abilities.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- As more difficult/advanced nodes are researched also require usage. \u00A0Want to get \u0022level 3\u0022 LO/LH engines? \u00A0Well, we need a combined 5000 seconds of actual real-world flight. \u00A0Want level 4 of the same? \u00A0Now we need another 5000 real-world seconds with level 3 engines but some of it needs to be in another planetary \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E for... reasons. \u00A0Doesn\u0027t exactly matter - the concept does.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- As an interplay between the (very necessary idea of) procedural parts and science, let players push hybrids or specialty parts from science. \u00A0Let them research very specific avenues to very specific parts - like amto and vac optimized engines. \u00A0OR, if they want to have LH engines have really good atmo performance and RP1 engines hybrid between vac and atmo that should be a thing they can unlock too.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- Sample returns and other body \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E required for advanced materials unlocks.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- Doing things like this can gate science advances behind required missions and visits to other places. \u00A0Crawl before you walk. \u00A0Walk before you crawl. \u00A0If you don\u0027t want the progression - that\u0027s why you have a sandbox mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECareer Mechanics\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- Some folks lament having to be potentially bogged down with \u0022boring stuff\u0022 if you have to keep far-flung colonies and space stations supplied. \u00A0What if instead you had a mechanic where your rockets can be \u0022rated\u0022 with a certain reliability, lift capacity, and systems engineering. \u00A0You could use these \u0022rated\u0022 systems to auto-magically (just funds and time) fulfill logistical or transport needs.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- Firstly you have base requirements. \u00A0The main space centre at Kerbin could be made to have logistical, building capacity (rockets and such) and \u0027background\u0027 personnel for off-world work. \u00A0These start small and are upgraded like other facilities.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- A combination of those new facilities and \u0027rated\u0027 systems keep your stations/bases/colonies staffed and equipped as required. \u00A0You basically setup \u0022trade routes\u0022 for lack of a better term.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- What I mean is for example, you have a science station in orbit around Minmus. \u00A0It requires A life support, B maintenance and parts, and C crew transfer every D months. \u00A0You have a system rated for Minmus delivery of cargo which carries up to a specific amount. \u00A0If it meets that station\u0027s cargo requirements \u0022every D months\u0022 then you can just \u0027set and forget\u0027 the necessary runs. \u00A0They happen in the background and funds/personnel are allocated depending on the available reserves. \u00A0If the rated system isn\u0027t able to meet the cargo requirements maybe you need 2. \u00A0You would could have a separate rated system for crew for Minmus delivery which handles the crew transfers. \u00A0Or you could have a hybrid crew/cargo rated system.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- Building out infrastructure should be a goal but getting bogged down in sending enough toilet paper to Jool would drive me crazy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, simply having interesting, engaging, and useful missions WITH rewards that players WANT to chase is critical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyhow, just some thoughts. \u00A0Wonder what you think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-21T13:20:59Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2019 01:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Idleness\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-21T13:04:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223655471\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187315\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221566370531\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022191771\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00224472TJ\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, 4472TJ said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, files are not cross compatible\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would love to see something offical about this.
