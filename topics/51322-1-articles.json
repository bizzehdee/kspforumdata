Problem is, on its current trajectory it\u0027s going to miss the planet. But when trying to adjust its course, I found out that I couldn\u0027t rotate it. At all. (Before you ask, yes it has power.) Even with an inline reaction wheel, all it did was flex a little between the reaction wheel and the part above it. Same with Q and E rotation. Thinking it was some mistake in design, I started a minute burn in order to use the engine gimbal to change its orientation. But even that didn\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any reason at all why a probe would REFUSE to change attitude under torque?
