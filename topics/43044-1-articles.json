Not at present. Since it appears that Squid uses file folders for each part used and the same name is used in every folder for rendering that part in the game, a custom program would have to be written to convert a Craft file into the 3-D format that a printer would recognize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is far different from the way parts work in Train Simulator s format which uses vector descriptions with texture maps easily convertible to the popular CAD 3-D formats that created them.
