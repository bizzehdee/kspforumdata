You hear me. By Kraken.

First, he can\u0027t stand up, and when he comes to the point where he can stand up... *plop*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe screen goes black and the altitude reader stops reading anything. The portraits of the kerbals show the snowy screen of death, and everything seems to be clickable for a little while. You can even press esc and go back to KSC, but it\u0027s just not there... Also the save seems to be corrupted if you attempt to load it, however I was able to recover the craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that it\u0027s probably an issue specific to my system (Ivy Bridge I7 \u002B Nvidia GT 630M, 6 GB RAM, Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty, Bumblebee installed, Wine 1.7, KSP 0.25 x86), but still it\u0027s interesting.
