I am fairly new at this game. Below are some screen caps of my ship and after it blew. I circled the part which blows up. Any advice would be great. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/U9RZAFZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022U9RZAFZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/91nXn9Y.png\u0022 alt=\u002291nXn9Y.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Norok","CreatedById":147978,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T20:13:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe same thing happened to me when I was trying to assemble a modular interplanetary ship in orbit. Your design and use of parts (docking ports on structural fuselages) is what I was going for as well. It happened when I switched to the other vehicle too. I heard the explosion and saw in the distance my connecting section breaking up. I was actually kind of amused in a roleplaying sense that part of my planned ship and mission (took almost a RL week before I even launched the parts) experienced a catastrophic failure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking I had gotten hit by debris or something I reloaded my quicksave and then immediately after the game finished loading the vehicle exploded. Thus I am left to conclude this is a physics engine bug. This is my original design:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TndkHob.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TndkHob.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI chewed out my Kerbal engineers at the VAB for using such structurally weak parts. We went back and resigned the whole ship. Instead of using the docking ports for planned modular, replaceable drive sections I went for a single drive section connected more securely on a more structurally sound Rockomax tank which gave us the idea of using the tank as a fuel reserve for the main NERV engines and to allow refueling the attached lander for multiple Mun and Minimus landings. We increased the delta V for the whole ship to compensate and the whole project topped over 600,000.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gWDchAv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gWDchAv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end this change of fate that expanded the mission parameters yielded a 6000\u002B Dv ship that gave a happy tour to 6 Kerbal Tourists, achieved 3 Mun landings, 2 Minimus landings, and brought back 3100 science after being out in space 94 days. Now it sits stably in LKO until Duna comes in window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TAS4eGm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TAS4eGm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line is one of the reasons I love this game is trial and error through iterations. So my suggestion is to rethink your design with different parts and see the bug as a feature \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sheppard","CreatedById":93282,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T22:51:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeems to be a random bug - here you have the solution (page 4): \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126664-MAJOR-Heating-Bug\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126664-MAJOR-Heating-Bug\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
