Normally, when building a new craft the first part you click in the part list appears in the centre of the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may have a corrupted craft file. In your KSP folder, open \u0027saves\u0027 and then the name of the save. There should be two folders inside that. One for VAB craft, and one for SPH craft. The craft files are just text files and can be opened with a simple editor such as notepad. If one file is very small compared to the others, that may be indicative of corruption. If you examine the uncorrupted craft files, any that are corrupt should be obvious once you open them. You will have to delete any corrupted craft file, but that should fix the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.
