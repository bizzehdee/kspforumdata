I have a deep space ship with an Ion probe attached at a jr docking port. This probe carries my Scansat gear. I have used it successfully at Duna and Dres so far. Today I was in orbit around Tylo and detached the probe. I had full Xenon gas tanks and activated the engines. However when I throttled up nothing happened. No gas consumed, no battery used, no thrust, no engine glow. Right clicking on the engines shows that they flameout as soon as I throttle up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used the rcs to reattach to the mother ship. As a test, I tried throttling up while attached and they now work! Undock again and they don\u0027t work. Very very strange.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing that has changed is I docked a refueling module containing extra Xenon gas to the main ship and then refueled the probe. Somehow this messed something up. It seems as though it doesn\u0027t recognize the presence of the two xenon tanks on the probe anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have looked in the persistence file but didn\u0027t see anything obviously wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have a suggestion?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks much!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrudbasher\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-07T03:42:35Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2014 03:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by crudbasher\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ratchet freak","CreatedById":119895,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-06T13:43:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eis the battery enabled?

The probe is a small cube probe body with jr docking port on top. Then a Z-1k battery (1000 units) a rcs tank, 2 inline xenon tanks then the sar SCANSAT radar on the end. I used cubic struts on the sides to put the engines.
