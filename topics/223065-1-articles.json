But the probe cores are almost always too small to do that. Unless I\u0027m missing something, the probe cores aren\u0027t actually any better the bigger they get, and if you can build a 1m wide computer that can fly a ship, its weird that it takes an exponential amount of research to do that with an even larger computer?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my request would be for the probes to either unlock all at once (minus maybe the stayputnik which is kind of a tutorial probe and presumably intentionally unwieldy), or in tandem with the larger parts so you can always build probes to scale with the size of your rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-17T02:21:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI put them in a cargo bay or something else structural.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-17T11:13:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey have stronger reaction wheels, can hold more electricity, and probably something else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
