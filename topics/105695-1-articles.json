I load into the game, adjust the settings to my liking (or use the launcher), exit the game, check the .cfg and everything is looking fine, but once back in KSP all settings are back to default.\n\nProblem remains even after a complete reinstall. Thought in the first place this was caused by a mod, but removed all mods and reinstalled KSP clean but the problem still remains.\n\nHere is the output\\_log.txt: [http://pastebin.com/72q9jg4t](http://pastebin.com/72q9jg4t)\n\nHere is the ksp.log: [http://pastebin.com/UYvMLS9Z](http://pastebin.com/UYvMLS9Z)\n\nEdit: Using the Steam version of KSP, Steam installed in C:\\\n\nEdit 2: Logs added\n\nEdit 3: Submitted a bug report on the bugtracker\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T17:52:56Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 05:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Andy81le**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T17:18:14Z","Content":"Hi Andy81le, can you please check the support stickies and post your game logs ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Felix_Shepard","CreatedById":142091,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T20:58:17Z","Content":"I was having the same problem repeatedly (same system setup). I tried exiting KSP, deleting the settings.cfg (after making a backup copy) and then restarting the game. As I anticipated, the game automatically made a new setting.cfg file since it was missing, but now it hasn\u0027t reset the .cfg on startup since then. \n\nI think there may be something wrong with the initial one in the download and making a fresh .cfg resolves that problem."}]}
