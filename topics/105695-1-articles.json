I load into the game, adjust the settings to my liking (or use the launcher), exit the game, check the .cfg and everything is looking fine, but once back in KSP all settings are back to default.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem remains even after a complete reinstall.

I tried exiting KSP, deleting the settings.cfg (after making a backup copy) and then restarting the game.
