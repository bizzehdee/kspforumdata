Ex:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAscent profile: I climbed at full throttle to about 20k at a 45* angle and had my Ap reach about 28k. I leveled off keeping my Ap around 28k then slowly bringing it up to 30k. Around the 30-31k mark I also had to start throttling the engines back to avoid burnouts. I simply let the speed build up and slowly let my Ap climb to above 110k while keeping the angle of attack very shallow (5-10%). Kept doing this all the way up to around 50k throttling engine down slowly then at 48-50k shut down jet\u002Bvents and waited for my Ap which went to around 95k to bring first Pe all the way up to 102k then waited for new Ap and brought Pe up to 102k also.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELeaderboards\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - carazvan 381.88\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pinolallo","CreatedById":47075,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T17:54:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion your calculation does not compute nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egood way is the ratio between vehicle weigh on take off and weight on orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T19:07:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe scoring mechanism is similar to the ratio, though I don\u0027t see why you\u0027d double the oxidizer.
