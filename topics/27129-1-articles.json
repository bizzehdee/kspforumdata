Physical time acceleration is pressing the (alt\u002B\u0026lt;\u0026gt;) and Time Warp is just \u0026lt;\u0026gt;. But I don\u0027t understand the difference. How are they different, why would there need to be a distinction and what situation require one over the other?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know this has probably been covered all over, but I can\u0027t find it right now - here or on the wiki.

You have no control, it\u0027s just fast forward. Physics warp doesn\u0027t run as fast, and the physics calculations are still being done. You have control of your ship, everything just runs faster. You have to be careful with this, the way it does this (as I understand it) is the game is running fewer calculations each second, so it\u0027s faster but less accurate. This means it\u0027s much easier to go off course and/or rip your ship apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the things I\u0027ve been doing lately is using PW to orient my ships without wasting RCS (when I have the time to do it, it doesn\u0027t work so hot if you have a maneuver coming up in under a minute). It takes longer, but you can turn very large ships with very small probes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T16:33:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETime warp is just that, it makes time go faster, but it stops all physics calculations. If you are in a stable orbit, then you will stay that way as long as you are in time warp (you can still have encounters with other planets and moons though). You can\u0027t use it when in an atmosphere, or with the engines on, and you can\u0027t change anything when in time warp (like the direction you\u0027re heading, activating solar panels, RCS, etc.). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith physics warp everything is still being calculated. You can activate engines, enter an atmosphere, or do anything else, just a little bit faster (only 2X - 4X regular speed). Physics warp can also break things if your ship is too big or complicated, or too many things are going on at once. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime warp is just there to make the game tolerable. A transit to Jool can take 300 days, or 75 days with physics warp. But it just takes a few minutes with time warp. Physics warp is the same principle, making you not waste so much time waiting for something to happen, it\u0027s just that the complexity of the physics calculations make it not feasible to go much faster than 4X regular speed. Also, you don\u0027t want to go too much faster than normal when important things are happening, like using fuel, or being in an atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"42undead2","CreatedById":47664,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T16:34:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn short; phys warp means physics, albeit more errors.

For example, a plane that has a small wobble with ASAS turned on inside the atmosphere can and will shake itself to pieces when on max time acceleration. Also, try to avoid any time acceleration when firing your engines (except for ion, or possibly nuclear for long burns). For higher thrust engines, this will tear your craft apart.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Conarr","CreatedById":60613,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T17:11:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, I think I have it now.
