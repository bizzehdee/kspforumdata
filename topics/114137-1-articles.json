However, the statistic i keep finding is that [30-40%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_in_Earths_atmosphere) of man-made CO2 goes into oceans, whereas, by my calculations, it is more like 99.97%.\n\nIs there an error in my calculations? If not, where does the rest go?\n\nEDIT: found the error. Mass of CO2 increases by 1% per year. Since current concentration is 400ppm, CO2 concentration should increase by 4ppm/yr. It actually only increases by 2-3ppm/yr due to ocean absorption, so the data are consistent.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T13:29:37Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 01:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by arkie87**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T16:24:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...\n\u003E Is there an error in my calculations?

Light near poles is a small fraction of total planet area, and fluxes are very low due to angle of incidence, so i\u0027m not sure that that effect is significant.\n\nFrom [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass_(ecology)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass_%28ecology%29):\n\nTotal biomass of carbon on earth is 560e9 tons Carbon = ~1.5e12 tons CO2, which is the same order of magnitude as the mass of CO2 in the atmosphere. Interesting.\n\nTotal annual primary production of biomass is 100e9 tons Carbon = ~30e10 tons CO2, which is 10x more than humans create, based on the data in the OP. So by burning fossil fuels, we are having the same effect as a 10% global biomass increase per year. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E And one more thing - some of phytoplankton mass gets eaten by fish etc. But a lot of dead algae sink to the bottom of the ocean where carbon bound in their cells gets locked pretty effectively.\n\nThis is natural part of the carbon cycle. Unless you can quote numbers (like Gton/yr), not sure if this matters at all. This is just like the dinosaurs becoming oil-- the algae might be replacing them (or perhaps, oil is actually dead algae?).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-25T17:45:28Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2015 05:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by arkie87**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T17:45:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The amount of CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E modern man adds to this equation is only a very small fraction.\n\n\u002297 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists\u0022 disagree with you.\n\n[http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/](http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/)"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T18:00:15Z","Content":"Demonstrably false... just these numbers here show the release is 1% of total atmospheric CO2 mass every year\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Photosynthesis is limited by sunlight, NOT by CO2 concentration...
