It sounds like you\u0027ve grabbed a BoxSat module and you\u0027re right clicking the module to attach it to your BoxSat frame. The BoxSat frame is implemented as a \u0022KAS Part Bay\u0022 (same mechanic used by the KAS Container Bay Type A/B part). This means instead of normal attachment process you instead right click on the BoxSat frame and then click the button marked \u0022Store\u0022. This will place your module in an open slot on the frame that is \u0022nearest\u0022 to your Kerbal. I hope this solves your problem.

Rexporting the part in Unity fixed it so that\u0027s good. I\u0027ve finished updating the part files for KSP 0.25 and verifying function with KSP 0.25, mechjeb, and KAS. I\u0027ve also rexported all of the textures as PNGs which shaved install to about 1/4 original size on disk and reduced memory usage by about 70 mb (need to do some more testing on this to confirm). Right now I\u0027m setting up test installs for Remotetech and ActiveTextureManagement. Once I\u0027ve finished testing the MM configs for those I\u0027ll need to test tweakscale, kerbal engineer, and kOS configs. I saw the comments about Packrat compatibility. I\u0027ll have to see if I can whip up something for that and confirm it works as intended. So the list of things to do before A.02b is released is getting shorter. Ah, I\u0027ve just discovered a new way to break KSP. Excuse me while I confirm this and check the bug tracker. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETLDR: BoxSat update for KSP 0.25 is coming soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"orcmaul","CreatedById":19612,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T06:53:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo Remotetech mm file works as desired and the new antenna ranges should be much more interesting. I finished testing the rest of our supported mods before starting on ActiveTextureManagement support. I subsequently spent the rest of the day on ATM. Uh, it seems to work but it\u0027s actually using more memory than if BoxSat doesn\u0027t use ATM. I\u0027m going to hold back on releasing ATM support until I have some more time to test this. Time to do the packrat config and testing got eaten by ATM testing. Everything else is done and the update is ready to post.
