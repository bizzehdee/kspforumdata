Quicksave and Quickload is ok, but we need a save menu with options to do several saves. They are only accessible in KSC and even those are weak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to know if it is possible to make a mod that handles save games, and also the possibility to load them \u0022on the fly\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany times, I crashed into the mun just to discover the quicksave or autosave just killed my career game because I lost jeb, bob and bill and they already had good xp and level up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mod should allow me to save the game at any moment and do it by order. Instead of one quicksave, make quicksave1, 2,3, etc. date and time would also be great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith most solo games having a decent way of loading and saving the game, why KSP is to dumb about it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I screw up my flight, most of the times, I need to restart my game from scratch due the hard mods I use to give more realism to the game. Sure, save scum may change this, but I have other considerations to take. Using mods like Remotech 2, oks, kas, TAC life support, and many others, the stock hard level is nothing compared the way I play KSP. I do not play sandbox or science, I play full career and sometimes mistakes happen, some I can live with them, but after screwing a mission because of one small mistake, a mission in space for 5 months, gathering science (the way I play science is a bit hard grinding), it just kills my mood of play KSP (who am i kindding? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm sure there are many solutions, and I know I can make backups of saves and so on, but thats not the point. I want to have the option to load any save file and save the game in anytime, anywhere while playing, quicksave and quickload just dont cut it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThx. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also may be an alert to Squad to think about the way the game works in career. This should be stock Squad. 90% of games have a save/load function/menu that is not just quick save or load.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T19:14:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s already stock.
