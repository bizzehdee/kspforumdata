The giant panels are needed for the labs, as the combination of processing and transmitting experiments has a huge power usage. I don\u0027t see anything other than unnecessary frustration being gained by heavily nerfing them. That said, all electrical stuff should get a balancing pass before 1.0, I just don\u0027t see them as being overpowered right now, or in urgent need of attention. Best to leave that balancing until fairly late in beta, in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe RTG does have a useful niche right now, in providing baseline power during solar blackout conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joonatan1998","CreatedById":97636,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-02T15:26:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think they would be balanced if the smallest one wasn\u0027t massless.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bv1","CreatedById":127982,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-02T18:37:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree, Marclev.
