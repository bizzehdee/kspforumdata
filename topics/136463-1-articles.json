In th stock game, there is no punishment for using time-warp. That means that at all times, solutions that are the most delta-v efficient are the \u0022best\u0022 decisions. It also means taht you don#t need to use an Ore Scanner to scan for high re concentrations. Just land and drill, and if you happen to be in a bad spot, then simply increase time-warp a bit more. Also science labs. In the stock game, you can basically cheat yourself infinite science with them by time-warping a lot, without punishment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat an LS mod does is adding depth to the game by providing more choices in strategies. Suddenly, an expensive delta-v maneuver can be very desirable instead of a low-delta-v maneuver, because it allows you to finish within your supply limit. it also makes scanning for proper ore sites desirable, and fixes the problem with the science lab.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSetting yourself mental rules and role-playing is certainly a viable strategy, but that is no argument against using a mod to enhance the experience. With that argument a lot of mods would be superfluos. I still think that when you want to have more severy consequences for time-warping, using a mod to actually provide incentives not to time-warp is much more enjoyable for a lot of people then just setting arbitrary rules not to do so. I certainly feel more immersed when the rules are enforced by the game and refrelcted in the game instead of when they only exist in my head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-10T23:31:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222506146\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022136463\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460293871\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022153969\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kosmognome\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, Kosmognome said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/69507-geschosskopf/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002269507\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/69507-geschosskopf/\u0022\u003E@Geschosskopf\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0You are making it a bit too easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo? \u00A0Everything you mentioned is a choice that individual players might make, but it has zero bearing on what you do in your own game. \u00A0Why are you so worried about what other people do in their own games?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if you do worry about that, let me ease your mind. \u00A0It\u0027s a LOT easier to create your career game with such easy settings that you hardly need to fly at all, than it is to use hard settings and then\u00A0exploit around them. \u00A0So very if any people would do that but if that\u0027s what they enjoy doing, who are you to ruin their fun? \u00A0You play your game the way you want,.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSetting yourself mental rules and role-playing is certainly a viable strategy, but that is no argument against using a mod to enhance the experience.

The issue is that we fail to see how LS should limit you from excessive warping. Pack enough life support and you can still warp three years through a mission. On the other hand, I never warp for more than a couple of days at a time and somehow I don\u0027t need LS for that. That\u0027s the only thing that was really questioned as far as I was concerned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy all means, do enjoy playing with life support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
