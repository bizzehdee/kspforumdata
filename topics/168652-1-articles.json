It would be nice if it could be changed where the 1st stage lands. (ex. if I move the barge it would land there, not where I set it to land before.) If anyone knows if there is already a piece of code that does this, please link it but more likely some ideas of how I could make this would be nice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
