Pallas is not small, and the tidal buldges it raises as it passes Earth may by itself be enough to cause massive earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. I read once that a near miss by Mars would turn Earth\u0027s surface entirely molten from the deposited tidal energy, but I don\u0027t know if that scales down to Pallas too. Still, it would NOT BE GOOD.\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, it may change Earth\u0027s orbit enough to significantly alter the climate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, a near miss does not erase the possibility of a future impact. In the \u0022best\u0022 case for negating the possibility of a future impact, where Earth ejects Pallas from the solar system entirely, could mean that Earth deposits so much of its orbital energy into Pallas that our perihelion is too close to the Sun for Earth to remain habitable. Even as it currently stands, Earth is supposedly just inside the inner edge of Sol\u0027s habitable zone. If we got just a bit closer, the planet will supposedly go into runaway greenhouse mode, like Venus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPallas is not small, but it\u0027s only a tiiiiiny fraction of the mass of Mars. Earth\u0027s orbit would be changed enough for astronomers to notice, we may need an extra leap day every hundred years or something. Pallas\u0027 gravity wouldn\u0027t disrupt the Earth \u003Cem\u003Enearly\u003C/em\u003E as much. The tidal wave caused by a near miss certainly would not cause a \u003Cem\u003Emass\u003C/em\u003E extinction event. If you can get it from a grazing impact to... say... half of geosyncronous orbit, then Earth will probably be fine... until Pallas\u0027 next approach.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T01:21:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NASAFanboy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NASAFanboy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt would be easier to use a screwdriver to deflect the asteroid than the Moon.
