Also, drag and drop reordering the list would be fantastic as well. (And could be done with some modifier key, like ctrl, so that the regular dragging still acts like a scroll.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T22:36:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh yes, I fully support this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMyself I\u0060d like an option to have an active list that showed all the contracts in order of preference for the ones with least amount of criteria still to be met. Maybe filter by contracts that have at least one criteria met. The top three would show what was still needed in an expanded form. Completed contracts would drop off the bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea as proposed in the OP is one I like too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
