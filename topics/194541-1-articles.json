Last time I played was right after careers were added. So coming back to the game after this long time, it is like playing new game all over again. I have managed to land on Mun and Minmus several times and so on but some elementary stuff eludes me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am trying to simplify my design and the R-7 version is 42 tons lighter and can achieve pretty much same as previous iterations at same cost (I am playing career mode). This is also my first design with Nerv motors in upper stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is not to get this in orbit... \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe problem is that due to the flight path I end up using first stage before reaching orbit and have to use upper stage for that final push. Simply put the rocket starts to flip whenever I try to angle it over 2-4 % towards the east before I reach 20000 meters. \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EWhich means that I am flying stright up too long and have too low horizontal speed before I make the sharp turn.

The blunt, uncapped docking port is an absolute no-go - put a nosecone on that, you can eject it once you leave the atmosphere. Additionally, there\u0027s that gap in the rocket where the stages connect. I cannot quite understand what is going on there, but depending on how it\u0027s set up, it\u0027s a major candidate for crippling drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see you have the center of lift marker activated. Unfortunately, this marker does not actually show the center of aerodynamic pressure that is relevant for rocket stability. The game does not feature a way to display this to you. You\u0027ll have to work with educated guesses based on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E location, and test flights to verify your guesses. In your case, those test flights tell you \u0022nope, you guessed wrong\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can use a fuel flow trick to force the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E a little further up in flight, by configuring the fuel tanks on your first stage so that they have decreasing priority from the bottom up. That is, if your fuel tank priority is, I dunno, 30 by default, then leave the bottom-most fuel tank at 30, set the one directly above that to 29, the next one to 28, and so on. This will make the bottom-most tanks drain first, leaving the others completely full. As a result, the average Center of Mass ends up higher than if all tanks were draining equally at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is however only a band-aid. It can make the difference between slightly unstable and barely stable.

Now the rocket can do Split S if needed at any height - figuratively speaking, she is no nimble beast below 7000 but rather maneuverable outside atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did test the drag with shielded docking port and it improved the drag by 30-40 KN at 10 000 meters (worth mentioning, thanks for the tip). Improving the fairing for Nerv engine had minimal effect what so ever (that is what you are seeing on the middle of rocket - default fairing is even worse). The rocket has no shaking what so ever, so I am leaving that one be. Removing antenna removed another drag factor but difference is 20 m/s gained at 10 000 meter.
