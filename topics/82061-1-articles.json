However, I believe that such a feature should be handled upon starting a new game (where you can select what mods you want to use). While Career/Research should disable the selector after you start, I believe Sandbox should still provide a way of loading mods (though it maybe trickier to implement unless we retain the current method that it currently uses now with no selection whatsoever).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne handy thing about this form of mod selection is you could really customize career mode where you may end up with a totally different tech tree, different contracts, etc. Whats to say that one wants a close to reality space program using authentic parts based on real space programs. Another interesting perk is it could minimize memory consumption (something I remember reading in some older posts from other threads) while at the same time make the game more interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETechnically, it would be like running your own total conversion (or nearly) or partial conversion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
