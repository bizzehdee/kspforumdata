Unfortunately when I decouple my last fuel can deliver ship from the station the entire thing starts to wobble and eventually shakes itself apart. Sometimes a fuel can explodes. I took a video of it happening but until it uploads here is a screenshot of the station.

That is the side that makes it wobble. I will remove it and see if that fixes the station.

All Kerbal Space Stations come standard with a claw module. I had it on the station in the first place just to make it 20% cooler. Turns out it is useful after all! I took up the new station design with 4 empty cans with struts to keep them from falling apart. It made for a very stable package without that wobble from the port. I took the cans off station A because I thought it wouldn\u0027t make orbit. Tried and failed three times. This time it made it with no issues.

I turned off all SAS modules but one and it stopped. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand that when one has SAS modules trying to keep the station orientated you can get resonances. The station flexes a bit as they torque it, the SAS responds to the motion, which torques it again, so it flexes some more. It the new flexes are \u0022in time\u0022 with the old, the torques just add to the flex faster than it can dissipate and bad things happen. The solution is to keep the SAS from being in resonance. You can change where you control the station from (which give is a different point to judge from) or the distribution of controlling modules (RSC and SAS, modules and capsules) until you break up the resonance. That is, IMO, what you did when you changed the design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is like the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. Small vibrations are the right frequency add up until it falls apart. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/j-zczJXSxnw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
