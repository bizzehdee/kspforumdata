If anyone is unsure, the theoretical top speed of the turbojet is 2400 m/s (surface velocity - after that it entirely stops producing thrust), realistically you\u0027ll get acceptable performance up to 2250 m/s (read: \u0022produces about 1 kN of thrust and doesn\u0027t flameout if you alternate tapping shift and X\u0022) - if you\u0027re going east, that\u0027s 2430 m/s orbital velocity (you should only need about 30 m/s vacuum dV for circularisation). Going west, however, this will only net you ~2080 m/s orbital velocity, which means you\u0027ll have to supply about 300 - 400 m/s vacuum dV to reach orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think this is going to change in 1.0 - getting into a retrograde orbit will always be more costly, regardless of the engine type used.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T17:50:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deutherius\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Deutherius\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t think this is going to change in 1.0 - getting into a retrograde orbit will always be more costly, regardless of the engine type used.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree that getting into a retrograde orbit will always be more costly.
