But I guess you could fake the pulleys with KAS winches....\n\nWith a recurve bow they are made out of layers of wood, so could you try having layers of girders (with many struts of course) and see if you can get a stronger bow like that? I suspect that it will probably just snap, but it might work."},{"CreatedByName":"kStrout","CreatedById":116630,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T02:10:19Z","Content":"Through extensive research and experimentation we may finally be able to use space age technologies to create ancient weapons!
