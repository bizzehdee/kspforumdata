It\u0027s the same principle though, look how I have this attached at the front (you actually don\u0027t need the extra docking port, a docking port will detach from anything, it just won\u0027t re-attach back without a docking port.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rQoE8IG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rQoE8IG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis B9 one was done the same way, but the picture isn\u0027t as good for this purpose.
