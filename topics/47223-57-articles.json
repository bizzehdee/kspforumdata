This is not yet accounted for in engine balance, resulting in some engines being as much as 8% above the baseline.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, the fuel/mass ratio of liquid hydrogen tanks affects the HydrogenNTRs patch negatively. Because of dry mass differences between stock tanks and Near Future liquid hydrogen tanks, the LV-N loses at least 35% of its performance and thus becomes so weak that in most use cases it delivers less dV than common chemical engines. Other NTRs are similarly affected when patched.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, changing tank masses to fix the first issue makes the second worse - and vice versa. And *then* there\u0027s CryoEngines, a wholly different mod which also uses LH2 tanks, but with different dry masses again. A fundamental review of the whole setup is required.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCurrently, tank dry masses look like this:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Stock liquid fuel, 8:1 across the board\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Near Future LH2, from 2.56:1 to 3.54:1 depending on tank size class\u003Cbr\u003E\n- CryoEngines LH2, 2.02:1 across the board\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Stock xenon, 1.27:1 across the board\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Near Future xenon, from 1.43:1 to 1.48:1 depending on tank size class\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Near Future argon, from 1.37:1 to 2.00:1 depending on tank size class\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHigher values mean less dry mass per fuel, which results in more TWR and more dV. That\u0027s why the LV-N dies such a horrible death when switching from stock LF to NF LH2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis also illustrates another issue: installing Near Future together with CryoEngines currently lets the player use Near Future\u0027s lighter hydrogen tanks to get noticably better performance out of the engines than the mod intended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIgnoring other mods for the moment and focusing fully on Near Future Propulsion, the way I see it, there\u0027s two main approaches we can take.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOption 1: ignore the tanks, balance the engines. Dropping performance by ~4% for argon thrusters and ~8% for hydrogen thrusters brings all electric engines back onto the same baseline.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblems with Option 1: HydrogenNTRs will require absurd stat changes to restore stock performance, such as increasing Isp to twice what their inspirations had IRL, and lots of testing. Also doesn\u0027t fix disparity between stock and NFT xenon tanks, which does exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOption 2: leave the engines, fix the tanks. Bringing Argon and Xenon together on one baseline ought to be easy, since they aren\u0027t far apart. Could even tweak the three stock tanks to match with little to no effort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblems with Option 2: What to do with hydrogen tanks? You cannot pick a value for them that satisfies both electric engine balance and NTR balance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAdditional considerations:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Is it worth keeping the HydrogenNTRs patch in the first place? Sure, it is a nod to realism, but is it strictly necessary from a game design perspective? Since stock KSP removed the need for oxidizer, NTRs are already differentiated from normal engines more than they were in the past when the patch was first conceived. Dropping the patch would eliminate the most severe issues in *both* options above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Do the hydrogen tanks have to copy values directly from real life? A thought I recently had was: KSP has entirely unrealistic dry masses on tanks and engines alike to account for needing less dV to orbit, but the math still comes out heavily in favor of the player, as is apparent from ~15% payload fractions in KSP compared to ~3% payload fractions IRL. This probably makes chemical engines a better alternative to realistically statted NTRs and tanks than they would be IRL. As such, maybe the hydrogen tanks need artificially elevated numbers over what you\u0027d find IRL. After all, the stock LV-N does benefit from tanks with no boiloff yet significantly better dry mass ratios than NASA\u0027s zero-boiloff hydrogen tank concepts, which I suspect are the inspiration for the current numbers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Large disparities between the tank dry masses that are compensated for by adjusting engine stats look fairly interesting at first glance and work out perfectly fine in the spreadhseet, but are extremely intransparent to the player in practice. He will unlock different engines in the tech tree, and the engines running on fuel A will constantly have significantly better stats across the board than the engines running on fuel B. The player doesn\u0027t realize that tank dry masses are so much better for fuel B that fully built ships offer comparable performance to ships built with fuel A, because this would require looking at the tanks to compare engine performance, not at the engines. That\u0027s not only counterintuitive from a user experience design standpoint, but the fuel/mass fraction of a tank is also not directly displayed, and needs to be figured out by hand. While these considerations definitely exist IRL, for a game it would appear to make perhaps more sense to have very similar dry mass ratios for all fuel types, so that the player can actually compare different engines directly - unless you want to add hints to every single engine description about how good its available fuel tanks are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The same intransparency problem exists for fuel costs, which are currently very far apart from each other and only tenuously factored into engine design. But since it is a far less pressing issue, I\u0027m not going to bother with it right now until we\u0027ve figured the dry mass thing out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Should tanks really scale their mass ratios with size class? Neither stock KSP nor most other mods do this.
