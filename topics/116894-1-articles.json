MISSION SUCCESS!","CreatedByName":"FishInferno","CreatedById":106219,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T17:57:34Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"FishInferno","CreatedById":106219,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T17:57:34Z","Content":"UPDATE: The mission was a success, with the model flying straight and true both flights.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/u52YATuMMcQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nAs you can see in the video, I did actually swap out the streamer for a parachute last-minute.\n\nI had wanted to make one of arc5555\u0027s paper models for a long time, but I decided, why not take it one step further? Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you, No Parachute No Problem!\n\n![32zj3sw.jpg](http://i59.tinypic.com/32zj3sw.jpg)\n\nI know, I know, the name is kind of long, but the rocket does not, in fact, have a parachute. It uses a streamer. Plus, the name sounded very Kerbal to me. The rocket was made entirely of materials I had around the house, i bought nothing for this (except for the engine).\n\nExpected launch in under an hour, wish me luck!\n\nEDIT: I don\u0027t know why TnyPic rotated all of my pictures, sorry about that.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![2wbvrkh.jpg](http://i59.tinypic.com/2wbvrkh.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Here it is shown next to an Estes Alpha, for size comparison. I made the body like I would any other rocket, and I used papercraft parts as a \u0022skin\u0022.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![2074xhg.jpg](http://i61.tinypic.com/2074xhg.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E The fins were made by cutting out cardboard to the appropriate shape/size and gluing papercraft parts to the sides.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![23vjcki.jpg](http://i61.tinypic.com/23vjcki.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E The launch Lug is simply a straw cut down to size. An ugly but necessary part to any model rocket.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![34hjitt.jpg](http://i62.tinypic.com/34hjitt.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E The engine is mounted inside the cosmetic nozzle\n\u003E \n\u003E ![wthfkz.jpg](http://i58.tinypic.com/wthfkz.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E This rocket is a rear-eject, meaning that the engine section pops out of the rocket with the parachute instead of the nosecone. The shock cord is made from rubber bands and the streamer is a cut up garbage bag.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nAll credit goes to arc5555 for his [KSP Paper Models](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84621-Paper-Space-Program-%28-a-k-a-KSP-Rocket-Parts-Papercraft%29/page36)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-28T01:57:52Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2015 01:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FishInferno**"},{"CreatedByName":"arc5555","CreatedById":103212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T18:52:31Z","Content":"The parachute mechanism is kind of crazy ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) I love it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Can\u0027t wait for the launch results !"},{"CreatedByName":"FishInferno","CreatedById":106219,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T21:04:12Z","Content":"it worked!!!!!!"},{"CreatedByName":"arc5555","CreatedById":103212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T21:15:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E it worked!!!!!!\n\nThat\u0027s really cool !
