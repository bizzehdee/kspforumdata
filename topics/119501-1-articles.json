For example, if it takes you 1,000 m/s to go to the Mun (a 860 m/s transfer plus a 140 m/s capture and circularize), then going back to the same low Kerbin orbit you started from, will also cost you 1,000 m/s (this time a 250 m/s transfer and a 750 m/s circularize).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe nice thing with Kerbin is the atmosphere, so you can always aerobrake/direct EDL and skimp on the orbit insertion and circularization dV.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T16:02:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost of the delta-V maps you\u0027ll come across (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96985-1-0-2-WAC-s-Delta-V-Map-(24-05-2015)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elike these\u003C/a\u003E) will have arrows on them indicating \u0022aerobraking possible\u0022. Where those exist, you can essentially discount any delta-V requirement for the return trip entirely. For example, a Mun orbit takes 1,170 delta-V - 860 to get the intercept from LKO, then 310 to get from the intercept to LMO. The return trip, however, only requires the 310 to escape the Mun\u0027s SOI; 860 for the return flight isn\u0027t necessary because you can aerobrake back down to LKO (and beyond).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor planning purposes, until you get the hang of it, you might put a little margin in for where aerobraking maneuvers are indicated. Even then, you don\u0027t need much - 50 m/s tops. A small supply of RCS fuel and a few blocks might cover it as well. When I was first starting out I\u0027d plan for the various phases of my missions with 125% of the indicated delta-V requirement (to have a little safety margin in case of screw up) and in almost every case it worked well (the exception being Moho, because there are special guidelines to follow when you\u0027re shooting for Moho\u0027s orbit...).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SchweinAero","CreatedById":126909,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T16:14:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere are some examples, based on \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/V4FHldK.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis chart\u003C/a\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin -\u0026gt; Eve 4540 m/s (3500 to low orbit \u002B 1040 to transfer \u002B aerocapture/braking to surface)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve -\u0026gt; Kerbin 8500 m/s (7000 to low orbit \u002B 1500 to transfer \u002B aerocapture/braking to surface)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin -\u0026gt; Duna 4580 m/s (3500 to low orbit \u002B 1080 to transfer \u002B aerocapture/braking to surface)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna -\u0026gt; Kerbin 2240 m/s (1500 to low orbit \u002B 740 to transfer \u002B aerocapture/braking to surface)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin -\u0026gt; Dres 5060 m/s (3500 to low orbit \u002B 1560 to transfer \u002B 1140 to capture \u002B 150 to low orbit \u002B 430 to surface)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDres -\u0026gt; Kerbin 1720 m/s (430 to low orbit \u002B 1290 to transfer \u002B aerocapture/braking to surface)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cairol","CreatedById":145279,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T16:20:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you all.
