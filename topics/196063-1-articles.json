You\u0027d drop 15-20$cad(1983)\u00A0for a box of ten disks. Sure, it\u0027s half the price of a game. But, you also needed the copying software, which could\u00A0be difficult to find. Then you needed to know somebody that had a copy and was willing to share. It was often faster and easier to flip burgers to earn enough to buy it than to track down a copy. There was DRM then, either based on the disk itself, based on feelies included with the game, or a serial number. Higher end software used dongles, or its usability was tied to specialist equipment. There was the early precursors to the internet around back then. But, it was a similar, and additional problems, you had to find a BBS that had what you were looking for, wasn\u0027t long distance, and that nobody picked up the phone while you were hunting or trying to download it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese days it is easier to find and get. Though finding a clean source, and clean supplemental software can range from tricky to difficult depending on the software and how deep you\u0027re willing to dive.

Yes, internet connection is almost ubiquity nowadays, but it does not means it is. Or that it\u0027s cheap and affordable for everyone.
