My name\u0027s Tim, I\u0027m 28 and addicted to KSP. It kept popping up on Steam and stuck out. After reading the reviews I bought it, loved it, have spent hours a day on it after work for a couple weeks now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOriginally I wouldn\u0027t get far into the careers I\u0027d start because I\u0027d find another mod I wanted to try and would begin a new career each time but now I\u0027m settled on my combo and am trotting along.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a question though and hoping someone could help me - Are there rival agencies in KSP? After a few weeks (or days I don\u0027t know when they appear) I start to notice different colored orbits when I\u0027m in map mode. They\u0027re not any of my ships and always have the name of some in-game company. So basically other companies are in space as well....The one that pushed me over the line and caused me to register to ask this question just popped up and is orbiting very close to the sun....It belongs to Zaltonic Electronics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a feature of the base game (competition)? I have several mods installed so it could be that. I\u0027m just curious. Suddenly I feel like I lost because travelling so close to the sun is way beyond anything I\u0027d be doing right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, I\u0027m glad to be registered here because of how into this game I am. I look forward to chatting with you guys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETimmy T.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T13:11:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe orbits that appear are targets being offered as contracts.

Back before I finally settled on a few favorites, I was constantly ditching saves or missions because I found a nifty new mod I wanted to try out that would change too many of the basic rules to make continuing with the current save really viable. Sometimes it\u0027s like eating popcorn; it\u0027s hard to stop at just one \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think Pecan has pretty well answered your original question. Rival space agencies are an oft-requested feature, but as of yet, it\u0027s just you, plus a few corporations you can take contracts from. There\u0027s no rivals to compete against; the only limiting factors are tech, funds, and your own self-imposed mission goals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have any further questions about the game, feel free to ask; we won\u0027t bite, and quite a few of our users are more than happy to help out new players. You may also want to take a look at some of the tutorials that I\u0027ve listed in the Drawing Board, which is conveniently available through the link in my signature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps, and happy launching!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
