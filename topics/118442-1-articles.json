After 5 launches, I\u0027ve yet to get to the first staging event without toppling. I assume Mechjeb is likely more accurate and can feather the controls to orbit. I\u0027ll keep trying on manual...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 2: Made it to orbit finally by resorting to vertical ascent until drag forces were minimal, then transitioning to horizontal - so it may work with old school .25 trajectories but with 1.x it seems to be unable to respond to a proper gravity turn. I believe this is due to the fuel drain and shifting of the CoM during ascent. Still need some work. So I finally voted \u0027Detailed\u0022. Good job, but still can benefit from further work.
