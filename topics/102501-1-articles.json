It is basically what it would be like if I had the keys to the vehicle. That is why the textures are kind of aweful. I was trying to stay true to the Bird of Prey in the movies. This time the textures are very detailed and well placed as well as some other improvements such as disruptor cannons that extend and missiles peaking out of missile bays which open up in battle mode."}]}
