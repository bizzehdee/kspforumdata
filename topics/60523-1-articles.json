Jeb took one of the rovers down to the farside crater to grab some science missed during my original Mun missions and, despite wasting quite a bit of fuel on the descent, was able to rendezvous with the station (had to scrub the last 16m/s of relative velocity with RCS). The trouble comes when trying to dock. No matter how slowly I approach the port, Jeb always gets thrown out of his command seat when the rover docks and gets killed by hitting something (usually the materials lab on the rover). I can be approaching the port at 0.1 m/s and, once the magnets start pulling me in, thrust back with RCS to prevent the speed building up, and still he manages to die. Given he can withstand impact with the ground at many tens of m/s, I don\u0027t see why such a little bump should make him disintegrate...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried EVA but the rover doesn\u0027t have any remote control so that will only let me switch him for some other unlucky sacrificial victim.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks like I\u0027m going to have to make some changes to the rovers but would it be better to add remote control or make some other change that will stop the pilot getting wasted...?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone fancies taking a look then it is \u0022KSS Mun Rover Beta\u0022 in this save game, currently a few tens of metres from the docking port on the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/nufitujts132pqf/V23.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EZipped save file\u003C/a\u003E (stock \u002B KER and alarm clock)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Pad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T17:32:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry docking and then right before they get close enough Eva him.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T19:44:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup, I agree with technical kerbal.

If not you may want to send up a new set with at least the smallest core. Have jeb ride the thing up close and then just EVA over and get into the main ship and let the probe handle the docking by remote. Its probably just a weird glitch of the physics engine causing the kracken to devourer anybody on the command seat when the docking happens. I doubt any mods could fix that unless theres one that causes the external seat to be treated like a full command pod so the kerbals cant be unseated by G forces.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T12:34:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, but I said most of that in the original post. I can live with the \u0022leave seat just before port contact\u0022 method for now but if they don\u0027t fix the issues with the command seats apparently not having any sort of seat belt/harness then I could do with being able to assign leave seat to an action group (might be tricky to support more than one at once as you auto-switch to the Kerbal when he gets off so the game would have to decide which Kerbal to switch to).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I said \u0022craft mods\u0022 I was referring to making modifications to the rover (e.g. the position of the seat or something) so that the forces during docking don\u0027t throw the pilot out. I can\u0027t believe that every vehicle with a command seat does this when docking so I assume it has something to do with the relative position and orientation of the docking port and seat. My rover design (and launch method) doesn\u0027t really allow for much of a change. I may be able to stick the chair further forward on the lander can which might stop him hitting the materials lab but there is a 2x3 solar panel and a 4-way rcs block on the front of the can that may interfere. I guess I\u0027ll have a play around and test it on the identical station I have in 200km Kerbin orbit. I could do with more practice launching to rendezvous anyway... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
