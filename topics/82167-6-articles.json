As an undergrad in astrophysics I taught 9th grade science at my church\u0027s private school. So I am happy that access is being provided to schools. However, I know, personally, many families that homeschool their children and who could benefit from this and though my own 4 children have not as of yet reached school age I very possibly may end up homeschooling them as well and very much look forward to the opportunity to use this as an educational tool for them also. In any case my point is I hope KerbalEDU does not get institutionalized leaving the rest of us out in the cold.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-21T00:13:55Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2014 12:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by mcirish3\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T00:57:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rune\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rune\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhere did you read this?
