It is a useful mission in game due to the reclaim value of spent sats and a lot easier to do in terms of physics than a Utilitarial Commendation which is why, re Camaron\u0027s suggestion, I think its not worth over-complicating the K-Prize rules to add another award for a lesser achievement imho (it would at least require another proviso for command pods and solar panels for example). This is because some newcomers find the rules a bit involved already plus I have to award all prizes by hand, so more complicated for me too. If the K-Prize could be scripted as an in game mission mod then it could be worth adding a \u0022Scrapcycle Credit\u0022 or something. I am not working on such a mod myself, though I would invite anyone who is capable of making it and into the idea to feel free to PM me. Its still a nice mission I agree, just a bit beyond the K-Prize remit which is really about seeing how far you can go and how much you can take with you in a reusable spaceplane, as an incentive to Kerbal spaceplane engineers... to visit the Dog and Booster! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astrobond","CreatedById":127649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T23:28:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi All \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my next Biomes Catcher mission to Eeloo, i wanted to try my new MK3 SSTO Plane as lifter...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery versatile and easy to fly, full stock \u002B KER\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E36 Tons max payload (tested with the big orange tank)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E275893 Funds, 56 Tons without Payload, 240 Parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this mission, the payload was 32.2 Tons in Spaceplane Hangar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECost to lift the payload at 90km: 1013 Funds\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the album:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/jYwQD\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Took a number of versions, as there were problems at high altitude (28 km or above) with the plane pitching up out of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI finally came across a way to get extra pitch-down force, when flying a prototype that had two Rapiers mounted near the nose, one above and one below. I could toggle the bottom Rapier off, so that the upper Rapier thrust made the nose pitch down. I sort of stumbled across that idea in the middle of an attempted climb with another prototype. Once I realized how well that could work, I went back to an earlier prototype, which had better Delta-V, and added that fix including action groups for each engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic idea for the plane was to use Mk2 tanks, because they produce some lift. I did not think it would be practical to try to do a horizontal \u0022glide\u0022 landing on Duna, so it would need to come down vertically, using a mix of chutes and some rocket thrust to slow the final landing. So to make it more stable to not fall over easily, it uses four outer fuselage/tanks for wide spacing for the legs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used RCS Balancer to see the CG changes due to fuel burnoff. This led to putting most of the engines on pods mounted near the nose. There is a MAJOR bug that KSP has had and I fear will never be fixed, the gimbal control does not reverse steering when the engine is in front of the CG. But the aerodynamic control surfaces do reverse, so I do not understand why the engines do not (NovaPunch has some great Vernier liquid engines that do reverse steering when in front of the CG). That is part of Basic Rocket Science that ought to be fixed. So, anyway, I had to lock the gimbals of the engines up front. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#B22222;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E - I forgot to mention why I had asked about bringing back a payload that the SSTO had not brought up. It was not for a special extra, it was for utility. The SSTO prototype at the time had a significant CG shift due to fuel loss. So the idea was to dock with a payload of suitable mass to bring the CG back to where it was when fully fueled, before re-entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission is documented in the Imgur album. It has a few surprises and some technical details about the combined ISP when using one LV-N, two Rapiers, and/or two 48/7S engines (see the images of the launch and climb to orbit from Duna).

Eight are there to help make sure if can be controlled in pitch like my last SSTO (Duna and Eve missions), action groups to shut down lower Rapiers to pitch down as needed to fight pitch-up tendencies at high altitude. And one in the center so that I could easily manually toggle it from airbreathing to closed cycle and back as needed (do not like to use action groups for that because accidentally hitting the wrong key during airbreathing conditions without noticing wastes lots of fuel and oxidizer). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fksaBSC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022fksaBSC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the climb to higher altitudes, used Mechjeb to keep engines from flaming out randomly.

Biggest issue is leveling off at 23-26 km to make a good speed run before climbing higher. It wants to go so fast in the initial climb towards 20 km that it can easily blow past right on an apoapsis of 30 km or higher, even above 70 km, before achieving enough horizontal velocity to make orbit on rocket power alone. The glide handling is great too. For more Dv, it could have an extra tank pair or two adde, but watch out for the CG change if you do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/edKbYma.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022edKbYma.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Cargo SSTO is a reasonable workhorse.
