Welcome to the guest list for the K-Prize party. \n\nMesklin has become the latest to break the minimalist record with the diminutive Brynhildr, well played. \n\nraygundan to explain the awards for your ingenious second mission, the K-Prize applies to the entire craft, there are precedents for turning the command pod into a rover or lander (which is a worthy feat but does not count as payload delivery) and the rule is that the awards only count up to the point the craft splits or from the point of reassembly. I hope that makes sense and is agreeable for you. \n\nInteresting VTOL deployment btw WhiteKnuckle.\n\nGeorgeG currently your payload return mission would count as an Advanced Pilot Precision Award for docking in orbit and is perfectly in keeping with the K-Prize mission under the circumstances you describe. It is a useful mission in game due to the reclaim value of spent sats and a lot easier to do in terms of physics than a Utilitarial Commendation which is why, re Camaron\u0027s suggestion, I think its not worth over-complicating the K-Prize rules to add another award for a lesser achievement imho (it would at least require another proviso for command pods and solar panels for example). This is because some newcomers find the rules a bit involved already plus I have to award all prizes by hand, so more complicated for me too. If the K-Prize could be scripted as an in game mission mod then it could be worth adding a \u0022Scrapcycle Credit\u0022 or something. I am not working on such a mod myself, though I would invite anyone who is capable of making it and into the idea to feel free to PM me. Its still a nice mission I agree, just a bit beyond the K-Prize remit which is really about seeing how far you can go and how much you can take with you in a reusable spaceplane, as an incentive to Kerbal spaceplane engineers... to visit the Dog and Booster! ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"astrobond","CreatedById":127649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T23:28:00Z","Content":"Hi All ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nFor my next Biomes Catcher mission to Eeloo, i wanted to try my new MK3 SSTO Plane as lifter...\n\nVery versatile and easy to fly, full stock \u002B KER\n\n36 Tons max payload (tested with the big orange tank)\n\n275893 Funds, 56 Tons without Payload, 240 Parts\n\nFor this mission, the payload was 32.2 Tons in Spaceplane Hangar\n\nCost to lift the payload at 90km: 1013 Funds\n\nHere is the album:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Took a number of versions, as there were problems at high altitude (28 km or above) with the plane pitching up out of control.\n\nI finally came across a way to get extra pitch-down force, when flying a prototype that had two Rapiers mounted near the nose, one above and one below. I could toggle the bottom Rapier off, so that the upper Rapier thrust made the nose pitch down. I sort of stumbled across that idea in the middle of an attempted climb with another prototype. Once I realized how well that could work, I went back to an earlier prototype, which had better Delta-V, and added that fix including action groups for each engine.\n\nThe basic idea for the plane was to use Mk2 tanks, because they produce some lift. I did not think it would be practical to try to do a horizontal \u0022glide\u0022 landing on Duna, so it would need to come down vertically, using a mix of chutes and some rocket thrust to slow the final landing. So to make it more stable to not fall over easily, it uses four outer fuselage/tanks for wide spacing for the legs. \n\nI used RCS Balancer to see the CG changes due to fuel burnoff. This led to putting most of the engines on pods mounted near the nose. There is a MAJOR bug that KSP has had and I fear will never be fixed, the gimbal control does not reverse steering when the engine is in front of the CG. But the aerodynamic control surfaces do reverse, so I do not understand why the engines do not (NovaPunch has some great Vernier liquid engines that do reverse steering when in front of the CG). That is part of Basic Rocket Science that ought to be fixed. So, anyway, I had to lock the gimbals of the engines up front. \n\n**EDIT** - I forgot to mention why I had asked about bringing back a payload that the SSTO had not brought up. It was not for a special extra, it was for utility. The SSTO prototype at the time had a significant CG shift due to fuel loss. So the idea was to dock with a payload of suitable mass to bring the CG back to where it was when fully fueled, before re-entry.\n\nThe mission is documented in the Imgur album. It has a few surprises and some technical details about the combined ISP when using one LV-N, two Rapiers, and/or two 48/7S engines (see the images of the launch and climb to orbit from Duna).

I figure somebody has probably done something like it. \n\nSince the goal was to simply be able to carry a specific payload into LKO, the cargo SSTO was not optimized. I gave it more engines for the mass than for my other big ones. That was to make it easier and faster to climb high enough to do the speed run, and get into orbit easier. Has enough TWR to do a vertical climb after takeoff. \n\nSo, it has nine Rapiers. Eight are there to help make sure if can be controlled in pitch like my last SSTO (Duna and Eve missions), action groups to shut down lower Rapiers to pitch down as needed to fight pitch-up tendencies at high altitude. And one in the center so that I could easily manually toggle it from airbreathing to closed cycle and back as needed (do not like to use action groups for that because accidentally hitting the wrong key during airbreathing conditions without noticing wastes lots of fuel and oxidizer). \n\n![fksaBSC.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fksaBSC.jpg)\n\nFor the climb to higher altitudes, used Mechjeb to keep engines from flaming out randomly. As all engines began to lose thrust, to help keep the Rapiers at high enough thrust to control pitch, I shut down the outer 4 turbojets so the rest could share the air from the intakes and have higher thrust each. Then later another 4 turbojets in the tail, leaving only the two upper and lower turbojets.\n\nThat said, had a good bit of Delta-Vee left, and could have carried a heavier payload, but a heavy payload was not a goal.\n\nPayload tested out successfully.\n\n![kXACkXQ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/kXACkXQ.jpg)\n\nIt re-entered stably and landed safely. \n\n**- GeorgeG**\n\n![15qpezf.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/15qpezf.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-09T08:00:58Z\u0022 title=\u002202/09/2015 08:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GeorgeG**"},{"CreatedByName":"Styles2304","CreatedById":109841,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-10T08:27:31Z","Content":"And here\u0027s my entry - a modified SR-71.

The glide handling is great too. For more Dv, it could have an extra tank pair or two adde, but watch out for the CG change if you do.\n\n![edKbYma.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/edKbYma.jpg)\n\nThe Cargo SSTO is a reasonable workhorse. Not the most efficient, but no agonizingly long tedious climbs \u0022on the wing\u0022 like the Buh Hee Moth was. Take note that it needs to use TAC fuel balancer, set to balance fuel and oxidizer. If not, some of the jets will run out of fuel during the speed run.\n\n![8x2pL4n.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8x2pL4n.jpg)\n\nThe 2.9 meter SSTO is\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 unique! And also flies into orbit pretty nicely as the Corvette does.\n\n- GeorgeG"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-11T14:55:56Z","Content":"Fenya, of course, if you want to check rules see page 1 first post.\n\nReistlyn, did Pernach return safely without refuelling etc ?\n\nGeorgeG great rocketplane entry and enjoyed the secret cargo but unfortunately the K-Prize judges got hung up on a technicality, namely that cargo lift surfaces are not currently occluded.

And you would be right to declare it invalid if the Cargo SSTO had landed without the 2.9 meter SSTO that it took up. But\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6.. the Cargo SSTO space plane landed in the same aerodynamic configuration it took off in, with all the same parts. It did not jettison anything\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6. it undocked a part (the 2.9 meter SSTO) that then re-docked with it and landed with all the parts it had when it took off. So, I file an appeal to the Gate-Crasher verdict! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nBut for the sake of proving the Cargo SSTO can fly without the 2.9 meter SSTO, and more, I flew it again. And I added a different payload that had no wings. I was tempted to just keep the 2.9 meter SSTO but remove all the flying surfaces. But, instead, I gave it a very useful payload that could go fly off pretty far to somewhere, dock with something else for a big mission, or whatever one can do with that much fuel and and aerospike (originally it had an LV-N but there were problems as noted in the album).\n\nTakeofff mass of 148.66 tons, carrying a 39 ton payload.\n\nI added more pics to the Cargo SSTO album. But rather than click thru the album, you can go directly to the first image (#35) of this flight by using this link to the full album:\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/yDGR3#35](http://imgur.com/a/yDGR3#35)\n\nSo, the heavier payload meant it was a good thing that the Cargo SSTO has a lot of TWR. It had a slower climb and took longer to make orbit, using more fuel, but it made it easily, with 1369 m/s dV left.\n\n![FNB97Xm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/FNB97Xm.jpg)\n\nThe payload left the payload bay, then docked with the front of the SSTO for a brief while. Then undocked to go do its own thing. The SSTO cargo ship reentered fine and landed safely (see album for proof).\n\n- GeorgeG\n\n![WnYSVFr.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WnYSVFr.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-13T06:28:03Z\u0022 title=\u002202/13/2015 06:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GeorgeG**"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-13T15:49:02Z","Content":"ah so I did bodge something, you are right GeorgeG, my apologies, I have fixed it and added your latest mission, thanks.

Please correct me if I am wrong, I am just going by the screenshot with the missing wingtip. If you decide to complete the K-Prize with a successful landing (replaying from a save is recommended if possible) then the mission will qualify for the K-Prize and you have the right to choose whether to have the gatecrasher listing removed or kept.
