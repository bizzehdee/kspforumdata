However I noticed this break in the haze between the ground and atmosphere portions of the horizon that wasn\u0027t there before? This was on windows with force-OpenGL and RSS, I figured it was a clipping plane or camera distance issue however altering any of these values doesn\u0027t make a change.

I personally do not enjoy using this with clouds. Does anyone know any cloud mods that is jut a flat layer of high-res clouds or clouds that only come/fade into view after you pass a certain distance from the surface. I have noticed one bug though. When I start the game up such as loading a save, reverting to launch, or going to the launch pad or runway there is no atmosphere and the sky is all black. This bug is easily fixable by zooming way out until the atmosphere suddenly appears permanently until you go back to the space center but it is very annoying. Also I am running this on KSP x64.
