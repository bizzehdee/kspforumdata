I had the 360 controller for racing games, as I don\u0027t even own an Xbox, but the build quality of the 360 controllers rivals Logitech\u0027s very closely, and I have a lot of friends with 360\u0027s so I can use it at their house if I need to. I personally use the joystick for my rotation, and the little hat switch for translation, and two of the silver top buttons for the other axis. Works quite well, but for me, KSP would NOT recognize the hat switch as a digital or analog input. It was like it didn\u0027t exist. SO, what I recommend doing, if you\u0027d like to use the hat switch for something, is to use the little program Logitech provides, bind some keys to functions you want it to perform, then, in the Logitech utility, you can go and tell it to basically perform those keypresses. Now, the hat switch IS only digital, not analog, but that\u0027s fine. It works like a charm!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for me, the Logitech Extreme 3D pro is a great joystick, it does very well and I couldn\u0027t be happier with it.
