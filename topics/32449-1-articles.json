So instead in my component\u0027s Update function I call Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.F2). That will detect when the user presses the F2 button. When that happens, I toggle a bool variable of my own that is then used in my OnGUI function to control whether I run my GUI code or not. This seems to work fine, although it\u0027s in a mod I haven\u0027t released yet...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JDP","CreatedById":30775,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T22:08:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou could always just go the oldschool way of using RenderingManager:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ERenderingManager.AddToPostDrawQueue(3, new Callback(this.someMethodName));\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe callback will then be called in compliance with f2 behaviour.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nobody44","CreatedById":66369,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-17T11:00:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you guys.
