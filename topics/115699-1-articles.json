Depending on your TWR, you could either get to your target orbit well before your target is close enough, or you\u0027ll take so long your target will have made another orbit by the time you\u0027ve established yours (Though I think only Ion-engine level landers would be that slow)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, Minmus is fairly easy to get around, so I\u0027d say raise your targets orbit a bit (provided its a return ship and not a station) so you\u0027ll have a bit more wiggle room. IN general, rendezvous in very, very low orbits are going to be very tough as you\u0027ll likely have to go suborbital in order to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T10:08:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E10km isn\u0027t too low for Minmus. My station is at that altitude as well. Always make your orbit bigger than your target, that\u0027s how to do low orbit rendezvous. Using this approach I can do Kerbin 70~75km orbit rendezvous easily w/o ever touching atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T10:55:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEh, on Minmus all things are easier.
