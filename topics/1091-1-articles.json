Evidence must be taken to prove such great feats. Highest orbit will be measured from the perigee. So radical ellipticals be ware. You must then return to the surface of the planet safely, a safe landing or else! All parachutes deployed, with a m/s of 15 or less will be considered safe, if they blow up upon touch down due to terrain bug. My call. STANDARD PARTS ONLY. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no submission for this yet, but I do know my best so far has been a 500k, so I figure others out there can do a lot better. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Letum","CreatedById":4227,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-26T23:47:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell...if you can reach escape velocity and return, than you can orbit at any altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo to 1,000,000,000k and slow down to 0km/s and you may well be in a very, very slow orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"@@","CreatedById":4167,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-26T23:52:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGotta have some horizontal speed. 8)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-27T00:24:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would take forever to tell if you are in an orbit at some point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Letum","CreatedById":4227,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-27T01:29:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022@@\u0022 data-cite=\u0022@@\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGotta have some horizontal speed. 8)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYer, but at extreme altitudes, you need less than 0.00001kms to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the reading in 0.0kms, it\u0027s likely your just moving very slowly and at very high altitudes, that means you may well be orbiting.

I\\\u0027ve done this using only stock parts (I don\\\u0027t have any mods installed).
