Smaller launchpads would be cheaper to build and maintain than larger ones, but would put a limit on dimensions and mass of the rockets you can launch from them. Support facilities near the launchpad might be required to be able to use certain parts. But as long as launches can be done in zero-time, there would be no reason to have more than one launchpad. Just having a single one and upgrading it as soon as the player has the funds to spare would be sufficient. It would get more interesting when launches would require a preparation-time of several days. Then it would suddenly get interesting to have multiple launchpads so multiple launches can be prepared and performed in parallel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a sandbox-game where prep-time and budget are no constraint, the player could just spawn one of the largest and best-equipped launchpads possible.
