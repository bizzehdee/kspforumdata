Many people reported issues with latest FAR version due to new wing mass/strength feature. Those could be solved if you reduce weight/strength from 1.0 to 0.7 or 0.6. For me there is fun to create new craft instead using old ones. You can even recreate your old craft and improve better if you build it from scratch. When SQUAD release KSP 0.90 beta most probably we all have to rebuild our crafts from stratch due to lot of changes in VAB/SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-24T17:54:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Agost\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Agost\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve found another big issue!
