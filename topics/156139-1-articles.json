However on all but one of my bases I have built using this have had the issue of launching the Kerbal through the roof or floor. I tried putting chairs inside and having them board the chair then leave the seat (so they would be standing inside) but when I did that the Kerbal exploded. Am I doing something incredibly wrong?

There are \u0022regular\u0022 fairings with pointy tops. And there are \u0022interstage\u0022 fairings that are cylindrical at the top where they connect to the next stage. Interstage fairings are hollow inside. Regular fairings are solid inside. So what happens if you spawn a Kerbal inside an interstage fairing is that it works fine. OTOH, If you spawn a Kerbal inside a pointy fairing they get shot out the top or bottom or they die. So I\u0027m going to take a wild guess that you are using a pointy fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo fix it, all you need to do is put a nosecone above the fairing (on an interstage node). And then build the fairing to attach to the nosecone as an interstage fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-08T01:35:31Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2017 01:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 8, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
