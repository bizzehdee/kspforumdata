A dependency, as used most commonly in English, means something that is absolutely required for any part of what you are talking about to work. Think of say, Minecraft. It is dependant on Java. Without it, no part of Minecraft would work. That\u0027s what \u0022dependency\u0022 means. What you have are various requirements for particular features. And by using it as you have, you\u0027re putting across the notion that using, for example, the planet artwork for EVE is dependent on Chatterer to work. Hence my own confusion.

While you are correct in saying that having all of the mods listed are required to use the entire pack, that is still not an argument against providing clearer information in the OP. The OP\u0027s wording suggests that in order to use \u003Cstrong\u003Eany\u003C/strong\u003E part of the KSPRC pack, one must have \u003Cstrong\u003Eall\u003C/strong\u003E of the mods listed in the dependency list to work. This leads to logical conclusions of this sort: \u0022In order for the extra Chatterer sounds to work, I must have Environmental Visual Enhancements installed.\u0022 The reason I bothered asking in the first place is because this conclusion is fallacious. As you said \u0022common sense and even minimal knowledge of mods\u0022 is all one needs to determine that. That\u0027s why I even bothered asking, on the off-chance that in fact, my conclusion that the OP was wrong was wrong. It\u0027s not inconceivable that someone would do such a thorough up-rooting and re-coding of all of those mods and their functions that they really are all required for anything to work right.
