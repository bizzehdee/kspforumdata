I\u0027ve actually set this and forgot to reply back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@NathanKell, actually I find it very differently. With FAR I always had a really difficult time slowing planes down for a landing, and also couldn\u0027t get proper stalls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me it seems that FAR works well trans-sonic and above, but drag doesn\u0027t scale up properly going sub-sonic, planes could glide for a really long time without loosing altitude...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, this was the behavior back in 0.25 when I used to play and is the same now with the latest dev branch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to report it when they release or open another thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another note, I do think the new stock system works reasonably well, we just have to account for incorrect cubes when they happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that said, I\u0027m looking for a way to make the system a bit more realistic and challenging, harder stalls and more need for efficiency.
