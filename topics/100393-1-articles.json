I have tweaked the fuel so that it will drain from the back first and the fuel in the front will be used last. It will be always be stable now.\n**Action Groups**\n\n1 - Jet engines\n\n2 - Nuclear Engines\n\n0 - Ladder\n\n[**DOWNLOAD**](http://www./download/idmnumkfwfsk6wn/Xephos.craft)\n\n![x9a8HHz.png](http://i.imgur.com/x9a8HHz.png)\n![3lXiqEk.png](http://i.imgur.com/3lXiqEk.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-22T19:57:22Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2015 07:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by manni01**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T11:33:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/B5fz78x.png](http://i.imgur.com/B5fz78x.png)\n\u003E **Xephos - Mun or Minimus SSTO**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E One of my better Mun or Minimus SSTOs.

It flies fast and easily to orbit. The average KSP player should be able to fly this into orbit, to Mun and back. If newer, you should try Minimus. When not fully fueled, make sure to pump all fuel into the front tank. It will otherwise spin out of control. It is even a bit suspicious when the fuel is on the front, so glide carefully. I may upload a tweaked version where it is more stable after its orbital ballet. I attempted a video, but recording software pooped out a crash message rather than a video to edit.\n\u003E [**DOWNLOAD**](http://www./download/idmnumkfwfsk6wn/Xephos.craft)\n\nThis is seriously good looking! I would have a look at that CoM/CoL thing, probably by putting a bit more fuel on the back. That should make the CoM and CoL stay in the same place either full or empty, and that kind of powerplant can push more weight anyway. Extra points by working out a fuel routing system (all tanks feed into a single part, *then* to the engine), then you can have stable atmospheric flight at any fuel level.\n\nRune.
