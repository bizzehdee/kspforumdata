It would require launching it, finding it in the quicksave/persistence, creating a copy of each part it uses(like if it uses dockingPort2, make another part and name it for example dockingPort2_2), changing the name of every single part it is made of in the persistence/quicksave to the name of your copied parts, and then, finally, editing the textures used by copies to make them green. Maybe there is some other easier way, but this is the only one that comes to my mind.
