But all I could find is a very complicated way of doing this. Where you pass around a save file. But I wish to see a mod where it\u0027s a large scale game of risk, with live actions.. It would use some sub add-ons like BDarmory. But something that would add mechanics from risk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpecifically:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Live warfare\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Multiple Space Stations\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-A custom unlock system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Multiplayer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other side there could be a mod where it\u0027s like a space race. Where the first person to a certain point gets more technology. Over time they can get better technology into researching and developing. It doesn\u0027t have to have a finish. But if any of this sounds to complicated. Then maybe someone could find a different game like this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
