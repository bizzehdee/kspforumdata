station within Kerbin\u0027s SOI for the purpose of assisting interplanetary ships. \u00A0This has been discussed many times, based on all the various mod and stock refueling systems that have come out over the years, and the answer is still the same. \u00A0Because the KSP universe is so small, the practical benefit from doing this is so small that the system will never pay for itself, nor be worth the trouble of using. \u00A0You just never need more fuel than you can lift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then,\u00A0by the time you\u0027re doing interplanetary missions, lifter and transfer fuel is really a small fraction of the cost of a rocket---the payload is where you spend your money. \u00A0If you can afford the payload, you can afford to lift it and shoot it out from Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, things might be different if you use RSS or some other rescaled solar system, for the same reason that such ideas have some traction in the real world. \u00A0But in stock KSP, don\u0027t bother.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, back to the thread\u0027s title of interplanetary parking orbits, the best ones are the lowest you can manage. \u00A0Here\u0027s why....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo go to another planet, you need to reach Kerbin\u0027s escape velocity plus whatever extra is required to raise your Ap (or lower your Pe) to the altitude of your target. \u00A0Therefore, the higher your velocity to start with, the less dV you need to reach the required transfer velocity, and you have a higher starting velocity the closer you are to Kerbin. \u00A0In addition to this, the higher your velocity, the less fuel is required to create a given amount of dV, thanks to the Oberth effect. \u00A0Thus,\u00A0a ship in a higher orbit will require more fuel to create the same amount of dV than a ship in a lower orbit. \u00A0Therefore, the higher your parking orbit, the more dV you need to create, and the more fuel that dV costs, to get to the same place. \u00A0This means that the lowest possible parking orbit is the best---lower dV required and it\u0027s cheaper per unit of dV on fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHOWEVER, transfer burns take a non-zero amount of time, which means that at the start of the burn, your ship will be pointing off prograde and losing efficiency. \u00A0In fact, it will be pointing at Kerbin somewhat. \u00A0Thus, if your burn is more than about 5 minutes (which is about 20% of an orbit around Kerbin in LKO), you lose a lot of efficiency to cosine loss. \u00A0And if your starting orbit is too low, you might even push yourself down into the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore, if your burn time is 5 minutes or less, start in about an 80km orbit. \u00A0If it\u0027s 6-7 mintues, maybe start at 100km. \u00A0If it\u0027s any longer than that, either do the burn in multiple passes or start in an orbit big enough to minimize the cosine loss and just accept the higher dV required and the reduced Oberth efficiency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, if you\u0027ve got a really long burn (10-20 minutes, or even more), then odds are you\u0027re using some really super-efficient but very low-thrust transfer engine. \u00A0In which case, you\u0027ve probably got enough fuel in the tank to go anywhere you want so don\u0027t care about the loss of efficiency from starting in a high orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-02T18:50:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe
