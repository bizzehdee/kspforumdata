By contrast,\n\u003E \n\u003E the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\n\u003E \n\u003E share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\n\u003E \n\u003E software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\n\u003E \n\u003E GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\n\u003E \n\u003E any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to\n\u003E \n\u003E your programs, too.\n\u003E \n\u003E  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n\u003E \n\u003E price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n\u003E \n\u003E have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n\u003E \n\u003E them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n\u003E \n\u003E want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n\u003E \n\u003E free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\u003E \n\u003E  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n\u003E \n\u003E these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have\n\u003E \n\u003E certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\n\u003E \n\u003E you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\u003E \n\u003E  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n\u003E \n\u003E gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\n\u003E \n\u003E freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive\n\u003E \n\u003E or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they\n\u003E \n\u003E know their rights.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n\u003E \n\u003E (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n\u003E \n\u003E giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\u003E \n\u003E  For the developers\u0027 and authors\u0027 protection, the GPL clearly explains\n\u003E \n\u003E that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users\u0027 and\n\u003E \n\u003E authors\u0027 sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\n\u003E \n\u003E changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\n\u003E \n\u003E authors of previous versions.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\n\u003E \n\u003E modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\n\u003E \n\u003E can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\n\u003E \n\u003E protecting users\u0027 freedom to change the software. The systematic\n\u003E \n\u003E pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\n\u003E \n\u003E use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we\n\u003E \n\u003E have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n\u003E \n\u003E products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\n\u003E \n\u003E stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\n\u003E \n\u003E of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n\u003E \n\u003E States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n\u003E \n\u003E software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\n\u003E \n\u003E avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\n\u003E \n\u003E make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that\n\u003E \n\u003E patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\u003E \n\u003E  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n\u003E \n\u003E modification follow.\n\u003E \n\u003E  TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\u003E \n\u003E  0. Definitions.\n\u003E \n\u003E  \u0022This License\u0022 refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\u003E \n\u003E  \u0022Copyright\u0022 also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\n\u003E \n\u003E works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\u003E \n\u003E  \u0022The Program\u0022 refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\n\u003E \n\u003E License. Each licensee is addressed as \u0022you\u0022. \u0022Licensees\u0022 and\n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022recipients\u0022 may be individuals or organizations.\n\u003E \n\u003E  To \u0022modify\u0022 a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\n\u003E \n\u003E in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\n\u003E \n\u003E exact copy. The resulting work is called a \u0022modified version\u0022 of the\n\u003E \n\u003E earlier work or a work \u0022based on\u0022 the earlier work.\n\u003E \n\u003E  A \u0022covered work\u0022 means either the unmodified Program or a work based\n\u003E \n\u003E on the Program.\n\u003E \n\u003E  To \u0022propagate\u0022 a work means to do anything with it that, without\n\u003E \n\u003E permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\n\u003E \n\u003E infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\n\u003E \n\u003E computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,\n\u003E \n\u003E distribution (with or without modification), making available to the\n\u003E \n\u003E public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\u003E \n\u003E  To \u0022convey\u0022 a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\n\u003E \n\u003E parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through\n\u003E \n\u003E a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\u003E \n\u003E  An interactive user interface displays \u0022Appropriate Legal Notices\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\n\u003E \n\u003E feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\n\u003E \n\u003E tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\n\u003E \n\u003E extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\n\u003E \n\u003E work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If\n\u003E \n\u003E the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\n\u003E \n\u003E menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\u003E \n\u003E  1. Source Code.\n\u003E \n\u003E  The \u0022source code\u0022 for a work means the preferred form of the work\n\u003E \n\u003E for making modifications to it. \u0022Object code\u0022 means any non-source\n\u003E \n\u003E form of a work.\n\u003E \n\u003E  A \u0022Standard Interface\u0022 means an interface that either is an official\n\u003E \n\u003E standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\n\u003E \n\u003E interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\n\u003E \n\u003E is widely used among developers working in that language.\n\u003E \n\u003E  The \u0022System Libraries\u0022 of an executable work include anything, other\n\u003E \n\u003E than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\n\u003E \n\u003E packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\n\u003E \n\u003E Component, and (![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) serves only to enable use of the work with that\n\u003E \n\u003E Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\n\u003E \n\u003E implementation is available to the public in source code form. A\n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022Major Component\u0022, in this context, means a major essential component\n\u003E \n\u003E (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n\u003E \n\u003E (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\n\u003E \n\u003E produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\u003E \n\u003E  The \u0022Corresponding Source\u0022 for a work in object code form means all\n\u003E \n\u003E the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\n\u003E \n\u003E work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\n\u003E \n\u003E control those activities. However, it does not include the work\u0027s\n\u003E \n\u003E System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\n\u003E \n\u003E programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\n\u003E \n\u003E which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source\n\u003E \n\u003E includes interface definition files associated with source files for\n\u003E \n\u003E the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\n\u003E \n\u003E linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\n\u003E \n\u003E such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\n\u003E \n\u003E subprograms and other parts of the work.\n\u003E \n\u003E  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\n\u003E \n\u003E can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\n\u003E \n\u003E Source.\n\u003E \n\u003E  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\n\u003E \n\u003E same work.\n\u003E \n\u003E  2. Basic Permissions.\n\u003E \n\u003E  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\n\u003E \n\u003E copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\n\u003E \n\u003E conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\n\u003E \n\u003E permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a\n\u003E \n\u003E covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\n\u003E \n\u003E content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your\n\u003E \n\u003E rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\u003E \n\u003E  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\n\u003E \n\u003E convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\n\u003E \n\u003E in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\n\u003E \n\u003E of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\n\u003E \n\u003E with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\n\u003E \n\u003E the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\n\u003E \n\u003E not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works\n\u003E \n\u003E for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\n\u003E \n\u003E and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\n\u003E \n\u003E your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\n\u003E \n\u003E the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\n\u003E \n\u003E makes it unnecessary.\n\u003E \n\u003E  3. Protecting Users\u0027 Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\u003E \n\u003E  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\n\u003E \n\u003E measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n\u003E \n\u003E 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\n\u003E \n\u003E similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\n\u003E \n\u003E measures.\n\u003E \n\u003E  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\n\u003E \n\u003E circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\n\u003E \n\u003E is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\n\u003E \n\u003E the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\n\u003E \n\u003E modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work\u0027s\n\u003E \n\u003E users, your or third parties\u0027 legal rights to forbid circumvention of\n\u003E \n\u003E technological measures.\n\u003E \n\u003E  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\u003E \n\u003E  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program\u0027s source code as you\n\u003E \n\u003E receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n\u003E \n\u003E appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\n\u003E \n\u003E keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\n\u003E \n\u003E non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\n\u003E \n\u003E keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\n\u003E \n\u003E recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\u003E \n\u003E  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\n\u003E \n\u003E and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\u003E \n\u003E  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\u003E \n\u003E  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\n\u003E \n\u003E produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\n\u003E \n\u003E terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\u003E \n\u003E  a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n\u003E \n\u003E  it, and giving a relevant date.\n\u003E \n\u003E  ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n\u003E \n\u003E  released under this License and any conditions added under section\n\u003E \n\u003E  7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n\u003E \n\u003E  \u0022keep intact all notices\u0022.\n\u003E \n\u003E  c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n\u003E \n\u003E  License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This\n\u003E \n\u003E  License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n\u003E \n\u003E  additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n\u003E \n\u003E  regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no\n\u003E \n\u003E  permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n\u003E \n\u003E  invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\u003E \n\u003E  d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n\u003E \n\u003E  Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n\u003E \n\u003E  interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n\u003E \n\u003E  work need not make them do so.\n\u003E \n\u003E  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\n\u003E \n\u003E works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\n\u003E \n\u003E and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\n\u003E \n\u003E in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022aggregate\u0022 if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\n\u003E \n\u003E used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation\u0027s users\n\u003E \n\u003E beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work\n\u003E \n\u003E in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\n\u003E \n\u003E parts of the aggregate.\n\u003E \n\u003E  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\u003E \n\u003E  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\n\u003E \n\u003E of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\n\u003E \n\u003E machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\n\u003E \n\u003E in one of these ways:\n\u003E \n\u003E  a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n\u003E \n\u003E  (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n\u003E \n\u003E  Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n\u003E \n\u003E  customarily used for software interchange.\n\u003E \n\u003E  ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n\u003E \n\u003E  (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n\u003E \n\u003E  written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n\u003E \n\u003E  long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n\u003E \n\u003E  model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n\u003E \n\u003E  copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n\u003E \n\u003E  product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n\u003E \n\u003E  medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n\u003E \n\u003E  more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n\u003E \n\u003E  conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n\u003E \n\u003E  Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\u003E \n\u003E  c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n\u003E \n\u003E  written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This\n\u003E \n\u003E  alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n\u003E \n\u003E  only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n\u003E \n\u003E  with subsection 6b.\n\u003E \n\u003E  d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n\u003E \n\u003E  place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n\u003E \n\u003E  Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n\u003E \n\u003E  further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the\n\u003E \n\u003E  Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to\n\u003E \n\u003E  copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n\u003E \n\u003E  may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n\u003E \n\u003E  that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n\u003E \n\u003E  clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n\u003E \n\u003E  Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the\n\u003E \n\u003E  Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n\u003E \n\u003E  available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\u003E \n\u003E  e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n\u003E \n\u003E  you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n\u003E \n\u003E  Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n\u003E \n\u003E  charge under subsection 6d.\n\u003E \n\u003E  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\n\u003E \n\u003E from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\n\u003E \n\u003E included in conveying the object code work.\n\u003E \n\u003E  A \u0022User Product\u0022 is either (1) a \u0022consumer product\u0022, which means any\n\u003E \n\u003E tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\n\u003E \n\u003E or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\n\u003E \n\u003E into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\n\u003E \n\u003E doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular\n\u003E \n\u003E product received by a particular user, \u0022normally used\u0022 refers to a\n\u003E \n\u003E typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\n\u003E \n\u003E of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\n\u003E \n\u003E actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product\n\u003E \n\u003E is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\n\u003E \n\u003E commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\n\u003E \n\u003E the only significant mode of use of the product.\n\u003E \n\u003E  \u0022Installation Information\u0022 for a User Product means any methods,\n\u003E \n\u003E procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\n\u003E \n\u003E and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\n\u003E \n\u003E a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must\n\u003E \n\u003E suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\n\u003E \n\u003E code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\n\u003E \n\u003E modification has been made.\n\u003E \n\u003E  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\n\u003E \n\u003E specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\n\u003E \n\u003E part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\n\u003E \n\u003E User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\n\u003E \n\u003E fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\n\u003E \n\u003E Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\n\u003E \n\u003E by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply\n\u003E \n\u003E if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\n\u003E \n\u003E modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\n\u003E \n\u003E been installed in ROM).\n\u003E \n\u003E  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\n\u003E \n\u003E requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\n\u003E \n\u003E for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\n\u003E \n\u003E the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a\n\u003E \n\u003E network may be denied when the modification itself materially and\n\u003E \n\u003E adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\n\u003E \n\u003E protocols for communication across the network.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\n\u003E \n\u003E in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\n\u003E \n\u003E documented (and with an implementation available to the public in\n\u003E \n\u003E source code form), and must require no special password or key for\n\u003E \n\u003E unpacking, reading or copying.\n\u003E \n\u003E  7. Additional Terms.\n\u003E \n\u003E  \u0022Additional permissions\u0022 are terms that supplement the terms of this\n\u003E \n\u003E License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\n\u003E \n\u003E Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\n\u003E \n\u003E be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\n\u003E \n\u003E that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions\n\u003E \n\u003E apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\n\u003E \n\u003E under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\n\u003E \n\u003E this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\u003E \n\u003E  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\n\u003E \n\u003E remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\n\u003E \n\u003E it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\n\u003E \n\u003E removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place\n\u003E \n\u003E additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\n\u003E \n\u003E for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\n\u003E \n\u003E add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\n\u003E \n\u003E that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\u003E \n\u003E  a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n\u003E \n\u003E  terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\u003E \n\u003E  ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n\u003E \n\u003E  author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n\u003E \n\u003E  Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\u003E \n\u003E  c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n\u003E \n\u003E  requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n\u003E \n\u003E  reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\u003E \n\u003E  d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n\u003E \n\u003E  authors of the material; or\n\u003E \n\u003E  e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n\u003E \n\u003E  trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\u003E \n\u003E  f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n\u003E \n\u003E  material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n\u003E \n\u003E  it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n\u003E \n\u003E  any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n\u003E \n\u003E  those licensors and authors.\n\u003E \n\u003E  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \u0022further\n\u003E \n\u003E restrictions\u0022 within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you\n\u003E \n\u003E received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\n\u003E \n\u003E governed by this License along with a term that is a further\n\u003E \n\u003E restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains\n\u003E \n\u003E a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\n\u003E \n\u003E License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\n\u003E \n\u003E of that license document, provided that the further restriction does\n\u003E \n\u003E not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\u003E \n\u003E  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\n\u003E \n\u003E must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\n\u003E \n\u003E additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\n\u003E \n\u003E where to find the applicable terms.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\n\u003E \n\u003E form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\n\u003E \n\u003E the above requirements apply either way.\n\u003E \n\u003E  8. Termination.\n\u003E \n\u003E  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\n\u003E \n\u003E provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\n\u003E \n\u003E modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\n\u003E \n\u003E this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\n\u003E \n\u003E paragraph of section 11).\n\u003E \n\u003E  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\n\u003E \n\u003E license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\n\u003E \n\u003E provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\n\u003E \n\u003E finally terminates your license, and (![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) permanently, if the copyright\n\u003E \n\u003E holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\n\u003E \n\u003E prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n\u003E \n\u003E reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\n\u003E \n\u003E violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\n\u003E \n\u003E received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\n\u003E \n\u003E copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\n\u003E \n\u003E your receipt of the notice.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\n\u003E \n\u003E licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\n\u003E \n\u003E this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\n\u003E \n\u003E reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\n\u003E \n\u003E material under section 10.\n\u003E \n\u003E  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\u003E \n\u003E  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\n\u003E \n\u003E run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n\u003E \n\u003E occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n\u003E \n\u003E to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\n\u003E \n\u003E nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\n\u003E \n\u003E modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do\n\u003E \n\u003E not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\n\u003E \n\u003E covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\u003E \n\u003E  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n\u003E \n\u003E receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\n\u003E \n\u003E propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible\n\u003E \n\u003E for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\u003E \n\u003E  An \u0022entity transaction\u0022 is a transaction transferring control of an\n\u003E \n\u003E organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\n\u003E \n\u003E organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered\n\u003E \n\u003E work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\n\u003E \n\u003E transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\n\u003E \n\u003E licenses to the work the party\u0027s predecessor in interest had or could\n\u003E \n\u003E give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n\u003E \n\u003E Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\n\u003E \n\u003E the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\u003E \n\u003E  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n\u003E \n\u003E rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may\n\u003E \n\u003E not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\n\u003E \n\u003E rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n\u003E \n\u003E (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\n\u003E \n\u003E any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\n\u003E \n\u003E sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\u003E \n\u003E  11. Patents.\n\u003E \n\u003E  A \u0022contributor\u0022 is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n\u003E \n\u003E License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The\n\u003E \n\u003E work thus licensed is called the contributor\u0027s \u0022contributor version\u0022.\n\u003E \n\u003E  A contributor\u0027s \u0022essential patent claims\u0022 are all patent claims\n\u003E \n\u003E owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\n\u003E \n\u003E hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\n\u003E \n\u003E by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\n\u003E \n\u003E but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\n\u003E \n\u003E consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For\n\u003E \n\u003E purposes of this definition, \u0022control\u0022 includes the right to grant\n\u003E \n\u003E patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\n\u003E \n\u003E this License.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n\u003E \n\u003E patent license under the contributor\u0027s essential patent claims, to\n\u003E \n\u003E make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\n\u003E \n\u003E propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\u003E \n\u003E  In the following three paragraphs, a \u0022patent license\u0022 is any express\n\u003E \n\u003E agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n\u003E \n\u003E (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\n\u003E \n\u003E sue for patent infringement). To \u0022grant\u0022 such a patent license to a\n\u003E \n\u003E party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\n\u003E \n\u003E patent against the party.\n\u003E \n\u003E  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\n\u003E \n\u003E and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\n\u003E \n\u003E to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\n\u003E \n\u003E publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\n\u003E \n\u003E then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\n\u003E \n\u003E available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\n\u003E \n\u003E patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\n\u003E \n\u003E consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\n\u003E \n\u003E license to downstream recipients. \u0022Knowingly relying\u0022 means you have\n\u003E \n\u003E actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\n\u003E \n\u003E covered work in a country, or your recipient\u0027s use of the covered work\n\u003E \n\u003E in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\n\u003E \n\u003E country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\u003E \n\u003E  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\n\u003E \n\u003E arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\n\u003E \n\u003E covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\n\u003E \n\u003E receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\n\u003E \n\u003E or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\n\u003E \n\u003E you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\n\u003E \n\u003E work and works based on it.\n\u003E \n\u003E  A patent license is \u0022discriminatory\u0022 if it does not include within\n\u003E \n\u003E the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\n\u003E \n\u003E conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\n\u003E \n\u003E specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered\n\u003E \n\u003E work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\n\u003E \n\u003E in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\n\u003E \n\u003E to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\n\u003E \n\u003E the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\n\u003E \n\u003E parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\n\u003E \n\u003E patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\n\u003E \n\u003E conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) primarily\n\u003E \n\u003E for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\n\u003E \n\u003E contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\n\u003E \n\u003E or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\n\u003E \n\u003E any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\n\u003E \n\u003E otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\u003E \n\u003E  12. No Surrender of Others\u0027 Freedom.\n\u003E \n\u003E  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n\u003E \n\u003E otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n\u003E \n\u003E excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a\n\u003E \n\u003E covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n\u003E \n\u003E License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\n\u003E \n\u003E not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\n\u003E \n\u003E to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\n\u003E \n\u003E the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\n\u003E \n\u003E License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\u003E \n\u003E  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\n\u003E \n\u003E permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\n\u003E \n\u003E under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\n\u003E \n\u003E combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this\n\u003E \n\u003E License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\n\u003E \n\u003E but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\n\u003E \n\u003E section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\n\u003E \n\u003E combination as such.\n\u003E \n\u003E  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\u003E \n\u003E  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\n\u003E \n\u003E the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will\n\u003E \n\u003E be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n\u003E \n\u003E address new problems or concerns.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\n\u003E \n\u003E Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\n\u003E \n\u003E Public License \u0022or any later version\u0022 applies to it, you have the\n\u003E \n\u003E option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\n\u003E \n\u003E version or of any later version published by the Free Software\n\u003E \n\u003E Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the\n\u003E \n\u003E GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\n\u003E \n\u003E by the Free Software Foundation.\n\u003E \n\u003E  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\n\u003E \n\u003E versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy\u0027s\n\u003E \n\u003E public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\n\u003E \n\u003E to choose that version for the Program.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Later license versions may give you additional or different\n\u003E \n\u003E permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\n\u003E \n\u003E author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\n\u003E \n\u003E later version.\n\u003E \n\u003E  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\u003E \n\u003E  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\n\u003E \n\u003E APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\n\u003E \n\u003E HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \u0022AS IS\u0022 WITHOUT WARRANTY\n\u003E \n\u003E OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\n\u003E \n\u003E THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n\u003E \n\u003E PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\n\u003E \n\u003E IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\n\u003E \n\u003E ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\u003E \n\u003E  16.
