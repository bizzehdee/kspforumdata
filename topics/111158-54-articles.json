We had to do that in one of the forums I moderated for for SimCity.

Now granted, that was about four years ago, so I am assuming that different protocols are in place or are you using a combination of IP, user name, and email addresses?\n\nWe even tried shady looking email domains, but because a large number of our spammers had either Yahoo! or Excite email addresses, we could not place that entire email domain on the rejection list..."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-07T23:56:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 14 minutes ago, 5thHorseman said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Could you be more specific?
