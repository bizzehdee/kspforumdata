Second - your \u003Cstrong\u003Eaerodynamic\u003C/strong\u003E control surfaces don\u0027t work (which also makes sense if you recall that they work by manipulating the airflow around them, when there is no lateral movement, there is no airflow).

Since ideal balancing is next to impossible, RCS is often use to compensate for small imbalances. In real life it\u0027s compensated by differential thrust of engines and/or by thrust vectoring, both of which are kinda hard to do in KSP (although I seem to recall that there is a plugin to do just that), so using RCS sounds like a good way around...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"How2FoldSoup","CreatedById":82003,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T18:39:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do in fact understand exactly what a stall means and how lift works. I believe you misunderstood my initial post. Had this been a post about an R.C. Plane I was making in real life I would say you\u0027re right. The problem lies that this is kerbal and unfortunately it is not the most realistic simulator \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E In stock kerbal lift works simply; If you have enough lift compared to the weight of your craft you will fly. You can search for videos of snake craft and the like doing just that. Since I enjoy challenges and planes are my specialty in general I opted to use FAR. How FAR works is as I said in my second edit. FAR determines your horizontal speed and compares it to your AoA. If such is that it does not agree with FAR\u0027s algorithms it deems that you are \u0022stalling\u0022 and flips you to one side or otherwise lose control. Since this is a video game and not life, actual airflow does not really have an effect. Unfortunately the lack of laminar flow creating a low pressure bubble above the wing to create lift just doesn\u0027t happen in kerbal . I was speaking in terms of kerbalogy as opposed to real life. If you look at my pictures you\u0027ll see that I do have the vtol engines balanced in addition to using RCS. That is not the problem. The mechanics with FAR and kerbal is.

Otherwise you will do all crazy stall flipout. You can put small thrusters or Air RCS found in the B9 pack on the tips of your wings to help with this problem or more SAS systems. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is really frustrating and trying to say the least, but it does work. I am still working on VTOLs to make them better, and I am still making them better on my end.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-14T02:08:28Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2013 02:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Hodo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
