It originally was a regular train (it even once had ISRU capability), but then my mind thought of a really crazy idea. This is the result.![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/CwkBG](http://imgur.com/a/CwkBG)\n\nIt has a hyper-funnel, nice orange looking lights to simulate a firebox, capacity for 16 kerbals and 2 seats up front to drive from (with a probe core in case you don\u0027t want to walk 2 kerbals over there). And of course, it flies, relatively well for what is basically a train with wings, control surfaces and engines bolted on.\n\n(PS I put the images in a link because I don\u0027t know how to embed images properly in a post)"},{"CreatedByName":"trash0551","CreatedById":88568,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T13:10:50Z","Content":"You can embed the album with [imgur ] [/imgur ] tags (remove the space before the brackets).
