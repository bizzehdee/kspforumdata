It originally was a regular train (it even once had ISRU capability), but then my mind thought of a really crazy idea. This is the result.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/CwkBG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/CwkBG\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has a hyper-funnel, nice orange looking lights to simulate a firebox, capacity for 16 kerbals and 2 seats up front to drive from (with a probe core in case you don\u0027t want to walk 2 kerbals over there).
