The gliders must carry a probe each. Once on Duna the Probes (Rovers) must reach one of the poles. Once at the pole (does not have to be the exact pole, just within the arctic circle where there is snow.) the rover(s) must call home to complete mission. Score will be decided on the amount of science gathered at mission end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules: No cheats, the trip must be documented via Shadowplay or FRAPS. If your computer cannot handle them then this wont be for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can either build all at once or build in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShip Names: The orbital craft must be named Newton, The two gliders must be named Hawkings and Einstein. The Rovers can be named anything in this list ( \u003Ca href=\u0022http://cnr2.kent.edu/~manley/astronomers.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://cnr2.kent.edu/~manley/astronomers.html\u003C/a\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMODS ALLOWED (B9 Aerospace, MechJeb)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMODS Required (Deadly Re-entry)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, the ships have to be somewhat realistic.
