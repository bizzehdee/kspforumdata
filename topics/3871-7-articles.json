I dont know why but for some parts this seems to work very well for fixing the wobble. Its like the high breaking torques values make the part too rigid and instead of flexing \u0026amp; absorbing some if the movement, it all gets transfered through the object till it gets to a week point where it can wiggle, and does so with gusto.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, is the wobble occuring only at joints where an engine is located, or is any where you use that part. Reason being that I\\\u0027ve found in some cases, the engine it self is the weakpoint and is where the deflection is actually occuring. Adding the breaking resistance lines to engine\\\u0027s part.cfg seems to help alot if this is the case. It also seems to help prevent the parts from getting stuck on the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-02T23:03:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIts most of the connections - because the additive mass has overwhelmed what the connection engine can handle - all the relevant parts have crashTolerance of 40 and breakingForce/Torque of 100000 - it seems to be a common issue in this \u0027weight class\u0027 of mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBacking off to something inbetween those numbers and the earlier one stopped it, and the rockets don\\\u0027t get so unruly when so large.
