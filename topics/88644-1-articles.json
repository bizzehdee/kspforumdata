A rescue needs to be mounted, but the finance department has decided that we can only spare 15,000 funds on the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, we have one trick up our sleeve: The Cylon 2. A recently developed aircraft capable of lifting small satellites into low orbit for a very low cost of about 2000 funds per launch. We also have a partially built ion powered probe in orbit that was intended for a Jool mission (It has more than enough dV to do a short transfer to the Mun) and a refueling station that was put into orbit for the failed prototype mission, so is still mostly full.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EThe Challenge:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDevise a way to get Jeb and Bill home using less than 15,000 funds net.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ERULES:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile not necessary, it is recommended to use the craft mentioned in the scenario for this mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may not redesign the Cylon 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may build an original lifting stage if you wish, but keep in mind the budget constraints.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is not required that the prototype plane be returned to Kerbin, but extra points will be awarded if you do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ESCORING:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour final score will be calculated based on the following equation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(15,000 - funds spent) x (bonuses)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonus multipliers (these stack):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Return both Jeb and Bob to Kerbin = 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Return the Cylon 2 - X to Kerbin intact = 1.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Do not use the orbital refueling station = 0.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Do not use the Journeyman 1 probe as a transfer stage = 0.25\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEg: Spent 10,000 funds and got Jeb and Bob home without using the Journeyman 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E (15,000 - 10,000) x 1.25 = 6250\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERequired files:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/q69m804gk3o5vim/MunRescue.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESave File\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload this file and extract it to your saves folder in the KSP directory, then open the Mun Rescue game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[OP Attempt to come]\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apature rocket science","CreatedById":77886,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-04T01:41:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeems like a good challange, I might attempt this challange, and are mods allowed ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tsevion","CreatedById":66600,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-05T13:29:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI decided to do this MacGyver style using only what you already had available... so it\u0027s FREE \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed your \u0022fuel depot\u0022 had engines, and all the Cylon 2 needs is fuel... so why not bring the fuel to it?
