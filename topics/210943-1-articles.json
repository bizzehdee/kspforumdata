The best way I know to do that is to use dummy payloads- ore is especially good as it\u2019s very heavy and dense, requiring only a few ore tanks to get the required payload mass, and also dirt cheap; fuel tanks with locked feeds so they can\u2019t be drained are the next best option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuild your dummy payload to the required mass and then build an upper stage (or stages) that give you the required delta-V for what you\u2019re doing with it (Kerbin orbit, Mun/Minmus orbit, interplanetary transfers are more variable but a delta-V map will give you a good ballpark number to work with). Re-root the vessel to the decoupler that the payload will be attached to on the upper stage, remove the payload and save the vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen create another dummy payload that\u2019s as heavy as your new upper stage and payload combined and build a launch rocket that can put that into orbit. Remove the upper stage and save that too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRepeat until you have a selection of different upper stages and launch rockets for different payload masses and destinations as needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeep in mind that adding more fuel to an upper stage will reduce the delta-V of every stage below it and that reducing the payload mass even slightly can reap big increases in overall delta-V- and conversely making things heavier will reduce delta-V pretty significantly. Always include a little extra delta-V to make up for losses due to drag, course corrections and especially for long burns which are often not perfectly pro/retrograde and so lose a bit of delta-V through cosine losses as a result.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Psykikk","CreatedById":83995,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-07T21:02:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthank you but maybe I was no clear enough abot what I am trying to accomplish:\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe launcher is easy as it can be saved as sub-assembly.\u00A0 so building different launchers acording to deltaV needed works exactly as you stated.\u00A0 dummy weights (which I did) and off you go.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBUT what I am trying to do is have a launcher, then attach several fully fledged , indivicual craft as payloads.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nexample: a launcher that delivers several satellites to one planet (for relay constellation setup ).\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhat I did so far is build one satellite, attach the launcher, then copy / paste what I could from the one satellite to add the additional ones. this still took quiet some time, even though all three satellites ended up being exactly the same.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nbut what about if I wanted to deliver a satellite (which is craft A, assembled and saved), a rover (craft B, assembled and saved) plus a skycrane (craft c)\u003Cbr\u003E\nin one go. ?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nso the order of assembly is just different: choose target and weight, grab launcher. then add payload.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nbut it seems the only way is grab payload, then grab launcher.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nin reality thats not how it works. payloads ar designed for launch capacity, not the other way round.\u003Cbr\u003E\nat least afaik\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nas an example: I have this ISUR Unit. its a fully saved \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E craft. how would I load (attach) two of those to one launcher ?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022y4mF8fLPSfQBjBAXKuDn9DdIbLlLIlmqFNbjWoec\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002294.97\u0022 height=\u0022661\u0022 width=\u0022696\u0022 src=\u0022https://dub01pap001files.storage.live.com/y4mF8fLPSfQBjBAXKuDn9DdIbLlLIlmqFNbjWoecMLSoXxF2irqTeZH2GhfcW8lqZO42q3OMC_5Gc0JRi-RYS4XtPjELVE-sBSQEsgeoYokwqhWeOfO0ikp6AO4HbsQKpiJFubPF6KF_BTXohpOFegXvUfiSnsoD6vhJL90hzdyuVoynwdMZRjSrVSXdslTTsH6?width=696\u0026amp;height=661\u0026amp;cropmode=none\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-12-07T22:05:00Z\u0022 title=\u002212/07/2022 10:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 7, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Psykikk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eexample pic\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheFlyingKerman","CreatedById":182407,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-08T09:15:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSave a copy of your payload to another file, with root part re-rooted to the part attaching to the rocket.
