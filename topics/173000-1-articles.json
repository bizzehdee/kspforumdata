And Unity uses SDL on linux. KSP has been supporting DX9 on Win for compatibility reasons, but it\u0027s getting harder to fight with the Unity library to make that work. Especially since Unity changed the supported SDL library and got even more tied up with DX11 in the new library version. Unfortunately, all this library mucking about is resulting in some nastiness for joysticks, currently. The devs are looking into it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dafni","CreatedById":149636,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-28T06:51:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoystick support has always been a bit poor in KSP ever since the early days I started playing.
