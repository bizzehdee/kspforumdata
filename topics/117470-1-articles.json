I have issues with stable flight with hovering engines. These engines are liquid rocket motors. What I am requesting is a plugin that will allow assigning the engines for balanced hover but at same time not restrict the RCS from turning left or right during level hover. I have used ThrottleControlledAvionics and DavonTCsystemsMod. Now ThrottleControlledAvionics does a great job at balancing the vessel however level RCS turning results in a roll and subsequent crash. Here is a crude layout of what I mean. Basically a assignable Orbiter style control system for ALL propulsion systems\n\n![djxEXC3.png](http://i.imgur.com/djxEXC3.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-02T16:28:33Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2015 04:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Redneck**"}]}
