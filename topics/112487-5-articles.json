I\u0027m not sure if full fledged adoption would affect students more before or after high school. My guess would be before since they may still be struggling to grasp basic concepts in those phases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I went and did some googling about the subject matter.

I have my bachelors in aerospace engineering, and throughout college received the experience of doing the same math with both metric and imperial units on a regular basis. This is because the aerospace industry is split between metric and standard. Metric conversion factors are always a power of 10, but somewhat difficult to remember exactly what. Also, Metric units are almost always too small or large to be truly useful and you end up living the life of scientific notation. Imperial units have wacky conversion factors that while more difficult to learn tend to stand out. For the size of imperial units, odds are someone created a unit that fits the need making numbers that are easily represented without scientific notation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I am not against converting to the metric system, I find it highly overrated and not worth the effort.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T23:20:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LN400\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LN400\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThankfully for science, you\u0027re right \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack on topic: As an \u0022outsider\u0022 (Norwegian) looking in, it shouldn\u0027t matter which one you use, metric or imperial, in your daily life.
