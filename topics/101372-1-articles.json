It\u0027s not really an issue, but it\u0027s making me wonder if I have any missing textures.\n\nTo clarify:\n\nThis is what is considered normal: ![tcKnSJ2.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/tcKnSJ2.jpg)\n\nAnd this is what I see: ![152g5sn.png](http://i59.tinypic.com/152g5sn.png)\n\nI think it\u0027s with my computer, I\u0027ve tried KSP on Mac as well and the effects would work.\n\nKSP: 0.90 32-Bit\n\nProblem: Re-entry effects partially not working\n\nMods installed: Adjustable Landing Gear, Component Space Shuttle, Camera Tools, Environmental Visual Enhancer and HyperEdit.\n\nSystem: Windows 7 32-bit\n\nThanks in advance!"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T09:41:26Z","Content":"Did you set the aerodynamic effects to minimal?"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T10:16:01Z","Content":"It\u0027s currently set to \u0022Normal\u0022 so, no.\n\nI\u0027ll look into that.
