I tried launching it with Wine, but nothing happened, so I guess I have to update manually by downloading the newest version. \n\nIs this a bug? Should this be happening? I have no idea. All I know is, the launcher won\u0027t let me click \u0022update\u0022 (even though 1.0.4 is out and I\u0027m still on 1.0.2), and the Patcher that was downloaded was a .exe file, which I cannot use.\n\nAnyone having this same issue? any solutions? Please help!"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T20:00:48Z","Content":"https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120983-The-launcher-will-not-update-KSP-this-is-a-known-issue-see-here-for-help\n\n**The launcher will not update KSP, this is a known issue, see here for help.**"}]}
