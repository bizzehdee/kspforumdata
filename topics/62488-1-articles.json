With the amount of mods I use, it\u0027s infinitely more stable than the windows version, which would crash incessantly. With the linux version, I regularly see my ram usage for KSP up to 7Gigs while remaining completely stable. There are two caveats though - AMD cards, even fast ones, unfortunately have atrocious performance with KSP. I recently switched (back) to an Nvidia card, and the performance difference is night and day. Second - you have to apply the \u0022binary patch\u0022 (can be found on the linux compatability thread), or any mod using png textures will crash the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-08T00:27:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might occasionally run into a mod that doesn\u0027t work on Linux (typically because of case-sensitive file names and paths, using \\ as a path delimiter instead of /, etc), but otherwise things are ok.

And when running lots of mods, 64bit is so much better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, my laptop has the slightly unusual Nvidia Optimus setup, where the computer decides whether the dedicated Nvidia GPU or the integrated Intel GPU handles certain tasks, and when I last tried it, the support was pretty shoddy for Linux and I couldn\u0027t find a work around, meaning KSP was only running on my little Intel card and I was missing out on some neat graphical effects like reentry heat.
