Just tune it so that \u0026gt;100m/s with a big engine, you\u0027re not going to get any power at \u0026gt;90 degrees AoA.

Normally, they are unrecoverable with this plugin because you lose all engine power (unless you have a fueled rocket on board). In this case, it isn\u0027t just the direction of travel that matters, but also the rate of rotation and the distance of the intake from the center of rotation.

I\u0027ve worked out that the NASA EngineSIM definitely uses subsonic flow inside the engine itself, because the first equations for the intake works out the stagnation pressure and temperature, both of which assumes the air slows down almost to zero. I was kinda hoping there would be some hints as to dealing with supersonic flow from the equations given with regards to the intakes, or there would be some hints as to handle velocity inside the engine. But no. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the paper I was looking at regarding scramjet fuel flow, I\u0027ve just realised how they solved things. They used a full set of ODE solvers written in Fortran90 on a set of differential equations I\u0027m still looking at and not understanding. No amount of physical intuition is helping. The whole thing is scary and terrifying and I couldn\u0027t think of a way forwards. For one thing, using any kind of ODE solver scares me, since I don\u0027t really understand the complexities of all of that, nor do I know how to get one working in C#. However, it also strikes me as severe fail in trying to get something simple to work on limited processors in real-time during the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, having said that, I was lying in the bath after Zumba (why are baths such good places to think?) and I realised that I might be able to do something with solving a scramjet engine if I modelled the interior as a set of discrete volumes. If I assumed that temperature, pressure, velocity, density and volume were all constant over such a volume, and I made the volume small enough to work through, I could maybe achieve something. It also kinda matches the method used in EngineSIM, which merely models the temperature and pressure through discrete parts of the engine (except supersonic flow appears to need way more variables of state). It might also help because different effects occur at different parts of the engine and I might be able to accurately model certain bits with less complex code. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would require me understanding what the hell was happening in the engine and writing good equations (it seems I might need something like ODEs in terms of points along the engine length) to fully model the engine.

At the moment, it\u0027s blindingly obvious that rockets are not the way forwards if we want to do that. I want to know because, since I was young, I\u0027ve always been a huge fan of sci-fi. I\u0027ve devoured it and lived in the various future worlds other people have created and its been fun. But, I\u0027ve always wanted to know things like how likely it is and this is one of the fun ways I have of exploring that. RSS is fun, and a chasing of realism is fun, but I find it limiting. I want to know what the next generation of technologies might do and whether they make any sense. To do that, I want to have some realistic models that would let me play with and figure out how they would work. I don\u0027t just want to make something up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy scramjets? Well, I started playing KSP and I could design, using the standard KSP and B9 parts, spaceplanes that would fly up into orbit so successfully that it\u0027s not a design challenge any more. The designs I have are really simple and, because of the incredible fuel efficiency and the loveliness of Kerbin, they work amazingly. I want to know whether a similar approach will work on the Earth, what I would need for it to work or whether the scaling factors preclude that. There aren\u0027t really any designs that would allow that except for hybrid ramjet/scramjet engines paired with SABRE engines and I\u0027ve been wanting to explore that. I\u0027ve created some curve-based scramjet engines and I want to go further. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the fact that most of the research is classified, this is true, and it is annoying. However, there\u0027s still a lot of stuff out there. The paper I have compares its model to real life results in a wind tunnel. That\u0027s just one paper I have access to outside a University paywall, not the other stuff that\u0027s so tantalisingly out of my reach. There are probably others, and you all seem to have forgotten HySHOT and a couple of other programs that are out there doing stuff, plus the fact that Lockheed Martin wants to build the successor to the SR-71 Blackbird using a ScramJet engine design (it will be called the SR-72), with the engines provided by Rocketdyne, if they secure funding from Congress (which is doubtful, but could happen, and if not now, at some point). I don\u0027t understand why you\u0027re happy to have modelling for SABREs (which have a similar could happen approach) and not for scramjets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for my approach, I have no idea whether its the right one. I think, though, I would like to give it a go, since I think only testing it would see if that\u0027s so. I\u0027m asking if anyone has any specialised knowledge that might be useful and might help me, or any useful experience, assuming you want to give it. For example, you all seem to be bright people, so I thought one of you might have done maths numeric work (I\u0027m afraid my numerical analysis work has tended towards analysing parametrisation meshes in n-dimensional spaces), so you might have experience about whether what I\u0027m doing is stupid or not (I was surprised about the number of papers and methods surrounding that one field alone, let alone something as well travelled as the fields of ODEs and PDEs). Or about the aeronautics, which I know nothing about. Still, you\u0027ve been light on that information and instead told me your opinions about whether what I\u0027m doing is worthwhile in the first place. Of course its worthwhile to me... Grrr....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NocTempre","CreatedById":100081,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-06T01:13:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat are the differences and overlap between KIDS and AJE?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-06T03:02:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NocTempre\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NocTempre\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat are the differences and overlap between KIDS and AJE?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAJE does to air breathing jet engines what FAR does to the atmosphere.
