The others are estimates and contingencies. As you can see, landing takes very little \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV as most of the braking is done with parachutes. I used four parachutes for Duna landing, which are the one you see mounted to the decoupler. (The parachutes mounted to the command pod were for landing back at Kerbin.) I didn\u0027t fire my engine until I was 60 meters above the ground. Of course I selected a landing site that sat at a low elevation to take maximum advantage of the atmosphere. Landing at a higher elevation will require more propulsion because parachutes will be less effective in the thinner air. I don\u0027t think I used any of the 300 m/s contingency for \u0022site selection/plane change\u0022.

Understanding and mastering use of the Navball is critical. I figured out rendezvous pretty quickly, but docking was a pain until I really learned how the Navball fit into the whole equation. Now 90% of the rendezvous and docking it done entirely with the Navball. You also have to learn to maneuver with RCS. Once you\u0027ve closed to within a few hundred meters of your target, it\u0027s all RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(ETA)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething else I forgot to mention about the \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV budget. It gets a little tricky because the different maneuvers are performed in different configurations. Some maneuvers are performed by the lander and some by the propulsion stage. And some of those performed by the propulsion stage are performed before landing (with a fully fueled lander attached), and some are performed after landing (with a nearly empty lander attached, or perhaps no lander). When I use KER to find the \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV of the propulsion stage, it gives me the number based on it always being attached to a fully fueled lander. The actual \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV that I\u0027ll get out of the propulsion stage in the order that the maneuvers will actually be performed is higher than what KER tells me. I found it best to perform all the \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV calculations by hand to make sure it was getting done correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso be careful to check the fuel in your tanks before you separate and land. In my case when I burned the engines on the propulsion stage, the first fuel tank that it drew from was the topmost tank that\u0027s part of the lander. Before separating I had to transfer fuel back into that tank. Had I not checked it, I would have landed on Duna with an empty fuel tank. You might want to also top off your RCS tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-19T23:22:10Z\u0022 title=\u002201/19/2015 11:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OhioBob\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded comments\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-19T23:15:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy last mission to Duna used the same craft I used to go to Mun.
