Make your vertical stabilizer bigger.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNotice how fighter jets with canards almost always have equally impressive vertical and/or horizontal stabilizers. Sometimes the vertical stabilizer(s) has/have almost as much surface area as a single wing! This is so the planes have authority in the relevant axes in almost any situation, sometimes even spins.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou have insane pitching ability because of the canards, ailerons and the big wings (yes, the wings help too, remember the Fokker triplane?).\u003Cbr\u003E\nRolls might be also fairly high because of the 2 sets of ailerons and possibly the canards if you didn\u0027t disable roll for them.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor yaw you only have the single little surface. See the pattern here?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo add a nice big back fin, or two. That should make the jet naturally stable. If it reacts very aggressive when you use yaw, only then dial back the angle of actuation. This last bit is also true for pitch and roll. Dial back and/or limit the number of participating surfaces if the plane is too aggressive handling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cavscout74","CreatedById":181783,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-27T17:53:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the responses everyone.\u00A0 I switched from the all-moving canard to a two piece stabilizer \u0026amp; control surface like \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022154251\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@bewing\u003C/a\u003E suggested \u0026amp; it flies pretty normal now.\u00A0 It\u0027s still a \u003Cem\u003Elittle\u003C/em\u003E weak in yaw - perhaps a larger tail would help - but even getting 5 degrees or so yawed left or right, it settles back to prograde within 2 seconds instead of going the other direction instantly.\u00A0 I didn\u0027t have to eject once on this morning\u0027s test flights.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JRqqvC9.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.22\u0022 height=\u0022575\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/JRqqvC9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Klapaucius","CreatedById":181256,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-27T21:14:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223661227\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187746\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221566928419\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022181783\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cavscout74\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Cavscout74 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the responses everyone.\u00A0 I switched from the all-moving canard to a two piece stabilizer \u0026amp; control surface like \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022154251\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@bewing\u003C/a\u003E suggested \u0026amp; it flies pretty normal now.\u00A0 It\u0027s still a \u003Cem\u003Elittle\u003C/em\u003E weak in yaw - perhaps a larger tail would help - but even getting 5 degrees or so yawed left or right, it settles back to prograde within 2 seconds instead of going the other direction instantly.\u00A0 I didn\u0027t have to eject once on this morning\u0027s test flights.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/JRqqvC9.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JRqqvC9.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.22\u0022 height=\u0022575\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/JRqqvC9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use canards on the front all the time.
