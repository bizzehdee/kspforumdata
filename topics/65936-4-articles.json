Yes (kinda). the Kerbitat MKS module is not crewed (none are), but it\u0027s required cap has a one crew capacity. The actual location of your Kerbals could be anywhere in the base.\u003Cp\u003E2. Probably another way of thinking of it is that the Kerbitat has storage tanks for Waste/WasteWater/CO2, which are then consumed by other attached modules to convert them, and the Kerbitat in turn can store resources regardless of where the generation module is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Since all of the MKS bits would have to be linked to operate, once your ship is docked you could just transfer from any Kerbitat, which should all stay at a pretty high net amount due to the closed system - and if you drained one, it would just be the first to fill up again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo one way to get what you are looking for would be to have your Kerbitats brimming with food/water/oxy on launch (they hold 500 each). Alternatively, if that number is too low, I could always add in a stand-alone high capacity provisions module specifically to handle this kind of excess conversion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
