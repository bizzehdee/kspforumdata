Clearly, the binary patch is still required. So, I\u0027ve found the new offsets for 0.90. It does indeed fix the issue for me. However, use at your own risk! Make a backup of your original KSP.x86_64 binary before you do this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo these are the new commands required to fix that annoying bug in 0.90:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eecho \u00220099e747: 00\u0022 | xxd -r - KSP.x86_64\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eecho \u00220099e74c: 00\u0022 | xxd -r - KSP.x86_64\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you could update the OP with these, sal_vager, it would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor future reference, this is the series of bytes that you need to look for: 01 00 00 00 b8 01 00 00 00 c3 41 56 41 55 49\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth the 01\u0027s need to be changed to 00, basically.
