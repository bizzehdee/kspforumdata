Doesn\u0027t matter that millions or tens of millions of people own the game before hand. EA is not the \u0022Launch\u0022 of a game. No matter what you say.

By that time word of mouth and \u0022let\u0027s plays\u0022 have already reached whatever audience you would want to reach and the company won\u0027t have had much of a word in setting expectations to the general public. The point of marketing is to draw attention to those who are unaware of your product and lets the company have a voice in what customers should expect out of your product while also giving the company a chance to show the game in its best light. If they release EA in a state so unfinished that it creates a negative reaction in the new community then that\u0027s on the company for shipping a broken game, regardless of it being in EA. In the end if T2, PD, and Intercept want to utilize their best chance to attract an audience, then that time is now, not way down the road when the game has been incrementally improved in the public eye and long lost the spotlight only to be thought of as old news. If the game isn\u0027t in a state to handle the backlash from marketing to new players then it shouldn\u0027t be released and they should delay it again for as long as needed to be in a functional and presentable state, even this close to the deadline.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcwaffles2003","CreatedById":180102,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-23T17:36:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224222881\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210247\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221674462160\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002264714\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gargamel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, Gargamel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yet, here you are. \u00A0 I\u2019d say that\u2019s a very successful marketing campaign. \u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe have the forums here. \u00A0Reddit. \u00A0 The YouTube channel. \u00A0 \u00A0Twitter. \u00A0 \u00A0 TikTok. \u00A0 Instagram. \u00A0Facebook. \u00A0 \u00A0All those sites are abuzz with talk of the upcoming game. \u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[...]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust because you haven\u2019t seen a billboard along the I430 in Nebraskastan doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have a marketing program going. \u00A0 \u00A0The fact you\u2019re here talking about it proves the point their marketing program worked on you. \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut most of us are her because we play KSP 1 and love it.
