That is not meant to be a criticism, I have branched out to learn a lot about \u003Cem\u003Ereal\u003C/em\u003E space flight thanks to this philosophy. KSP has introduced me to a ton of stuff that I\u0027ve never been able to interact with before. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven enough time, I hope the remaining squad at Squad will eventually rework the necessary code to allow greater realism, and some kind of player-pre-programmed thrust-on-rails. That work would be hard to justify for one part, but, it \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E be justified, if they think about how it would enable a lot of other near-future, very-low-thrust engine types.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-07T22:55:14Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2015 10:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by basic.syntax\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LittleBlueGaming","CreatedById":144665,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T23:37:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FleshJeb\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FleshJeb\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s not how it works in this case.
