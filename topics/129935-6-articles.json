However, the way it calculates build time from cost seems to be very strange. I was getting a bit frustrated when I started combining payloads I\u0027d designed separately, because the times didn\u0027t come out how I expected. Then I watched an early showcase video by Magico13, where he mentioned that build time is related to the square root of cost, not any kind of linear function.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, my re-usable lifter is very simple - Delta-IV style design, with each booster being an orange tank and a skipper, plus parachutes. When I build this subassembly on its own, it takes 105 days. However, when I add it to one giant craft containing all my payloads, it only adds 36 days to the build time. Incidentally, the tiny hex strut I had to place first in order to add my subassembly took 2 days on its own, but only added 5 minutes to the build time of the finished craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis leads to some.... perverse incentives, shall we say?

If\u00A0you \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E want to cheat it, launch your rockets out of the SPH: there\u0027s no rollout time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRecovering through the KCT menu takes time minimally equal to the rollout time (basically you\u0027re just rolling it back) and is mass based. Building the vessel is cost based. Which one is faster depends on the cost to mass ratio of the vessel. Personally, I prefer rebuilding from scratch as it\u0027s way less likely to bug out and break things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDual assembly lines might still be faster (and is the \u0022legit\u0022 method). With that you build it in two parts, then scrap one (the cheaper one)\u00A0and edit it onto the other.\u00A0With 10 upgrades you could get one rate of 0.6 or two\u00A00.4 BP/s rates. If it takes 151 days and 81 days totalling 232 days normally, you could build both halves at once in 226.5 days (226.5 for the bigger one, 121.5 for the smaller), then edit and rebuild. Hmm, unless the edit stage took less than 6 days it looks like you might not save any time. Where you would save time is launching that smaller thing separately while the other is still building, if at all possible, since you could almost launch two of them in the time it takes for the larger craft to finish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDual or tri rates should always result in a higher total\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethroughput\u003C/em\u003E at the expense of each \u003Cem\u003Eindividual\u003C/em\u003E craft taking longer. The square root in the BP formula does promote construction of larger craft if you have a single rate, however.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI never really got a chance to do a bunch of in-depth balancing for KCT, it\u0027s mostly just balanced for \u0022this gives times that won\u0027t make people want to kill me\u0022. And given that the whole mod can be completely reconfigured through the Presets, anyone can change the balance on their own. Seriously, you can make build times use a linear formula instead of square root, or a logarithmic one, or an exponential, or\u00A0be based on\u00A0mass, or on the number of engineers you have at KSC right now, or a fixed time (per vessel or per part).

After seeing NeilC\u0027s post about the benefits of producing single big projects I may have to rethink that strategy. My original strategy also has some challenges with regard to getting the prestige points.
