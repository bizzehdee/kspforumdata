You might want to try launching just a bit before your target passes you overhead, to compensate for the time it will take you ascend and get up to speed. If you happen to overtake your target during launch, just allow yourself to reach a higher orbit so that the target now catches up to you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T23:30:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the target is in LKO, I find that what works best is to launch when the target is about 5 to 10 degrees above the western horizon (eyeball this in map view by rotating the camera so that it\u0027s over the south pole). Then launch and do gravity turn per usual; this typically works out to put your apoapsis at least approximately near where your intersect is. As you\u0027re coasting up to apoapsis, your navball will switch to \u0022target-relative\u0022 mode when the target gets within 60 km. When that happens, just adjust your vector to keep your target-relative velocity aligned on the target, and thrust to match velocities. It works out pretty well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote, the above advice is for vertical takeoff. If you\u0027re a spaceplane guy, those typically need a much longer curve into orbit, so you\u0027d need to launch a fair bit earlier than that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the direct-intercept mode is hard, then just launch into a circular orbit that\u0027s either lower or higher than the target, then timewarp until the target lines up, as the previous posters have suggested.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
