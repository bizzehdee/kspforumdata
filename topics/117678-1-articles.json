I can match up my orbits perfectly, but every time I do, I end up with my two docking crafts on opposite sides of Kerbin.\n\nIs there some trick to knowing exactly when to launch, as so that you can dock?\n\nAny help would be much appreciated!\n\nBest regards,\n\n - March Unto Torment"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T05:53:18Z","Content":"Old but still accurate: \n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHkY3FusJIQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"mrclucks","CreatedById":139561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T09:51:35Z","Content":"Launch and circulize your rocket, taking note of your targets position before launch and after.

Circularize at Ap, and now you have an orbit a bit smaller than the target, but you are steadily catching up now. Coast until you\u0027ve gained enough ground but don\u0027t allow yourself to pass the target. Gradually extend your orbit to match the target and you will notice you don\u0027t catch up as fast anymore. This is how I do it the first few times, until I get that Tracking Center upgraded.\n\nBTW: You don\u0027t NEED to wait until the target is over the launch site, this just drastically cuts down the catch-up time you spend coasting at a lower orbit. If the orbital periods of 2 craft differ at all, enough time-warping will eventually lead them together, no matter how far on opposite sides they are at the moment. This just isn\u0027t always ideal like when you\u0027re using life support and need to work quickly."},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T20:49:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Best way to eyeball it is wait until the orbiter is directly overhead or perhaps a minute before, launch into orbit as normal but keep your Ap lower than the target\u0027s by a little.

You might want to try launching just a bit before your target passes you overhead, to compensate for the time it will take you ascend and get up to speed. If you happen to overtake your target during launch, just allow yourself to reach a higher orbit so that the target now catches up to you."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T23:30:25Z","Content":"If the target is in LKO, I find that what works best is to launch when the target is about 5 to 10 degrees above the western horizon (eyeball this in map view by rotating the camera so that it\u0027s over the south pole). Then launch and do gravity turn per usual; this typically works out to put your apoapsis at least approximately near where your intersect is. As you\u0027re coasting up to apoapsis, your navball will switch to \u0022target-relative\u0022 mode when the target gets within 60 km. When that happens, just adjust your vector to keep your target-relative velocity aligned on the target, and thrust to match velocities. It works out pretty well.\n\nNote, the above advice is for vertical takeoff. If you\u0027re a spaceplane guy, those typically need a much longer curve into orbit, so you\u0027d need to launch a fair bit earlier than that.\n\nIf the direct-intercept mode is hard, then just launch into a circular orbit that\u0027s either lower or higher than the target, then timewarp until the target lines up, as the previous posters have suggested."}]}
