I like to figure out systems and schematics on my own, how it will jettison spent boosters, what type of fuel for ignition. I guess you could say I\u0027m the real\u00A0KSP engineer. I have all these rockets and countless more planned, but no one to conceptualize these with. I\u0027m looking for some sort of place where I can talk about the coring or the body material, or someone to do this with. So, does anyone here like building actual, civilian rockets? Are there those that like the real-life version of KSP and can, in fact, be bothered to strive for it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-16T19:27:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSmall kits or HPR?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlazingAngel665","CreatedById":30182,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-18T03:39:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey Alex,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m an avid rocket engineer as well. A couple of online resources I like:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.rocketryforum.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.rocketryforum.com/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.reddit.com/r/rocketry/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.reddit.com/r/rocketry/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you enjoy talking about things in person, I recommend you find a local National Association of Rocketry (NAR) or Tripoli Rocket Association (TRA) chapter. These groups host launches and are always happy to share experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, feel free to PM me. I\u0027ve build rockets from scratch for about three years (custom body tubes, custom motors, custom electronics, everything but the parachutes). I\u0027m currently on the MIT Rocket Team, and we build rockets from scratch all day long.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFair warning though, experimental rocketry is very dangerous, and depending on where you live, highly regulated. Make sure you are well versed in hobby rocketry and high powered rocketry before trying the leap to custom propulsion. In real life money is a concern, so we try to use models to reduce the number of unplanned disassemblies, so it isn\u0027t very much like Kerbal Space Program at all. There is also, of course, no piloting. Guided rockets require a lot of paperwork to fly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
