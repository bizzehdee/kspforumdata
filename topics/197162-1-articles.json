As a layman, i have no idea how to program and create a mod to\u00A0do that,\u00A0so, maybe i can get some help. The mod would be very simple, it would create trust at instead of drag when aileron is applied, and it could also have\u00A0UI that allow you to switch on and off this effect and control its intensity. The\u00A0bell lift distribution create this\u00A0effect,\u00A0as you aply aileron to generate more lift on the wingtip\u00A0you also generates more trust, thus yawing in the same direction of the turn. For understanding more of this you can search for the prandlt-D project that is made by NASA. I want to reproduce this effect on KSP to make better flying wings projects, i hope you can help me with this project!\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nHere is a link for the NASA\u0027s\u00A0Prandlt-d project:\u00A0https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/news/FactSheets/FS-106-AFRC.html\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/ed15-0193-336_0.jpg\u0022 style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#3d6594;\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ed15-0193-336_0.jpg\u0022 data-ratio=\u002266.67\u0022 height=\u0022800\u0022 style=\u0022border-style:none;vertical-align:middle;\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/ed15-0193-336_0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
