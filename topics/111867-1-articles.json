Going off into space, possibly never to be seen again is stressful enough. Being cooped up in a soup can certainly is not going to help. It might very well be that somewhat spacious living quarters are required for long term, healthy survival.\n\nDo not forget that so far, in real life, we only made it to the garden shed.
