If you can use energy shielding you do not have to lug heavy pieces of space ship with you or to space at all. I think NASA engineers would kill for good, light shielding against high velocity space debris.\u003Cp\u003EThis could be true. If a laser with enough energy hits anything, the instant vaporisation of the part hit will cause gasses to violently expel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what about the dumb idea that lasers make pewpew sounds, there is no air in space and if there was all you would hear was the laser gun humming as it worked, plus why do spaceships in scifis have massive amount s of interior space when all they need is enough for the crew, all that extra space should be used for more reactors or armor or guns.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T06:06:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022daniel l.\u0022 data-cite=\u0022daniel l.\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewhy do spaceships in scifis have massive amount s of interior space when all they need is enough for the crew, all that extra space should be used for more reactors or armor or guns.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere might be psychological reasons for that. Going off into space, possibly never to be seen again is stressful enough. Being cooped up in a soup can certainly is not going to help. It might very well be that somewhat spacious living quarters are required for long term, healthy survival.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo not forget that so far, in real life, we only made it to the garden shed.
