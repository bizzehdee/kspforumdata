This way you can tow your containment towards your base, and make it a part of this. Maybe you even want to use it as a shelter for your rover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegards\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTantalus\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-14T16:34:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell you could use something like a little rover with a claw on each end. Use one end to grab probe\u002Bbatteries and then use the claw on the other end to grab onto whatever you want to use them with.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMight be more trouble than it\u0027s worth but could be satisfying to make it work.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeware that claws can be a tad buggy.
