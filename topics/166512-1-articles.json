As I approach the surface of the planet I decrease the velocity on the HSI to almost zero and I get about 50 meters off the surface, then the surface suddenly accelerates to the craft even when I hold the vertical velocity as close as I can to zero. When this happens the texture of the surface goes fuzzy, like I am far away from the surface. For example I can see details of the surface 1000 meters above then around 50 meters or so it goes fuzzy and 2 seconds later the surface of the planet crashes my craft, just like that with landing velocities of 0-3 meters per second.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this a game file problem, do I need to reinstall the program?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- - - - -\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit- disregard, I had physics acceleration on, doh!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-14T03:23:45Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2017 03:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
