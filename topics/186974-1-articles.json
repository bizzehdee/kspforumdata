Even the smallest torque settings like 1-2%, which can power a 2-4 blade type B prop should be able to generate enough electricity to power a cabin light or landing light at night.

Airplane builders attach the alternator they think is adequate to the shaft to generate electricity. On multiple engine aircrafts, not all of them have alternators - sometimes, only one engine has one, and the pilot had to rely on the APU if that engine fails (to tell you the true, some commercial airlines are this way until nowadays).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFuel cells are excellent APUs , but I agree that an alternator should be provided to be attached to the prop engines - or your idea should be implemented.
