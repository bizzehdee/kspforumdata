That makes for a lot of cylindrical elements and a generally aerodynamic approach to things.\u00A0As KSP2 starts to move into more futuristic tech, built in orbital shipyards and off-world (often zero atmosphere) colonies, what changes would we expect to see in the components we use? The new fairing-free hydrogen tanks and big hydrogen ball were clearly made with orbital engineering in mind, but what else?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think we need parts with a flatter, blockier aesthetic, to facilitate building outwards in three dimensions rather than rocket stacks. Spheres aren\u0027t ideal structural elements (at least in their current form) because of the lack of fixed attachment points - it\u0027s easy to misalign anything placed radially.\u00A0Cubic fuel tanks would be the obvious answer, but could make for some seriously ugly craft (Borg cube, anyone?) Cuboctahedrons might be fun? (Anyone remember the old space stations in\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EElite\u003C/em\u003E?) It would be nice to be able to build\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Espaceships\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0rather than\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Erockets\u003C/em\u003E, IYSWIM...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stephensmat","CreatedById":200752,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-19T11:28:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScaling the wings is a first step towards doing it for other parts, so it\u0027s possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe already have a capacity to use Space Shuttle/Rover parts in landers, jets, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe don\u0027t know what the colony parts are yet.
