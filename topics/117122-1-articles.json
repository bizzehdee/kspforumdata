Really made me mad til I figured it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike Explorer said, you have to make sure that if you set any key bindings to a joystick, you have to have that joystick plugged in when you start the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe the reason is that the game looks through the files, sees that part of it, and when it can\u0027t find what it\u0027s referring to, it just skips to the next thing. This is just a theory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, just make sure you have that thing plugged in. You can still set your axis\u0027 and buttons from the main screen like you would usually do. It just gets screwy if you forget it one time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s mod related, so any changes to mods shouldn\u0027t affect it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T07:15:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor those of you who are having this problem, does your log file contain the following exception text when it happens?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EKeyNotFoundException: The given key was not present in the dictionary.\u003Cbr\u003E  at System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary\u00602[System.String,System.Int32].get_Item (System.String key) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E  at InputDevices.GetDeviceIndex (System.String deviceName) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E  at AxisBinding_Single.Load (.ConfigNode node) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E  at AxisBinding.Load (.ConfigNode node) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E  at GameSettings.ParseCfg () [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E  at GameSettings.Awake () [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf so, then it\u0027s not an OSX specific problem. Windows has the same problem. It\u0027s in SQUAD\u0027s code that reads and processes the CFG file.
