One of these is the standard type, it\u0027s pretty common.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe others are much more rare (maybe only occurring once every few hundred metres)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou get pictures of these in a contract briefing, or accessible through a menu, and get science for gathering them. (Or maybe you don\u0027t get a picture, you just get told to gather interesting-looking things).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey don\u0027t have to be loaded for physics, the only change from the standard terrain scatters is that you can gather them somehow (either by right clicking on them, or right-clicking on a nearby Kerbal, whichever is easiest to implement).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means that instead of just landing on a planet, planting a flag, and going home, you have a small treasure hunt to do once you\u0027re down there for additional science (if you want to do it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also makes rovers more of a useful thing, as you can cover more ground more quickly, enhancing your search.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExamples of things you could have would be different types of rock on the Mun, maybe some sort of primitive life on Laythe, possible fluvial features on Duna, bones in Kerbin\u0027s deserts, patches of water ice near the Mun\u0027s poles, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(If anyone wants to make a mod of this as well, feel very free!!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andrew Hansen","CreatedById":82311,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-29T11:21:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExcellent idea!
