You could also make high temp wing leading edges and control surfaces. I\u0027d stay away from actual wing parts, though. We have lots of those already, heh.\n\nI\u0027m planning on making an air intake later. I\u0027d like to also make some parts for lifting bodies too.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Maybe a hypersonic cockpit, I know there is one in B9 but some variety is always nice. Or maybe cockpit plus other parts with cooling systems you mentioned built in. Also any thoughts on a Pulse Det engine as from the Blackswift project? The oxidizer as coolant I like gives me a reason to build SRAMs with OX.\n\nI am thinking about making a Mk.2 drone cockpit. Manned ones are a bit beyond me right now. Other cooling parts will definitely happen. I\u0027ve been looking for a good \u0022experimental\u0022 engine to do for a while.
