The living space will be at one end of a long radial arm, and spent delivery vehicles will be docked at the other end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to be able to dock while the station is rotating, so part-way along the arm, at the center of mass, I will put a docking hub. I think that\u0027s also the logical place to put reaction wheels for control of the station\u0027s rotation and attitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that the center of mass doesn\u0027t correspond to any convenient attachment point -- and as the station grows and changes, the center of mass will change anyway -- so if I want my docking hub to be stationary, I need an adjustable counterweight that lets me fine-tune the center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve sketched out a solution which involves attaching weight to secondary arms and using docking ports to adjust the angle at which those arms are attached to the radial arm. However, this seems like an unrealistic solution and I\u0027m not sure it is feasible even in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have a better suggestion?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-TC\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-26T20:01:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2014 08:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by T.C.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T18:45:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as the station goes on rails (either out of physics range or time warp) then It\u0027s not going to rotate anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"T.C.","CreatedById":111697,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T19:20:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh...
