Anything that fits inside the Mk2 or Mk3 bay can easily be moved with RCS. The stock sepratrons are way too powerful to do such a delicate job.\n\nYour cargo doesn\u0027t even have to be equipped with RCS. Instead of moving your cargo up out of the bay, you can also move your cargo plane down."},{"CreatedByName":"luizopiloto","CreatedById":97503,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T15:12:04Z","Content":"sometimes the parts attach to the inside node of the cargo bays... making it impossible to place other parts inside, you have to detach and attach again to place it at the right node... then you can place parts inside.\n\nA trick to safe hold parts inside cargo bays w/o using struts is using 2 docking ports."}]}
