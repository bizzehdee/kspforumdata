This has been planned as a cliffhanger for a while, though.

However, I\u0027m going on vacation on the 22nd, and I won\u0027t be back until the 7th, so if I don\u0027t get finished before a few days before the 22nd (packing, preparations, etc.) then you probably can\u0027t expect it for a while, sorry. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just wrote a short paragraph on how I don\u0027t have many screenshots past this next chapter done, and I elaborated, but then I realized that it would have been a bit of a spoiler.

Ethan, firmly grip the edge\u00A0of your seat with one hand and undo your buckle with the other. I will help Evelina. Get out of the control room and down to the habitation modules. Wait for me there. If I\u0027m not down in three, no, four minutes - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022NUCLEAR MELTDOWN IMMINENT. COOLANT DEPLETED.

Pride? Happiness? Coolness? It was almost like a father telling his son he could drive his car around... And my father had, because of circumstances that were not his fault, been remarkably absent from my life for the past several months.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs if I knew how to fly the Wyvern.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022There are locks on the hatch!\u0022 I said. Jeb flipped a few more switches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I just blew the hatchway. Or, at least, I hope I did.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI looked down. All but two of the harness straps had broken, and one of the ones left was partially torn through.\u00A0With one hand I gripped the side of the seat, and with the other, I tried to undo the buckle. I tried for several seconds, but the buckle wouldn\u0027t budge. It was melted shut. I tried the other one. Same problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI looked around, and at that point I really noticed the state of the control room. Not a single window was left, only sparse shards at the edge that looked like they had melted and refrozen.\u00A0The walls were blackened from the re-entry fire. There weren\u0027t any loose objects left. Some of the equipment bays were just gone, with sparking wires, broken pipes, some spewing gases, and exposed ship structural beams the only sign that there had been something there. I tried the buckle again. It was firmly stuck in place. Then, I looked next to me. The seat to my right was completely gone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had a panic attack. If I had chosen that seat, I would be dead or falling to the core of Jool right now. I was only still here because one strap decided to rip only halfway. How long had it been? If I had only about thirteen minutes left, then every eight seconds I spent struggling with the harness was a full percent of the rest of my life. The amount of time it took to do that math was... The amount of time to calculate that wouldn\u0027t be worth it. I took three quick breaths and forced myself to come to my senses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022EVELINA! Do you still have your Swiss army knife on you?\u0022 Evelina thought hard for a few seconds as Jeb continued undoing her latches. Evidently, hers had been spared from the melting. She was panicking just as much, if not more, than I was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I left it in the bag I packed, in the ring! It\u0027s gone now, I\u0027ll never see it again!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Actually,\u0022 Jeb said as he pulled it out of his pocket, \u0022I was using it to conduct repairs on a control circuit a few hours ago!\u0022 He reached across the cabin and pushed it into my outstretched arms. \u0022Sorry.\u0022 He stood for a second. \u0022It is most definitely an extremely useful tool.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Don\u0027t apologize!\u0022 she said. I fiddled with it for several seconds, trying to open any of the knives. However, I was wearing a spacesuit, and with that came gloves. After a few more percent of my life had passed by, I managed to open the largest knife by using a snapped strut on the control panel in front of me as a lever. I began sawing frantically through the strap, which was far tougher than it looked. After a few more percent of my life, I had cut all the way through, but in the process jerked the knife right through the other side, and straight into my glove. The harness dropped away, but thankfully I remained in my seat thanks to the air resistance acting on the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022DAMMIT!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022 shouted Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I punctured my suit!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How the hell did you manage that? These are made of - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do you have a patch kit?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t know where they are! Probably in the ring! Close your hand for now! Jool\u0027s atmosphere is hydrogen, as long as you have a constant supply of oxygen, you will be fine! As long as we can get to the Wyvern before the pressure reaches significant levels, the atmospheric content won\u0027t kill you. The pressure will - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kill me\u00A0first, got it.\u0022 I gripped the side of the chair with the gloved hand, trying to seal it. I reached over to the central console and grabbed it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Just do not get near any sparks!\u0022 shouted Evelina. Right. With each passing one percent of my life, more hydrogen made its way through the slit in my glove. I was becoming more and more of a bomb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI walked around with surprising ease. The floor only rocked a bit compared to what it had been doing, although it was still several times worse than an abnormally turbulent airplane ride. Both hands were still clamped onto whatever was left to grab onto, the one hand pressed especially tight to stop the leak...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy ears hadn\u0027t popped when the suit was punctured, I realized. That meant that the external pressure was close to one atmosphere. Either that, or my self sealing was very good. That meant that instead of an outward leak, the leak was, or was about to become an inward leak. I needed to get to the Wyvern in the next few minutes or I would be crushed early.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made it to the ladder in the middle of the command center and descended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022dEndslp.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/dEndslp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI noticed the magnetic coffee cups were still on the table, somehow. The windows in this module, being much smaller and stronger, had not broken either, although there was a crack in one of them. I began looking around for anything that could patch the leak.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe duct tape cabinet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI went further down the ladder trying to find it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u00229qO4OOy.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/9qO4OOy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere it was, just around the corner. I practically ripped it open, and then spent the next several percent of my life first delicately applying a layer after matching the sides of the cut up as close as I could, and then adding more layers, before wrapping the whole thing as well as I could several times, using up most of that roll in the process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust as I was done, Jeb came down, helping Evelina. \u0022Alright, let\u0027s go,\u0022 he said. We passed through the habitation section, bouncing off the walls. At one point, Evelina was thrown against a cabinet hard, on her broken arm. She cried out in pain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The best legal painkillers in the galaxy will be available when we get to the Wyvern!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022q1qpn2x.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/q1qpn2x.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe external pressure was significantly higher than one atmosphere by now, but while I felt it in my ears, they had not popped. That was a good sign that my duct tape patch was holding up well enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait!\u0022 I said. I turned to face one of the bedroom doors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Go!\u0022 said Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The flower,\u0022 I said, opening one of the doors. It was the wrong room. I tried the next one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re risking your life over a flower?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The monolith said it\u0027s important!\u0022 That one was the wrong room as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Maybe it\u0027s another flower!\u0022 said Jeb, pushing past me, opening the hatch into the next module, the artificial gravity ring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What other flower have we come across?\u0022 I shouted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re wasting time for a FLOWER!\u0022 I opened the fourth door. The room was a mess. Stuff was burned. The window was shattered. The wind was loud. But, it was the right room. Inside the charred drawer was the Auris Facsimilis, an undelivered gift from lover to lover, still preserved inside its eternity vessel, whatever that was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI followed Jeb through the hatchway, trailing behind by several meters. We came across the hatchway to the cargo bay, still fastened shut by several dozen locks. The hatch blowing had not worked. I realized that it would take forever to get through. Jebediah, however, grabbed something from the wall and began applying it\u00A0to the hatch in a large circle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Stand back! Especially Ethan!\u0022 He took out another tool, which shot a small jet of plasma out from the front, and applied the flame to the circle of whatever that material was. It burned ferociously. I stepped back, as I was still\u00A0a bomb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022NUCLEAR MELTDOWN IMMINENT.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat reminded me, we were entering a high radiation area. I looked off to the side, where the radiation suits were located. I wondered how we were supposed to change into them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Don\u0027t bother with those! The pressure will kill us first!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few percent of my life later, the circular portion of the hatch fell away, leaving a glowing ring around the edge. Jeb and I peered through the hatch, only to be nearly instantly crushed by a massive chunk of metal.

I don\u0027t know, but it\u0027s probably in that ballpark,\u0022 I said, as it smashed into the side once again, further denting a wing.

I took a deep breath, and then made my way through the impromptu hatch, clinging to whatever I could find on the side of the bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022DXqNuPZ.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/DXqNuPZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter several tense seconds, I made it to the hatch, which was thankfully open. I had a close call with an intake, but it was a nudge and not a shove. I looked back to Evelina. \u0022Your turn!\u0022 I shouted. The Wyvern was still on the other side. With a determined expression on her face, she exited the hatch, legs first and, with one hand and\u00A0her feet, braced against whatever was there, started making her way across the bay. I had my legs on the other side of the hatch and was reaching out with my arms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then the bay jerked open once again, sending a shock through the ship. The new surge\u00A0of wind jerked the Wyvern around once more, and it narrowly missed Evelina\u0027s\u00A0legs. She jumped, but away from the Wyvern and towards the open bay. She looked out there and froze, a terrified expression on her face. She was looking straight into Jool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI abandoned the hatch, crawled along, and grabbed her leg, trying to drag her to safety. But then the intake crashed into my leg. I howled in pain, almost losing my grip on the bay. I desperately tried\u00A0to get back to the hatch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seemed like an eternity, but it was most likely only a few seconds. Still, a few percent of the rest of my life...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a struggle, Evelina and I were both safely through the hatch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You saved my life. Again,\u0022 she said, breathing heavily, holding me as tightly as she could with her one good arm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How many times did you save my life back on Kerbin?\u0022 I replied. \u0022I think you\u0027re still winning by one!\u0022 I checked to make sure - the Auris was still strapped to the suit\u0027s\u00A0belt area, where I had left it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022OUT OF THE WAY!\u0022 shouted Jebediah, who was rapidly approaching the hatch, rapidly traversing the sides as the Wyvern continued bouncing.\u00A0He entered after we had stepped to the sides. He shut the hatch behind us. We were now in an enclosed space once more. At this point, I finally turned and examined the bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u00227vYqBDa.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/7vYqBDa.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This,\u0022 he told as he faced us, \u0022is an Illasticonian crystal,\u0022 he said. He was holding up a tiny shimmering bluish crystal, held in place by an intricate framework of metal protrusions, connected\u00A0to a transparent sphere, which was inside another transparent sphere. The volume between the spheres appeared to be filled with a nearly transparent\u00A0gas. The whole thing was about golf ball sized, with the actual crystal being the size of around an ant, with a substantially long metal chain so it could be worn like a necklace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How do you make them?\u0022 I asked. Definitely a stupid question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You don\u0027t,\u0022 replied Jeb. \u0022They have only been found in two places. Deep in the crust of Illasticonia, and at the atomic level out in deep space, in quantities that are not useful.\u0022 He handed us each one and kept one for himself. \u0022When exposed to a gas that has a name too long to pronounce, the\u00A0gas trapped between the two bulbs, they rapidly decompose into a very specific form of quantum energy. This energy teleports the nearest atoms, with the percentage of atoms decreasing sharply as the distance from the center increases, to a random point in space. Cutting this short, it has an 80% chance of being within the galaxy, 20% way further, and will teleport about 90% of the mass within two meters of it, at least for this size of crystal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s a teleportation stone?\u0022 I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They are incredibly dangerous! They have a 20% chance of straight up exploding! For the three of us, that\u0027s a 50/50 chance of one of ours not working and then blowing up and falling into Jool!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And the pods?\u0022 Evelina asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Designed so that at least two thirds of their mass stays intact when using one of these crystals. Enough life support for about two weeks, anywhere in deep space. A quantum distress beacon so you can be rescued.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022When do we start?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Take one of these.\u0022 He passed out a few small rectangular-ish box things. \u0022These contain all mission relevant data, including our fight with The Species. These are worth more than your life. They go right next to the crystal when you smash it to minimize corruption. Get them to any member of the galactic council by any means necessary.\u00A0Get into the pods. There are basic medical kits on board.\u0022 The ship shook some more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022NUCLEAR MELTDOWN IMMINENT.

As a result, you are going to develop lots of nasty cancers that can be reversed only if you are rescued. If not, the pods all have self destruct features.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why do these even exist?\u0022 I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022As a last resort. Get into a pod. Wait until the bay doors are open. Press the red button, which fires the escape motors, which will clear you from the vehicle. Then curl as tightly as possible around the crystal to minimize the atoms lost, and then crush it a few seconds after launch. Then press the blue button and wait for rescue.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022As simple as that?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022There\u0027s a manual if you have time, but we don\u0027t!\u0022 He started down the walkway to the farthest pod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Can we increase the radius to decrease the atomic loss?\u0022 said Evelina as she grabbed onto the ladder of the first pod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022With a bigger crystal, but the ones we have are some of the biggest in existence!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuddenly there was a massive jerk to the ship, throwing us around the interior of the bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022K0IHp3Q.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/K0IHp3Q.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022HNgzYMD.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/HNgzYMD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI almost smashed my crystal against the side of the bay, but I just barely avoided it.\u00A0The rocking subsided and I climbed back onto the platform.

Fortunately, the fairing did not hit the spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, I had a realization.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hallway was too narrow for anyone to pass another, even in times like these. If I managed to catch Evelina, I would have to take the back seat, and she would have to fly the Wyvern.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd having just been blown up, and with her broken arm, with the pain she must be in? And I was the more experienced pilot. I couldn\u0027t expect her to be able to fly.

I was planning on it anyways, to give her a larger place to grab on to, and for more drag.\u00A0But what I was planning, well... I was suddenly extremely glad that Jebediah had taken the time to fix it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo. I couldn\u0027t possibly do this. I couldn\u0027t control the craft like that! I couldn\u0027t aim for her!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWait.

I had to try. I turned around to face Evelina. I made sure \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E was on, and I angled the plane downwards so that my path would hopefully intersect hers. I then tried to open the hatch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was stuck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuh. The pressure outside was probably ten atmospheres now! I looked around for several seconds before I found some EVA related switches. I flicked most of them. There was a hissing as the atmospheric pressure equalized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then opened the hatch again. Luckily, it opened vertically rather than horizontally, otherwise it would have been nearly impossible to open, or would have ripped off.\u00A0I took a deep breath, thinking about all of the things that had to go right for this to work. I made sure not to lock myself out. Then, terrified, I\u00A0stepped out into the Joolian airstream, making sure to go slowly, gripping the ladder, well, for dear life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022SLLZEJB.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/SLLZEJB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022GAYHxRV.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/GAYHxRV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI slowly crawled down, looking forwards to Evelina.

I relaxed the most I had in the past, well, how long had it been since we were first attacked? Thirty minutes? An hour? \u0022I\u0027ll tell you what happened on the way up. Wait... Oh no. The flower!\u0022 I pulled away from Evelina (OH MY GOODNESS. MY ACTUAL GIRLFRIEND!!!) and went back to the radar. We were out of range of any detectable objects, besides a few of the larger chunks of the Legacy II, far below us, all but destroyed. \u0022I don\u0027t see it anywhere!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ethan, maybe it wasn\u0027t the flower that was important.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Of course the flower was important!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nobody cares about the flower any more.

A lot of our data is scrambled and our personal electronics were hit hard, but for the most part, the Voyager is good enough to continue the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only serious damage was done to the John Cena spacecraft, the cockpit of which was not designed for long term spaceflight, and therefore did not have substantial shielding built in. We do not have the parts to fix the computer systems. It can still be flown and controlled manually, but cannot be controlled across the docking port (which, by the way, is having electromagnet issues) due to the interface controller being shot, and the manual control is very iffy.

You were attacked by not one, but two Species ships, received a ginormous dose of solar radiation, escaped three nuclear explosions, a K-drive explosion, an intense atmospheric entry, a nuclear meltdown and containment failure, clinging onto a ladder deep inside a gas giant several times, flying an illegal spaceship you had no prior experience with through another nuclear explosion and into orbit just in time to be picked up by a passing vessel and rushed here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Where exactly is here?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The finest nuclear focused wing of the finest medical center in the entire galaxy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, I do not mean to brag, but I am one of the leaders in the fields of radiation sickness and oncology. Representative Jebediah was rather insistent on having the best of the best take care of you.

You and Evelina would have begged for death minutes in. But that didn\u0027t happen. I am not an expert in human facial expressions, but I believe I have sufficiently driven home my point based on your reaction.\u0022 I gulped and shook the thoughts from my head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And Evelina?

Curiously, there were different leaders for different parts of the planet. Countries, they called them. A reasonable amount, less than fifty, though, and there were bound to be differences between species. \u0022I am the interplanetary ambassador for our world, Kerbin, although most of you know that by now.

One of us will pilot the John Cena, probably using the engine to get it underwater, and dock with the Lost Dreams. From there, the plane and lander\u00A0will float mostly level. We will detach the tug.\u00A0I will then detach the spent de-orbit motors, and attach more sepratrons in their place with the electric screwdriver, altering the\u00A0existing mounts so I can attach four instead of two.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What are the sepratrons for?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m getting to that. From there, the tug, with the remains of the scanner attached to the back\u00A0for additional leverage, will klaw the top rear of the plane, we will use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and reaction wheels to rock back and forth, and eventually reach vertical again, pointed maybe thirty degrees above the horizon. We will refuel the plane, board both command pods, rock forward and back as far as we can, and then, at the right moment, fire the jet engine, light the sepratrons, and when we are vertical, release the Klaw! The sepratrons will get the jet up to a speed where it can produce enough thrust to work properly,\u00A0and from there, we fly up into orbit, where we are picked up one by one on the Emerson and brought back to the Voyager.\u0022 He inhaled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wow...\u0022 said Marie. \u0022That\u0027s...

Once we get high enough, we can ditch one of the capsules once it\u0027s out of fuel, and fly the other one to orbit with the other person carefully holding onto the ladder!

Suddenly, something jumped out of shadows, towards me! \u0022AAAA!\u0022 I shouted, jumping backwards. I fell flat on my back, a bit harder than I would have liked because of the high gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Relax, dude, it\u0027s just me,\u0022 said a familiar voice. The figure stepped fully out of the shadows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh. Evelina. Hi!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hello again, Ethan!\u0022 She helped me up, and we hugged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I missed you so much,\u0022 I said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I missed you more!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Bet.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I do bet!\u0022 We pulled away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So, you\u0027re okay?\u0022 I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m not the one who nearly cracked his head open on the ground just now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Haha. You know what I mean, though... You were, well, sitting closer to the engines.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, yeah, that. The doctors haven\u0027t told me much, but I\u0027ll be okay, for now at least. I have a slightly higher chance for cancer later in life, and I guess you do too, but all of the other stuff that they fixed in the meantime should more than offset that. Are you okay?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, yeah. I\u0027m fine. I was a tad lonely, bored, and anxious, but who wouldn\u0027t? And did you say that the doctors fixed other stuff?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah. They didn\u0027t tell me but I heard them talking about how they couldn\u0027t believe how fragile our bodies were and that they couldn\u0027t resist making a few upgrades. Don\u0027t tell anyone, we aren\u0027t supposed to know.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Weirdest superhero origin story ever.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s probably just disease resistance and organ optimization and boring stuff like that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right. Evelina? You look tired.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, yeah. Since they finished helping me first, I\u0027ve been interviewed by God knows how many people about how the attack went. Enjoy these few hours, they will want to interview you too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yay, something to look forward to...\u00A0How long have you been out here?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Only a few minutes. I wasn\u0027t going to stay long, what if someone comes and we\u0027re not supposed to be out here?\u00A0I thought about coming in to wake you up and talk to you, but - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe airlock beeped and we both froze. A light turned red. It started to hiss. Before we could take more than a step or two back to our rooms, the door swung wide open to reveal none other than Jebediah Kerman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeb!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ethan! Evelina!\u0022 He said, obviously struggling to hold a smile on his exhausted face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We were just going back to our, well - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How soon can you be ready to leave?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, now I guess? It\u0027s not like we have much of anything to pack.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right.\u00A0most of the stuff that was on the Wyvern has been decontaminated and has already been loaded onto my spacecraft. Unfortunately the Wyvern itself was confiscated, deactivated, and placed into storage, as it is an illegal spacecraft after all. Since this was a secret mission, none of us are facing charges. If it\u0027s anyone that will after all this is done, it\u0027s me, as you were following my orders and never flew it except when you didn\u0027t have a choice.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do you have clothes for us?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What\u0027s wrong with what you\u0027re wearing now?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re in hospital garb, Jebediah,\u0022 Evelina said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Exactly. Comfy, has it\u0027s own temperature regulation system, tailored to you, repels dirt, what\u0027s not to love?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The blue and white polka dots.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Also we don\u0027t have socks or shoes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Point taken. Get your stuff, I\u0027ll find something for you to wear, and we\u0027re out of here in a few minutes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Where are we going?\u0022 I asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kerbin. Illasticonia is likely one of the next places to be attacked. The planet is being evacuated as we speak. We\u0027ll debrief you further when we get there.\u0022 I looked out the window at the majestic blue city. This could all be gone in who knows how long? I started tearing up. \u0022Ethan, let\u0027s go!\u0022 I snapped out of it and quickly walked back into my room and gathered up the few things that were mine. I wondered... Would this room ever be used again? There was an earsplitting beep in the hallway. I heard Jebediah cry out. I ran back to see what was happening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb was backed up against the airlock door. In front of him was a green hologram,\u00A0with ethereal webs spreading out in tendrils all around, a dark spot in the middle that evoked the reaction one would get if it were\u00A0a hideous creature, though this creature was without form apart from\u00A0the darkness. It spoke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Greetings, Representative Jebediah Kerman. I speak for The Species. I come with a crucial message.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You!\u0022 snarled Jebediah. I had never heard him speak with this level of anger and fear. \u0022Get out of our galaxy!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022All of the Galactic Representatives will arrive to the Galactic Council Chamber around Sagittarius\u00A0A* for one final meeting. A final\u00A0surrender\u00A0agreement will be presented. If not accepted, we will never offer you another deal and will proceed with our ideal galactic plans. The meeting will commence in exactly\u00A03 Ziquunodian days. You may bring all the force you desire ,as\u00A0 it will do nothing. If a representative is not present, that representative\u0027s planet shall be immediately obliterated. If The Species has already destroyed that planet, a random inhabited world will be destroyed instead.\u00A0We would like to remind you that the Species exists as a driving force to discover all that exists, learn all that is to be known,\u00A0and prolong existence, no matter the cost. The time is ticking, Jebediah. You certainly don\u0027t want your world to end up like Meros.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Jebediah clenched his fists and began to tremble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You didn\u0027t have to make this personal. This is not a personal matter.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Neither was Meros.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E The green orb curled up into itself, spinning faster and faster, its light growing brighter and brighter, until it plinked out of existence. Evelina had seen the whole thing from down the hallway. I had hid behind the door. and peeked out. It probably didn\u0027t help. The Species probably knew exactly where I was the whole time. Nobody spoke for a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I need to go,\u0022 said Jebediah, in a tone of voice I had never heard him use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright. Let\u0027s go,\u0022 said Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No. You are not coming. The Species are going to have all of the most important people in the galaxy in one place. We will be completely at their mercy, if they even have a single ounce of mercy among them. You two are going back to Kerbin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeb - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I was blackmailed into taking both of you with me on a dangerous, likely one way mission before, and I won\u0027t make the same mistake again. You two are getting put on the next neutron bolt to hub 9 and from there, a secure ship back to Kerbin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I...

Who knows what they will have at the chamber? This isn\u0027t an adventure game. We can\u0027t keep looking at danger and saying \u0022Oh, that looks fun!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022True.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Come.

I wish you safety on your journey.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Likewise,\u0022 I said. \u0022But what\u0027s Meros?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I said come on, Ethan, we need to get your stuff.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeb - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Put on these bubble helmets.

I think that we can still take off with three. We just have to mount the third one on the bottom and leave the top two.

In order to build loads of carbon capture machines and an orbiting sunshade, we need time. We have under three weeks before people start dropping dead because newsflash, they can\u0027t breathe carbon. Best case scenario, the sunshades will take several times that.\u00A0The planet is so hot now that forests are dying and burning constantly, releasing more carbon than the rest of Meros combined. This carbon makes the planet even hotter. It\u0027s a feedback loop. In order to stop this feedback loop, we need to take drastic action to cool the planet down as soon as possible.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Which is what the sunshade is for!\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Again, we don\u0027t have time for a permanent one now, but we have time for something more temporary:\u00A0Uncountable tons of dust flying up there blocking out the sun should do the job. Our top scientists have been calculating day and night. We have enough nuclear material to blow a giant chunk of land into the air, blocking out most of the sunlight. We would have used a supervolcano but your planet doesn\u0027t have any of those.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022It\u0027s enough of a shock to our scientists that an atomic explosive is even possible.

Do you think you are ready?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well... Yes. I trust Cheng\u0027s math. I think I can take off without much issue. Cheng, are we go?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes. We are go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright. Let\u0027s review the takeoff plan.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Orient so that we\u0027re nose up facing the proper direction, rock back and forth, warming up the jet engine. When we\u0027re swinging upwards, we fire the sepratrons and detach the klaw once we\u0027re at a sufficient angle. The sepratrons will get the jet to a speed where it can work well enough to accelerate us. Arc over to the precalculated angles shown on the tables I made. Once we\u0027re out of the thick part of the\u00A0atmosphere, we transfer fuel around, stage, fire the plane\u0027s engine, and run out of fuel. Alonya, at this point you will go EVA and grab onto the John Cena\u0027s ladder. Then, we undock, and I\u0027ll carefully fly the John Cena to orbit. If we don\u0027t get all the way there, we jetpack.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright. I think I\u0027ve got it.\u0022 She paused for a second. \u0022Cheng... This is insane.
