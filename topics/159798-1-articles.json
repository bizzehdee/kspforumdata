Get into orbit and not die. The flight to Duna was uneventful. He successfully completes the\u00A0rendezvous with Duna. The Swivel Engine knocks the velocity down to a high orbit. Rocket science ensues, then Jeb fires the engine back to Interplanetary space. All of the sudden, the engine cuts out. Then, I realize that a lack of fuel made a very dangerous situation, stranding Jebediah an an orbit a long way from home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo then comes the rescue. Since Wernher von Kerman neglected to plan for this and slap a docking port onto the ship, his genius idea was to build a probe with claws, slap it onto the same rocket body, and send it up to Jeb in order to push his ship back to Kerbin. This rendezvous occurs without incident. The only problem is, a lack of Reaction Control makes the docked ship unable to fly in a straight line for very long. A long and slow burn ensues, slowly hauling Jeb towards Kerbin. This time however, the rescue probe runs out of fuel, stranding Jeb on an elliptical orbit instead of the fairly circular one from before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe solution? Drop the empty rescue probe (I\u0027m terrible at space junk management) and launch a new one, but add more boosters.\u00A0This time the mission was a success, and Jeb was brought home!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s my half million dollar rescue mission!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Moose In Your House","CreatedById":177101,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-26T18:04:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRescuing my rescue ship that was trying to rescue a rescue ship trying to rescue Jeb after he crashed his Mun lander by getting distracted and claimed he saw the \u0022Kracken\u0022, after the mission I lost 12 kerbals but managed to rescue Jeb.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-26T18:33:10Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2017 06:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by The Moose In Your House\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crillion","CreatedById":177185,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-26T18:18:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223035486\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159798\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221493229871\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022177101\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Moose In Your House\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 minutes ago, The Moose In Your House said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRescuing my rescue ship that was trying to rescue a rescue ship trying to rescue Jeb, after the mission I lost 12 kerbals but managed to rescue Jeb.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorth it!

First of all, I didn\u0027t know how to use gravity assists at the time, so I did a powered insertion around Jool. Then after deciding that Bop would be the \u0022best\u0022 one to visit (despite its high inclination) I made a maneuver mode and got a Bop encounter.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, because I didn\u0027t bother to correct my inclination and because my orbit was so eccentric, my relative velocity was like 1500m/s, and I was on\u00A0a collision course with Bop. I didn\u0027t have a lander, so the whole ship had to land on Bop. I landed on a steep slope, and was sliding along at almost a meter a second. I had drills, and if I had landed in a better location, I would have been able to get home, but the ore concentration was below 2.5%, so I couldn\u0027t drill. I also didn\u0027t have enough fuel to land again without jettisoning my side tanks with the drills, so I just left after plabeting the flag and getting loads of science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring my ejection from Jool, I again didn\u0027t use gravity assists from Tylo or Laythe, so leaving Jool took almost 1000m/s. I then left Jool\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, and plotted a course for Kerbin.

After about 20 minutes of messing about with a maneuver that would get me a rendezvous with the dead ship, I timewarped ahead 4 years or so to the rendezvous. It went smoothly, and Ted,Bob, and some Kerbal whose name I don\u0027t remember were ecstatic to be returning. I then left the vessel and \u00A0 got a Kerbin encounter, which was ANOTHER 4 years ahead. In order to get home as soon as possible, my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E was at Moho orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I entered Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, I found that my relative velocity was around 9.3km/s. Thinking that I would certainly die on reentry, I used the remaining fuel to slow down, but my re-entry velocity was not any slower due to acceleration. Coming in at 9.5 kilometers a second, I simply thought there was no way the head shield could endure the inferno. To my surprise, it barely managed to scrape by, and Gee force reached at least 30 G. I then got captured and slowed down to deploy the parachutes and splashed safely in the ocean. To this day, I haven\u0027t been able to re create this ridiculously fast re-entry without the head shield failing.
