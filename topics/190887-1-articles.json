So much for the degree. That being said, back when I tried scenarios (which was a long time ago!) it was not always clear what you are meant to do.\u00A0 I\u0027d say, read tutorial (there is whole category\u00A0 here on forums) or watch some video on topic of orbital mechanics (Scott Manley be your guide). It\u0027s not\u00A0hard, it\u0027s not even particularly complicated. It\u0027s just different and need some getting used to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
