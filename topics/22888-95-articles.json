He has not responded because none of us know exactly what he is doing. Finally have you seen the **** this guy is doing? Mercury through Gemini and all the stuff in between! I dont care about the scale being completely accurate and neither should you. Remember Kerbin isnt earth so he doesn\u0027t need to make the rocket the same size as the Saturn V. You could probably get to Jool and back with a full scale Saturn V. He is making accurate to the scale of the Kerbol system and from Kerbin to the Mun. All I care about is that is doesn\u0027t look like stock parts, closely resembles the saturn v and gets me to the mun and back. And that I can use the parts to make wicked rockets of my own. Also just be a little more diplomatic. This guy doesnt have share any of this especially for free. So let him do what he does best and give him time. I mean look at what he has done already. There are very few other modders on here that are doing what this guy is doing and at the pace.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-06T20:00:25Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2014 08:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by sp1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
