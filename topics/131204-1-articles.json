It goes from hot greenhouse state to a cold state caused by the great oxygenation event. Simple fission for bugs works well, and we do see perfectly replicating creatures, cloning oneself is effectively immortality from a microbes point of view, up until something massive changes, then its what we call an evolutionary dead end. Eucaryotes get around this issue by exchanging gametes, simple enough we could have an exact copy of mother and father inside our genome, but theres a problem because the genes sort dependently on linkage groups. To solve this problem eucaryotes more or less have a recombination facility known as meiotic division (and its presteps). This cause the genes on linkage groups to sort semi-independently, but consequently to be realized it must also create a new, different, individual something that cannot be a clone. Having two copies now allows for a higher mutation rate, the mess gets sorted out by the F1 generation (selection). It does not have to be like this but it tends to be that case that parent one creates a meiotic cell and parent 2 the same, and they combine these into filial X (with two chromosomes of every type with no single chromosome exactly like either chromosome of the parents). IOW parent cannot carry on by cloning themselves by fission. This is a wildly successful group survival scheme for complex organisms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now you have progeny that are different and in selection with the parents, in a zero sum game, if parents cannot procreate at the rate of F1 then they are now consuming progeny resources, so selection does not favor immortality, instead it favors variation. There are other mechanisms, like balancing selection and heterozygous selection rates that favor diversity this allows populations to be older by showing more diversity than actually exists (offspring tend to select non-alike mates for certain critical traits like immunity). This has the benefit of allowing them to live longer and produce less progeny.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yasmy","CreatedById":79995,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-02T02:45:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222389755\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022131204\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221454374325\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298447\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022YNM\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, YNM said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re not immortal because we reproduce sexually.
