Although you can program the flight computer to initiate timed commands for thrusting while unfocused, which you\u0027ll still (I\u0027m guessing) be required to have a connected signal to activate and use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for staggering launches, that\u0027s what I\u0027d do. Granted I made a four dish configuration that separates at a certain point, and uses the flight computer to coordinate timed burns for orbits. Just try and stagger as best as you can and then if one is too far ahead, lower your orbit to speed up and then level out, and visa versa. Not sure how far out they should be, perhaps 250km? Oh, and Mechjeb helps if you want razor close orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps. Maybe someone could explain better then myself. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaHuJa","CreatedById":58370,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-12T16:36:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kethevin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kethevin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehow exactly to place satellites 90 degrees apart from one another.

You launch the first one, figure out (measure) the launch phase angle (how far an object in the target circular orbit moves ahead of you if it was straight over you at the time you start the ascent. Then you launch the next one when the phase angle is 90\u002B-LPA. This assumes the ascent happens identically, meaning you don\u0027t have any mishaps, you start the gravity turn at the same time AND altitude, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other way to do it, is to launch them all from the same ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Get into the orbit you want the satellites to hold\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Release the first satellite\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Burn prograde so you have a 1.25 times longer orbit time than the satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) When you have done the complete orbit, you\u0027re at the correct place for the next satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your sats have engines of their own, you can release it, let it burn itself into the correct orbit, and repeat that every time. If not, you\u0027ll need to slow the ship, release a sat, and burn up to your extended orbit again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing this method you can get them in perfect position with one ship, and this will also work well for placing satellites around other bodies than the one you launch your ships from. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a setup of 3 RemoteTech Microprobes around kerbin that I deployed in a perfect triangle using that method, though I naturally had to use 1.33 rather than 1.25. To maintain line of sight, they had to be some 600km up. You can be lower if you use more satellites, I just wanted to unclutter my ship lists. If you have space, you can lower your orbit instead, 1/1.25 = 0.8 times the orbit time. If you want to save dV, you can do half the difference (1.125x or 0.9x) and wait two full orbits instead of one. Or three or four.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaughed off the forums? Hardly.
