If you design the craft with nearly perfect horizontal symmetry (as in it is not left or right side heavy) and if you have enough pitch authority (center of mass stays slightly forward of center of lift and you have enough control surfaces that can lift the nose with relative ease) you can get very good stability using only pitch trim.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo set pitch trim, turn \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E off and hold Alt while you slew up and down with the S and W keys.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is not perfect, it is a catch-all algorithm that is trying to keep a huge range of rockets and planes stable, with a lot of drawbacks.

In the spirit of conveying information on \u0027how to\u0027 rather than \u0027do this\u0027, I submit the following...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot trying to over-simplify physics, but in the void of space, the resultant path or motion of a vehicle is a consequence of, in essence, a thrust vector and its relationship to the center of mass interacting with a single gravitational body (yes, there are localized interactions, but they are just that - localized). While in the atmosphere, however, there are numerous aerodynamic couples that complicate the forces, and thus the path of the vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn steady unaccelerated flight, the forces of lift = weight and thrust = drag, but if *ANY* of those forces change, it results in a cascade of related changes that in reality even super-computers have a tough time calculating, much less your humble desk-top computer or lap-top, not to mention that the fidelity of the software cannot really approach the true dynamics of the process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that said, KSP attempts to retain a level of \u0027honesty\u0027 to their simulation and in doing so makes things rather \u0022squirrelly\u0022, so the solution falls upon the user\u0027s ability to both make a design that is not prone to over controlling (one in which small inputs result in large movements), but also has the ability to \u0022finely tune\u0022 the control inputs to establish and maintain the lift=weight, thrust=drag relationship. Those two concepts translate into designs that fly a specific profile that varies only minimally with the corresponding gradual change in mass due to fuel consumption.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s the \u0027why\u0027, but in practice not the \u0027how\u0027. The \u0027how\u0027 is made more possible by following certain design philosophies like not putting in an \u0022angle of incidence\u0022 on wing/tail parts to enable a wider operating range OR building WITH various \u0022angle\u0027s of incidence\u0022 knowing you will generally fly at one particular airspeed and will be able to set thrust and trim to maintain that condition. Also keeping the thrust vector as close in line with the center of lift so changes in thrust have minimal effect on stability is another consideration. Because take-off and landing speeds relative to the design speed are significantly different, separate lift considerations will have to be made to accommodate those flight regimes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnecdotally (meaning I am aware my solution is one of many) once your design has allowed for overall stability as suggested above, using the trim feature (Alt-W or S) is key to achieving the \u0027hands off\u0027 flight path you desire, and once established, having \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ethen\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E turned on seems to provide a solution that allows x4 physics warp to speed things along without going out of control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope that helps... As always, YMMV.

reason for an unstable plane (especially on the pitch axis) is that your \u003Cstrong\u003Ecenter of mass is behind the center of dynamic pressure\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I mean by that:\u00A0 Imagine you have a badminton birdie.\u00A0 If you throw it with the heavy weighted end in front, then it\u0027s stable and will fly through the air in that orientation just fine.\u00A0 But if you try to throw it with the feathered end in front... it just aint\u0027 gonna happen.\u00A0 It\u0027ll flip around; the weighted end wants to be in front.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt does that because,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nthe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E wants to be in front, and\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nthe draggy part wants to be in back.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for example, if you have a plane with a big lightweight fuselage sticking way out in front, but a lot of heavy engines at the back of the plane, you end up with a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E that\u0027s pretty far to the rear, meaning the plane kinda wants to fly backwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can make up for that a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elittle\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E bit with control surfaces... but not only is that a bit dicey, but also \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe effectiveness of a control surfacve depends on its lever arm, measured to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0 If the control surface is too close to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, it has very little control authority on the plane.\u00A0 For example, if you build a craft whose \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E is way towards the back of the plane... then that means that any pitch controls on the aircraft tail (\u0022elevators\u0022) are pretty close to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and won\u0027t actually do much for you, meaning they can\u0027t help stabilize the plane\u0027s pitch well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso:\u00A0 If you have a vertical stabilizer on the tail to control yaw... you should make it \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eas vertically close to the center axis of the plane as possible\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E (i.e. not sticking way up high above the plane).\u00A0 And be sure to \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edisable \u003Cstrong\u003Eroll\u003C/strong\u003E authority on it\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E (i.e. it should be set to address only yaw, not roll).\u00A0 I could explain in detail why this is, but it would be a longer explanation and I\u0027ll save

Jet engines would be the best choice, a hybrid of Whiplash ramjets and a NERV would most likely be enough to get into orbit due to Laythe\u2019s low orbital velocity and fairly thin atmosphere and would also have the big advantage of using solely liquid fuel and no oxidiser.

They\u2019ll add quite a bit of drag making it harder to fly into orbit, but can also hold fuel. You\u2019ve mentioned propellers, which I\u2019ll assume means you have Breaking Ground and which also means you could make the floats retractable for flying up to orbit and then deployable for water landings; some heavy duty hinges might be the best bet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd back to the original point of the thread... Planes are rarely stable in flight as all the different forces acting on them change considerably depending on things like speed and altitude.
