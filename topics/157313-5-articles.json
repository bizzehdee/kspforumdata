I fully support the idea of mod lists with links to each mod\u0027s forum thread and additional configs or installation recommendations provided by the list maker. If they want the players following the lists to use specific versions with known compatibility, then they can just mention that in their list. It\u0027s less work for the list maker and modders don\u0027t need to worry as much about random outdated versions existing somewhere they don\u0027t have control over, which is better for the players as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook at Realism Overhaul and/or RP-0.

For me at the moment, it\u0027s just too much time commitment out of my limited time for KSP. But...if someone packed together a suite of VFX mods that are tested well to work together and look good (while of course honoring licenses, being courteous to the original modders, and supporting their own distribution), then I\u0027d be first in line to click download. To a large degree this is what some of the existing VFX suites already are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis has been\u00A0my experience as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAside from KSP, Morrowind and Fallout 3 are the only games I\u0027ve ever applied mods to. Both games have a daunting number of mods that change the base appearance of the game. . .sky boxes, weather effects, terrain textures, character models and animations,\u00A0etc. Basic incompatibilities aside, as a player it is very easy to assemble\u00A0a batch\u00A0of VFX mods that \u003Ci\u003Efunction\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0together, but end up looking horrible when taken as a group.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am a big fan of \u0022graphics overhaul\u0022 or \u0022visual compilation\u0022 packs that allow me to apply a certain aesthetic to my game without having to spend an inordinate amount of time experimenting with dozens of different VFX mods a la carte. This is especially beneficial in games like KSP where there\u00A0is a strong emphasis on exploration-- having to manually fiddle with and evaluate all of the artwork ruins some of the \u0022I wonder what\u0027s over the next hill?\u0022 surprise. I find VFX packs attractive because I know someone with an eye for it has taken the time to comb through the final product to make sure the artwork blends well.

Clearly, there are ways to do compilation packs right (full list of mods, their licenses, their authors, etc) and ways to do them\u00A0wrong.

Do you allow others to redistribute your mod? Yes, great, others can host your work on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, Spacedock, etc. for you.

However there is significant gray area here, the CC license uses the term \u0022passed along unchanged and in whole\u0022 to define if something is a derivative or not which means that \u003Cstrong\u003Elegally speaking\u003C/strong\u003E if someone changes a single character in a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E config file and then re-uploads the mod with no other changes, the derivatives clause applies as the mod is changed, even if only very technically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow the rules of the forum are both more flexible as the moderators are around to enforce them, and also more limited as they only cover the forum, not all methods of distribution. In short, the moderators can define a modpack as they see fit and ban them, the question then comes back to \u0022what is a mod-pack\u0022?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd at this point I\u0027m going to leave it, I\u0027m actually not sure what my feelings on this subject are.

For both users\u0027 and authors\u0027 sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\u0022 This is interesting because it could be taken to mean that the creator of a mod-pack must indicated that my mod has been changed and that all problems are with the modpack are taken to him. It\u0027s arguable how well that would work and it\u0027s still reactionary in that it is action taken after the modpack is put up, not before, but an interesting thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nD.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-07T16:16:04Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2017 04:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Diazo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
