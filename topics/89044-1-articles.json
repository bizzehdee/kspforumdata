It\u0027s OpenGL capabilities are far higher than it\u0027s Direct3D capabilities. However, you will still run into significant bottlenecks, including limits on the amount of video memory you can allocate and latencies when transferring things to and from video memory. This is not to the fact that the virtual video driver prevents the proper optimization of shaders for your bare-metal hardware.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have two video cards you can set up a dedicated video card for your virtual box machine. This is faster, but difficult to set up. It still will have some latencies, but your guest OS will have direct access to the video card.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of VM-Ware, I recommend against using VM-Ware for gaming at all.
