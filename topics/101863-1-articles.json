The option is just not there for any but the first one. The Unity file has all three animations setup in its animation component. \n\nThe actual model has only the first animation actually in the model used in Unity from the Blender file. The other animations were stripped out because of the KSP issue with multiple animations. Or did I make an idiotic mistake? Should I have all animations within the actual model in Blender first? \n\nWhere have I made my mistake?"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T20:46:00Z","Content":"you have 3 FSanimateGeneric modules in the config file, one for each animation clip? do the animations try to animate same objects in the part? what messages do you see in ALT-F2 when you attempt to trigger the animation?\n\nhow the animation clips are created doesn\u0027t matter."},{"CreatedByName":"MLWostal","CreatedById":134330,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T20:54:20Z","Content":"Currently, I have only 2 FSanimateGeneric modules in the config file.

I must confess, since I was not even getting a button, I did not check Alt-F2.\n\nI will check the debug screen and post the results here.\n\nUPDATE\\*\n\nNo errors in the Debug window. All looks normal but an error message might have popped up earlier and I missed it. Though, I was watching the window during the entire loading process.\n\nUnity is my nemesis!
