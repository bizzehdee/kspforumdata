For example, build your lander as usual, place any probe core above it, select that one as the new root, and save the lander as a subassembly. Now start a new craft, build the CSM, and place the lander from the subassembly under it. Then put the lifter stage below that. Voila, there\u0027s your Apollo mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fastbikkel","CreatedById":101702,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T12:54:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks blizzy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo a mod is needed?
