I\u0027ve been looking around in this section, and its really hard to find the information I\u0027ve been looking for. I\u0027d like to use this thread to document choices of lifters for various weight ratings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would like to do is that you guys can send me the desing of your lifters along with how much weight they can send to orbit around Kerbin. Lets make it a benchmark of a LKO of 100km. So a 40t lifter would have to bring a 40t payload into a 100km orbit around kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I am suggesting is for you guys to send me designs via PM. You can either give me some sorts of blueprints or simply clear printscreens of your lifters, or the files to the craft itself. The reason I want them by PM is to limit the amount of replies in this thread so that I can keep it clean, simple, and easy to follow. I will, of course, give all the credit to the author of the design in here. If you send a design that is not from you, please include the name of the original creator so that I can give the credit to the right person. Don\u0027t send a design that\u0027s not yours unless you are certain that the original creator is ok with the fact that his/her design is made public. I will try to keep this thread updated with the top 2 or 3 lifters I\u0027ve received for each weight rating. I may, sometimes, modify your rating a little bit. For example, if you send me a design for a 80 tons lifter, and I find it a bit too hard to lift 80 tons with it (like it barely has enough DV to reach a 100km orbit, and any mistake would mean not getting it), I may classify it for a lower DV. Since I still lack experience with the game, I think that if I can use it successfully, anyone can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rules are simple:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Your design must be composed of ONLY stock parts. No parts from any mod whatsoever. None. I do have mech jeb, but I do not want to use it for this at all. the reason for it is to make sure that everybody can use them, without being forced to install mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Your design have to be clear for me to follow. If you don\u0027t give me printscreens that I can see exactly how the craft is made, I may decide to overlook it. Include more than one print screen if the craft is too complex! I don\u0027t even know how that works but I think you can also just send the files for the craft. You can do that too, I\u0027ll take care of making the printscreens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you have specific directions on how to control the craft, like don\u0027t turn before 15km or whatever, please include those when you send the designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I would like for your designs to include a bit of extra fuel. Remember, this topic is not necessarily for the more experienced players. It\u0027s purpose is to help out new players. I am expecting the people who will use your designs, including myself, to make piloting errors. Please don\u0027t assume it will be piloted flawlessly. Doesn\u0027t have to include double the DeltaV needed, but lets say it would be nice for it to have at least 2-300 m/s extra once you are in a stable orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I reserve the right to post my own printscreen instead of yours if I find yours are not clear enough. However, I will still give you full credits for it. Its just about making it easy for the people to replicate the lifter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I don\u0027t have payload categories set in stone at the moment. Just tell me how much weight you personally rate your lifters for, I\u0027ll organize them in categories myself. May vary a bit from yours but I\u0027ll try to classify them in a category as close as possible to your rating. (I don\u0027t want to have 100 categories lol.) However, even if I put it in a slightly diffrent category, I will include the rating you gave me (if you tell me a lifter is rated for 80 tons, but after my classification it ends up in the 60 tons category, I\u0027ll mention that you rated it for 80 tons).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure that would help so many people to gain experience in the game. Seeing other people\u0027s designs, well organized like that helps to see what works and what doesn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarily, you can also send me designs for thugs and SSTOs. I may be creating seperate threads for those though, or compile them in a diffrent post in this thread. Keep in mind I am absolutely horrible when it comes to piloting SSTOs I\u0027ve never really used them I am no clue what I\u0027m doing with those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease keep the chit-chat to a minimum here, the goal is for this thread to be as clear as possible. I don\u0027t want people to have to be looking in 40 pages to find their designs. I\u0027d like this thread to fit in only one or two pages ideally. I want this thread to be as usefull as possible for me and all the other newbies out there!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you guys are willing to help out on this! I think that would be a great tool for all the newbies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, if you want to submit a design or if you have questions or comments, try to PM me instead of replying here, as I\u0027m trying to keep the thread as clear as possible!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thunder_86","CreatedById":148043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-13T13:41:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, apparently not too many people are willing to share their creations...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll upload mine instead, but they aren\u0027t great (far from it), and are still work in progress...

These are all Subassemblies, not craft. They include decouplers, but not fairings which you would typically want to go below that decoupler. They are designed for use with StageRecovery so they do carry a bit extra weight in parachutes on the more expensive stages. The Tier 5 and higher decouplers include self de-orbiting sepatrons, so point prograde before staging. If you want \u0027pure\u0027 Tier 5 you can easily remove them.

The ONLY thing I don\u0027t like about his lifter is the lack of reaction wheels, probe core, solar panels and batteries. I wanted to fine tune my orbit but couldn\u0027t steer the ship anymore. When I design a lifter, I keep in mind that the thing I launch will maybe not have any control whatsoever, so I always include control in the lifter itself. Apart than that, his designs are absolutely awesome. He is also excellent at making the rockets good looking, the way he clips stuff, it makes for very interesting designs!

I get the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow about this thing? I use a similar design on a lot of things because it basically removes the whole wobble problem. The rocket stacks work to reinforce each other. Payload is either completely in the middle, or, in this case, the payload is a combination of the middle and the top of each stack which then makes a nice, broad lander and a nice squarish spacecraft for maneuverability. This one is pretty simple, flies nicely and is easy to see what is going on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s called the XP Bus because I slapped it together to take 9 fresh kerbal recruits and get them to level 3 in one flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2j9nMYj.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u00222j9nMYj.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EyjhZut.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022EyjhZut.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-16T01:12:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Thunder_86\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Thunder_86\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EExcellent, I\u0027ll try that.
