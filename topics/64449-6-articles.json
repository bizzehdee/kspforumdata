It showcases the new RAPIER engine while still making the pilot worry about asymmetric flame-out. I\u0027m not sure whether it will actually go into a spin if I let it, but it certainly will yaw menacingly. The Rasvelg is capable of reaching a 100 x 100 km orbit, even if the pilot switches modes at only 25,000m and under 1200 m/s. I\u0027m pretty sure in one of my many test flights, I was at as low as 23,000m when I switched over, and I still got to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn takeoff, it is possible to damage the probe against the runway if you have the nose high enough at any takeoff speed. This is intentional, though easily avoidable. Recommended takeoff speed is anything above 70 m/s, though it can be done (without damaging the probe) as low as 60. It is not terribly maneuverable with a full fuel load, though it\u0027s meant to be climbing, so that\u0027s less important during the first half of the flight. Still, it can make an immelman turn in under 1500m at full throttle, so that\u0027s not too bad, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the Rasvelg is almost empty, it flies as I want it to: it\u0027s more responsive, easy to handle and has a good glide slope. I really designed its flight characteristics for what I consider the most important phase of the flight: Landing. Too much lift here and it may be difficult to get it to the runway.
