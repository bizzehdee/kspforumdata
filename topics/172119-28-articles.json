Yes Squad isn\u0027t that realistic of a target but Take Two is. That\u0027s why people are concerned. Squad talked to the customers because they cared more and had a small base. Take Two would sell KSP and leave it in the dirt if they could make a profit.

I\u0027m not blatantly suggesting Take Two doesn\u0027t care about KSP, they do but they will dump it from a sensible business prospective if it is no longer profitable.

I don\u0027t have the energy to explain that process at the moment, but I\u0027m sure you can find what you need on a site similar to the one linked above, if you choose to go that route. (Look for \u0027dual booting\u0027 a computer - often used for two different operating systems, but no reason you can\u0027t do it with two of the same. You\u0027ll want to do it with an external hard drive or USB [if you can get one that will fit the OS and KSP on it] that can be disconnected when running the online OS, for added security.) Simply put it would be like having another computer without needing to have all of the additional hardware. No way for data to be mined through KSP if your ethernet cable isn\u0027t plugged in and you aren\u0027t connected to Wifi, and the data can\u0027t be sent when you reconnect because that virtual computer will never be booted (or even attached with external HD) while connected to the internet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know this doesn\u0027t address the underlying philosophical issues you have with the Terms, but it would be the most foolproof practical solution to your concerns that I can offer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheif Operations Director","CreatedById":183218,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-12T01:21:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223317574\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022171236\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221520817540\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002227914\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 minute ago, Vanamonde said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome posts have been removed from this thread or edited.
