It is scared with intricate tranches that stretch across the planet. Each one is 100m to 2km wide and 2km to 6km deep, with the occasional eroded, sandy bank leading up the sides of the cliffs. Natural bridges often can be found between narrow parts of the trenches. At the bottom of the trenches are dried up river beds. The trenches lead to a large, deep crater that covers a fourth of the planets surface. The crater is filled with lush jungle and exotic crystal formations, and the little water that remains on the planet gathers here. Large sand dunes and differing cliff heights make perfect jumps for rovers and the trenches are great for driving through. Dotting the planet are lone mountains with sparse alpine foliage beginning about a third of the way up the mountains, forming micro biomes around the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe large crater on Turanos was from an ancient cataclysmic impact on what used to be an ocean. Chunks of the planet were torn off and formed two moons, Darby and Yubea. They are roughly the same size, both of which are a little smaller than Gilly. They share the same orbit, but are on opposite sides of the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDarby\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFormed from Turanos\u0027 crust and ocean, and parts of the dense meteor that struck the planet.

It orbits right at the very edge of the Kerbal\u0027s Solar system. If it were to have an orbit at all bigger, it would lose its orbit around the sun entirely. Valtine has 3 moons and a 2 rings. If you get into the rings, your ship will take serious damage, and eventually explode. It\u0027s first one is called Salge. Salge is basically a moon with a very dense atmosphere, 5x as dense as Kerbin! It\u0027s atmosphere is also quite small, so if you can put a spaceship or probe around Salge, it\u0027s very rewarding. The second moon is Kerbona. Kerbona is a moon with no atmosphere, low gravity, pretty small, but a LOT of volcanic activity. The volcanic activity means its hard to land safely here. The final moon is call Deralt. Deralt has a lot of mountains, a lot of caves, and a lot of ice deposits. Deralt has an atmosphere, but a very thin one.
