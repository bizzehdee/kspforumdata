And it has some very dark prospects. I heard about studies that suggests that the base of the technology is already available. Think of prosthetic limbs that\u0027s moved by neural impulses. That\u0027s a very basic application of translating neural impulses to digital data. The question is how complex impulses can we transcode, and if the process can be reversed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImagine if we could convert audiovisual sensory information to raw data and back. That\u0027s essentially the plug from the Matrix movies. There it was used to fake a reality and digitally exchange experience. That\u0027s dark enough as it is. But for example in the Shadowrun universe, it\u0027s used (among other things) as drugs. It can easily reproduce the effects of classic substances, but it\u0027s harder versions are the \u0027Better Than Life\u0027 chips. Imagine Felix Baumgartner\u0027s jump not just recorded by a go-pro camera, but by a \u0027simsense\u0027 rig that stores every sensory information, that can be relayed to any user\u0027s brain.

Have it done by an \u003Cs\u003Eevil\u003C/s\u003E very practical AI, and we arrived to the Borg. The common borgified creatures are drones. Basically zombies, controlled by the \u0027hive mind\u0027 - I assume it\u0027s motoric AI control. The Queen (and the assimilated cpt. Picard in the series) are a step further - they kinda\u0027 keep their personality and creativity, so I assume it\u0027s a higher level of digital control - not a motoric, but a cognitive one. I always found the borg infinitely more interesting than anything the ST universe could come up with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow in 2010, I read about a prototype prosthetic eye replacement for blind people. It was big, monochrome, and had a resolution of 34x34 px. Maybe the technology failed or was a dead-end. I\u0027m not the type of guy who goes into conspiration theories because the lack of further data. But if were a sci-fi writer, I\u0027d totally imagine some government buying the project up to the last pencil to further develop it.

It\u0027s really hard to follow a conversation when the \u0022person\u0022 you\u0027re talking to is actually the entire ship, and Captain Picard appears to be talking to an empty room.

Well, it\u0027s basically similar to, say, during World War II when Allied engineers snagged German fighter planes and dissected them to see how the Germans were building their stuff. If you find new ideas in there, you copy them in your own designs. If you find weaknesses, you build your new weapons designs to exploit those weaknesses. The Borg take you and stick you in their Assimilate-O-Tron 6000, turn you into one of them, and then all your ideas become theirs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found KAL 9000\u0027s choice of thread title amusing for that reason--the Borg don\u0027t have any real science of their own.

worked it into the black spandex costumes. throw in a robot arm here and an eyepeice there. then the actors were painted plae white to contrast the black tech bits, and you get the

such an esoteric concept wouldn\u0027t fly in theaters, so they invented the queen to act as the antagonist. voyager continued this nonsense and over used the borg so much that they became laughable. they could have potrayed it as a temporary coup in the borg power structure and gone back to the hive mind for the show. but the temptations of prop reuse manifested themselves and the queen costume came out of wardrobe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nas for assimilation thats pretty much the process of bringing an individual into the collective. this involves networking their mind to the collective and installing implants in their body (if you watch both parts of bobw you notice locutus is having new implants installed throughout the episodes) for whatever tasks they are to be assigned. in the classic borg the mind would be part of the hive mind and the hive mind could control the individual borg. first contact borg, assimilated individuals become drones and both mind and body would essentially be slaves to the queen. you might say that applied to locutus but i figure in that case his \u0027voice\u0027 was present but drowned out by the greater hive mind. first contact

Somewhere in the past, a bunch of individuals, probably very few, thought \u0022hey, let\u0027s hook ourselves together and all be one great big mind\u0022. And when they did that, they all collectively decided to run out and start assimilating stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe real grist here is, the Borg started out as individuals with individual memories; the collective they formed still had all those individual memories. The Collective looked at itself as a bunch of individuals, and as this new Mind, and decided \u0022yeah, this way\u0027s better\u0022.

Not of the Collective, but of not being in it. She wanted to plug herself back in. She was assimilated at a very young age (something like five or six years old), and the Collective is pretty much all she knows. Probably a lot of the Collective\u0027s members are like that; they were either born into it or they\u0027ve been in it so long they\u0027ve gotten used to it, to the point where they don\u0027t want to unplug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
