I\u0027m looking for something around the $50 Dollar mark. I may be looking to spend more though based on one hang up. I like the idea of a separate throttle. it seems like it would be more comfortable and easier to control if it wasn\u0027t a tiny thrust button on the bottom of the joy stick. However for the $50 dollar price range, I\u0027m only getting x-y control. Would I miss the other axis(es)? Am I making too big of a deal about a separate throttle console? Which ones do you guys use, what do you like about them and what do you wish you had?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-13T22:25:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI used to use a Logitech MX-518 mouse.
