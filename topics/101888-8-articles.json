This tool will not be needed at all! So the lifecycle of this tool will end soon - maybe in the next 6 months as soon as the most part of the mods  have been ported to 1.1.\n\nBTW: How are modders [@ferram4](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/21328-ferram4/) [@NathanKell](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/75006-nathankell/)  doing porting to 1.1? Is it hard??\n\nCheers!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-05T20:07:41Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2016 08:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by jrodriguez**"}]}
