But my concern is how are you going to dock it. Is it on the Mun surface or is it in orbit? Or can it get to orbit? They don\u0027t break real easy but they do bend and even if you manage to land directly on top of the craft on the Mun, the moment you decelerate it\u0027s going to fall over. It\u0027s best if you can at least get to an 8k orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s still possible from the surface but it takes some skill. You have to land the docking port an dock the craft together while one is flying and the moment you dock hit the gas to pull away from the surface. The rescue craft absolutely can not stop all acceleration. Basically a celestial claw game. Another way would be to build your rescue craft to \u0022wrap around\u0022 the other but with it sitting on the moon, getting it the perfect height would be difficult.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, do you need the other craft at all?

I am sure that applies to the other docking ports too. More concerning would be if all the other parts below will hold. Here are my pennys on that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy personal approach would be to try to detach unneeded weight before re-entry (just like in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0186566/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESpace Cowboys\u003C/a\u003E) if that\u0027s possible (and not loose much stability).

So if you placed them in a 4-symmetry and edit one parachute, the other three parachutes are set to those values too. But after launch, those numbers are adjusted individually for each parachute and changing one will not affect the other three (and I like it that way).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure that you full-deploy the parachutes one after one on descent. Maybe starting at 300 meters and going up 100 meters each parachute. The half-deployment pressure can stay unchanged. The first parachute that is to open will shake the vessel heavily to the side but will reduce the load that tries to rip it apart. On further descent all the other parachutes deploy and slow it down step by step - versus the shock of going from 96m/s to 8m/s in one single second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking that refuelling vessel to your landed ship will be a big challenge, agree (quicksaving at a certain point will help a lot), but I am sure you will find a way to master that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Progressm","CreatedById":80659,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-06T10:50:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile refuelling with the claw could make sense, how about carrying a couple of SRB\u0027s with claws and probe bodies next to the stranded craft with a rover, attach them to each side with claws and fire up both...voila, your craft is on a high Munar suborbital trajectory and you can do a Scott manley scoop rescue to get the craft to a safe orbit and home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClearly this is the simplest way to go about it all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-06T11:16:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, docking a skycrane to the top of a landed vessel is awkward but it is possible.
