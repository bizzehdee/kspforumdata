A good thread for finding them is \u003Ca href=\u0022forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/445-The-Drawing-Board-A-library-of-tutorials-and-other-useful-information\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eforum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/445-The-Drawing-Board-A-library-of-tutorials-and-other-useful-information\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are, especially, a lot of tutorials and other threads on docking as it is - like in real life - about the most difficult of manouevres. Broadly, it falls into two phases: 1) rendezvous by matching orbits, 2) actually moving slowly closer and aligning docking-ports to dock. Both these are well-covered here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no way to stage the landing legs but they are automatically added to the \u0027Gear\u0027 action group when you place them on your ship. Action groups use keyboard buttons to activate items - G for gear (not neccessarily capital). The wiki page on keybindings may help (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Key_bindings\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Key_bindings\u003C/a\u003E) but you\u0027ll get used to them quickly: stage=space (not much use), brakes=B, gear=G, lights=U, RCS=R, SAS=T, abort=backspace, Custom01 - Custom00=1 - 0. You can set any and all of these in the VAB/SPH by clicking the middle button at the top-left of the build screen. Click an action group to edit it, click a part to select it (other similar parts added to symmetry also selected too), choose the available action in the list shown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile there are landing tutorials the \u0027simple\u0027 - not most efficient - way to practice is to turn your vehicle retrograde and burn the engines to make your orbit-line hit the surface (the de-orbit burn). Then keep your nose on the retrograde marker, watch your altitude and vertical speed (indicator next to altimeter), burning to land slower than -10m/s and with almost no horizontal speed - which, like many essential things KSP won\u0027t show you in stock. Anyway, as you initially burn towards the horizon, from de-orbit, you\u0027re initially killing horizontal speed. As you do more of that your vertical speed, falling towards the surface, becomes more significant and the retrograde marker moves towards the vertical. Keep your nose on it all the way, gradually putting more and more thrust into killing vertical rather than horizontal speed. Start all this from a low orbit (7-8km for Mun) and if possible use the IVA (inside) view instead of the normal one - most cockpits include a \u0027radar\u0027 altimeter that shows your true height above the ground instead of above \u0022sea\u0022 level as the main altimeter does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that although it\u0027s harder to GET TO, Minmus is so much easier to LAND ON and TAKE-OFF from, that it is the easier mission overall. Especially using quicksave (F5) and quickload (F9) you can do the transfer to Minmus, get a good low orbit, quicksave ... and then practice to your heart\u0027s content, quickloading if it all goes wrong. Minmus\u0027s gravity is so low it is easy to accidentally start going back up again but don\u0027t worry ^^.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETA: Nearly all available tutorials are written or videos, in-game tutorials are very few and far between and I don\u0027t know of any off-hand.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-08T12:00:42Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2014 12:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Pecan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETutorials not in-game added.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"asb3pe","CreatedById":112330,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T13:29:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScott Manley youtube series entitled \u0022Kerbal Space Program - Tutorial For Beginners\u0022.
