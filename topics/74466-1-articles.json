Notice that \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe landing gear is mounted low, on octaginal struts , for clearance when landing on water. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESupplementing the radial intakes are 4 Ram intakes which left off until high in the atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAircraft like cars are dependant on fuel to move, like the saying about old cars they can pass \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanything on the road but a gas station. However the Hermes isnt dependant on a mother ship to \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Erefuel. The Hermes can self refuel as long as there is a kethane field within its flight range. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith its kethane equipment added, the small kethane detector, standard small drill, small processor, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand 2 small kethan storage tanks the Heremes can refuel itself in a few hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition it mounts a kethan power generator which adds the supplemental power needed to run \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe drill and processor without having to add a ton or more of solar panels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn flight the Hermes is stable and resistive to roll but sensative enought to make water landings when \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eneeded. Take off from the runway is easy and the craft lefts at 60 m/s with lift arround 75 m/s. Flight \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etesting of the Hermes demonstrated it can move at 70 m/s on water, making it as capable as a hover \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecraft over short distances. If there is not enought level ground to pit down on the Hermes carries a \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eparachute landing system however parachute landings on water will damage the aircraft and shoudl \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eonly be attempted in the most dire circumstances. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWater landing do require a gentle touch as the plane is tail heavy and too fast decent will cause \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edamage to the engines and drilling probe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDont have a pilot, not a problem the Hermes carries the state of the art in electronics with hardwired \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbodobodyne OKTO2 linked to the cockpit capable or remote piloting of the craft and with the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eadvance communication gear, the communitron 88-88 and COMMS DTS-M1 ensure solid carrier \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esignals from ground, orbit and interplanetary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERational of design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYea i tried to build it all in one package, took a bit but it can do most of everything i want it too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETook a while to get it working but I spent way too much time trying to build larger complicated planes \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewith little success. Had too many roll over crashes and uncontrolables until i remember an article \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eabout military aircraft. short version the military modded many of thier best designs simple because \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit was easier to work with a stable, reliable aircraft. so that got me thinking i should use a stock craft \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E and simply modify it . \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecs ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Max take off weight is 24.46 t with the kethan tanks and all standard tanks full but i fly it with less \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethan the max fuel load ( 18.62 t take off wieght) to keep the mass down. Note that the center tanks \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efeed the jet engine and the outer tanks feed the LVN 14Kn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Typical fuel load for SSTO 100km orbit arround kerbin is to load the forward center tank FL-t800 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewith 252 fuel and no oxidizer, the rear center jet fuel tank with 90 units of fuel, the outer 2 FL -T400 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etanks half load ( 90/110) and the 2 FL-T200 tanks full (90/110). you burn 3/4 of the center tanks to \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eget to orbit and not much of the outer tanks and easily enough left over to fly to the mun and back \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand make a powered landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you need more space Delta V you can load the forward center tank with oxidizer and fill the outer \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etanks this gives you 4700 Delta v over an HOUR of thrust more than enough to move between the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emoons of Jool . \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHandling is easy, some slight instability issues when between 12, 000 and 25, 000 Meters but x3 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ephysics while climbing is easily done. Turning is slow but not hard but its not a aerobatic flyer stick \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto basic manuvering and you wont have too many problems. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned water landings are difficult you have to desend slowly and be careful of landing at too \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehigh of angle as it will tear off the drill assembly ( if your lucky and the engines if your not). This is \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhy the landing gears are mounted so low, and the radial air intake mounted to the landing gear. One \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eside benefit from them is mounted in reverse the do make intake air but for zero drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Once landed on water takeoff is easy nose up at 50m/s and air born by 70m/s. But for the simplest \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elandings use the chutes. Parachuts landings are the easiest way to land and the chutes are placed in \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eorder to make level landing easier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also wanted a plane that wasnt tied to a mothership so i added the kethan parts to it, the kethan \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egenerator was a nice wieght saving addition, since it would take 3 to 4 Large solar arrays to power \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe processor and the drill and each XL solar array weighs 0.35 t , the Kethan power generator only \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewieghs 0.3 t. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso what ya think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Justin Kerbice","CreatedById":101695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T07:33:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s notepad style text is hard to read \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sealed:\u0022\u003E, but the intakes on landing gears are a great idea !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFireSpitter include dedicated parts for such purpose (I know it\u0027s not stock, but wanting \u0022stock only\u0022 can be ridiculous sometimes especially when using issues/\u0022hidden features\u0022 which could be fixed in a further release).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ILikeRockets","CreatedById":107634,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T13:39:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou probably want to change it from Stock craft to Mod craft, because i see Kethane supplies on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut i like it.
