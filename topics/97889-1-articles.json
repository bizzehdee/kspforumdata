As you get close to the target, click on your navball until it says \u0022target\u0022 (and not \u0022orbit\u0022 or \u0022surface\u0022). Then point your ship to the retrograde marker and burn until your velocity drops to 0.0m/s. You should now be parked in space a fixed distance from your target. Now you can aim at the pink target marker on your navball and slowly burn to get some speed which will allow you to close that distance. Keep this speed very low, just a couple m/s at most -- sometimes it\u0027s easier to control this with RCS using H and N keys instead of your main engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vixr","CreatedById":133940,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T18:06:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E^^^this^^^ make sure you kill it all too...even 1 or 2 meters per second can cause you to go sailing past.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T18:06:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProbably the best way to do it stock is to set up a maneuver node at the point of closest approach. Look at your target relative velocity (click on the speed gauge until it says \u0022Target\u0022), and set up the node for a retrograde burn equal to that amount. You should get a burn time estimate from the maneuver node; start the burn when you\u0027re an equal number of seconds away from the node (unlike a regular burn, where you want to split it 50/50 on either side of the node) and stop when you get pretty close to zero. This will at least get you reasonably close to the closest approach distance you had with the target originally, and travelling at a much slower relative velocity, making the approach part easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Ninja\u0027d, twice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bdito","CreatedById":112760,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T18:33:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe simple solution, install MechJeb and let it do it for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn reality do it like Kelderik said.
