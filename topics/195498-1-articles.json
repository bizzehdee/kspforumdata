In v1.10.2917 when I load the MK2 Lander into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, there is no \u0022Open doors\u0022 command on the right-click context menu (see image link). Looking at the Lander in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and in flight it is obvious the side doors are there, you can see them. Another indication that they are there is the fact you cannot place any other part on them in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E (see image). However as you can see, I was able to place a Mystery Good \u003Cem\u003Einside\u003C/em\u003E the doors, which is what I\u0027d expect if that side compartment was actually usable (the Mystery Good is highlighted green, not red indicating that it is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E clipped inside). If the doors cannot open, how can you access anything placed inside?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe doors were a nice feature on this Lander and I have used them before in 1.6, 1.9. In v1.10 it seems Squad has forgotten to add the \u0022Open doors\u0022 command on its context menu to open them. Am I correct? Or have they just decided to do away with that functionality? If this is the case then why are the doors visible, as opposed to a smooth surface like it was before the doors were added?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://ibb.co/HhmgYx5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDoes the MK2 Lander still have functional side doors?\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fraktal","CreatedById":184990,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-09T19:19:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey didn\u0027t remove the doors, this is a known and confirmed bug in 1.10.
