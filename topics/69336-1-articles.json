It should be static to enable quick and easy selection and while it \u0060should\u0060 be possible to select any craft or port with doubleclicking, in reality it fails very very often.

On a ship over 200m away it is really hard to select a port. If there were a menu for that which also had \u0060switch to\u0060 on it exactly like the implementation in the map then most people would be able to use that system without being taught it. Having [] switch to your target only helps if you can select your target in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding another key would mean many people would not even know the feature existed and that\u0060s not good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0060ve long wanted a list of options when clicking or doubleclicking which has a few actions that could be chosen from. The menus would be intuitive and drill down to your required result so they would be more powerful than the current system meaning quicker or the same speed in most situations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example to switch to a craft in a close bunch and then select a docking port on a craft that is in another close bunch (maybe they just undocked and there are 8 craft in such a close space you cannot select one by doubleclicking)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecurrently you either ][ a lot and hope to see your craft in the 16 craft you have to choose from (although they may be the same craft but with different names) or doubleclick and hope the pixel under your mouse pointer is the craft you want although the chances of this are getting under 15% at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI propose a method of click, select (object) craft from group, select (function) target, select (object) port on craft. Four clicks and you have targeted a particular port on a particular craft inside a group of craft so closely bunched you couldn\u0060t select an individual craft.

Doubleclicking has failed to be functional or discerning enough. It also makes no sense to have many methods, there should be a single method that can be applied to all scenes (map, flight etc) and all distances (250m,2.5km, everything else) which would be intuitive, powerful, and fast.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt Snuggler","CreatedById":65092,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T10:37:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeems like a pretty simple and reasonable request (suggestion) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecant understand why anyone would be against this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
