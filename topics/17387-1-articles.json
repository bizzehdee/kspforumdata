I recently bought the full version of KSP after playing the demo for quite some time. I installed a good bit of mods and know I want them all gone. I still have the files and I will put back the few I want, but is there a way to delete the mods without deleting the stock stuff in the parts section? Yes, I should have put them in a seperate file inside the parts, but I didn\u0027t think about it or know if that would work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E While in the discussion of mods, any recomendations? I\u0027m going to keep KW Rocketry but anything else in mind?

I created a separate folder called \u002701stock\u0027 which contains a copy of all the stock parts and then install this as a mod with the Mod Manager software. If I want to go back to a clean install I just delete everything from the parts and plugins folders and re-install the stock \u0027mod\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I find Kerbal crashes frequently if I have too many parts, so I created a \u002702favourites\u0027 mod which contains only the parts and plugins I commonly use from various mods. By cherry-picking I can keep the total number of parts under 150, and also be sure that any ship I save will always load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I always rename the parts from each mod to include a three letter identity at the start of the folder names (a few mods do this already), so they are all listed together in the parts folder. Helps with house-keeping. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd extra mods to try them out, and if you really like a part then move it to your \u0027favourites\u0027 mod (move rather than copy, to avoid conflicts). If it gets in a mess just delete everything from parts and plugins, and re-install these two \u0027mods\u0027 to return to a known baseline.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NuclearWarfare","CreatedById":42325,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-21T20:00:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t worry guys it was a clean copy of the game to begin with, I deleted the demo and installed the full game \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, thanks a lot guys, I\u0027ll go fix it and get back to exploring!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
