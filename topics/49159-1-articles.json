After a lot of playing KSP I did my first Mun-landing after a 2h session in Voice-Chat with one of my best friends, who was like Mission Control and me as the Flight Captain. It was a great feeling to land on another planet. And I am excited what comes next.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut my intention of this suggestion is: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWouldn\u0027t it be great to implement some sort of asteroid belt or periodicly appearing comets? For Science! And for extra thrill for getting into the outer rings of the kerbal solar system!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI once saw a Scott Manley Video where he implemented something like this as a model. If it would be implemented, the system also gets more \u0022realistic\u0022 (depends on the existence of asteroid belts in other solar systems out in the galaxy. Maybe our Jupiter produced this as a rare result).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"digitalsingularity","CreatedById":79683,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T17:59:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow that I\u0027ve been playing 0.22, this seems like it\u0027d be especially awesome to get tons of science points for exploring comets that are passing into range.
