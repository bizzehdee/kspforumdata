(acording to the wiki, please correct me when wrong)\n\nso if you fly by, then orbit, then land, then plant a flag. all you get is the XP for the flag.\n\nis there a mod or a MM config that i can use to get ALL the xp instead of just the highest one? (you would think pulling that stuff off, even as a nooblet kerbal would give you a truck ton of experience, right?)\n\nsorry if this in the wrong forum, please move it if required.\n\nhope someone can help me!\n\nfriendly greeting,\n\nThahat,![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"}]}
