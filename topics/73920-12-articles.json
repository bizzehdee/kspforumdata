I have had multiple (4\u002B tanks) fail within a few minutes, with spacecraft only 15 minutes old. other parts failure rate is a bit more rare (once a week, or even longer). it got a bit ridiculous, with nearly guaranteed tank leakage making unmanned probes useless. (an automatic miner could not operate independently for more then a week). while this is realistic, there is of course no way to design a better tank. as a feature request, I wonder if it would be possible to allow the failure rate (the check made during clock ticks, I am assuming it\u0027s a variable or %) to be something we can mess with in the config. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eof course i could simply be unlucky, and this could have been chance, but without knowing the chance of failure on a new part per check, i can\u0027t be certain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif i wasn\u0027t building extensive infrastructure and STS it might not hurt as much, so the ability to make tank leakage rare would be a playstyle change for myself (and others who run massive 30\u002B active vessel auto/manned programs) versus an actual criticism on the failure rate itself, which as I said is actually rather realistic right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanother possibility.. maybe a different kind of tank failure? catastrophic versus slow leak? i know the reason we have yet to build orbital propellant depots is the loss of fuel due to evaporation and heating. a slow leak could be more common, and result in a single or multiple instance of 1 or 2% fuel loss, not crippling but definitely noticeable, versus an actual puncture (micro-meteoroid, bad design) that would be very rare.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
