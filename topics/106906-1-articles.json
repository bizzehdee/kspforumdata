So I guess this is a request for one more thing to be added to the To-Do List ... please update the [Wiki](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Main_Page). ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"LostOblivion","CreatedById":111504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T16:48:37Z","Content":"That\u0027s up to us.

I know KSP has been under development, but it is after all *out of beta now*.
