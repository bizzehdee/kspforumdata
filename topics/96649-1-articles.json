Flying airplanes in stock KSP is truly weird, but \u0027souposphere\u0027 is only half the concern. The erroneous jet engine/inlet model ruins the game no less, yet not talked about as much as the aerodynamics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInitially, all engines in KSP were rockets, they have a max thrust and a curve of altitude vs Isp, a simple model that works fine. And later on, jet engines are added as derivation of rockets, on top of the Isp curve, a speed vs thrust curve is added. Jet engines also requires another resource named IntakeAir, that is created by inlets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis model is totally wrong and leads to terrible mistakes in two aspects. First, thrust is dependent not only on speed, but also on altitude (roughly proportional to static air pressure). Also, Isp should be dependent on speed besides altitude. Second, when we talk about Isp (usually 2000-4000s range for jet engines) we are referring to the consumption of fuel, not including the air going through the engine. However, in KSP the IntakeAir is also counted as a fuel. Take the \u0027basic jet\u0027 part for example, the actual Isp is 15x higher than what the game says.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlayers are heavily misled by these problems. Because thrust doesn\u0027t decrease with altitude, basically any design can reach high speed and altitude with enough wings and controls. As long as there\u0027s enough IntakeAir, the engines can push the aircraft all the same, and when IntakeAir runs out, they \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Esuddenly\u003C/span\u003E flame out. The unusually high Isp makes a player never care about the fuel. The result is clear: it encourages engine spamming and inlet spamming, that\u0027s why you see them so much. It also makes hypersonic flight a trivial task, which it really shouldn\u0027t be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy nobody cares then? Maybe I need a PR campaign? I think the reason lies in how things are balanced: people would just make a plane and say \u0027hey it flies\u0027 or \u0027hey it SSTOs\u0027 and be done with it. Hopefully applying mistakes on top of other mistakes (aka souposhpere) makes things right? I don\u0027t think so. Bugs are bugs not features and they should be fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that they are finally redoing the aerodynamics, maybe it\u0027s time to review the jet engines as well.
