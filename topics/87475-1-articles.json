You are also allowed to use rocket thrust, but it will reduce your score the more you use (beyond a certain point), so be sparing with those engines!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESetup:\u003C/strong\u003E It is accepted Kerbal folklore that once you can get to Eve\u0027s SOI, you can get yourself pretty much anywhere using mainly gravity assists. So our challenge begins with you in Kerbol (solar) orbit, on your way inbound to Eve\u0027s Sphere of Influence. Set your delta-V counter to zero before you arrive at Eve. Eve\u0027s SOI will be your jumping-off point. Once you enter Eve\u0027s SOI, every meter per second of delta-V must be carefully conserved!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScoring:\u003C/strong\u003E You get 20 points for each unique celestial Sphere of Influence you can reach. A second visit to the same SOI (after going elsewhere) is awarded 10 points, and a third visit gets 5 points. No additional points for 4th and subsequent visits to the same SOI. Your total score is the sum of all your points, \u003Cem\u003Edivided by the total delta-v used on your mission\u003C/em\u003E. BUT, if you use less than 100 total delta-V, you still divide by 100... in other words, everyone is encouraged to use at least 100 m/s delta-V. (This is to prevent scores from blowing up due to a vanishing denominator, and also to incentivize creative and elaborate multi-planet trajectory design by awarding everyone some \u0022free\u0022 delta-V.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if you visit four unique SOIs (80 points) and burn 160 m/s delta-V doing it, your score is 80/160 = 0.5. If you visit two SOIs (40 points) and burn no delta-V, your score is 40/100 = 0.4, since the delta-V floor is defined by the rules to be 100 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERules:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Stock solar system. No modding the celestial bodies or adding more of them. This goes for orbital alignments and conjunctions as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. No mods, cheats, or exploits that give you \u0022free\u0022 delta-V. Modded parts are fine as long as they allow correct computation of actual delta-V used. Hyperedit is OK to get your craft into position (as long as it\u0027s something that could have reasonably been achieved naturally), but not OK after your run starts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Use something to display your delta-V (such as Kerbal Engineer), and sufficiently document your voyage with screen caps that show where you\u0027ve gone and how much delta-V you used to get there. Also be sure to get screen grabs of your cool elaborate gravity assist trajectories!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. You don\u0027t have to land on the celestial bodies, just pass through their SOI\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Aerobraking is allowed and encouraged!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Kerbol (sun) does not count as a SOI for scoring purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. You can have whatever speed and trajectory you\u0027d like before you start your run by entering Eve\u0027s SOI, and it doesn\u0027t count against your Delta-V budget. So plan your entry trajectory appropriately!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Exiting an SOI into a parent SOI doesn\u0027t count as a new SOI visit. So for example, exiting the Mun\u0027s SOI back into Kerbin\u0027s SOI doesn\u0027t add more points to your score for visiting Kerbin again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. \u0022The mercy rule\u0022 as suggested by PLAD: time limit of 20 years once you start your mission (although you can choose whatever starting date you want). This is to avoid situations where people just wait in orbit endlessly for something interesting to happen. If you have some really cool trajectory that takes a little longer than 20 Y to complete, let me know and I might make an exception.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBonus Points (added to your raw point score before dividing by delta-V):\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Two bonus points for each (detachable) lander you land on each celestial body, limit one per body. Once the probes separate from your main craft, their delta-v\u0027s don\u0027t count against your score. \u003Cem\u003EIf you do this, make sure to note your delta-v before and after you separate your lander from your main craft, as the separation event might throw off your delta-V counter.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. 30 bonus points if you end with a safe landing on Kerbin. Thus, if you make Kerbin your final planet and you land safely there, you\u0027d get 50 points instead of 20 for the Kerbin leg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax possible score (if I\u0027ve done my math right) is 6.2 if you hit all the SOIs three times, land a probe on each one except Jool, and finish with a safe Kerbin landing, all with 100 m/s or less of delta-V spent. I very much doubt that\u0027s possible. But in case of a tie, lowest actual delta-V wins!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStandings:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
