I then go towards to Duna, on an 400km orbit. I realize i\u0027m out of fuel. I decide take up a vessel that is already landed at Duna, to refuel the Space Shuttle. So I rendezvous and dock with the Space Shuttle. I was a bit worried the ports wouldn\u0027t fit since the Shuttle has a slightly larger one, altough it worked. So I was bored and asked myself, what am I gonna do now? I just say YOLO(Sorry XD) in the Kerbal Feed Chat, I\u0027ve decided to land with the space shuttle, upwards. So I decent fast down to the ground and burn very quickly. I realized I was going a bit horizontal, and I was loosing control, I was like well, OK, I failed. But then, I manage to slam to the ground at a velocity at 14.3 m/s. It was just about to fall to the side until I turned on the RCS and managed to get it on its feet. I\u0027m very proud of this, I know many people will be like \u0022noob\u0022. I\u0027m new to this game, BTW.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FkynjqX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FkynjqX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oWwfAdo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022oWwfAdo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what are your epic missions and landings?
