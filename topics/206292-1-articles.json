There are 500 parts not currently in use that you could eliminate from the scene by recovering the vessel, but you\u0027re like me and love keeping vessels in service until they are unusable rather than mission-by-mission gameplay. You\u0027re left with a neat slideshow of all your creations.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow consider Distant Vessel Rendering from Distant Object Enhancement. It will give a visual, physicsless version of your target (or all visible crafts). What if you could apply that same \u0027mask\u0027 and toggle a vessel \u0027off\u0027 essentially unloading it from the scene but for the visual physicsless version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m only a veteran mod \u003Cem\u003Euser\u003C/em\u003E so I\u0027m curious. Is there a way to create a mod that does this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
