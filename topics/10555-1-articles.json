One is a direct descent; as soon as you enter Munar SOI you head for the surface. The other option is to slide into orbit after entering Munar SOI and then perform a de-orbit burn. Apparently the direct descent is the most fuel efficient (though not by much) but it\\\u0027s much harder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI usually use MechJeb these days for my landings (getting a bit lazy I know). What I used to do though is get in a low orbit around Mun, say 15-20km. I\\\u0027d then make a nice burn de-orbit burn so that my downrange distance to landing (or impact) would be about the same as my altitude (10-20km). Kind of like a right angled triangle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen once I\\\u0027d descended below about 5-8km (or if my velocity exceeded 300m/s for a measure of control) I\\\u0027d make a steady burn with the intention of reducing my velocity to near zero at zero altitude (obviously it\\\u0027s not that easy manually so make adjustments as you go). Remember to keep your ship pointed towards \u003Cem\u003Eretrograde\u003C/em\u003E so as to help cancel both horizontal and vertical velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMain thing I\\\u0027d say is to keep your ship stable and orientated with your horizontal velocity vector so your controls actually match up with what happens on screen and don\\\u0027t let your velocity get out of control.

If your rocket is under-powered, a shallow angle should help reduce gravity drag while the airspeed tends to stay below terminal velocity anyway. An over-powered rocket should use a steep angle, to get clear of the atmosphere early, so as to put that extra thrust to work asap. This is probably not important enough for an introductory lesson, but worth discussing here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"closette","CreatedById":11773,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-17T20:04:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike a purely vertical ascent (known as the \u0027Goddard problem\u0027), finding the most efficient ascent-to-orbit profile is a difficult optimal control problem and unique to each design, although there is a Challenge now on the forums to get to 100km orbit with the least delta-v, and some players are doing better than MechJeb I believe (yay humans!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout much to back it up, I tend to start my gravity turn when the craft can no longer \u0027keep up\u0027 with the optimal terminal speed for vertical ascent.
