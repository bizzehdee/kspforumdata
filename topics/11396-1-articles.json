UPDATE COMING\n\nI would like to suggest some tips and tricks for packing your project up into an archive file to be used as a standardized template.\n\nArchive Filename: The file for download should include your project name and version number. The reason for this is so people can organize their downloads and quickly see if they have downloaded the current version.\n\nExample: MechJeb 1.8.3.zip, NovaPunch 2.1.7z, DamnedAerospace 1.1.rar\n\nFile \u0026 Folder Structure: Since most people will extract your project to a folder that contains other projects, the first thing inside your archive should be a folder with the same name as the archive, i.e. the project name and version number. Inside that folder should be your readme.txt and the folders for Parts, Plugins, etc.\n\nExample:\n\nMechJeb 1.8.3.zip\n\n-\u003Ereadme.txt (optional)\n\n-\u003E\\Parts\\[partname]\\[files]\n\n-\u003E\\Ships\\VAB\\[files] (optional)\n\n-\u003E\\Ships\\SPH\\[files] (optional)\n\n-\u003E\\Plugins\\[files]\n\n-\u003E\\PluginData\\[files] (optional)\n\n-\u003E\\Source\\MechJeb 1.8.3\\[files] (optional)\n\n-\u003E\\[other folders]\\[misc files] (optional)\n\nThis format will insure that no files are overwritten by accident (except the readme, tho GME handles it). If you are using Generic Mod Enabler, it will properly rename the readme by adding the project name to the filename. All other files will give a warning about being over written.\n\nCheers!\n\nCapt\u0027n Skunky\n\nKSP Community Manager\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-06T16:03:24Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2013 04:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Capt\u0027n Skunky**\n  \nImport errors fixed"}]}
