So now I am running my laptop on AC power with unplugged battery until I can find a replacement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E But for some reason, sometimes the laptop just flat out power off on its own (no set time, sometimes 30 seconds after power on, sometimes a few minutes), and refuse to turn back on, which require me to unplug it from AC power, hold power button for a bit to use up residual charge, then plug it back in, at which point it automatically power back up ( note I did not press the power button again, it just power back up right when I plug it back to AC power). It will then run for a bit and then power itself off again, and the cycle begins a few more times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes I luck out and it works fine, even for a week or two, and I can just shut down through window and using the laptop normally. But occasionally, especially after power blackout (which happen around here sometimes) the cycle begins again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, sometimes it will power up by itself if it suddenly power off earlier. Kind of like it is throwing a tantrum being used without a battery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone knows if this is normal or not? Is there a way to make sure it stays powered on reliably instead of me going through cycles and hope it sticks?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-02T05:18:40Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2015 05:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RainDreamer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T15:21:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have not mucked about with a laptop in a long time, so this may be out of date: IME, many laptops use(ed) the battery as a kind of power filter / buffer, as such some machines will not power up at all without some battery (even a dead-ish one) installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is the case with yours, weird things may happen without a battery, and if you have particularly unreliable mains you could even do damage to the machine.
