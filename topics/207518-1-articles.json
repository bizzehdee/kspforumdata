experiments have had their share of failures. the whole biosphere 2 experiment i think was far too ambitious. it was a bad experiment because what it tried to do was far too broad. the whole thing was plagued by unforseen consequences, concrete eating up all the oxygen as it cured, bug infestations, and a low biodiversity ecosystem prone to various cascade failures. the goal for long term life support is not to maintain an engineered ecosystem but to keep the crew alive for an extended period of time.\u00A0all you really need to do is scrub co2, provide oxygen, heat, water, food and recycle waste materials. the ultimate life support experiment is actually the iss, which has thus far been successful. we probibly need to get our consumable consumption rates down low enough before we do an interstellar colony mission, try to maximize our recycling and really start developing space agriculture

ground centrifuge on low grav worlds would be optimal for a colony. all you need is a tbm and several kilometers of maglev track (or even conventional rail would do). the colony would exist on a bunch of train cars, more or less, though somewhat bigger. the track would be angled such that the centrifugal force adds to the gravitational force to a magnitude of 1g. perhaps the hab modules would be on trunions. its probibly better to pressurize the tube than the cars themselves, though the cars could provide secondary atmospheric containment in an emergency. a smaller spindown rail could be used to enter/exit the hab, as some people will need to venture into the tubes for maintenance and can provide emergency gravity in the case you need to spin down the main ring. aside from the investment in casement for the tunnel and the track itself, the hab cars need not all be installed immediately with the installation, you can add cars as your population grows until the full ring is used. beyond that build another ring concentric to the first one, with the spindown rail acting as an interchange between the rings. being underground provides ample radiation protection. this would probibly be of better use just outside the habitable zone so you can groundsink the surplus heat. you would still be fairly dependant on some external nuclear power of some sort. insulating the tunnels would be critical i think as the warming from the interior environment could cause them to shift. the trans alaska pipeline has a problem with the hot oil melting the permafrost and you need a combination of ground sinking the surplus heat over a wider area and flexible pylons that can handle expansion. you would have something similar especially if you set up shop on an ice
