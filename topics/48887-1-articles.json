This way the experiment doesn\u0027t have to be returned or transmitted. This data can be stored at a reduced level of science points but still be more than transmitting. I also think that the amount of data that can be stored should be limited based on capsule size. The data can also be transferred from one craft to another making Apollo style landers the ability to return science data from the surface. It will also give stations functionality with data being returned in high quantities. I would much rather land a small crew pod than a large science ship. It just seems more realistic and adds more possibilities.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
