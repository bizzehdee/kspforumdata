They\u0027re quite interesting. They have seen most use in the Soviet Union/Russia, but as the new Falcon announcement shows they\u0027re being looked into by others as well. What do they do? They\u0027re control surfaces but they\u0027re foldable (which is hard to do with normal fins). As such they\u0027ve seen/are seeing use as stabilizing surfaces on Launch Escape Systems or rocket stages and control surfaces for landing steering. Having a foldable fin would (especially with aerodynamic improvements) be an interesting addition to game\u0027s control surfaces.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B3EsTeDIUAAO86M.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022B3EsTeDIUAAO86M.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGrid fins for helping to steer the Falcon 9R\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.nearinc.com/images/GridFin1_medium.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GridFin1_medium.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProposal for grid fin stabilization on the Orion spacecraft\u0027s Launch Escape System (LES)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Jsc2005e15407.jpg/800px-Jsc2005e15407.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022800px-Jsc2005e15407.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGrid fins on the Soyuz\u0027s LES\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"X10Z","CreatedById":105923,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-23T16:25:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe there are a few mods that do this, but I don\u0027t remember which ones.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-24T08:28:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might do that with airbreaks from b9. I think there is also a spoiler function that activates control surfaces. I never used the latter so I have no idea if they work that way. Anyway, I would definetly like to see airbreaks in the stock game. If there would be a tweakable included that lets you adjust the breaking power or let you use ist as a control surface you are pretty close to what you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebtw: you just gave me the idea to modify my probes to remain orientated correctly during airobreaks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E I want to use the same heatshield for the aerobreaking of the probe and the decent of the included lander. It\u0027s harder than it appeared first due to the CoG/CoL of the whole thing (with FAR and DRE that\u0027s a thing).
