I wasn\u0027t happy with my current school since when I joined it 6 years back and went to 3rd grade(the moment I was born we went to live in the Ukraine, then we returned back to Latvia). My native language is Russian, but i am Latvian, and basically y current school was the only one that agreed to accept me under one condition:I had to learn Latvian from scratch in 3 months time. And so I did, and I got the best grade \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway my current school is Russian speaking(Latvia is divided between the Russian camp and the Latvian camp), but despite that some subjects are forced to be in Latvian. The number one school in the country is fully Latvian, but what attracted me is that if i join the IB program, I get to study in English for the last 2 years of high school(3 years of high school in Latvia). However, there is that year of full Latvian.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I started prepping for the entrance exam that just had to happen on my mother\u0027s birthday \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_sleep.png\u0022 alt=\u0022-_-\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was the most stressful year of my life, and KSP was the only thing keeping me sane.
