He said to build a rocket the way he did, and I did, with some small personal modifications. He said to maintain 200-300 m/s until 12000m-ish and then turn to about 45 degrees in the east direction. I did that, but when i tried to turn, i lost control of the craft very easily. Is this normal?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry I don\u0027t currently have pics for visual reference, i\u0027m not sure how to screenshot.

As Sal says, the best way now is to tip over a bit just after launch and then follow the yellow marker as it heads to the horizon with the goal of being horizontal around 40-50km high (ideally when your Ap is around 55km)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe good news is that a craft built for the old air will easily get to orbit as it needs less Dv to do so now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
