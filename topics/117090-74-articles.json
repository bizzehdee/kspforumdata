It\u0027s just fun to launch rockets when you can make clean separations with the new decoupler and match different stages with the fairings. Really love building rockets that resemble the real thing, or at least look like something that would have been built in the real world. I\u0027m a big scifi fan so I love my Near Future ships as well, but combining real-world and sci-fi is why I still enjoy playing this game. I could not imagine building stuff like I do without your mod. I think Squad could take an example from you and implement some modular tanks in 1.1, I have no clue why this was not included to begin with. Next to tweakscale and SSTU, there are no mods that I can think of that have sizeable tanks (maybe Proc Parts).\n\nRe the SRBs:  The nose cones look fine to me, they tend to be just plain white in the real world, so not much to work with. As for the nozzles it\u0027s hard to say, the plain nozzle from the Delta and Atlas are not detailed IRL, so I think not much can be done there, and when the textures are added to the Shuttle/Ariane nozzles, I think they will be quite detailed already."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-08T20:06:17Z","Content":"Re: Nosecones -- I agree, they generally tend to be very plain affairs.\n\nHowever, I\u0027ve noticed that due to texture-space/texture-use I need to make a couple more, at least one, in order to fill out the texture sheet for them.

Wasted texture-space is mostly a RAM and VRAM concern, though hopefully both of those concerns will be minimized with 1.1 (VRAM only if they implemented dynamic asset loading, RAM still dependant on system configuration).\n\nSadly I cannot think of a way to share texture space with these models as they will all have the jettison motor stuff done as part of the texture/normal map, and will mostly need unique positioning of those details on a per-model basis.  Will do some experiments though, it might be possible to fudge them a bit to make it work.  If ever it were going to, these would be the models to try it on, as they do not have any AO bake to speak of.  If that works out, these could potentially all be mapped onto a single 512x, which would be great from a memory-use perspective.\n\nHmm... you know... I might be able to clean this up a bit to use a single 512x if I... cheat... a bit regarding the thrust transform locations;  I could easily add a 0.25m or so straight section to the bottom of each nosecone where the thrust transforms are located; this geometry could be consistent across all of the nosecones.  This could also simplify the plugin-side of things if I know I have a consistent thrust transform setup/location for the nosecones.  Hmm... will give this a bit of thought and testing as it seems like it might be the best all-around compromise for texture-space/density/memory use.\n\nRe: existing nosecones -- the SRBs will have access to all of the MFT nosecones (and vice-versa), although the existing nosecones will not have the nosecone jettison motor port textures unless I rework them a bit.

Would enable easy texture-sharing for the nosecones, enable easy use of the existing MFT nosecones, and allow for consistency on the location and orientation of the thrust transforms/texture details for both the nosecones and nozzles.  Could potentially even add a bit of geometry for them to the skirts if deemed necessary; I have a bit of wiggle room on that texture still.\n\nThis wouldn\u0027t be 100% technically accurate as far as positioning and function goes, but seems like a good compromise for most of the gameplay and efficiency concerns -- they would be functional, aesthetically consistent, and quite appropriate for a \u0027generic\u0027 implementation.\n\nHmm.. and more hmm...\n\nAnyone have any strong arguments or feelings -against- moving forwards with this method (jettison transforms/details as part of the top/bottom skirt segments on the SRB\u0027s themselves?)   \n\nSo far it is seeming like it will solve... many... implementation problems and go a long way towards letting me do the auto-jettison end of things in the future.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-08T21:31:37Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2016 09:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"ComatoseJedi","CreatedById":91567,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-08T21:51:45Z","Content":"[@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) In my honest opinion, an srb is an srb.

May or may not keep the black stripe at the bottom, mostly was using it to test for consistency and proper alignment of the bottom portion of the UV\u0027s. \n\nThese are all unwrapped onto a single shared 512x texture.  This will allow them to match the texture density of the existing tanks and nosecones;  this will mostly be important if I include orange-foam type textures for them, where it will allow the foam grain to be of approximately the same size.  Could also add new nosecones using this texture / set of textures in the future with minimal impact to existing parts, and even minimal time spent on modeling/unwrapping (...if all parts were this easy to do, I wouldn\u0027t mind modeling nearly as much).\n\n![tGeXUF2.png](http://i.imgur.com/tGeXUF2.png)\n\nWill also be doing a simple flat black / dark gray texture for them (and the bodies, and nozzles...).  Will look into doing other colors/textures as things progress.\n\nNote however, that due to them sharing textures and being unwrapped organically (curved/mirrored, rather than seamed and aligned), there is no way to add any form of actual detail;  these nose-cones will -not- have any kind of stripe or checker pattern to them, and will be limited to flat-color textures only (aside from the lower lip on them, which is unwrapped in an aligned/squared manner).\n\nWill be working on exporting these through Unity and getting them in-game tonight with their textures, and adding texture-set-swapping support to the MSRB module.  I guess either bodies or nozzles will be the focus for tomorrow (or even later tonight depending on how smooth things go)."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-08T23:57:48Z","Content":"I wouldn\u0027t even mind the jettison nozzles not being visible in the textures.
