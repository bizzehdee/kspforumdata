I, too, have discovered the horrendous bugginess of Pol. There seems to be great disagrement between the visible mesh and the collider, worse in some places than others. Like you, I\u0027ve had the most problems in the area around the southern rim of Nelemy Crater, only in my games I call that The Mountains of Madness (from HP Lovecraft). Back when I used Kethane, if there was any near the equator it was usually in that area. But most attempts to land drilling rigs on it ended in explosions while still about 1400-1500m above the visible surface. Bringing up F3 to see what had happened always showed the ship had \u0022collided with Pol\u0022. And as you\u0027ve noticed, if you get under this invisible roof, things below it will get teleported back on top of it when you\u0027re not looking. Fortunately, these deadly areas seem to be 1-way affairs. You can fly up through them no problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this reason (and its general appearance), I consider Pol itself to be the unholy spawn of the Daemon Sultan Azathoth. Which kinda goes with the unholy spawn of Cthulhu being next door on Bop. There is much ancient evil lurking in the outer fringes of the Jool system so these days I rarely land anything there except sacrificial victims to appease the Elder Gods, when the stars are aligned and the dark rites howled through in their season \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFWIW, misplaced colliders seem pretty common on small, very lumpy moons.

You can see in the trench we dug here.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022Probably there were more volatile ices mixed in with the water ice, and those have already evaporated away. What about the spires?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022They are also ice, but denser solid ice.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022Hmm. The spires could have been cryovolcanic inclusions. As the more porus surface ice sublimated away, the ice in the spires was uncovered. It\u0027s just sublimating away more slowly...the top parts are narrower because they have been exposed longer.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UduTtxm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UduTtxm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Has there been enough time for this much surface ice to have sublimated away?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022Could be...depends on the age of Pol, and the luminosity history of Kerbol. Some scientists even speculate that Pol may have been in an eccentric orbit around Kerbol before being captured by Jool, in which case it could have spent time closer to Kerbol or it could be from deeper in space...or both. Have you sampled the highest and lowest points on the moon yet?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022No, but those are both south of here. I can drive you there if you wish.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Thompbles, the most experienced Pol driver, took Hellou south to sample the extreme elevations of the moon. Emilynn stayed behind with Kurt, who taught her the techniques of driving on Pol (which she learned quickly, because they were similar to driving on Bop...only at even lower gravity).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3m5TyoM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223m5TyoM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDriving southeast across Siebold Planitia was easy, with its rolling terrain.

The surface in that area was considerably darker than the normal surface coloring of Pol. Thompbles named the place Walker Depression after Walker Kerman, the first kerbal test pilot to fly the K-15 suborbital rocket plane out of Kermin\u0027s atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pbqAaoi.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pbqAaoi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is the Map view showing the first leg of Thompbles and Hellou\u0027s drive.

The high overview shows the rover\u0027s path from Walker Depression (and then, in a different color, where they went next).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gH2xnk3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gH2xnk3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oOgSJcw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oOgSJcw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles hung mostly to the inner wall of the north rim of Armstrong Crater when crossing toward the tall peak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9swIsED.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229swIsED.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow: When climbing the side of the tall mountain, they came across one of the somewhat rare round boulders that can be found on Pol. Hellou had Thompbles stop for samples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bHGp3XI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bHGp3XI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe high point had several close-together ridges. Often, the other ridges looked to be higher...but when they drove over to check, they turned out not to be. The highest point they could find was 4,883 meters, which Thompbles named Armstrong Peak. Hellou planted the flag and sampled the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NqZebJz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NqZebJz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ze4pIKd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ze4pIKd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter exploring Armstrong Peak, Thompbles and Hellou headed north, back toward base camp. Because of the overlapping double-crater terrain, this involved going down a steep slope, traversing a narrow flat area (below), and then driving up the even steeper north rim of Armstrong Crater.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oytEQDz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oytEQDz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow: The leap over the north rim...followed by a very steep descent on the other side. It got a bit hairy, but Thompbles managed it OK (if things got too steep, there was always the option of firing the rocket engines and hopping out to the flatter plains...but this wasn\u0027t necessary).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/f9i1LHa.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022f9i1LHa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/f0lc1Kp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022f0lc1Kp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen our intrepid explorers left the southern mountains behind them and headed mostly north toward Pol Base at Area 0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0ACz3St.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220ACz3St.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, Thompbles and Hellou return to base camp. The four kerbals spent several more weeks exploring Pol. When Hellou wasn\u0027t having somebody drive her around to collect samples, Kurt and Emilynn were doing rover races ...er...I mean they were gathering additional data about rover behavior on low gravity airless surfaces. And the videos they made were quite popular back on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BbJuwKi.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022BbJuwKi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s it for this episode...except to mention that Aldner and Nelemy were entertaining themselves up in Pol orbit, getting the Grey Haven Express ready for its return trip to Kerbin.
