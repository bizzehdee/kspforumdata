This is due to floating point issues, if two parts of your ship were moving slightly differently, and then you applied the appropriate physics formulas over a 10 minute period, the small difference could become a massive change and would break everything. This is why at 4x warp ships become very wobbly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a couple options available to those who want to be able to push past this boundary.

It can work in the atmosphere however, and you can control your ship or set up an autopilot to control your ship, but you won\u0027t be able to get the same kind of speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
