It will overshoot slightly but under normal circumstances it will overshoot in a decaying fashion (ie. less each time). SAS instabilities are also contributed to by a flexing rocket because it uses the command pod facing to determine it\u0027s reaction (and that\u0027s typically one of the parts with the greatest amplitude of flex)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue is one of sensitivity and the fact that stock SAS has a fixed setup. Adding a reaction delay to gimbals reduces their apparent sensitivity and alters the torque/MOI ratio that SAS can cope well with (slower = greater levels of torque required for the same effect). If you try the fix with one of the alternate SAS modes (eg. hold prograde) which just happens to be ~4x more aggressive than the stability assistance mode, you\u0027ll probably find that it works perfectly (whereas in stock it tends to be far too twitchy). This problem will continue to exist until someone decides that a constant sensitivity is wrong and writes something that changes with available torque and current MOI (or just copies it out of MJ \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T02:26:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 02:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Crzyrndm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tontow","CreatedById":64552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T02:30:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E just copies it out of MJ\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Yes, that^.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have never had MechJeb over shoot in space and very rarely will it wobble in atmosphere flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny chance of that happening?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T04:12:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spartwo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spartwo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWobbly wheels, you fixed wobbly wheels!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes indeed.
