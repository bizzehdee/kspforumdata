Sad things and glad things. You got what I\u0027m saying, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, It was a program that made a really (I\u0027m saying REALLY) big rocket that goes to Duna. Usually it\u0027s capsules carries the MK-1-3 or whatever it is, and I even got a bunch of kerbals over there (No screenshots due to the screenshot button is broke)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So the last mission (The second to last) was with Jebediah, a kerbal named Billy Something (can\u0027t remember) and Zach (Yeah.
