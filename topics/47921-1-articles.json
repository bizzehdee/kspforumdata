(for me at least)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe goal is to make an accurate, nearly pinpoint landing on a NON-ATMOSPHERIC celestial body. We\u0027ll use Minmus for this example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep one: Acheive an orbit around your desired body. This is self explanatory, and will not be covered in this tutorial. If you need help with this, check out some of the other great tutorials here!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep two: Lower your Periapsis as low as you can go while still maintaining a stable orbit. On Minmus, be wary of the high hills and mountains. While in orbit, wait for your landing zone to be under your periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep three: When your Ship and Landing zone are alligned correctly, kill all forward velocity and orient the front of your landing craft away from the planet or \u0027right side up\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep four: Control your vertical velocity as you descend and land as you normally would in any other scenario, except you\u0027re moving straight down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep Five: You should be incredibly close to your desired landing point, enjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-10T14:20:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStep three will be quite a challenge if your lateral velocity is high and thrust is low.
