I thought \u0022Oh kewlies I gotta use this somehow\u0022 and thus put some batteries, RCS fuel and stuff in it, the works. When I saw there was some extra room I decided \u0022bugger it ill wack some seats in there\u0022 and IT was not until after I landed on the north pole and played around with the new base I saw the possibilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimg.org/image/4avn54031/full/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s6.postimg.org/uvy60o2gh/screenshot102.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot102.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimage.org/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efree upload image\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe service bays could easily be used as little apartments or rooms for kerbals without any wacky mods!

Hooray for RP!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks lovely, just be careful. The service bays are known to be Kraken-bait. Especially if you put anything animated in them so that the moving parts clip through the floor or ceiling, if you hang a probe core from the ceiling, or if the moving doors contant anything while moving. And of course Kerbals doing animations are irresistible forces in their own right, so be careful when they\u0027re getting out of the seats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully, these problems will be fixed eventually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Macdaddy42","CreatedById":145262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T01:27:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks and yeah the kraken did strike my rocket during that launch because the service bay decided to shake and wobble the rocket into destruction. The problem was fixed with good ol\u0027 struts in random places though. Also I launched another craft of the same design but replaced the extra resources and RTGs with table and for some reason kraken approved of the furniture and didn\u0027t harass me.
