If everything is procedural you can basically just go: \u0022need a hlv? herpaderpA i\u0027ll just make a 7.5 meter tank and stick 8 mainsails on the bottom!\u0022. With set part sizes, you actually have to think about the size and structural stability of your rocket. For example, if I have to build a 7.5 meter wide rocket with 8 mainsails on the bottom, maybe I should split they payload up instead or try and make it smaller. If its something like wings and fairings, which are an absolute pain when you just use a set part, it is all right for them to be procedural. Procedural tanks, engines, etc, would make the game too easy.\u003Cp\u003EAnd also, your rant against realism basically mirrored mine: I said that ksp doesn\u0027t have n-body physics, that everything is 1/10th the size, and that our astronauts are little green men.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe facts were the same but the conclusion was oppositional.

The size ratio comes from restrictions in the physics engine, as does the lack of n-body physics. Don\u0060t fool yourself those restrictions are there because of game mechanics.

Tooling specialists soon realized, however, that while plaster model masters had been satisfactory for constructing aircraft, they could not maintain the tolerances required for critical space hardware. So the technique was conceived of fabricating control masters, masters, and assembly tools from like materials, compatible with the end hardware: for example, aluminum masters and aluminum tools for the aluminum hardware and steel masters and steel tools for the steel hardware. Basic tolerances could be integrated into these tools and were not nullified by differential expansion during operations involving the application of heat.
