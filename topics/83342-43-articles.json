The KCT recover to storage feature has a time limit based on distance, but you get the Kerbals and science and all that back immediately. That\u0027s mostly because overriding the default recovery behavior is not a simple matter, and even if I did there\u0027s a decent chance it might break compatibility with other mods that depend on recovery. CrewQueue has a feature that makes it so Kerbals need a short vacation after missions, which might be closer to what Beetlecat has in mind. Enneract is CrewQueue\u0027s author, and has done a bit of work to add compatibility between KCT and it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pigowallace\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pigowallace\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy bad, I picked up the wrong file.

After several months of the issue randomly occuring for a small percentage of users, someone finally submitted a video of it. There was a mechjeb window open behind the simulation configure window, so the mechjeb lock stayed on. I submitted a report to the mechjeb developer and it was fixed within a day \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Stupid things happen in this game to cause problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have similar stories about Tarsier Space Tech and Contract Configurator having minor issues and totally breaking KCT installs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cleric2145","CreatedById":73281,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T22:31:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah trying again today, something has completely broken KCT.

I think it would be neat to be able to split up your VAB/SPH build queues. For example, you could have a separate queue for manned missions and one for your probes.
