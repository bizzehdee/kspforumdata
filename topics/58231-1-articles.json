Since then I have been attempting to send an orbital science base(processing lab, 3 man command pod, 2 small tanks of matching diameter, and 8 large radial RCS tanks) and lander to Mun or Minmus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander went into orbit with ease due to modifying the design I used for successful 1 stop and return landing with plenty of fuel left in the accent stage. After much tweaking I managed to get the base unit into orbit by launching with empty tanks and draining the last of the fuel in the lifter. Since then I have been learning through trial and error the art of docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy closest run so far had the 2 craft bounce off each other at under 1 m/s but the ports were no where near aligned. While correcting to make another attempt I accidentally pressed space instead of N and separated from my fuel stacks so the attempt failed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb remains trapped in orbit due to the lander not having any chutes while he awaits rescue. Getting close though so it is only a matter of time before I learn to finesse the controls to get it done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cashen","CreatedById":71281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T07:54:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a trick. When you get your first ship in orbit, have it point directly north and on the horizon on the navball, then turn on ASAS. That way, when the second craft comes up to dock, you\u0027ll know that to be perfectly aligned, you just need to be facing due south on the horizon. This only works north/south but it\u0027s useful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Soda Popinski","CreatedById":92416,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T08:21:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso highly recommend Navyfish\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/dock-align-indicator/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDocking Port Alignment Indicator\u003C/a\u003E.
