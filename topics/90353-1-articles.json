Just do a quick experiment: Take a plane, and up an extra set of control surfaces at the front of the plane, and one at the back. Note how the front ones will rotate in a different direction than the ones at the back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this situation, pictures are always a must, if you have any! ^.^\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T14:29:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAilerons shouldn\u0027t affect pitch, they control roll.

Just right click on them (either in the SPH or during a flight/before take-off) and make sure the button next to Pitch is toggled to off. Incidentally, they should also have Yaw toggled off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you mean elevons, the problem is probably caused by the surface being in front of the CoM (centre of mass). Surfaces in front of the CoM automatically angle upwards to pitch up because under torque the aircraft pivots around/close to the CoM - think of a buggy with 4 wheel steering, the back wheels turn the opposite way to the front wheels to make a very tight turn. The solution in this case is to make sure your CoM is well in front of your surfaces, or to convert these surfaces to ailerons only and use a separate rearward tailplane or forward canards to manage the pitch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Martin0","CreatedById":84922,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T16:34:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you using Swept wings?
