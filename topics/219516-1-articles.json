But there are certain scenarios when in real-life assembly there would be extra structural integrity added between parts even without attaching external structural beams or notable extra mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReasonable limitations to effect:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSame rigid element - no auto-connections going across decouplers or docking ports or (as future possibility) movable hinges - anything supposed to come apart at some point would still require specially placed struts if more rigidity is needed before that.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDirect proximity - the maximum distance (as placed in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E) between collider surfaces should be no more than a certain value (maybe certain percentage of the larger part\u0027s size). This will only ever need to be evaluated in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, no crazy in-flight collider calculations needed.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nContact length matters - side-by-side across full length should be stronger than barely touching near the ends. This, actually, should apply to directly surface-attaching parts as well (could be as extra connections along the contact line).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome options when it could come into play:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nParallel stacks (with no decoupler in-between). For example, some tanks surface-attached to center stack and then longer tank stacks built off them. Or 1 to multiple stacks splitters/adapters. These stacks, running within touching distance of each other are 100% logical to be welded together without need for additional struts.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStack-attaching through several thin parts. The most common scenario is when under the decoupler (or a docking port) there are several parts like probe core, reaction wheel, battery - and only then go the fuel tanks. The decoupler should have some connection directly to the tanks through the thin parts. And, while auto-strutting shouldn\u0027t go across the decoupler, the decoupler placed below a shrouded engine should transfer most force not to the engine but to the part above it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLanding gear, legs, wheels. Should auto-connect to any parts within a certain range (could be larger range than in other cases) of the attachment point. Like landing gear right next to where a wing is attached to the fuselage should transfer the force to both the wing and the fuselage, no matter which of them it\u0027s placed on.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n"}]}
