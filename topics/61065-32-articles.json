These events are rare and caused by things like, launching, landing, EVA,... The other method is implemented by special classes that are called regulary via the Update() method. All are calling the check() methods in the Achievement classes (any ribbon is linked to its own Achievement class) and it keeps track of the previous situation of a vessel, too. Those checks should be cheap for obvious reasons, so maybe under some circumstances they will not resolve the correct result. Not because they are broken (well they may be), but because KSP behaves quite strange sometimes (remember the 6g ribbons just by doing EVA?).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Schmonzo","CreatedById":5728,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T01:15:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI seem not to be able to get into the decoration board anymore...

First, if you resume a game with a kerbal with 21 missions flown and he has not got the 20 missions ribbon (because of some historic bugs), then FF will not check this. The only point in time this is checked is a vessel recover. And now it starts to get complicated. The kerbal gets the mission ribbon but its not listet in the summary. A bug? Well, thats a quesition of the viewpoint. The kerbal gets the ribbon AFTER he has completed the mission, so its not part of the mission itself. And that\u0027s the reason FF doesn\u0027t report it.

First, if you resume a game with a kerbal with 21 missions flown and he has not got the 20 missions ribbon (because of some historic bugs), then FF will not check this. The only point in time this is checked is a vessel recover. And now it starts to get complicated. The kerbal gets the mission ribbon but its not listet in the summary. A bug? Well, thats a quesition of the viewpoint. The kerbal gets the ribbon AFTER he has completed the mission, so its not part of the mission itself. And that\u0027s the reason FF doesn\u0027t report it. It reports only ribbons that awarded WITHIN the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I have found a (a little dirty) solution for this.
