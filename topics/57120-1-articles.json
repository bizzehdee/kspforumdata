I ran out of electric charge. In wanting to keep with the spirit of not making orbital debris magically disappear, I decided to re-designate it as a piece of debris. I was unable to do this however, as the button for changing a vessel\u0027s type seems to have disappeared as a result of my electrical charge running out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I don\u0027t see the logic of having that feature be dependent on electric charge, because in reality, once a satellite dies, it is considered a piece of debris. You didn\u0027t need the satellites electric charge to do that, as you just do it on the ground in mission control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I suggest the simply suggestion of making the \u0022change vessel type\u0022 feature independent of electric charge (and anything else for that matter).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T23:52:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the suggestion needs to go even further. Not only should you be able to do this with a dead battery but it shouldn\u0027t even require any command core at all. The naming of space objects is a thing people on the ground are doing. We name asteroids and comets sll the time. They don\u0027t have commmand cores\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T23:56:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, not being able to rename and reclassify objects because the battery is flat is a frankly daft restriction.

I currently have a \u0027satellite\u0027 drifting randomly around Kerbin because of exactly the problem you described. I just haven\u0027t gone into the persistence and fixed it myself yet... mostly because I shouldn\u0027t have to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
