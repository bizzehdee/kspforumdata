I joined way back in 2015 (the email I use for my online persona actually served the initial purpose of joining the KSP forums) and was active for some time, then kinda just dipped for a while when life got crazy (undergrad). I kinda regret not being active here much for the last few years, but I suppose I was preoccupied with other things. KSP\u0027s mods really expanded the game further and let it grow in various creative directions, and this place is an amazing hub for that. I usually come here first to see the mods and what people experience with them before downloading them. If that experience gets lost, sure I can go to other places for the mods but I\u0027m not sure how well player feedback gets communicated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope TTi has the foresight to keep the forums up for a while longer. If not, let\u0027s hope we can archive a decent chunk of this place and find a new home elsewhere. It sucks, but all good things must one day come to an end, KSP and related shenanigans included.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-07T23:33:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo emphasize, I am not saying the forum WILL be shut down. Many games have forums which continue long after the game itself is finished and if nothing else KSP1 is still something that people are buying and playing, and so its forum may continue to be supported. What I am saying is that we are dealing with a vacuum of information and that a closure is at least a possibility.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lisias","CreatedById":187168,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-07T23:35:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224405394\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022225365\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221720394649\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002264714\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gargamel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, Gargamel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EBut it also makes sense to start a backup for archival purposes.\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI noticed that rhe 502 errors have a Schedule, they usually starts at 23:00 GMT-3 and keep going between 3 and 4 hours.

Put simply, the forum costs are a margin of a margin of a cost, but provide a great metric to point to while they try and sell KSP or PD as a whole. Even if it just sits for years in their backlog of IP that they\u0027re open to proposals for, the KSP property is worth millions, and keeping the forums likely costs in the realm of a few thousand a year. Invision licensing isn\u0027t all that expensive (on the corporate scale of things - my dayjob pays a thousand dollars a year per person for just one platform a couple hundred people use that isn\u0027t even revenue generating or customer facing, a few grand on forum software is nothing), and Take-Two\u0027s already going to be well invested in cloud and hosting infrastructure from the rest of their business, so the guts of the forum become a menial occasional task to deal with. It wouldn\u0027t be surprising if some of the issues we\u0027ve been experiencing lately was their team shuffling us off onto the cheapest, lowest tier hosting they got - The forums are valuable as a sales tool, but nobody is gonna be selling it on \u0022and the forums run buttery smooth\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cold bean counter calculus says that unless the KSP IP is deemed unsellable in perpetuity and never worth resurrecting, that the forums are a worthwhile continued expense.

Noire. It would be a very brave T2 executive indeed to kill the official forum to one of their brands, no matter how \u0027niche\u0027 it is. Despite the failure of KSP2, the Kerbal name is very well known and recognisable.
