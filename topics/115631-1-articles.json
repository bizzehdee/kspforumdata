Therefore any minor rotational changes (which happen with SAS, especially with large vessels) result in adjustments of the AP/PE. This effect tends to be more pronounced if the orbit is really close to circular. To get around the issue, if you are trying to place a manuever node, make the orbit have a small eccentricity rather than as-close-to-circular-as-I-can-get. For a manuever node, just adding some delta-V to it will solve the problem of it moving around, however small dV of \u0026lt;1m/s will still suffer from the movement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other issue is with floating point errors.
