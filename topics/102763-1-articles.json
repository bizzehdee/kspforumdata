I am on iPhone at the moment but if no one else has replied by the time I get home, I will see if I can give a more detailed answer.\n\nETA:\n\nI see no one else has chipped in, so I will see if I can get you started by describing what I did.\n\nFirst thing is to start a new game save. Give it a distinct name to keep it separate from your normal game saves. I set mine up in Sandbox mode so that I had access to all the parts I needed.\n\nIn the new game save, you can either build the ships/structures you need, or copy them in to the appropriate ship folders.\n\nPut all your vehicles/craft/structures in to their starting positions. To make this easier, you might want to use hyperedit.\n\nOnce everything is in place, you can quit out of the game.\n\nYou now need to find the saved persistent.sfs file from this game and copy and paste it in to the scenarios folder in your game folder structure.\n\nOnce in the scenarios folder, you should rename it as appropriate. You will see the stock scenario files in this folder, and the names you see and use here is how they will appear on the scenario menu in game.\n\nYou will now need to edit this persistent file. I use Microsoft notepad to do this, but any standard text editor should do.\n\nIn the first few lines you can amend the title and should add a description.\n\nIf you have more than one craft in your scenario and want to give the player a choice of which one he controls, change the line scene = n, to scene = 8 This will put them in the tracking station view with the option of selecting which craft to control\n\nIf you want your scenario to start with the player in control of a craft, change the line scene = n to scene = 7, but note that this will default to the first craft in the vessel section of the file. I have had asteroids occupy this part, so if this happens to you, you will need to delete the data for the asteroid.\n\nOther parts that may or may not wish to change, depending on what facilities you want to make available to the player are the following lines, which you will find near the beginning of the file:\n\nCanLeaveToEditor =\n\nCanLeaveToTrackingStation =\n\nCanLeaveToSPaceCenter =\n\nCanLeaveToMainMenu =\n\nThe default values for a normal game save are True, True, True and False respectively. Each should be self explanatory, and the stock scenarios have these set as False, False, False and True respectively.\n\nYou can choose to set them as your own scenario requires.\n\nI think that\u0027s about it, and hope that helps.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-27T15:17:35Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2015 03:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Scarecrow88**"},{"CreatedByName":"oriramikad","CreatedById":133379,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T15:48:05Z","Content":"Wow, thanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T18:46:07Z","Content":"In [The Drawing Board](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/28352-The-Drawing-Board-A-library-of-tutorials-and-other-useful-information) the only in-game tutorials made by players are by blizzy98, who of course also has several mods to his credit.\n\nYou might want to download those and look at the source code in C#"},{"CreatedByName":"ilo","CreatedById":130783,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T08:23:45Z","Content":"Here is a tutorial on writting tutorials..\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/23028-Article-Writing-Tutorials-A-Demo-%28and-some-source-code%29?p=1584655\u0026viewfull=1#post1584655](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/23028-Article-Writing-Tutorials-A-Demo-%28and-some-source-code%29?p=1584655\u0026viewfull=1#post1584655)"},{"CreatedByName":"ilo","CreatedById":130783,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T13:39:09Z","Content":"Additionally, if you create a custom Scenario addon or a tutorial, you will have to make sure the module is loaded with the game. For this you must make sure your addon DOES NOT START on every game automatically and you have to add it to your SFS file manually.\n\nEdit your SFS tutorial or Scenario and add the following chunk as a new Scenario module (you will find other scenarios being loaded in the SFS file as well).\n\nhttp://www.vbulletin.org/forum/misc.php?do=bbcode#code\n\n    [/URL]\tSCENARIO\t{\t\tname = THENAMEOFYOURSCENARIOORTUTORIALCLASS\t\tscene = 5, 7, 8, 6 // the scenes you want your class to be instantiated.\t}[URL=\u0022http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/misc.php?do=bbcode#code\u0022]\n\nJust need to put in there your module name and the scenes to load your addon. When the Scenario or Tutorial (the sfs file) gets loaded, KSP will find your scenario and spawn it.\n\nWen you have everything ready, you would want to change your game mode to Scenario (within the main Game node there is a \u0022Mode\u0022 Attribute), or Scenario no resumable if you don\u0027t want the player to abandon it in the middle and continue later.\n\nGood luck!"}]}
