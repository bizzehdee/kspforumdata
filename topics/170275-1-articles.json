I really didn\u2019t realize how much I rely on saving/loading until I suddenly couldn\u2019t. Suffice to say I\u2019ve been using a lot more probes and adding a lot of parachutes (might even use a launch escape system once I unlock one.) Sadly, I lost Jeb while testing an airplane to do pressure surveys (y\u2019all know the grind.) Valentina Kerman just hasn\u2019t been able to fill the void in my life left behind after the accident. Now, I\u00A0put separatroms, parachutes, and decouplers on my planes around the cockpit\u00A0just in case I ever need to eject. If only I\u2019d taken these measures sooner, Jeb would still be with us. Anyway, right now I\u2019m saving up money to upgrade the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E so I can send a rocket \u003Ci\u003Esafely\u00A0\u003C/i\u003Eto the moon. I designed a rocket with enough Delta-V, but I don\u2019t have enough parts to go around for struts and stabilizers, so I fear a catastrophic failure (which would cost a nice $20,000 in losses and maybe another life.) I\u2019m going to keep testing components, hauling em into orbit, ferrying tourists around Kerbin, and conducting observations in my ultra-safe jet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u2019t say that I have done anything too momentous in the game, although I\u2019ve played around with challenges and mods. One challenge that stands out for me was one to travel to the Mun\u2019s surface\u00A0and back for the smallest cost. I wound up with a rocket that cost only 4,975 and although it was a little ugly, it worked. Re-entry was a little rough, as the re-entry vehicle consisted of a small radiator, an external seat, a battery pack, and a control wheel. He still survived.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, I\u2019m rambling and I\u2019m sorry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u2019s nice to meet you all.
