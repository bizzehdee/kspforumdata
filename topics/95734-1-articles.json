Right now, if I tell them to point prograde, anti-normal, etc, then they\u0027ll massively oversteer and oscillate back and forth several times before settling into the right place. This problem is much worse with heavy vehicles, or low-torque probes. It feels like pilots are just going hard-over on the stick until the marker is dead ahead of them, and forgetting about angular momentum wanting to keep the ship turning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now it\u0027s faster to locate the marker myself, and then tell the pilot to just hold this direction we\u0027re already facing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might be nice to give them a bit of subtlety with regards to \u0027retrograde\u0027 as well. This setting can be really good for landings, since you only have to watch the throttle, but if you accidentally reverse your vertical velocity by even 0.1 m/s, the pilot flips you upside down with your engine pointing at the sky - probably at extremely low altitude! This gets aggravated by the oversteer issue and can result in a pilot panic attack, whereby the ship flails in all directions \u003Cem\u003Eexcept \u003C/em\u003Eupwards. I\u0027ve had some really close calls due to this behaviour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the AI to handle retrograde situationally is too complex, then perhaps a new \u0027retrograde landing\u0027 option available only when below 1km altitude (vs terrain). This would always be \u003Cem\u003Etrying\u003C/em\u003E to track true retrograde, but would not push the nose below zero degrees, even if you\u0027re moving upwards. If you start moving upwards, it would still help you null your horizontal velocity but wouldn\u0027t let you blast downwards at 50m above some sharp rocks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly; any chance of an option (toggle on/off in companion to other pilot controls) to cancel directional hold and revert to stability mode the moment the player gives WASD input? Few things are more annoying than a pilot who is constantly fighting me as I\u0027m trying \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E to land on a steep slope. At such a moment I don\u0027t want to divert the brainpower to finding the mouse and clicking the option over myself, because I\u0027m probably too low and too fast already \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...and since it\u0027s randomly in my head, on-the-ground training facilities? E.g. with a Tier 2 or 3 astronaut complex, perhaps you could put your new hires through a week of training for a fee, getting them straight to level 1-2 in their respective fields? Probably horribly imbalanced, but the taking 4 rookies to Mun and back is getting wearisome \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-05T15:21:31Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2015 03:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by eddiew\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Synapse","CreatedById":72502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-07T16:31:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESAS needs to be fixed so that when you enable SAS it defaults back to hold position, this will stop many landers going straight down into the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think a pilot training facility would be good, but boring?
