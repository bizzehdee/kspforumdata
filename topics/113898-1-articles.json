Right-click on it and choose the \u0022get science\u0022 option from the menu (it\u0027s called something different for different instruments, e.g. \u0022Log Temperature Data\u0022 or \u0022Observe Materials Bay\u0022 or whatever), then choose the \u0022keep data\u0022 option (green clipboard button) when the little dialog pops up. That will then reward you with science data when you recover the vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing that adding an antenna does is to allow you to transmit your science without having to recover the vessel. That\u0027s mainly useful for unmanned probes that aren\u0027t coming home again. It\u0027s always better to recover the data physically (i.e. with the ship) rather than transmitting, because when you transmit you only get a fraction of the science points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a lot more that can be said about working with science, but that\u0027s a good place to start. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUseful info:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Science\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Science\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETutorial:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:Science\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:Science\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"firsTraveler","CreatedById":146835,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T00:10:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn what building are the available experiments listed?
