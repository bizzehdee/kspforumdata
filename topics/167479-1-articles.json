This means that I become bored, and I sometimes like to plan KSP aircraft on paper. However, not knowing the width-length proportions of certain KSP parts ( fuselages and wings) makes this a kind of guessing game. My question is: is there something out there that I can use to plan for KSP aircraft? Is there a database that shows the proportions of various stock/modded parts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qzgy","CreatedById":160994,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-13T04:14:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot to my knowledge.
