I\u0027m fine with having to remove all the non-ladder parts of the mod, but if possible i\u0027d prefer to keep the number of ladder parts reasonable (no 8 ladder parts or things like that). Also, simple models with low polycount are preferable (textures are no problem - i\u0027ll repack them anyways).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-18T22:38:23Z\u0022 title=\u002201/18/2015 10:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rynak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Esimplified phrasing\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
