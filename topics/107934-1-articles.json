I have not attempted to stick this on a launcher but would love to see someone try!\n\nIt could probably do with some struts but I wanted to keep the part count as low as possible. Wobble is pretty minimal regardless.\n\n[DOWNLOAD](http://www.whoshotdk.co.uk/KSP/Ships/SPH/Nautilus-X/Nautilus-X.craft)\n\nYou might need to right-click that link and use \u0027Save As\u0027 or similar.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\n**Nautilus-X**\n\nTotal Delta-V: 3,201m/s\n\nMass: 70t\n\nDry mass: 41t\n\nPart count: 212\n\n**Planetary Excursion Science Pod**\n\nRCS Delta-V: 1695m/s\n\nPart count: 19\n\nMass: 2.9t\n\nDry mass: 1.4t\n\nCONTROLS\n\n[4] Toggle Antenna\n\n[5] Toggle Solar panels\n\n[6] Toggle lights\n\n[9] Undock Bay 1 port\n\n[0] Undock Bay 2 port\n\nPlease leave me some rep if you like this.
