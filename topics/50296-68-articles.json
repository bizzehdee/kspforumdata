Can you elaborate a little more on the direction vector?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach shield has a direction vector which is compared with its velocity vector as a dot product. The dot product is multiplied by the reflection value and I think is also used with dissipation and loss. So if your direction vector is exactly lined up with your velocity vector then you have 100% of your reflection rating and ablation/dissipation values. If you\u0027re hitting it at a 45 degree angle then you\u0027re cutting those things by half. That\u0027s especially important for space plane type shields which instead of having ablative materials rely in increased reflection ratings. Typically that\u0027s 25% for non-ablative and 5% for ablative shields.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, that works ok mostly for ablative shields in Real Solar System, but not for 25% reflection only shields, at least not for heavy planes.
