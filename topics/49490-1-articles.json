I\u0027ve been working on this all morning and can\u0027t seem to find a method best suited to launch and land this station. Its pretty balanced longitudinally except for being a bit top-heavy, and even then it is only slightly top-heavy. Any suggestions? I can upload the .cft file if needed. Mods on this station: Kethane (.22), DEMV Mk. V (.21), IonCross (dev 4 for .22), KAS (.22), FusTek, (.21x), B9 (.21). I am also using KW rocketry (.22) if that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/ObkrW\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
