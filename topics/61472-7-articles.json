Things like frames, some tanks, and some structural pieces will be constructable in the editor using raw materials, but more complicated things like rocket engines will either need to be bought in, or once you\u0027ve acquired the necessary equipment, created yourself in the manufacturing wing. I\u0027m still debating the extent to which you\u0027ll be able to customize parts. I\u0027d like, for instance, interchangeable lenses for cameras, so you can have narrow-angle, wide-angle, maybe even fisheye lenses.

Each galaxy can be considered a separate universe, internally.
