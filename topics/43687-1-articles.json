My objective is to create a base on any planetoids using the H.O.M.E. Modules. Stationed in orbit around said planetoids with be a fueling station. The H.O.M.E. Modules are easy enough to land them and get them set up. One of the H.O.M.E. Modules comes with a Miner system that you can use to mine fuel or mono from said planet (Mun for instance). I will be using the Kerbal Attachment System to transfer fuel from the HOME Miner to the lander/lifter. The hard part is getting the lander/lifter up and into orbit around said planet to dock at the fueling station with its payload so I can transfer the fuel from the lander/lifter to the fueling station. Another thing to note is that the reason for the fuel station and lifter/lander is for the mother ship that will need to refuel for its trip back to Kerbal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI was wondering if you guys can help me out with a few designs for the lander/lifter and the fuel payload.
