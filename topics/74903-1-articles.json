On the other hand, hypergolics ignite spontaneously when the two propellants come into contact (or when the one propellant comes in contact with a catalyst, depending on the system), so it\u0027s not as big a deal if non-fuel enters the combustion chamber.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"palioxis1248","CreatedById":100635,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-13T03:54:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a few problems with that explanation.

Simply opening the valve wouldn\u0027t fire the engine; usually, a small amount of hypergol is injected into the chamber along with the first few drops of fuel-oxidizer mix to ignite it. Problem is, bladders are not easily scalable, so there is an upper limit to the biggest pressure-bladder tanks that can be built. Though, there are non-hypergol engines designed to run off pressurized tankage systems, usually used as upper stages. One example would be SpaceX\u0027s Kestrel engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENon-hypergolic non-cryogenic fuel/oxidizer mixes are rare. Most use LOX because of its proven performance.

It used hypergolic engines throughout (for reliability), and during the first manned test flight (Apollo 9), the initial burn of the throttleable descent engine was started at 20% thrust. The crew reported a very rough ride and shut down the engine, but on a hunch, they tried again at 40% thrust for startup and found that it was very smooth, and they could reduce the throttle to the minimum setting without gaining roughness after starting at the higher thrust setting. Their verdict was that, most likely, the lower thrust setting at startup didn\u0027t provide sufficient ullage thrust to prevent the engine from swallowing some helium, resulting in pogo-style oscillations and a rough ride. From then on, the standard procedure was to start the LM DE at 40% thrust or higher, then reduce thrust to the desired level, since this would stratify the propellants from the pressurization helium enough to provide a smooth burn. (The RCS ullage, apparently, was just enough to get the engine started, but not enough to ensure there was no helium swallowed by the engine. This wasn\u0027t an issue for the CSM\u0027s SPS engine or the LM Ascent Engine, since both were non-throttleable designs that were sure to generate sufficient ullage for stratification, and, in all but the landing abort contingency mode, the LMAE had the benefit of lunar gravity to provide zero-charge ullage...)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shynung","CreatedById":101096,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-13T14:30:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeems like the LM descent engines didn\u0027t use bladder tanks.

The crew experienced a rough engine condition while throttling from the 10- to the 37-percent setting during the second firing\u0022, and again a bit later on the page and onto page 9-61: \u0022Engine roughness was reported by the crew when the engine was throttled from the 10 to the 37 percent setting during the second descent engine system firing. The onset of roughness occurred as the throttle setting reached approximately 27 percent, at which time the setting was held constant until the roughness ceased. This roughness is typical of that experienced with helium ingestion into the combustion chamber. The roughness lasted approximately 2.5 seconds (see figure 9.8-2) and the remaining portion of the second firing and all of the third firing appeared nominal.\u0022 A detailed summary of the anomaly is found in section 17.2.11, starting halfway down page 17-35 and ending about a third of the way down page 17-36. Apparently, testing showed that there was no detrimental effect from suffering helium ingestion, and therefore, no corrective action was taken.
