And the kerbal race.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe kerbals knew why they were here... To rise as a species. So these are the tales and the journeys of the kerbals rising.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter One: Kerbals Rising \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin was young, The kerbals were younger. They\u0027re numbers small. They wondered how they would start, One kerbal caught something in their eye sparkling and green! He ran over to it and picked it up, It was kethane! Though the kerbals didn\u0027t know that. He gave it to one of the kerbals and the others circled around him, Wondering. What is this majestic shiny material? And how would they find out what it was even? One kerbal sayed they may know somehow! The kerbals asked in disbelief, How would you know? As far as we know were the only ones in this galaxy! The kerbal sayed \u0022Come i saw something over there!\u0022 The kerbals ran following him... There stood, stuck in a hole... There we\u0027re ancient scriptures, In an ancient language the kerbals yet to understand! One kerbal sayed they think that those scriptures came from our ancestors! The kerbalens. On a planet somewhere... The kerbals gasped in disbelief! The kerbal then sayed he thinks he knows what it says, He read on... \u0022We have reached our ending... A more knowledgable and capable species will take on the kerbal race to glory... Whoever you are, You must build a space center!\u0022 The kerbals gasped in disbelief! Was this true? Was this the start of a destiny for kerbalkind?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe kerbal said, We must build a space center! The other kerbals agreed confidently!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo they searched for stuff that could work to build the space center, One of the kerbals found a very silver and shiney material, It was metal. They named it. The dug down more finding a whole deposit of metal! Big enough to build a VAB (Although they didn\u0027t know it was a VAB!) They hastily dug the metal out and started building a building! Once it was done in a few days, They didn\u0027t know what to call it... They scratched their heads, Think, think, Think! They said what would be in a space center! One of them hastily yelled and raised their hand! And said... Maybe we could call it a tracking station! They all yelled agreeing Yes! So they stayed up all night trying to get a working sattellite, It was harder than they thought! It would take longer than a day to make a sattellite!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the next day... They we\u0027re exhausted from a night of working! So they all setup some tents with sticks and cloth, And a simple cloth bed. They slept that day, Then they woke up well wide awake and were ready to get working again! One of the kerbals, Jebediah\u0027s cousin Jake Kerman, Said...\u0022Will we be able to create a Space Center?\u0022 Jake\u0027s friend sayed \u0022Sure we will, it\u0027s not we have to it\u0027s that its our destiny!\u0022 Those words re-assured jake, It put a grin on his face.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the kerbals had a strange feeling in there stomachs... They we\u0027re hungry! So what would they eat? The searched for something that looked edible, They found a tree with a red thing... (An apple but they did not know it!) one kerbal helped the other kerbal grab it by standing on their shoulders, Being the small beings that they are. One of them found a sharp stick and washed it with some water then cutted the apple into tiny half\u0027s then they each ate one of the half\u0027s, The felt better but they had to find some more, But not now! Now they had to get working on the space center! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo they went back to their mining hole, Then grabbed some metal with his brothers also grabbing metal then they ran outside and started working on a tall new building, This building took longer than the tracking station! After about 6 months, Almost a year they managed to create the VAB! They all thought in a group... What should we call this one of them yelled VAB Vehicle assembly building! The group yelled yes! Perfection! All of this was very overwhelming to the kerbals, What did this mean? Why are we doing this? They soon will find out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter finding tons of apples they stored them in the undergound metal mine, In ice they found so it would cyrostasis the apples preserving them!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(That was not the most real life accurate sentence in the world, I\u0027m being creative alright leave out the cyrostasis with ice isn\u0027t possible comments!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo then the kerbals ran out of metal, They kept digging and luckily found alot of metal, they thought maybe enough to finish the whole space center!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut one question remained... What is that green material, they keep running into it in the mines, when they mined it dust came out, They started thinking it was a mineral, So they kept mining metal and the green materials! After building and bonding the group of kerbals became friend quickly, They\u0027re teamwork was swell too! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey then started building the Space plane hangar!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the year 2, the kerbals were proud of they\u0027re accomplishments. But they know that still there\u0027s much to be done. So they thought what was a hangar?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey found a picture on the ground showing the kerbalen\u0027s hangar. They had a glimpse of what it should be!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/thumb/e/ee/Sphexterior.jpg/180px-Sphexterior.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022180px-Sphexterior.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe kerbals knew that they had to get to work, Another big building is going to take a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo they wondered, If that was the kerbalen\u0027s hangar, How do they use it? Was it a door?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo they started working on a few prototypes of doors, One where they would push it open, Or use a vehicle to open it, Until they found some rope and created a prototype when you raise the rope, The door opens! So they built the hangar first, The door should wait.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce they completed it a few months later they started working on the door, The knew how it had to be made. So once they created it they began trying to fit it on the hangar, It wasen\u0027t staying! So they used ropes to make it stay on parts of the hangar while keeping it\u0027s mobility!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter they got the hangar door working they saw a triangle looking thing, It was a spaceplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe kerbals knew that this meant something, They didn\u0027t know what was in the sky, But they knew it was their destiny to visit it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking of more ideas and getting pictures for chapter 2! So it should be here later today or tommorrow.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-25T22:09:26Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2014 10:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Bearsh\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-25T11:48:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHope you don\u0027t mind me commenting here but there are a couple of things you could do to make this easier to read.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
