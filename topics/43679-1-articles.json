You should be going under 100m/s by the time you get under 4-5000m. I also suggest using MechJeb or Kerbal Engineer because they cna show you your surface altitude, not your sea level altitude. That comes in handy to know how high you really are. You want to be doing under about 50m/s when you get below 1000m. I believe both of those mods have a suicide burn countdown, which tells you how long you have before you have to burn full throttle to avoid crashing. That will also come in handy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you learn, you will be able to gauge it better and you won\u0027t need the mods as much anymore.

Putting it into a low orbit (or at least an orbit with a low periapsis roughly above your landing site) lets you land using much less fuel overall, and it also gives you the advantage of being able to effectively pick the landing site you want if your first choice doesn\u0027t look that great once you get closer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-24T20:17:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMun landing. Okay, so you\u0027ve overcome the first major hurdle - you\u0027ve screwed it up at least once. So that\u0027s out of the way and we can have fun with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Not being facetious - it took me at least a dozen tries before I successfully landed in a state from which I could take off once again).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Go for Mun orbit; for a beginner player, I can\u0027t stress that enough. Being in orbit first gives you more control over what you\u0027re doing. I\u0027d recommend anywhere between a 10k-20k orbit and it should be as circular as possible. Don\u0027t go lower; the new Mun has a bunch of nasty, sharp, pointy objects on the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) If you\u0027re flying a manned pod, go IVA (C-key) and look for a gauge that looks like this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.navfltsm.addr.com/collins-ra.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022collins-ra.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is called a \u003Cstrong\u003Eradar altimeter\u003C/strong\u003E, and it tells you your actual altitude above the surface (the one in the cabin tells you your altitude above a reference level, which in most cases is totally useless information). Aim your camera at this gauge because you will need it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2A) If you\u0027re flying an unmanned pod...well, I\u0027d suggest planning your landing at a point near sunrise or sunset, like the Apollo guys did. That way you can use your shadow to help gauge your altitude above the deck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) If you\u0027ve got a separate lander unit, man it, undock it, go IVA and point its camera at the radar altimeter, and then burn slightly retrograde to de-orbit. You\u0027re now headed towards the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Put your gear down around 8,000 if you haven\u0027t already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) If you aren\u0027t burning by 6,000, begin a retrograde burn. Start watching your radar altimeter and your speed; the idea is to kill off your horizontal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) When your radar altimeter starts moving, you\u0027re below 2500 meters to the deck. Some quick math will tell you what the surface elevation will be (if your radar altimeter is reading 2000 and your exterior altimeter says 4500, the ground\u0027s at 2500: 4500-2000 = 2500).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) When your velocity gets below 100 m/s, reduce throttle to 2/3. When it goes below 50 m/s, reduce throttle to 1/3. Follow the prograde marker as it heads towards the dead center of the blue side of the nav ball - when it gets there, you should be travelling vertically (or close enough for jazz).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7A) \u003Cstrong\u003EVERY IMPORTANT\u003C/strong\u003E: Make sure the velocity indicated is your \u003Cstrong\u003ESURFACE\u003C/strong\u003E velocity! If it still says \u0022Orbit\u0022, click on the word \u0022Orbit\u0022 until it says \u0022Surface\u0022. I\u0027ve screwed up more than one landing because my speedometer was giving me the wrong reading...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8). When you\u0027re burning vertical, reduce your thrust to either the first or second click - you want to keep your velocity somewhat stable if at all possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) Check your radar altimeter again and update your information on the altitude of the surface. It\u0027s not going to change much at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10) If you\u0027re still well above the surface, you can kill your thrust entirely. Don\u0027t let it get above 30 m/s though. If you\u0027re within 500 meters, you want to keep your speed below 12 m/s. Preferably, you want to keep it below 10 for some additional safety. Adjust your throttle as necessary; you can still be travelling up to 10 m/s when you hit the deck and still land safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11) When you reach the deck, kill your thrust. You may bounce; that\u0027s alright as long as nothing breaks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12) God willing, you built your lander short and wide and landed in an area that has relatively level grade; the lander\u0027s less likely to tip over on landing that way. If you do tip over and have enough RCS, it should be possible to upright yourself again; you may have to fiddle with folding up your lander legs to do that, though. It might be possible with torque thrust but I wouldn\u0027t count on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13) During this whole process, keep an eye on your fuel. Bingo fuel in my experience is usually somewhere around 80 LiquidFuel units remaining; if you go below that, hit space and try again later. Or land if you\u0027re planning to do a one-way trip...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck; let us know how it turns out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joben","CreatedById":80076,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-24T22:02:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eok thanks i was trying to go straight for a landing instead of orbiting the mun first.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-24T23:04:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce you get in orbit around Mun, remember to press F5 for a quicksave.
