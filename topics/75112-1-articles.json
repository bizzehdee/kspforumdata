I don\u0027t know why exactly. The shape of the mouses curve just doesn\u0027t play out properly in the left hand because they are always designed to fit in a right hand. It also feels silly to use your forefinger for the RMB and your middlefinger for the LMB which is what you get while using your mouse left handed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do on occassion use the mouse with my left hand.

In fact my mouse and joystick are right hand only anyway. Guess it\u0027s just the way I learned. For what it\u0027s worth, I throw with my left hand and shoot firearms with my right, although with a little mental rewiring I can shoot with my left but not as accurately. I tried to teach myself to write with my right hand but my fingers just won\u0027t do what I want them to and I can barely read the result. If I\u0027m doing something repetitive like sanding, carving, drilling, sawing, etc I switch hands with no noticeable difference. Maybe I\u0027m just weird.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
