Kerbals start to form an basic social structure with tribes, and the first crude attempts at farming are made. Kerbals are still nomads, wandering in groups from a dozen to a hundred. Kerbals begin to spread out across Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3400 BEA - First indicators of Kerbal civilization start in the Juasdi valley. First signs of permanent towns, weapons, and pottery begin to show. By now, Kerbals have evolved into tribes and small towns, relying on agriculture for food and occaisionally going to war with each other, using clubs, slings, and crude swords as weapons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3200 BEA - First indicated use of metal by Kerbal civilization. Armor is created with the metal, but proves to be bulky and is later discarded in favor of charging into battle without it. Towns start to evolve to cities, and stone walls are built around them to keep out intruders. Earliest recorded use of projectile weapons in earnest, Kerbals begin to develop writing system and reading. Culture flourishes, and so does the arts. The Mun is \u0022discovered\u0022, first mention of it in ancient texts and manuscripts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3000 BEA - First indicated use of gunpowder by an advanced offshoot of Kerbal civilization. The offshoot later collapses, and the secret of gunpowder weaponary is lost. By now, agriculture is common, and Kerbal civilization has developed writing, and reading, and in turn, a code of laws. Kumammaeri\u0027s Code is the first recorded instance of law, establishing the doctrine of \u0022A finger for a finger, unless you don\u0027t have one, in which you get branded and catupulted out of my kingdom.\u0022. Catupulting becomes favorite execution-style of the day. Irrigation systems are established, allowing for larger cities and huge populations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2950 BEA - Kerbal kingdom of Aris becomes an empire in an massive military offensive against the Huqes tribe, wiping them out and establishing what has been known as the first true empire in Kerbal history. Kerbalkind constructs the first true seafaring vessel, and begins and new era of oceanic trade. The first mention of space travel is made in an science fiction story written by Erdas, an famous Kerbal philoshoper, in which an cart and a Kerbal are flung to the Moon by the use of an supermassive catulput. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2900 BEA - First instance of metallic alloy use by an Kerbal. Iron and Berrium is mixed to produce Beriron, Kerbal equivalent of steel. First alloy ingots are low-quality, but the craft starts to refine itself into new ways over time. Trade by sea becomes widespread, with one ancient philoshoper noting that \u0022Ocean trade is the new hot activity of this millinneum! It\u0027s like a fad, like the whole caltuputing thing, but this is one that everyone can agree is benefical to us all\u0022. Ocean trade later proves to smack Kerbalkind in the face when dieases from other lands wipe out entire cities, estimated death toll of one hundred thousand. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2850 BEA - Kerbal sailing vessel departs for \u0022strange land\u0022, crew never returns (\u0022I told them so\u0022, remarked an Arisan nobleman). First attempted use of long-range oceanic exploration by Kerbalkind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Imperial Chaiqeng Empire discovers gunpowder, begins to use it in fireworks. Chaiqeng offical later discovers Minmus, rewarded with land and two thousand bags of gold (Around $3,200,000 worth of money in Modern Kerbin).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2750 BEA - Arisan Empire collapses after war with the Kaisen Empire, noted by historians as the \u002230-Years War\u0022, due to the fact that it literally lasted thirty years. Due to the reliance of food exports of Aris, several kingdoms go into famine and collapse. Kaisen Empire starts to spread out, attacking \u0022barbarian\u0022 tribes. They soon conquer most of their contient, and start to focus inward on culture and science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2500 BEA - Kaisen engineers construct working model of indoor plumbing, which is quickly installed in the palace of their king. Indoor plumbing begins to replace sea travel as the \u0022fad of our time\u0022, as noblemen and rich merchants rush to buy it. Several angry groups of poor peasants later use the plumbing to their advantage, blowing up sewage pipes in wealthy districts and causing a ruckus. Needless to say, several kerbals are tossed out of the city on a catupult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2300 BEA - Kerbals discover Duna and Eve through the use of rudementary telescopes. First record of mass religon is made. Chaiqeng offical constructs an manned gunpower rocket and attempts to get to the Mun with much fanfare through much of the empire. The rocket lifts off with an massive crowd gathered and explodes at 3,000m, raining burning debris over the Imperial Palace and burning down the concessions stand. The Emperor is strangely amused by this, paying masive compensation to the officals family, but issues an ban on rocket experiments in crowded areas, first law in interest of public safety. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2000 BEA - First recorded use of an cannon in warfare. The Chaiqeng are the first to discover the cannon, and are later followed by the Kaisen Empire. Chaiqeng later falls into civil war, and splits into ten factions competing for rule, all equipped with cannons and rockets. Needless to say, the death toll is higher than previous wars. The first Kerbal makes an landing on another contient after the first intercontiental voyage by ship. The cannon is downsized, and lo and behold, the Kerbals invent the gun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1900 BEA - Kaisen Empire collapses after lasting nearly a thousand years. Several tribes take advantage of this and immediately rush the remmants of the Empire, and begin to batle for supremacy. This leads to a dozen large nation states taking up its place. Kerbal explorers start to explore Kerbin\u0027s ice caps. Several of the new nation states begin to set up colonies on the new contient, while the Chaiqeng Empire is finally reunited and sets up colonies on the opposite shore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1600 BEA - First recorded use of steam technology by the Vauris kingdom, one of the new factions that had been formed in the wake of the collapse of the Kaisen Empire. However, Steam Technology is dismissed as \u0022Not possible, insane\u0022, and its inventor, Maximulliam Kerman, goes on to work on the submarine, but dies before his work can be complete. Spies from Enligia take note of this new technology, and quickly inform their king about it, who gives an research grant to Keury University. Kerbal colonies overseas are flourishes, and start to become an extremely stragetic position in upcoming wars. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1400 BEA - The Enligian Empire and the Vauris go to war over colonization rights to the new contient. The Chaiqeng Empire collapses into another civil war. Due to its more advanced steam technology, the Enligian Empire quickly crushes the naval forces of the Vauris. After its defeat, the Vauris begin to work on the submarine, picking up on the work that Maximulliam Kerman had done before his death. They also reinstate steam power as a critical military technology.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1300 BEA - An Chaiqeng survey team crossing the contient makes contact with an group of Enligian soldiers, marking what many historians believe to be the most \u0022awkward moment in the world\u0022. The Chaiqeng Empire is still in civil war, but the Chaiqeng colonies are still united. Jool and Moho are discovered by Kerbal astronomers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1100 BEA - Influenced by revolutionary ideals of the great political scientist Adam Kerman, the Enligian colonies rebel. The Vauris support the Enligian colonies and soon overrun the Enligian navy with its submarines. The now free colonies form the United Republican Provinces, and are assisted by both the Chaiqeng and the Vauris who quickly transform it from some backwater colonies into a world power, much to Enligian\u0027s annoyance. A trade embargo is formed, and the Enligians soon attack and overhelm the Vauris with an barrage of rockets, then proceed to create crude depth charges that wipe out much of the Vaurisan submarine fleet. The Chaiqeng fall into another civil war and their colonies join the United Provinces. The Vauris angrily turn their backs on the United Provinces after they refuse to help them fight Enligan. The Englian invention of the machine gun soon causes the Vauris to surrender. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1050 BEA - The first steam train is constructed in Enligian, and soon becomes popular in an international craze. The UP soon constructs an series of inter-contiental railroads, and across the sea, entire nations are pouring their money into this new industry. To quote an writer, \u0022The train is the new hot fad of the century! Entire nations are amazed by it, and one cannot walk fifty miles without seeing an metal track snake through the landscape. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1025 BEA - Electrical lighting is invented in Vauris. This fad soon overtakes the trains, as Kerbals begin to install lightbulbs everywhere, ontheir clothes, on their ceilings, to the extent that an UP Senator constructs as entire house out of lightbulbs. The airplane is invented too, and air travel srtarts to phase out lightbulbs are an popular fad. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1000 BEA - An United Provincal engineer constructs the first working telephone, only to have his rival announce the first working radio. In anger, they both shoot and kill each other in an duel, leading to the expiration of their patents and the first open-source technology. Later, an entire research plant undergoes an meltdown, causing restrictions to be places in atomic research. Progress is made in computing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E900 BEA - The first fission reactor comes online in the United Republican Provinces. Chaiqeng is reunited, then falls into civil war again, prompting several nations to take advantage of the now-ancient empire, which promptly reunites and invades them in an curbstomp war. Despite its new oversea territories, Chaiqeng falls into another civil war, and this time, the rest of Kerbin keeps in mind not to disturb it, and lets the Chaiqeng fight in peace. An international group of astronomers, eager to test out radio astronomy, blast out an massive radio signal from the Kerbol system to other stars, then proceed to gleefully make alot of noise, outshining even Kerbol on certain frequencies. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E850 BEA - The United Republican Provinces constructs an atom bomb, and flaunts it by demostrating its power by blasting it as an surprise near an international meeting of world leaders. The government soon takes note to provide any future visiting dignitary with brown pants or hazmat suits and that Kerbals can die from radiation. Nevertheless, the rest of te worl is pretty impressed. enough for itto ignore the losses of several important government officals. Chaiqeng is reunited, but with most of the people missing the old days when they could walk outside and shoot people with an different faction, the new democratic government soon breaks into civil war again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E800 BEA - The movie is invented, and television follows. An science fiction film, \u0022The Kerbal Who Conquered Duna\u0022 becomes an huge hit, but critics slam it for its implausbility and extreme optimism. Talk is made about an massive fiber optic cable that would form the basis for an interconnected series of computing machines to allow fast communication. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E500 BEA - An paper is submitted to the URP President that claims that liquid fuel rockets could one day reach the Mun. The President is interested, and grants Nedbob Kerman several million in research funds. Nedbob is later assassinated by an angry Kerbal cult who doesn\u0027t want his \u0022profane rocket to trash the heavens\u0022. The cult is later confronted by an enraged berserk Kerbalist, who massacres them with an submachine gun, causing a deep divide in the URP over religon and science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E300 BEA - The first Kerbal URP aeroplane breaks the speed of sound. The URP President orders several hundred supersonic warplanes due to rising tensions with Vauris, which immediately backs down. The United Republican Provinces begins its rise to become the first Hyperpower Superstate on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E100 BEA - The \u0022Big War\u0022 breaks out when the Tetonians invade Vauris and Enligia. It takes the United Republican Provinces and the Chaiqeng intervention to stabilize the region. Millions are killed, and tons of infrastructure is destroyed. The Tetonian Empire ceases to exist, with the deployment of URP atom bombs. Seeing its power, the Enligian and Chaiqeng quickly start their own programs of nuclear weapons. The Chaiqeng Empire soon becomes communist, and allies itself with the newly formed Great Union. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E50 BEA - The United Republican Provinces sends up probes into the upper atmosphere to conduct experiments about the feasibility of space travel. An fiber optic communication channel is built from Vauris to Enligias and the Provinces, creating the first internet service on Kerbin. The internet becomes another fad, riding an massive bubble in the stock market, outshining every other industry. The bubble pops, and several companies go bankrupt. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0 BEA - Under pressure from scientists, the President of the United Republican Provinces authorizes the launch of the \u0022L-2\u0022, an rocket that sends the first science payload to an apogee of 405 KM. The payload reenters. The space age has begun. The President then creates a new agency, the Aeronautics Research Administration, the precursor to the National Astronautics Administration. The ARA begins to research space, and the Chaiqeng and the Great Union follow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10 AEA - The United Provinces orbits its first satellite. The Great Union replies by hacking the UP/Vauris/Enligia internet, replacing government files and credit card information with memes of cute rabbits. This becomes a craze, and \u0022cute rabbit\u0022 becomes an overnight celebrity. The owner of \u0027Cute Rabbit\u0022, an GU Intelligence Officer, decides to flee to the United Provinces, where he discovers that he and\u0022Cute Rabbit\u0022 have a net worth of ten million. Cue the annoying papparazi and the rabid fans. \u0022Cute Rabbit\u0022 and his owner star in movies. Later in the year, an young, ambitous Provincal Airforce officer named Jebediah Kerman pilots the first experimental hypersonic rocketplane in the atmosphere. Despite lawsuits, the government refuses to send workers to repair broken windows and later settles with the plantiffs outside court for an \u0022sum somewhere in the five figures, I guess\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11 AEA - The United Provinces launches a Kerbal into an suborbital trajectory, then tells him to leave his capsule. The first spacewalk lasts fifteen seconds, and makes the GU Ambassador yell \u0022YOU CHEATED\u0022 when the United Provincal Government boasts of the spacewalk. Nevertheless, the record is recorded, and the United Proviences is credited with the first Kerbal in space and the first spacewalk, to which the Great Union replies with an more apporpiate feat, by putting an capsule into orbit and returning the Kerbal inside safely. The United Provinces then launches a satellite to orbit the Mun, presumably with an picture of the \u0022middle finger\u0022 gesture to the Great Union. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12 AEA - The National Astronautics Administration is founded to take over the operations of the Aeronautics Research Agency. Despite officals pointing out the only that that changed was that the ARA got a fancier name and a more shiny-looking logo, the move is passed by the United Provincal Congress which mandates it into law. The Great Union launches a satellite that contains a \u0022stowaway\u0022 kerbal, then tries to register the first space station. Since the satellite does not have docking ports, this move is not accepted, and the Great Union\u0027s Politburo walks away, grumbling something about nukes and the Provincal Capitol. Bob Kerman is employed at the National Astronautics Administration as an intern in Planetary Science to get his University degree, where he meets Bill, an aspiring researcher in life support technologies, and the two quickly strike up an friendship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13 AEA - The fiber optic internet has been extended and upgraded. Mass media and instant communication becomes the norm for Provincal/Enligan/Vaurisan culture. The most popular TV show becomes \u0022Cactus In The Desert\u0022, and the show recieves the Golden Kerbal award for Best Actor, Best Show, and Best Special Effects. Child education TV programs also become widespread, with \u0022Walnut Street\u0022hitting record views of ten million people. Several polls show that most Kerbals are now agonistic in Vaurisan culture, but religon still has a strong hold in the Provinces. Literacy rate has skyrocketed in the developing countries, even hitting 100%. In space, the National Astronautics Administration begins in-depth studies of the sun and cosmic radiation through their Helios 1 \u0026amp; 2 probes. The GU smashes a robot into the Mun, and the space age is proceeding well. Meeting criticism for not doing enough, the Enligan government sends its first satellite into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E15 AEA - The first Kerbal probe, an international effort between the United Proviences and the Vaurisan government, brakes into orbit around Duna. The Politburo of the GU announces an ambitious plan to send a probe sample return from Eve. Not surprisingly, he fails, but the GU scores a massive prestige victory. The NAA prepares it\u0027s remaining Helios probe to explore the outer corona of Kerbal. The prob, rechristened the Sundiver, returns an plethora of data from the Sun. Lieutenant Colonel Jebediah Kerman is transferred by his own request to the NAA Astronaut Corps, and passes training with mediocre marks, making it into the roster. He meets Bill in the Off-Duty Lounge, who introduces him to Bob. By pulling political strings, Jebediah Kerman quickly rushes Bob out of University with an Ph.D, and attempts to get him and Bill to join him in the astronaut corps, and later bribes Werhner Von Kerman to hire the both of them. Bill is transferred from the Station division to the Astronaut Corps, and begins his training alongside Bob. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E16 AEA - An UP/Vaurisan/Enligian international probe brakes into orbit around Jool after multiple flybys of Laythe, confirming its habitability. This prompts the United Kerbin Outer Space Bureau to investigate and affirm rights of exterrestial beings on Kerbin. A strong radio message is broadcast to Laythe, with no response. Plans are made to send a future lander. Intelligence observations taken by UP recon satellites show the Great Union constructing an massive rocket of some sort in its southern regions, prompting the UP to send an high-altitude spy plane. The spy plane is spotted over the skies of the Great Union, and is attacked by escapes despite an missile shearing off an entire engine and blasting an hole in the left wing. The pilot manages to control the plane until he enters Provincal Airspace, then ejects with the and is recovered by the army. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E17 AEA - The Politburo of the Great Union gleefully announces to the United Proviences that they have sent an manned spacecraft to orbit the Mun and return. Photographical observations of the Mun confirms this, and something scarier; the GU craft is performing complex orbital manuvuers over the Mun. The GU astronaut later returns to Kerbin, greatly hurting te pride of the Provinces, which is hurt greater when the Sundiver probe loses contact. Taking advantage, the Liberal party runs with an extremely strong nationalist and space exploration plank, and soon capture the Senate and Presidency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E18 AEA - Taking advantage of laser technology, the United Provicnes launches an station named the \u0022Clark and Lewis\u0022, an military spacestation. The laser onboard the station proves itself in the Bali insurrection against the Pro-Provincal government, where it obliterates an entire village and scorches an nearby Union armored battalion. The Politburo threatens nuclear war, and blasts an island with an atom bomb to show the Provinces that he means busniess. An Provincal probe makes the it\u0027s successful landing on Minmus, and an Enligian orbiter arrives at Dres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E19 AEA - Determined to beat the Provinces to the Mun, an GU astronaut lands at the Southeast crater onboard an direct ascent spacecraft, and returns safely to Kerbin. Upon hearing news of this fiasco, the President makes an bold announcement regarding an manned interplanetary mission, directing that the Provinces should land a Kerbal on Laythe \u0022in the near future\u0022, and that \u0022The Great Union may have the Mun, but we shall have the stars\u0022. (Newly promoted) Colonel Jebediah Kerman makes his first flight to Geosynchorus Orbit as mission commander for Starstreak-07. Bill and Bob come along as payload specialists. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E20 AEA - An second module docks with the Clark and Lewis, and the first flight of the XRS-20 shuttle is made. The NAA is ordered to work on Project Bluestar, and sets to work. The Liberal Party wins reelection by a slim margin, narrowly defeating the fundementalist party. Mass protests are held against the spread of mass media, and concerns on the spread of communism cause proxy wars to erupt in third world nations. The United Kerbin is concerned about the spread of militarism in space, and creates a new treaty to ban space weaponary. Despite urging from the Secretary-General, the Provincal senate refuses to ratify the treaty, and upgrades the laser weapons on the \u0022Clark and Lewis\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E22 AEA - An lander probe arrives on Duna, and scores a huge political victory for the Liberal Party, which now controls both houses of Congress and the Presidency. The Conservatives take an less stronger stance, advocating lesser government and environmental issues. Opposition grows strong when the National Astronautics Administration tests it\u0027s interplanetary NERVA tug in Munar orbit. With the GU preparing for a manned landing on Minmus, an second spacestation is launched to orbit the Mun. \u0022Cactus in the Desert\u0022 is cancelled for a fifth season, prompting riots in the UP Capitol of Aseria. \u0022The Strolling Dead Ppl\u0022 races to the top, an becomes wildly popular, introducing the concept of zombies to the Kerbal population. The Atomic Reavers win their ninth football season in a row, causing a of young hooligan Kerbals to nearly burn down the red light district in New Hesenburg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E23 AEA - The first United Provincal spacecraft makes an manned landing on the Mun. The Vaurisan Space Agency launches its first ion powered probe, which makes it to Moho before running out of fuel. Ion technology is being looked at for freight transport to a future base on Duna, and the President orders an team to study it. The National Astronautics Administration begins to construct an multi-modular civilian station in orbit, as opposed to the weaponized \u0022Clark and Lewis\u0022. Jebediah Kerman becomes the first Provincal citizen to land on the Mun, and proudly speaks about an Mars mission during an ticker-tape parade back on Kerbin. Taking advantage of his newfound fame, Bill stars in an massive blockbuster sci-fi movie and becomes an media darling, with an personality cult/fandom with an size rivaling that of Cage Kerman. Bob does not take to his fame so well; he is arrested for civil disobiedence after attacking an papparazi photographer, but Jebediah and Bill soon secures his release and has the charges dropped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E24 AEA - The Great Union lands a Kerbal on Minmus onboard an direct ascent vehicle, which later explodes into pieces upon takeoff. The Politburo blames the Provincal-Enligian-Vaurisan alliance for this, and secretly places missiles on an island near Aseria. Another proxy war breaks out near the Union border, causing the Union to use nuclear weapons against the Provincal-back insurrectionists. The new Provincal spacestation in Kerbin Orbit is complete, and the Chaiqeng government surprises the world by launching an Kerbal to an circular orbit 90 kilometers above Kerbin. The Liberals strike an political deal with the Conservatives, and funding is cut from the space program, enangering those in support of space exploration. After an bill is presented to the Provincal Parliament that would stop all offworld exploration/outpost activites for five years to focus on rising internal issues, Jebediah secretly engineers an riot to break out, which causes the bill to be unanimously rejected in both houses. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E25 AEA - The first sample return mission yields results from Duna, and an Enligian-Vaurisan lander touches down on Laythe, and discovers micro-biological life in the oceans, causing an massive uproar amoung those devout to religous faith. Not surprisingly, the head engineer of the project is found murdered, forcing the Enligian government to clamp down hard on religous terriosm. The catulput execution is revived, then stopped after an Kerbal Rights commission from the United Kerbin threatens trade sanctions. The United Provinces launches it first interplanetary spacecraft, the Dawn Voyager I for an flyby mission of Eve. Despite political protests and attempts to stop the launch by radical members of the Green and Fundementalist Party, the rocket is powered by an powerful NERVA engine, and begins its transit toward Eve. The Politburo refuses to issue an offical statement regarding this new development. The United Proviences begins to speakin optimistic terms for an lunar base, which could be supplemented by its already-in-operation Lunar Orbital Station. Clark And Lewis, the military station, recieves another upgrade. Later in the year, the Proviencal government discovers an odd activity in an island near its shore; the Great Union has secretly placed nuclear missiles within striking distance, an outright violation of international law. Angered by this, the President calls off the Summit and orders the Clark and Lewis to fire its laser, quickly decimating the military installation on the island. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E26 AEA - With pressures mounting between the Proviences and the Union, the Union threatens to attack an Provincal city with nuclear missiles. While to normal observers, this seems like an act uncalled for, the Politburo knows full well that the Clark and Lewis had destroyed his military installation. The first interplanetary ship, Dawn Voyager One, arrives into orbit around Eve after an flyby/surface exploration of Gilly by using their Mobile Moving Around Unit (MMAU). The International Astronomy Observatory, the Little Ear, detects an massive radio signal coming out of Constellation Ara. The signal is one hundred times stronger than that of the background radiation, prompting an full-on investigation. Despite repeated scans of the sky, the signal is not repeated. The Provincal government orders the placement of the observatory under Federal control, and sends out an reply to the signal. The signal is estimated to originate from another star system, named Hues 4389A. No further investigation was made. The Vaurisan government engages in proxy warfare with the Great Union to an standstill. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E27 AEA - The first crew of the first interplanetary voyage returns back to Kerbin. Jebediah, Bill, and Bob are rocketed further into stardom, becoming overnight celebrities and swarmed by photographers and exicited fans when they make their return to the city.
