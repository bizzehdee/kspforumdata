But I already struggled a bit with it in KSP and with more people getting bigger and wider screens this will be even worse for them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is a recent screenshot from the PC Gamer interview and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E (I guess):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022xqkcOOT.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/xqkcOOT.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this scale it looks fairly reasonable. But now imagine this two times to the left. You have to do a lot of moving your head and eyes and the cursor as well to select a part. This is sadly very exhausting and when doing bigger builds it can make it very tedious and take away the fun in building stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s how Avorion does this, where you build at an even smaller scale with much more detail if you like to:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022oqfFoLN.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002280.06\u0022 height=\u0022795\u0022 width=\u0022993\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/oqfFoLN.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the building block dialog, which pops up at the center of the screen, if you press space.

Maybe have the building menu pop up at the mouse cursor or such a thing. This kind of menu is much better, because it sits where you can easily access it. The wider-than-higher way is better for selecting parts, since usually our displays are wider-than-higher as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027m asking you, the developers of KSP2, to at least consider reworking the menu for the building blocks to this type of style and putting it on an easy to reach hotkey.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-12-19T16:23:43Z\u0022 title=\u002212/19/2022 04:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 19, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Mat2ch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jastrone","CreatedById":208489,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-19T16:44:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nits not that bad. never had a problem with this in ksp 1. and in ksp you use a bunch of different parts, not many of one type. bringing up a popup would be very anoying since you would have to do it a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-19T16:47:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Avorion parts menu works if you\u0027re not doing pick and place for each and every part.
