I call it the Esquilax!

It comes with double everything science (expect pressure sensors and only one seismic) to get just above and landed science from all the Joolian moons (apart from Laythe), and return to the mothership for science processing and refueling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tzy3D7l.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022tzy3D7l.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could of course land on Laythe, but not return after.

It\u0027s primary thruster is a jet, taking advantage of Laythe\u0027s atmosphere to get it as high/fast as it can go. It then drops the jet stage and becomes a regular rocket, hopefully getting it back into orbit where it can rendezvous back with the mothership and latch back for processing. Then of course it returns to Kerbin (I hope, if I haven\u0027t wasted too much fuel) where the top lander and science pod parachute back down safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I\u0027m having is that I can\u0027t get the damn thing into orbit. The launcher can\u0027t attach to the jet engine, so I have to have it coming off the four nukes, but whatever I build it either crashes into itself when jettisoned and blows everything up, or it\u0027s just not powerful enough. Repeated failure tends to annoy me, so I\u0027ve turned to the good people here.

The engine fairings for the nuke get jettisoned with the force of a small supernova. Maybe angling your nukes differently or jettisoning them manually (one by one) will do the trick to prevent the fairings from slamming into your craft. I believe there is also a way to get the fairings to dissapear by reloading a quicksave when the seperator has been activated (but not the engine) but I am not sure about the details.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xoknight","CreatedById":80283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-24T17:17:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I don\u0027t think that lander has enough power or fuel to land on/take off from Tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Assault Bunny","CreatedById":61177,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-24T18:34:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you misunderstand.
