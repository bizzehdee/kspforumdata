But you know what radiators do, right? Their entire purpose in life is to pump heat into the surrounding environment. And the manufacturers proudly proclaim how much heat they can put into the air. So the last few months, thousands of new radiators have been built and are now in operation, and Kerbin\u0026#39;s temperature has spiked as a direct result.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MachTurtle","CreatedById":153223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T22:26:58Z","Content":"\nMight it be time to institute a cap and trade regime for ore usage?
