I see the mod key is now Left-Alt for some reason. Maybe I\u0027ll just leave it like that and see if I get used to it. It\u0027s not like I\u0027m going back to playing 0.90 ;-)\n\nEdit: Neither Left-Alt nor Right-Alt works correctly as the Modifier key. Changed it back to Right-Shift as XenonBlade described.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T10:54:20Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 10:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by boostme**"},{"CreatedByName":"leopardenthusiast","CreatedById":26084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T10:49:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thank you.
