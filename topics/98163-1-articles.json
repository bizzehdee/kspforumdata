The parachute and toroidal tank attached to the top of the lander appear to have been knocked off, as there was a big gap between them and the lander, but they acted as if they were still actually attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn take off back to orbit, the lander was still attributed as being on the surface, which prevented me from switching to another ship or exiting back to the space centre. The attached image was taken with the lander at approx. 62000m above the surface, and travelling at about 890 m/s. As you can see there is no orbit path line, and the information for the lander shows it as being on the surface with appropriate lat and long information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/bug01.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bug01.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RexKramer","CreatedById":76862,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T17:29:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a similar issue (#2825) which produces a similar result when launching from an ocean, via staging and decoupling.

The ship remains tagged as splashed down, which creates the same problems you saw- no orbit lines, can\u0027t switch vessels. I\u0027m wondering if there are additional situations that produce that bug, which might help narrow down the root cause.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlayers launching from Duna\u0027s surface is obviously a pretty common event. Even launching after you have knocked bits off your ship due to a rough landing is pretty common, unfortunately I do that somewhat regularly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
