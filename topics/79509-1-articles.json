I use quicksave just because of all the lovely little quirks KSP has, like the one that happened today when I went to get a drink while my Duna lander was on the way out of the system, engines/rcs/sas all off, no timewarp as I did have a maneuver node soon. Get back to my computer a minute later to see all the arms of my lander gyroscoping in opposite directions. 30 seconds of trying to stop the parts spinning later I watched the pieces of the ship rip themselves from the core of it. Then there\u0027s the times that my guys get out of the ship and somehow managed to tip it over even when it\u0027s sitting stable on flat ground. So yeah, as far as quicksaving goes I just use it as a backup against the random quirks of the game, and as a backup for the periodic saving the game does to the main file (had a few crashes where my quicksave was actually several minutes later (largest was about 30 minute difference) than the auto-save).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECase in point, earlier this week when I had 6 million in my budget, I launched MULTIPLE missions going to well everywhere outside of Kerbin SOI. The total price tag on this venture was around 5.5 million, and I had multiple, MULTIPLE partial failures on the missions where I would lose solar panels, mono tank here or there, even one of the engines on the final part of a transfer vessel. The greatest failure I had was when my manned Duna mission was heading for a rendevous with the transfer/refueling ship. Now, while I calculate and plot all of my intercepts and transfers myself, I do use mechjeb for executing the maneuvers, which allows me to save fuel. And I needed to save fuel on my Duna mission, I had gotten into orbit with just under 400 units of fuel left which resulted in about 150 m/s of delta/v I used 100-110 of it going toward my final rendevous with enough left for the deceleration burn that should park me about 50 meters from the transfer ship. HOWEVER I was doing this on the night side, with no lights, no big deal, done this plenty of times, plus I can see the docking port highlighted I can do this. What I did not take into account was the position the ship was in. Just as MJ was starting the final burn, my landing gear and main clamp-o-tron on the bottom of the lander plowed into the main fuel tank/engine of the transfer ship. Luckily the lander actually has 2 clamp-o-trons and I was able to rendevous with the remaining tanks, dock up, take the fuel from the tanks that no longer had engines to refill the lander, jettison what would unbalance the lander thrust, towed the remaining tank to ike, landed there, took off again, redocked, and started my transfer back to kerbin burn. Now due to the damage my lander had taken (lost a few landing gear, a clamp-o-tron, and some external components on the tanks such as batteries a few rcs props etc...) I had to balance the weight of my ship by keeping some tanks opposite of the damaged side empty. So here I am, using my lander to push some fuel tanks with me back to Kerbin, having to keep my thrust limited to 35-45% or the rcs and reaction wheel would not be able to cope with the imbalance (without \u0027ballasting\u0027 my lander tanks they could only handle 5% thrust) Managed to get this crippled lander back to Kerbin SOI, get into a orbit that would impact minimus later(dumped the spare fuel tanks then) burned at pe to drop ap below Minimus orbit then burned again at ap to encounter kerbin for a polar landing that the ship barely survived (each of the arms of the lander are twisted 10-20 degrees as it was sitting on the ground). The things is, I had done a quicksave just 15 minutes prior to the accident before I lifted from Duna. I could have avoided this entire \u0027mess\u0027 by reloading after destroying my transfer ship. I didn\u0027t because this wasn\u0027t from a quirk of the game, a problem in one of the mods I use, this was something that I had done, so I lived with that consequence, and managed to get back to kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESO yeah, I don\u0027t disable rollbacks or quicksave, I just don\u0027t use them aside from when the game itself messes up. Even when an 800k ship decides to turn itself into a Roman candle 1 second AFTER launch.
