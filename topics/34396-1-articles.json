I have had KSP since v16, but never decided to make a forum account until now. I am interested to join any groups, if there are any available! I am a child prodigy in astronomy, as I had the highest science scores every year in Florida. I also looked at how the world is becoming and how rulers are gaining more power, I decided to establish my own micronation within the mid-Atlantic Ocean. I began a good career as the High king of the kings of Aerox. The United Kingdoms of Aerox were up and running perfectly. But we all came to a conclusion of where should we get some education into the population of Aerox? We were all very happy about our decision of promoting space travel, but we never launched a rocket into space. I came up with the idea of using KSP for simulating our space program. The other kings weren\u0027t very good about it at first, but the came to liking it on how it feels like a game but can teach valuable lessons of astronomy into people who really are enthusiastic about it! Soon, we became smarter than some nations...But that wasn\u0027t the end of our problems. We were having problems with our Warfare Commander not understanding how all these plans worked. One problem is that I was the one who knew all the prime military tactics. I decided to get some random program up for people who want to train like generals. Scripting it took a while, but it came to work perfect! He became from a little pebble of a commander to a war commander. He understood the basics, and he even decided to do the advanced program so he can learn the more risky and yet smarter tactics. Soon, the nation became balanced and the country became a working country of about 80 people total. Small but not too small.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConcluding that story, I am glad to join the forums of KSP!\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal01","CreatedById":57322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T12:44:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T13:02:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome good sir!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T17:58:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
