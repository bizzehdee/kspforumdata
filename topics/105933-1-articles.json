Open the fictional (potential) tree editor - outside of KSP...KSP isn\u0027t even loaded.\n\n2. Drag and drop / use editor to make a tree you like\n\n3. Click \u0022export\u0022\n\n4. The editor then replaces the tree file in the squad folder (or saves your new config file somewhere for you to paste over the squad one manually / back up the stock one etc.)\n\n5. The editor then also drops a MM file into your game data folder with the tech node changes for all the parts\n\n6. Load KSP - your new tree has replaced the stock tree.\n\nDoes this explain better what I am suggesting?"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T00:21:23Z","Content":"In conjunction to a tech tree editor, I\u0027d like to see the stock game come with a tech tree selector in the Customise Game menu, to allow users to easily choose their desired tech tree without overwriting the SQUAD defaults."},{"CreatedByName":"dewin","CreatedById":96372,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T00:29:24Z","Content":"Not at home so I can\u0027t check at the moment, but I thought one of the changes with 1.0 is the tech tree .cfg file being per-save (as well as being customizable at all).
