Of course it\u0027s something we\u0027d love to have. Currently your only hosting is with Curse which we can absolutely work with, but requires manual updates (by you or someone else) with each update the mod goes through. If you hosted on KerbalStuff in addition to Curse it would allow for automation (one-time setup and likely never having to do anything further). I totally understand that adding another host might be burdensome though, so if you choose not to go that route we\u0027ll still make things work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second thing is that we would like your permission to have CKAN redistribute your mod, because you hold an \u0022All rights reserved\u0022 license over it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI look forward to hearing from you here or over at the issue page on github that I previously linked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Just wanted to add a link to the wiki page with the 3 steps required to get set up on CKAN: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/wiki/Adding-a-mod-to-the-CKAN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/wiki/Adding-a-mod-to-the-CKAN\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T11:40:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 11:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by plague006\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eclarification \u002B adding link to wiki\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Orionkermin","CreatedById":91013,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T15:42:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you, I\u0027ve given it a quick once over.
