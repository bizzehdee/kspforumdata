I\u0027ve got a heavily modded install, KSP 1.3.1, but these two problems cropped up on the same day without any mods having been updated. I guess a mod list and logs would be required to fix this, so I can send those but I thought I\u0027d just put this out there as a \u0022feeler\u0022 first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EProblem #1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sounds in general is fine apart from the music -- it cuts out on scene change. It comes back if I open the settings and alter a volume slider. This is true of all scenes. Very weird and I\u0027ve never had this problem before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EProblem #2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve got the Community Category Kit installed, and the parachutes section has disappeared. I can\u0027t find them in search either. However, they\u0027re still there and working fine, and I can find them using the categories for part cross sections. But again, pretty weird.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried deleting the config file and starting again with that, and verifying the files with Steam. No luck so far. I\u0027d really appreciate any insight, thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
