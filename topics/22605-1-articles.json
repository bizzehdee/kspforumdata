Disastrous missions hurt your reputation with the Kerbal Nation. If the game gives you this many little things to worry about, I don\u0027t care if research comes in the form of mission-specific rewards (a certain part for a certain feat, as Scotius says) or a built-up variable (a given number of science points lets you unlock more stuff); it\u0027d be a blast!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. The idea of a fluctuating \u0027reputation\u0027 score with the Kerbal Nation is my favorite implementation when it comes to budget. Destroyed equipment and killed Kerbonauts mean you\u0027re an ineffective space program and the Kresident will cut your funding; successful missions and fruitful discoveries mean you\u0027re worth funding more. Either way, you\u0027ll get some money over time, but time warp won\u0027t help you a whole lot, as doing nothing also brands you as an ineffective program and not worth funding. To further motivate you to have constant missions instead of waiting around, the mission-by-mission recompense described above should pay for most of the parts used; the constant budget stream through reputation is something you want to build to help you increase the scope of your missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-19T16:30:03Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2013 04:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Ringer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vantskruv","CreatedById":57934,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T17:42:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like very indeed the above statement from Ringer, this makes it really fun, and also hard!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would also to be nice to have a more personal connection with your Kerbanouts, just to make every flight more exciting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T17:51:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vantskruv\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vantskruv\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI like very indeed the above statement from Ringer, this makes it really fun, and also hard!\u003Cp\u003EIt would also to be nice to have a more personal connection with your Kerbanouts, just to make every flight more exciting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbsolutely.

Get a manned capsule into orbit, and it increases again. Dock two manned capsules in orbit. Land an orbital capsule safely on land. Find each anomaly on Kerbin. Land an unmanned probe on either moon. Land a man on a moon and return. Build a space station of over 100 tons. Send an unmanned probe to each other planet or moon. Send a man to each other planet or moon. Find all other anomalies. Refine a certain amount of each resource. Make an SSTO spaceplane, and safely land it back on Kerbin. Make a spaceplane that can lift a 10-ton payload into orbit. Land a spaceplane on Laythe, Duna, or Eve, and return to Kerbin. Assemble a large interplanetary ship in orbit. Do a Grand Tour. Set up a colony on Mun, Duna, or Laythe. Crash a probe into the Sun.
