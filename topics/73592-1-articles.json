(Ratio of the semi-major axes has to be greater than 12. For instance, a transfer from Earth to Uranus or beyond would be more efficient with a bi-elliptic transfer.) The problem with bi-elliptic is that it can be much much much slower than a Hohmann transfer (sometimes by several orders of magnitude.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHohmann generally uses the least delta-V, but there are constant thrust transfers that can use less propellant, simply because low-thrust engines are more efficient. In KSP, constant-thrust interplanetary transfers are impractical because you can only do 4x physics warp during them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are problems with Hohmann transfers that might make you decide to use other trajectories:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Hohmann only applies to circular orbits in the same plane. It\u0027s relatively easy to adjust for small eccentricities or inclination differences, but big differences will require different calculations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Hohmann transfers can only be accomplished at a particular time in the resonant period of the two bodies, thus the concept of launch windows, which might only arise every couple years (e.g. 26 months for Earth-to-Mars) If you want to launch earlier, it might make sense to use a less efficient trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Hohmann transfers cannot provide a free return path to the source planet. Something like the Aldrin cycler might be appropriate if you want the spacecraft to cycle back and forth without energy input.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Hohmann transfers make use of the gravity of the source and destination planets only. Many of NASA\u0027s interplanetary missions make use of trajectories that utilize one or more extra gravity assists. (Example: last October\u0027s flyby of the Earth by Juno on its way to Jupiter.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Hohmann transfers do not account for the gravitational influence of distant bodies during transfer. These influences will distort the trajectory and/or lend themselves to more efficient paths, e.g. the Interplanetary Transportation Network.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"T.C.","CreatedById":111697,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-30T00:16:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the excellent answers.
