So i usually find its best to let them get on with the mountain of work before repeating any of these standard ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said there is one minor tweak that i would love to see ... and i only suggest it because i know its a very very easy thing to change up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is to do with the Revert flight option when you press escape during a mission, this is useful but I think i may have come up with a more interesting way of doing it that will add realism to the game. ---- Flight Simulation!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlight Simulation is an absolutely crucial part of NASA\u0027s work and can be very easily replicated without changing much at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment we revert the flights, I think it would be really cool if there was an option in the construction yard to turn on and off flight simulation mode before you launch you mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if simulation is on, things would work very much as they do now ... you can revert flights to assembly or launch as many times as you like, the difference being here that it would not allow you to gather any data to increase your science for further unlocks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhereas when you turn it off the flight is for real .... any accidents that happen, happen, and there is no reverting just plain death and mayhem. (unless you have prepared for it in your designs, with escape pods etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously this idea is for career mode and may have already been planned, but if not i really feel it would add that intensity to your \u0022real\u0022 flights and add that extra element of realism to the overall experience. From what i know of programming this will not be hard to adjust either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading people, let me know what you think!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T21:29:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease stop trying to force realism in a game \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_sleep.png\u0022 alt=\u0022-_-\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T21:48:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like it the way it is.
