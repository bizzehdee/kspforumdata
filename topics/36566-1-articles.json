That\u0027s what I was doing wrong. Durp.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry I didn\u0027t make that more clear, but yes, that\u0027s what we were discussing. Basically, a craft in KSP is a tree of parts. When you attach a part to a craft, the part you attached the part to becomes that part\u0027s parent, so the attachment doesn\u0027t create a symmetrical relationship. Because of the tree structure, while several parts can share a single parent, each part can have at most a single parent part. A side effect of this is that any craft can only have a single node that has no parent, as there\u0027s no way to create a tree that has two \u0022root\u0022 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, when you\u0027re trying to attach a subassembly, with or without any of the mods or versions of mods that do this, you can only attach a subassembly by its root piece, because that\u0027s the only part of the subassembly that doesn\u0027t already have a parent. It would be theoretically possible to restructure the subassembly to change what piece is its root, allowing you to use any of the attachment points present, but that has proven to be more difficult than it sounds, and I\u0027m not sure if it would be possible for a mod to decide which node you\u0027re trying to use and rearrange the subassembly in response.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
