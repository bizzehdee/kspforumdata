Fuel wsa in short supply, as it\u0027d taken quite a bit of the remaining monoprop just to lift the trajectory from impacting Laythe at a low angle up to 60km. So I knew I had no hope of getting the probe into a near-polar orbit entirely within 500km. With the benefit of hindsight, I probably had just enough fuel to drop the apoapsis to 500km, leaving the incloination unchanged. What I actually did was to change the inclination to about 34 degrees (I was trying for 45, saw it wouldnt happen, so stopped and decided to use teh rest to drop the apopapsis), and then could only drop the apoapsis to about 600km. This seems to be giving me mapping coverage up to about 40 degrees N and S of the equator. \n\nIs it likely that I could have done better, gotten greater coverage of the surface, and if so, how? Is there some general principle to work this out, or is it a case of using best judgment from experience and crossing ones fingers?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T16:21:24Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 04:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Esme**"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T13:27:17Z","Content":"The basic principles for conserving dV:\n\n1. If you\u0027re burning prograde/retrograde, do it at the *lowest* altitude possible, when you\u0027re going really fast. (Oberth effect.)\n\n2. If you\u0027re burning normal/antinormal, do it at the *highest* altitude possible, when you\u0027re going really slow.\n\n3. Never burn radial/anti-radial.\n\n...I haven\u0027t sat down to work out the math, but I\u0027d guess that probably what would have been your best option would have been to wait until you were up at your 2500km apoapsis, adjust your inclination there (it would have been relatively cheap for dV). Then, once that\u0027s done, spend all your remaining fuel doing a retrograde burn at periapsis, to lower the apoapsis as much as possible.\n\nThat said: As a matter of practicality, I find that going for the completely-polar orbit isn\u0027t all that useful (to me, anyway), since my reason for SCANsat\u0027ing is to locate resources, and I\u0027d prefer to do my resource mining close to the equator; the only time I ever go to the poles is to pick up science points, which I don\u0027t need SCANSat for.

Hmm. Thanks, I see what you\u0027re saying with 2, hadn\u0027t really thought about that. As for the why - I\u0027m in it for the science points, generally. As I\u0027ve only just got adept enough to be able to get probes to the Joolian system, I wanted to get as much science as possibel out of it so I could unlock more stuff (I\u0027m playing v0.9, science game). I\u0027ve set up bases using KAS before, and am using TAC LS on mannd missions, but haven;t yet got to grips with MKS. I\u0027m looking forward to when I get a new machien so I can run 1.0 sensibly, and try the stock game in 1.0 before trying to emulate Mars Direct. :-)"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T00:54:04Z","Content":"Here\u0027s a tip for going to the Joolian system: Do your aerobraking on *Laythe*, not Jool (even if Laythe isn\u0027t your planned first stop--i.e. it\u0027s a valid option to use Laythe to aerobrake into Jool capture without actually capturing to Laythe itself).\n\nRationale: If you aerobrake on Jool, you\u0027re going to end up in an orbit that has periapsis right down on the surface of Jool. It means you\u0027re going to have to do a lot of dV to match with any of its moons, since your orbit will be highly eccentric and have very low angular momentum.\n\nOn the other hand, if you aerobrake on Laythe, then you\u0027re in an orbit whose periapsis is up at Laythe\u0027s orbit, rather than down at the surface of Jool, so it\u0027s a much lighter dV load to match any of the various moons.\n\nPlus, of course, there\u0027s always the option of aerobraking all the way to Laythe capture, if you want to make that the first stop on your Joolian tour. But the dV savings is worth it even if you\u0027re not doing Laythe first.\n\nTiming your approach so that Laythe is in the right spot when you need it to be might sound hard, but actually it\u0027s not that much of a hassle as long as you set it up long before you get to the Jool system. I was expecting it to be hard, and the simplicity surprised me the first time I did it:\n\nDo your usual maneuvering so you\u0027ve got a Jool intercept, then plop a maneuver node down long-before-Jool and switch your map focus to Jool. Play with the node handles so that your trajectory is tangent to Laythe\u0027s orbit at the right spot. If you\u0027re lucky, it\u0027ll show a Laythe intercept already. If you\u0027re not, play around with the prograde/retrograde versus radial/antiradial handles to adjust your Jool periapsis forward/backward in time while keeping the location pretty much the same. Pretty soon, Laythe will end up doing an intercept. Then you can click on Laythe and focus there, and it\u0027ll show your trajectory there, and then you can fine-tune the intercept to exactly where you want it."}]}
