I sent a rocket to catch up after it but spent more delta V than I had to and caught it right after it escaped Kerbin. And after I spent 3 hours making the kerbals take turns using their jetpacks to slow down the craft docked with the asteroid cause I was out of fuel. Was a real pain to do with that 0.6 m/s a second of deceleration and 515 m/s of relative velocity to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-17T11:21:46Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2020 11:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Vezbot\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EValue correction for deceleration velocity\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
