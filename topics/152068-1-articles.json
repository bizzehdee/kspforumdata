The bottoms do not have full curves like the top. So, for instance, when he flipped on the back it still flipped over because when it went sideways it was more likely to roll because the top is fully curved while the top has a flat bottom. so it always moved when possible to the top because the cargo could move more. It also makes it less likely to move from the top. so when it is on it\u0027s top opening it is not going to unroll from the top... Plus it may flip that way because the palyload can lean farther in that direction over even the other 3 flat side... I think he needs MK2 or a modded MK3 with a different shape.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought this was interesting.I never noticed this before.
