Business has been good, especially since he alone seems to be able to intuit the hidden meaning of the instructions and finish without having any pieces left over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter John F. Kerredy\\\u0027s bold promise to put a Kerbal on the Mun by the end of the decade (\u0027...explosions permitting\u0027), the Kerbal Space Program suddenly found itself woefully understaffed. Kerivak has started moonlighting for them, assembling equally poorly documented rockets for them using the traditional tools of his trade: long wooden dowels and tiny disposable hex keys. Surprisingly, he is doing only slightly worse than the average Kerbal rocket scientist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProjects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Apex Program\u003C/strong\u003E: Stacked SRB-only powered craft attempting height records.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Korivak","CreatedById":18792,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-17T14:43:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Apex Program\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to a general desire for plenty of thrust and a general inability to do simple math where rocketry is involved, the Kerbal Space Program has massively over-ordered solid rocket boosters.

They have very little stamina and you have the weight of a lot of extra engines and decouplers dragging you down. Even the nine-engine stack for the last flight didn\\\u0027t even really get to far up, and escape velocity is out of the question. Without throttle control, you get very twitchy flight controls. The constant staging means the balance changes every sixty seconds, making them even trickier to steer.
