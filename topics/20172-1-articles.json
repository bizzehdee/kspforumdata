You get the best energy gain when you are essentially standing still and the body catches up to you, swings your around its trailing edge and spits you out going twice its orbital velocity. This is great for travelling to Minmus, but since you\u0027re trying to exceed escape velocity you want to be moving faster still. As such the velocity gained by going round the Mun drops, it drops so far that the extra hassle of waiting for the mun to be in alignment is not worth it for the miniscule velocity gain\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a typical interplanetary burn you\u0027ll be moving 1-2km/s when you arrive at the munar orbit, which means the hyperbolic orbit deflection is going to be 1-2 degree at most (hyperbolic eccentricity will be about 10), giving you 1-2 percent of the munar velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you decide to not burn in low-kerbin orbit so that you\u0027re moving slower when you arrive at the mun then you lose out because of the Oberth effect is stronger in low kerbin orbit. So, make sure your injection and capture burns are as deep inside planetary gravity wells as you can get if you want to get the most bang for your buck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would have thought a Munar slingshot the best way to go myself, until I read that post.
