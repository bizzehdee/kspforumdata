There are a few precedents for that. But the achievements of the glider or main body on their own would then not count for the K-Prize, only the achievements of the complete craft, both ion glider and main body together.\n\nIf the glider detached before dropping a payload for example then the payload would only be counted as delivered to the point at which the craft split.\n\nI hope that makes sense !"},{"CreatedByName":"sdj64","CreatedById":100819,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-27T20:29:42Z","Content":"Alright, thanks.

Space gas stations and other space jobs ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif). Park her up there at your station with the belly docking port and then fly home when your shift is done. The only non stock parts are the landing gear which I believe are okay according to the rules but could easily be tweaked to stock if it\u0027s against the rules. I also clipped the radial air intakes into the body for aesthetics but they would easily fit the other way around. \n\nIt weighs 6.21T with 29 parts total. The margin for error is pretty small with this craft. Taking off seems to have wonky stuff going on where the craft starts to wiggle like crazy once it reaches a certain speed. Actually reaching orbit is a bit tricky because you need a very good ascent profile or you run out of fuel. I wish I could bring a small jerry can from the fire spitter mod because there is usually about 55 oxidizer left over once the liquid fuel runs out. \n\nThe nice thing is that the craft has a very high TWR so it quicky reaches the cruising altitude at 30,000 meters and quickly reaches the speed needed for orbit.
