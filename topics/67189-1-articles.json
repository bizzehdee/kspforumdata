My latest is a 230 ton outpost that I wanted to lift all at once. One problem however... how does one stick a 230 ton orbital stage on top of a single 2.5 rockomax decoupler without it crushing into pieces?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution? The gray 4x4 pad between every 2.5 m joint, reinforced with struts! I theorized that because the part has 80 m/s crash tolerance, it must have insanely strong joints. I seem to have been right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe conclusion - 230 ton payload loaded and held reliably, on top of a single rockomax decoupler, sandwiched between gray plates interconnected with struts. No joint reinforcement mods, no quantum struts, just an arrangement of gray pads and struts!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is a close up image of the reinforcement (yes that is a lot of struts, but lighter rockets will only need the pad)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t worry about the huge fairings. That\u0027s another trick for another time (I encase my entire 16 way asparagus setup in fairings for unprecedented aerodynamics with the FAR mod).
