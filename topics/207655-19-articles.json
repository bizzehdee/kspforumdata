While accomodation seeks to create new schemas, assimilation seeks to relate new information to old cognitive structures (schemas). In order to develop intelligence, organisms must balance accommodation with assimilation.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.simplypsychology.org/what-is-accommodation-and-assimilation.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.simplypsychology.org/what-is-accommodation-and-assimilation.html\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, as I read the articles above, (both relate to the fact that Webb is seeing mature galaxies at redshifts (presumed ages) where there should be (under the existing models) nothing more than proto galaxies and stars) I began to see that Cosmologists and astronomers are struggling right now with both assimilation and accommodation wrt the data.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome will feel like they\u0027ve staked their careers on established models and seek to assimilate the new info to those predictions...
