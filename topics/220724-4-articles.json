They\u0027re going to want \u0022millions\u0022 as they say, and they are going to need people with various different skills, some of which can only be gained after having lived enough of life to have had a family. I don\u0027t believe anyone would dump their family for living on Mars, and therefore would desire to bring them along. Musk doesn\u0027t really seem to like ethics, preferring efficiency, and I could see him allowing children to travel there. And then if the Mars hab explodes because of some defect brought about by a lack of care purposefully overlooked, the blood will be on our hands for having failed to prevent this.
