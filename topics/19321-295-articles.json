If that surface is foward of the CoM, then the crat has a reduced pitch up moment and thus is more likely to pitch foward and recover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make a surface stall earlier, all you do is increase it\u0027s apparent AoA IIRC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpins of death =\u0026gt; Larger vertically oriented stabiliser, or vectored thrust (Wanderfound\u0027s craft almost always have a couple of Vernor\u0027s on the nose for this exact reason)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T23:34:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gobur\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gobur\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eech, then i must change something :-(.

Run an AoA sweep on your ships at 0.8 Mach vs 1.1; you\u0027ll often get stalls at the subsonic speed but not for the supersonic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe drag at the back of the plane tries to push the nose towards the airstream; the more distance between CoM and CoL, the more leverage available to this force. This is normally a good thing; nose to airstream is what you want to keep your plane stable. However, since planes always require a bit of AoA to maintain level flight, too much of a tendency to point the nose to the wind will make sustained flight impossible: you won\u0027t be able to keep the nose up, and the plane will go into an uncontrollable dive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECoL right on top of CoM is ideal for maximum manoeuvrability, but it isn\u0027t essential. Not everything is built as a dogfighter. I tend to like a good amount of stability, but with the option to disrupt it when necessary; a bit of CoM/CoL distance, combined with a lot of pitch authority (thus the prevalence of canards on my designs).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThorBeorn","CreatedById":96670,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T00:39:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the update!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T01:17:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ferram4\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ferram4\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Emerry Late-mas!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003ELate-mas.
