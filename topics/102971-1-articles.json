That often involves a curved ramp leading from the position the rover will drop onto down the the ground to ensure that it remains the right way up instead of landing on its back end and falling over the wrong way.\n\nAdds a bit of weight, but means I\u0027ll always have a spare rover\\* ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n\\*provided I don\u0027t need 2\u002B rovers to begin with"},{"CreatedByName":"MasterSounis","CreatedById":114506,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T14:45:57Z","Content":"I haven\u0027t really done rovers, but I had an Ike probe hitching a ride on my Duna lander on the side, and so I used I-beams as counterweight.
