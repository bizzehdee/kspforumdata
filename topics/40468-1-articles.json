Each part would be split into several surfaces: eg the FL-T800 aka. the longest of the standard diameter tanks, could have 5 different surfaces the writing, borders, the background and the now black rectangles on the bottom section each of these could be cloloured differently. For example you start a rocket with the standard one person capsule and because the Kerbal might work better knowing he will survive you add the small parachute on top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou realize you dont\u0027 like the colour of the white chute and so change its colour to fit the command capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Synapse","CreatedById":72502,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T13:05:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice to have colour schemes, rather than selecting each colour tediously. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone remembers homeworld, you could choose your colour scheme (main colour and stripe colour) from a chart.

Or like the mech painter in MWO, for a more recent example. Where you have like a primary color which changes the bigger parts like the white bits on the FL-T800 fuel tank. Then a secondary color that you can change independently, maybe representing the black bars on the FL-T800. THEN maybe have a trim color for the lip at the top and bottom of the fuel tank. Maybe having a secondary trim color for parts with like a color stripe or band or something like that. If you could manually chose your colors via like a color wheel, that would be amazing(I like very specific shades of some colors \u0026gt;_\u0026gt; ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe for the space suits, you can have like a general setting for all kerbonauts or maybe save suit themes per rank or something(red hemlet=vet kerbonaut, for example \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E ). But the primary color would be like the suit color, secondary could maybe be the helmet color with a tertiary or trim setting for the stripes. Maybe have the ability to set the colors for their flight suit(that orange thing they wear when launching) and casualwear(the blue or red polo shirts, they wear in the real ISS ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would be phenomental and if you didn\u0027t care to customize those things, they can be set to the default setting(white suit/helmet for EVA, red stripe for bill, jeb and bob\u0027s helmet, orange flight suits for all, blue/red polo shirts for casualwear and all the defaulty colors for rocket parts). Might be a pain in the ass to setup, though. I mean, I don\u0027t know anything about it, but wouldn\u0027t they have to code every part with a specific kind of texture THEN setup the color wheel and add UI elements for all that ****? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe this would be something they could think about at the very end of their development cycle, right before the game launches. Or as a post-release update or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, I\u0027d absolutely love to customize all my colors to look how I want them to...and I know a lot of other people would too \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
