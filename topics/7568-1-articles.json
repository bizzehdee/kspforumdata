But here is a craft file of my merger of two great packs that thanks to Deusoverkill and Xemit have allowed me to post. It does require you to have Desusoverkill\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s RoketCo 1.0 pack for the Soyuz lower half and Xemit\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s Noyuz 1.2 pack for the upper half for it to work. I also have included to only the cfg files that I have changed in their original folders (names are the same) to go with my craft. So if you wish to keep your own settings you will not want to over write, but using mine will give you a more realistic performing craft (or at least I think it does). This craft works in 13.1 and 13.2 but I have not messed with it in version 14.xxxxxxxxx yet.
