Only mod I am using is Kerbal alarms. It felt like I was controlling from the red circle while looking in the green circles orientation(green circle was what I wanted). however for lining up docking ports this was of little use. I have also had this issue using docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i62.tinypic.com/313t193.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022313t193.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T18:30:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf your docking ports are not in alignment with the center of mass \u0022Control from here\u0022 can seem quite a bit off.

The 2 pieces were launched separately and the green line should have given me a perfect view for docking however if I followed the target in the nav ball the probe core at the top would end up hitting the docking port i was aiming for and I would be no were close to docking successfully.

So if you ever do a \u0022control from here\u0022 for a docking port whose axis doesn\u0027t pass through your ship\u0027s center of mass, then it\u0027s pretty useless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally wish they\u0027d fix it.
