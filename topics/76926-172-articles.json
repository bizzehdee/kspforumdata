I expect this is something to do with the placement of the weapons, usually I\u0027m using them hidden inside other parts with all movement ranges set to 0. Quite often the ship will first launch with the aimers out in front, but after switching into IVA view and back, or cycling weapons, etc, the aimers end up behind the craft.
