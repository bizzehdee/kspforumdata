If we consider payload to be effectively nothing, then your mass ratio will be quite high (3:1) which yields considerable delta v, 10.8 * Isp. For unadjusted 370s Isp, that means almost 4000m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"velve","CreatedById":112979,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-13T23:30:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh yes the payload was essentially nothing, I only strapped a stayputnik on top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKER states that my DeltaV is 1,642m/s and a 3.23 min 8.08 TWR on the Real life adjusted preset. I\u0027m not as versed in all these things as most on the forum, but I grasp most concepts. I did not attach a fairing so I\u0027m guessing I could have acheived at least another 10,000kms.
