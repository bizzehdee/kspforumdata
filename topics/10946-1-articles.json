They are the intermediary between you and your CC/Debit card company.\n\nThey use this position to attempt to convert transactional users into PayPal members. It\\\u0027s a really dirty trick, but if you read the options carefully, you will see there is a way to proceed with the transaction without having a PayPal account.\n\nWhat happens is the KSP Store prepare the transaction then hands it off to a PayPal page that collects the transaction data (CC info) and then processes the authentication. If it\\\u0027s successful, the transaction is then passed back to KSP and your purchase is complete.\n\nIt sounds to me like you proceeded to the PayPal processing and left the fields blank. The next step in the transaction would fail with and invalid/missing information error, you just didn\\\u0027t go far enough to get that message.\n\nCheers!\n\nCapt\\\u0027n Skunky\n\nKSP Community Manager"},{"CreatedByName":"szpw","CreatedById":25964,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T21:15:03Z","Content":"So...you enter the information and it then sends it to the credit card company, who then reconizes who the info belongs to and bills you that way?\n\nAlso, is there any way to pay directly through the paypal website?"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T21:32:35Z","Content":"Yes, all CC transactions online are done through payment processors, some are more transparent than others. PayPal isn\\\u0027t very transparent because of their ulterior motive to get you to sign up. \n\nRight now there are only two ways to purchase KSP and both involve PayPal. You can either pay with a CC/Debit card and have PayPal process the transaction, or you can use your PayPal account and still have PayPal process your transaction. Either way, PayPal will be involved, it just depends on whether or not you want or have a PayPal account.\n\nBy using PayPal, Squad doesn\\\u0027t have to bother with setting up and maintaining an expensive merchant account. In a sense, PayPal is renting their merchant account for a small fee per transaction which comes out of the $15 you\\\u0027re paying, not in addition to it.\n\nCheers!\n\nCapt\\\u0027n Skunky\n\nKSP Community Manager"},{"CreatedByName":"szpw","CreatedById":25964,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T21:49:17Z","Content":"Confusion was cleared up when I actually bought the game.\n\nI feel kind of silly now, but who cares!
