Too low for me. I also know that pure electron-positron annihilation produces velocities closer to 0.56c, which is what i need. Is there any possible way to magnetically store electrons on their own, or to supercharge normal matter with hundreds of electrons apiece and store\u00A0that?

To properly deal with the physical effects of such a weapon, of course the science get s very complex very quickly. Mainly because of the different types of energy released and the different effects they will have on the target. I think it is generally accepted that using E=Mc\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0to get an energy figure, and converting that into a TNT-equivalent-yield (you know, megatons, kilotons etc.), gives you an illustrative, if not precise, idea of the forces released.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it gets a little more complex (a lot more complex) because the energy is released in many different forms. Depending on the reaction, much of the energy can be carried away by uncharged particles, EM radiation or neutrinos, which are very difficult to utilize for thrust, because you cannot direct them or because they do not carry very much momentum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBussrd Ramjet: You get nothing for free with a ramjet, that \u201Cnudging\u201D will consume energy which will equate to drag. The maintenance of a huge wirseframe nozzle whole light-minutes ahead of your ship via beamed power will consume energy which will equate to drag. Compressing hydrogen that is whizzing through your engine at relativistic velocity will be problematic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in, you can hand-wave away some of the drag and justify (within your own universe) an improvement on the 0.2c, but getting it up to high relativistic speeds where time dilation is significant (lets say 0.7c and higher, as a minimum) is stretching the improvements quite far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSolar sails \u2013 IF you combine these with large, high power laser installations at departure and arrival, probably your best bet for realistic high-c travel.

The speed increase you get is not proportional to the mass of the body, but to its speed relative to you. You cant, for example arrive in a black hole system and use it to stop. But you can use it to change direction. Or if the hole was passing through another system at high speed, you could use it to help brake into that system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHOWEVER, if the hole is spinning rapidly (VERY rapidly, this can happen apparently, accordin to theory) then it may be possible to extract momentum from the ergosphere, where space is \u201Cspun\u201D or \u201Ctwisted\u201D by the hole.

However, I am not sure if any single body of mass can exist that close to a BH, maybe easier if it was a very, very large BH (which still [naturally] have very strong gravity near the event horizon, but the gradient can be very low, so it wont rip you apart.

Every kind of rocket becomes functionally equivalent! Because of relativity, if you store enough energy it\u0027ll always have a mass following e=mc2 and so always has a specific energy of c\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E at maximum. Assuming good conversion, no matter how we convert this energy to momentum it\u0027ll always make an Isp of c/g\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E. As a fun example, if we\u0027re ejecting a proton at near the speed of light, and we push all the energy from a 1gram matter/antimatter annihilation into it, that proton will become 1gram heavier! The net result is we\u0027ve taken 1gram off the ship and ejected it out the back at light speed. Alternatively, if you use the same energy to heat something up to white hot and launch photons out the back (photon rocket) you\u0027ll get an identical amount of momentum. This is called the Energy-Momentum relationship. That\u0027s kinda cool, so let\u0027s look at a handful of options which are at or near this hypothetical limit. *\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E* Naturally there may be stretches and gaps in technical abilities.

Spin up charged particles in a pair of large rings (LHC style). As you continue to load energy into them, the particles will stop having their normal rest mass, and will start becoming heavier and heavier according to e=mc\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E.\u00A0 Perhaps we could take the particles up to 0.95c, where they\u0027ll have 3x their original mass. This is actually very slow compared to modern day systems, but of course our future ship will have a great many more particles. Because they\u0027re going in circles, the particles will also release synchrotron radiation which would need to be reabsorbed as energy and fed back into the system constantly (using your thermoelectric generators perhaps). The exact nature of the synchrotron radiation depends heavily on the particle energy and size of the rings, but most of it would be in the form thermally absorbable photons in any case. As an additional wrinkle, in today\u0027s systems, there\u0027s also 10x the particles\u0027 energy stored in the magnetic fields required to keep the particles spinning, but hey... it\u0027s the future.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2.

I think even in the far future they\u0027d be a trick to store, but you could use them to make a stream of antimatter positrons (\u002B matter electrons) and launch them in the direction you want to travel. Then, your ship can follow the stream while using these particles for energy to accelerate the halfway there, and decelerate the halfway near the destination. It\u0027d require some astronomically precise \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.charfac.umn.edu/sem_primer.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eaiming, focusing and accelerating\u003C/a\u003E, but it would provide a convenient excuse for your characters to stop off in star systems every few dozen parsecs to make a new stream.

Conversion: Positrons could be guided\u00A0 and focused into a cavity in a thin walled chunk of Titanium. They would convert (annihilating with an electron from the metal) into a pair of gammas (high energy photons), which would escape the titanium and fly out in random directions. The Titanium would then recuperate lost the electron by absorbing one that was in the beam through a similarly focused electron beam or a superconducting wire... I doubt real titanium would stand up to this treatment, but it\u0027s a good stand in for some futuristic material that has amazing conductivity, low Z, and excellent refractive properties.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A03.

Keep a small blackhole (3 million metric tons) perhaps suspended in a magnetic field behind the ship?\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. The black hole will be constantly radiating erroneously high energy gamma rays and exotic particles (often short-lived).\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. If the black hole is held out the back end of the ship, its radiance could be caught and thermalized in an exceptionally refractory material (hopefully ~5000K) The heat would then get transferred to large and white-hot sails with carbon on one side and some polished white-body refractory (4000K) on the other. The carbon side of the sails would emit white light photons and create momentum as a photon rocket. If my sums are right, to achieve 1G acceleration on a black hole, we\u0027d need ~30TW of photon emission or about a square kilometer of carbon film at ~4000K. More likely, the sails would be several square km. That\u0027s big! This all assumes the ship is fairly light relative to its black hole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInterestingly, as the black hole evaporates it gets dramatically hotter! Its radiance goes up with the inverse square of its size, so if you think in terms of the rocket equation, by the time you\u0027ve gone 2c of deltaV, your black hole will be ~8x more intense!\u00A0 This could be a cool mechanic where your characters need to push their rocket farther than they intended and the excess power pushes them to uncomfortable accelerations while heating up the ship and punching holes in their sails. Then, before everything goes wahoony shaped they have to eject their warpcore! I mean... black hole. *ahem*.... Anyways, to prevent this people would probably do their best to keep the black hole fed, and how this would be done is pure speculation. Maybe shoot gammas back at it? The little sucker would be smaller than a nucleus and impossible to get normal matter close to due to its radiance. Also, I neglect neutrinos for these calculations. You may need to invoke a technomagical device that suppresses their formation, or alternatively a.... 1.5x smaller black hole with an Isp ~.5 - .8c/g\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E would also do.

Store huge quantities of antiHydrogen using magnetic confinement. As a gas the volume would necessarily be quite large, but as an alternative, there\u0027s some preliminary papers out there showing that you can make metastable Hydrogen metal, which could allow you to store larger masses of antiHydrogen in a normal space. Once again, you would use magnetic confinement, but for the metal it would be an entirely different and more efficient mechanism! Antihydrogen is a tricky material to create, both because it\u0027s hard to make antiprotons and, once made, it\u0027s hard to slow them down enough to form an atom with a positron (antielectron). Still, in the future, I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll have figured out these difficulties. The process would require an enormous energy source, again.

Here, if the matter we use is anything but hydrogen, you get tons of Neutrons liberated from the reaction, which will cause nearby things to become fissile and transmute a bit. If we go with Hydrogen however, there\u0027s some impressive energy losses to neutrinos. Fortunately neutrinos interact by the weak force, and those reactions are often chiral in a way that you can choose the direction the decay products go.... I\u0027m not 100% sure about this application, but it sounds right by the stories I\u0027ve read of CP violation. We may be able to make the neutrinos mostly go out the back. Maybe.
