As an airplane lover I really felt a lack of utility on creating atmospheric aircrafts despite being useful on running short distances to gather surface samples on the very beggining of your career. I really saw no need on building those gigantic and awesome airplanes. It would be even more awesome building those on career mode, where you would to plan and desing a even more efficient and better airplane then your casual \u0022sandbox jumbo\u0022. As a simple solution, I came up with the following idea:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMain idea:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdd \u0022Airports\u0022 around the surface of Kerbin capable of picking up or delivering Kerbals. It doesnt have to be too complex, just a runway and a \u0022terminal\u0022.Beyond the missons you receive form the Space center, you would have some \u0022passanger kerbals\u0022(as a new type of kerbal, like the Pilots, Engineers and Scientists, and now, Passanger)\u00A0on standby. Each kerbal would have a unique destination, and taking him to the \u0022airport\u0022 that he wants to go, would reward you with money. Further away the airport, more money you get.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPurpouse:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would encourage the player to build a better, saffer, more efficient\u00A0airplane and as a whole, creating an extra\u00A0purpouse for atmospheric aircrafts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECanon(?):\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo make the Kerbal passanger transport make sense as a whole, it would be a cool thing if we added something more beyond taking those random kerbals around Kerbin. It would make more sense if those airport were added next to a cluster of KerbNet Antennas in order to, in theory, keep the maintaince of those antennas. Also, there would have some bigger airports, which those, would be larger and contain a science only building\u00A0in it, so having more kerbals in it, would increase the income of science.\u00A0Taking scientists to an airport, would increase the amount of science income, and taking engineers, would increase the efficiency of the antennas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EConclusion to \u0022Canon(?)\u0022:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond transporting\u00A0Kerbal passangers that would give you money for that, you would have the option to take Scientists and Engineers too.\u00A0Taking scientists to an airport, would increase the amount of science income, and taking engineers, would increase the efficiency of the antennas\u00A0near that\u00A0airport.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-02-16T08:33:24Z\u0022 title=\u002202/16/2018 08:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 16, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by NukeZ\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EGrammar\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-16T11:45:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmay interest you:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed240940174\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/133545-13x-kerbin-side-gap/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:211px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any case a good baseline to compare your proposal\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NukeZ","CreatedById":185460,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-16T19:48:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223296507\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022170967\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221518781557\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166502\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spricigo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, Spricigo said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmay interest you:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed5307598053\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/133545-13x-kerbin-side-gap/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:211px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any case a good baseline to compare your proposal\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally interesting, never heard of that, thank you!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
