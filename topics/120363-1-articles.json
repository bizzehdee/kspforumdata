For instance, the various ways of driving the cutter-knife on a combine harvester. The \u0022wobble-box\u0022 wasn\u0027t obvious, and produced a reciprocating motion parallel to the input drive-shaft axis. Unfortunately, Massey-Ferguson build a wider header that overloaded the drive in heavier European crops.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then somebody posted about a new engine design that was canted, like the way the SSMEs were mounter in the Shuttle. Instead of the zero-gimbal thrust axis being aligned with the fuselage, it was slightly offset, because of the weight of the external tank. And then that mixed experience prompted an idea. Can something be made for KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe short answer is \u0022Yes\u0022. It is fairly simple, but is it worth it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you have are two identical components, a sort of special washer, a short cylinder. One end is perpendicular to the axis, the other is canted, perhaps by five degrees. If you want a five-degree shift in the thrust axis, that\u0027s all you need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it can all be a little more subtle than that. First, the two ends are both circles. That takes a little care with the design. And the centres are both on the axis. And you use two of them, sloped-end to sloped end. If the slopes are at 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 to each other, there no effect. If they\u0027re lined up, it goes to 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 cant. By varying the relative rotation, you vary the amount of cant. And rotating the two parts together varies the direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting the same cant on two different assemblies could be tricky. Maybe there need to be some indexing marks on the texture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone want to have a go? Perhaps the big advantage is that this wouldn\u0027t need a plug-in. But I would wonder if I could afford the increased parts-count.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-08T07:21:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUh.. are you asking for \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107407\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eangled fuel tanks\u003C/a\u003E?
