It was not an uncommon site these days, with large cargo ships hauling thousands of tons of cargo every day through that particular sea route. What was uncommon, was that this was no cargo ship. It could barely even be classified as a large yacht. Moreover, it was veering off it\u2019s route, ever so slightly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe are 20 nautical miles from the coast, captain.\u201D A gruff voice woke up Elias Kerman, the captain of the luxury yacht \u2018Virtual Insanity\u2019. He had slogged off for a decade for Morteks\u2019, one of the leading cargo ship companies in Kerbin before taking voluntary retirement and landing an easy gig.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAh, I see.\u201D Elias cleaned his glasses. \u201CI still don\u2019t get it. Of all the places for a vacation, why would you guys choose this Kraken-forsaken island? There\u2019s nothing but salty fish and saltier savages on here. I don\u2019t recall any docks that can accommodate a yacht this big on this island either\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s not a vacation, Captain, just a stop-over. We will hardly be here for a few days. And we wont need a dock. Just drop the anchor a few klicks off the coast.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah but -\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No buts. I believe you have the mental capacity to process an order by your superior.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022As you wish..\u0022 Elias decided not to probe further into the matter. It was none of his business anyways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E**********\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the din of the party that commenced some time later, no one noticed two kerbs throwing a big bag into the clear waters of the sea. No one heard the splash the bag made as it bobbed on the surface of the sea and then sunk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E**********\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kerbal was floating around in his consciousness. Drifting about in an endless void, with only his loneliness for company. \u003Ci\u003EThis feels really nice\u003C/i\u003E, he thought. \u003Ci\u003EMaybe I should stay here forever.\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t you ever give up!\u201D A voice jolted him out of his stupor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EWha-?

It is cruel, but- \u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut it\u2019s also beautiful, and we should strive to find the beauty in this wretched world.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EYes, we will!

It has been a smooth season so far, and he had every reason to be happy. At this rate, they will finally have full meals to eat in the winters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COld Kerb, ya seeing dis? Look at da size of dem fish!\u201D Lando, his first mate was attempting to lift a Ratfish about his size, but probably half his weight. \u201CI am tellin ya, dis will be tasting yummy when salted!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAye..\u201D Aidos was about to congratulate them when one of his crew shouted. \u201COIIIIII!!! A big catch! A effing big CATCH!!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd a big catch it was. The rusty old crane tasked to reeling in the nets were straining under the load of the fish this time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDis be one of dem Green Shrimpheads? What ya think?\u201D Lando was tensing up behind him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2018And with good reason.\u2019 Aidos thought. \u2018A mighty and huge fish like the Shrimphead weighed the same as a Kerbal, but had a ferocious bite and could breathe on land for a while.\u2019\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAight lads, ready the harpoons, just in case. Lando, reel in the catch on my mark.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe meager crew of four had their harpoons and crossbows ready and aimed, and at Aidos\u2019 signal, Lando reeled in the net.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA wriggling body bag fell with a thump on the deck. The wriggling stopped as soon as it made contact with the hard surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COIII!! A square FISH!!\u201D Lando exclaimed \u201CDis be a new speeshiez?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t be an idiot!\u201D Aidos took out a knife and sliced the bag, revealing a bloodied and bruised kerbal inside. The kerbal was still breathing, thankfully.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COi Oi\u2026 is that the\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes, he might be. Comrades!
