If you have one in your contracts list (for the Mun, perhaps), you cannot have another at the same time for anywhere else, no matter how you do it. There were bugs in the contract system for 1.1.3 that prevented Explore contracts from apearing, but that was fixed in 1.2. So you should definitely get them -- except that there is another rule that you can\u0027t get an Explore contract to do something you\u0027ve already done. If you\u0027ve already planted a flag on Minmus, you will never get another explore contract for Minmus. But the instant you complete one Explore contract, or let one expire in the contracts list without accepting it, you will immediately get another -- usually for some other destination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PTNLemay","CreatedById":30142,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-31T00:45:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you bewing, I wasn\u0027t aware of that.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI just need to finish the Mun one then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT:\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhere did the \u0022Mark question as answered\u0022 option go? \u00A0Isn\u0027t it usually somewhere in the original post?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-31T01:38:15Z\u0022 title=\u002210/31/2016 01:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by PTNLemay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
