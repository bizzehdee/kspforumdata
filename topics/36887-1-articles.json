That and the other equations you will readily see in physics have been derived from more-complicated equations using more advanced forms of mathematics. Look for calculus-based derivations of motion equations or something of the sort, I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll be able to find what you\u0027re looking for. That is, assuming your (1/2)at^2 equation is the simplified form of the displacement-time equation: x=xi\u002Bvidt\u002B(1/2)adt^2, if not, then I could be completely wrong haha.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-13T11:54:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mardlamock\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mardlamock\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi, i know this may sound stupid but, why is there a 1/2 in this 1/2at^2?.

You need to consider your speed at two times: at the start and at the end of the motion you are trying to measure. At the start, your speed is \u003Cem\u003Eat\u003C/em\u003E = a*0 = 0. At the end, your speed is \u003Cem\u003Eat\u003C/em\u003E = a*t. So, your average speed between 0 and t is \u003Cem\u003E1/2at\u003C/em\u003E.
