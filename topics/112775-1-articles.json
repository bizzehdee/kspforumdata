On the current rock, one drill provides 8.5u/second, enough to keep 17 converters occupied. As long as I don\u0027t let the ore tanks overflow, there will be zero mass loss -- resources are turned into ore at a 1:1 ratio, and ore becomes fuel at 1:1 as well. If I don\u0027t run the converter, the drill will stop once the ore bunker is full. If I do run the converter at the same time as the drill, I will lose 8 units of ore per second once the bunker is full.\n\nMy current testbed happens to be a tiny A-class: it\u0027s sucked dry so quickly that I can\u0027t do timewarp testing atm. But IIRC, the spillage on the E-class was on the order of 1400t lost, while 50t of fuel and 15t of ore have been produced. That would be ~96% losses. Not quite 16:17, but close enough."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T22:42:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If I don\u0027t run the converter, the drill will stop once the ore bunker is full.

But what happens when your fuel tanks fill up? Does that also cause ore loss?"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T04:12:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hmm, I wonder why that is when you get no overflow running the drills alone?\n\nThe drill runs for at least one time unit, producing a certain amount of ore. If that amount exceeds the free space in your tanks, you get spillage. Strictly speaking, every time you fill up the tank to 100% you may lose some ore. If you run the converter and the drill at the same time, this overstuffing happens several times per second, leading to considerable mass loss.\n\nWhat happens when the fuel tanks fill up? The converter stops, allowing the ore tank to fill up as well, thus stopping the drill.\n\nHowever, if you run the converter while consuming the output (e.g. fuel cells), you may also get spillage. Haven\u0027t tried that, though.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-13T05:04:58Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2015 05:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Laie**"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T05:34:26Z","Content":"Ah, thanks for the explanation."}]}
