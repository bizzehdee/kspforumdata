I am planing on mining ore on Minmus, moving the mined ore to kerbin station to convert it to fuel and then with SSTO land that fuel on Kerbin for credits. I tried with big orange tank and in VAB I saw that is roughly 2900 credits in fuel. My SSSTO that is capable to get to LKO take such a huge load and land takes roughly 4000 credits on fuel. Those 4000 are worst case scenarion landing it with 0 fuel in all tanks but still I believe it would cost me 2000-3000 fuel leaving me with very low margin yet big time investment in setting up infrastructure and to do a one pick up flight with SSTO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-15T13:56:37Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2016 01:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by seaces\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ForScience6686","CreatedById":144187,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-15T14:10:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot worth it, and some argue a fuel station in lko is not worth it either. \u00A0But I would recommend leaving it in lko for future missions and lower launch weights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-15T14:45:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYah, there\u0027s little economic point in mining ore in Kerbin system.\u00A0 That\u0027s not to say you can\u0027t make \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eany\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E cash out of it... but the amounts involved are small enough, and require so much of your time, that you might as well skip it and spend that time instead completing a well-chosen contract.\u00A0 Lots more cash for much less of your time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere ISRU makes a lot more sense is at other planets; if you can design a ship to arrive at the destination empty, and then refuel its tanks there, you can make the amount of payload you have to lift off Kerbin \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emuch\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E smaller, which seriously saves cash.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-15T14:52:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222515164\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022137002\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460729444\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022144187\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ForScience6686\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n35 minutes ago, ForScience6686 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot worth it, and some argue a fuel station in lko is not worth it either. \u00A0But I would recommend leaving it in lko for future missions and lower launch weights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use a lot of space stations (check my sig.) but thos space stations are to be set anywhere but LKO.
