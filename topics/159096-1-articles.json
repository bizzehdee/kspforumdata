I have been for about a decade now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe text of the novel is completed; the work is largely done. I am so pleased and proud that if you touched a pin to me I would positively pop. 125,000 words (minus a few) and tens of thousands of hours work - all done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy novel has been uploaded for review by a long list of trained/skilled/experienced science/writing/astronomy people; many of whom are published authors or work within the publishing industry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince you here - at the KSP forum - are equally important and special to me, I wanted to come on and share the book for you too. I have a small issue; that forum posts cannot link to anything profane. My writing is not Disney; it is designed to approximate real life, so by the strict rules of this forum I cannot post my novel here; it has swear words in it. Perhaps this will be an acceptable work-around:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey, guys! I saw a great novel posted on an astronomy forum! It\u0027s a mystery called \u0022The Burning Dark\u0022 and you can find it here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/ngms36e1mbu0oa5/The%20Burning%20Dark.pdf?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0066cc\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ngms36e1mb...0Dark.pdf?dl=0\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe post thread can be found here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.cosmoquest.org/showthread.php?164590-Text-of-Novel-The-Burning-Dark\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://forum.cosmoquest.org/showthread.php?164590-Text-of-Novel-The-Burning-Dark\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCool story, great characters and fine development.
