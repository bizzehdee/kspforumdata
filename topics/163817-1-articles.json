Chances are that people will spot if there an issue because the thread is old and, \u00A0if necessary moderators will take the appropriate measures. OTOH irrelevant threads that get necroed usually go back to rest by their own means.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn your specific case probably a new thread is the better approach. \u00A0The message you had seen was related to your life support mode, \u00A0I belive there is a [life support report] \u00A0provided by the nod where you can see what, and why, is happening to your crew. For more advice we need to know which mod are you using (and know something about it, \u00A0what might not be the case).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-29T22:04:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell the new thread is here, so let\u0027s just run with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI too have this issue.\u00A0 Sometimes a bunch of messages pop up on the screen from various sources, some mods, some stock (like transmitting science can create a lot of screen spam).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a buffer of these messages, and is there a way to go back through them?
