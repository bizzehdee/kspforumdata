When you make a part, you have to give the game a model with dimensions and a mass. What should the mass be? Well, you compute it based on the model\\\u0027s volume and the density.

That depends on the part\\\u0027s composition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompressed nitrogen is \u003Cem\u003Eway\u003C/em\u003E less dense than MMH, so a compressed nitrogen tank should be much lighter. But on the other hand, the specific impulse of MMH is much higher, so a thruster that runs on MMH should put out more thrust for the same fuel mass flow, or else consume less fuel for the same thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course this stuff matters. The numbers we have to put in part.cfg aren\\\u0027t just made up \u00E2\u20AC\u201D or rather, they shouldn\\\u0027t be. For the game to work properly and make sense, the numbers have to be derived from common constants, like densities and specific impulses and such. These can either be pure real-world values, or they can be scaled for the Kerboverse, but they have to be consistent. Otherwise parts don\\\u0027t work right together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve000","CreatedById":25343,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-16T00:06:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERotating helped thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECaptain, you think too much. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"azawada","CreatedById":17236,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-16T01:26:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid I say oxidized helium?
