I got some very good advice, and now I can competently build and fly SSTO\u0027s with FAR. About a week ago I started a new career save, and now i\u0027m getting to building some very large rockets for interplanetary probes. My problem is finding a good ascent profile that doesn\u0027t cause a flipout on rockets with little control and a lot of SRBs to save those sweet, sweet funds. So far (pun intended) i\u0027ve tried putting various sizes of b9 and stock fins on the bottom for control and doing my gravity turn at 1k meters. If I go easy enough on the turn, the rocket is intact but my ap always ends up at about 100k, far above the optimal 70k. If I try tipping over earlier in the ascent to flatten the trajectory, the payload starts to jiggle inside the fairing, and the fairing walls start to oscillate violently. This even happens when using FAR assists instead of SAS. If it manages to keep together from the sheer quantity of b9 struts I put on it, it will flip over and head for the ground. Please help. I can\u0027t seem to do an efficient ascent to orbit no matter what I do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tankbuster32","CreatedById":59371,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T16:45:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, STRUTS! second, your ascent profile should be a smooth curve, much like in real life. This is because it reduces efficiency loss from burning off-vector, and also because it\u0027s very benign for the rocket compared to turining over like in stock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T18:49:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I used to launch rockets in KSP and not use SSTO space planes to haul my cargo into space. I would use struts, a fair number of them. Or I would use the auto strut feature with the procedural fairings. Start your gravity turn at 100m/s or 1km which ever happens first, and ease into the turn, so by the time you are at 20km you should be about 10-15deg above the horizon in flight. Never push past the actual prograde flight marker just ease into it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kcs123","CreatedById":127158,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T18:59:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor large rockets with FAR you may want to have rocket that does not go at supersonic speed until you altitude is close to 10km. You have already found that is difficult to control rocket if you dou it otherwise. Go with subsonic speed until you reach 10km then speed up and start turning. Not very efficient way to put rocket in space, but it is safer with unforgiving FAR aerodynamic forces.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T19:04:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExactly what KCS123 said, at launch you want your TWR close to 1.2-1.4 at most.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BrotatoSalad","CreatedById":119211,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-29T17:23:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk wow.
