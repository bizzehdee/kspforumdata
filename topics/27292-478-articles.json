Design of the Ceres V booster is in progress: estimated mass is around 1000t, but only the uppermost stage is complete. I was reminded a couple times of the evilness of the rocket equation: I have separate Duna landing and Kerbin return heatshields (the Duna heatshield will be ejected during landing). It also lacks a Kerbin return parachute: I determined that it would be just about break-even to skip the \u0027chute and rendezvous with a mobile lab in orbit, and the other difficulties inherent in a return direct to Kerbin\u0027s surface made up my mind for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027d be a lot more efficient with some LV-Ns, but I\u0027ve made up my mind: I\u0027m going to get my next batch of science from Duna, and that means chemical rockets only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2lusCRh.png\u0022 alt=\u00222lusCRh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-27T21:40:12Z\u0022 title=\u002211/27/2014 09:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starman4308\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-27T23:27:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo pics yet, but I finished my Boeing X-37b replica. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Now to make the \u0027c\u0027 crew version.
