Although the approach and theoretical orbit looks good and tight, only after I fire my engine it tells me I have a couple of minutes burn time, there\u0027s no figure before I fire so it\u0027s impossible to do a half and half burn, the time is too long anyway, I\u0027d expect well under a minute.\n\nI realise I must be missing something, can anyone tell me where I\u0027m going wrong.\n\nThanks in advance for any input.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T18:53:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 06:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shotza**"},{"CreatedByName":"Invader Jim","CreatedById":142312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T18:27:32Z","Content":"Do a really quick engine tap on and then off and that usually will make it display time.

Which mean that it is estimated once you have started to burn. This is expected behavior.\n\nThe usual way to deal with that is, for long burn, to do a quick burn before the manoeuvre node, let\u0027s say 2 minutes before, and then you get the information required to precisely start your actual burn when you should (half the time of the burn before the node).\n\nIf your burn is really too long, you can (if you want) do it in two parts. A first burn with half the required delta-V, which make you stay in elliptic orbit with a high Ap, then you do a complete orbit and burn again when you are back at your initial position to actually leave your planet.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T18:54:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 06:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by haltux**"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T18:49:46Z","Content":"Yeah, the problem is that the game is more simpleminded about your acceleration ability than you might think:\n\n- It doesn\u0027t know what sort of acceleration your ship can do until you actually accelerate. (For example, it doesn\u0027t look at \u0022okay, here are your currently active engines, here\u0027s their rated thrust, here\u0027s your current mass, I\u0027ll just do some trivial math.\u0022 Why it doesn\u0027t do that, I have no idea. Seems like it would be really easy to code.)\n\n- Even after you activate the engines, it only remembers the info for the duration of the current \u0022flight session\u0022. If you switch to another ship and then come back, it forgets. (Again, no idea why... even if there\u0027s some good reason it couldn\u0027t calculate, surely asking it to remember one number wouldn\u0027t be asking too much.)\n\n- And it only remembers the highest acceleration you\u0027ve actually done, not what you *could* do. e.g. if you switch to a ship and thrust at 25% throttle, it\u0027ll only remember that; the estimated-burn-time isn\u0027t smart enough to realize \u0022you could accelerate 4 times faster than that if you floored it.\u0022\n\n- And it doesn\u0027t allow for things that affect your acceleration, e.g. you do some thrust, it remembers your acceleration, then you decouple some dead weight. It doesn\u0027t realize you can accelerate faster now.\n\n...So all of that makes for an experience like you\u0027ve observed. A brief tap of the engines at full throttle will do the trick (at least, until you switch away from the current vessel and it \u0022forgets\u0022 again.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-02T20:34:36Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2015 08:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shotza","CreatedById":145972,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T18:52:32Z","Content":"Thanks for the info.

Try launching an unmanned satellite to get geo sync with heavy fuel load and doing a flight computer pro-grade burn when out of contact. OMG. 45 seconds you say? OK, setting for 45s.... Wait, wait, wait. Computer kicks in, starts burning, the seconds on the \u0022estimated time\u0022 on maneuver node go by exponentially faster as the ship loses fuel, while my flight computer is just using \u0022normal/real\u0022 seconds. So 22.5 seconds into burning, computer wants to burn for another 22.5s, but estimated burn time is down to around 17seconds already... ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"moronwrocket","CreatedById":134908,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T22:44:04Z","Content":"Get Kerbal Engineer Redux, and Kerbal Alarm Clock.
