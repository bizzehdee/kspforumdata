Both players then run their respective programs against eachother and race each other for firsts just like the cold war. then as they go on one side may complete stuff faster than the other and come up with better designs so maybe you can contract with each other and when it happens you can use that players craft that you contracted for , and then also have joint contracts like the ISS or something, just an idea, I also wouldn\u0027t mind a single player version with an AI, thoughts? if anyone could make a mod like that if squad isn\u0027t interested then please do!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skyler4856","CreatedById":76452,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-31T01:48:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps a time limit, utilizing the contract system, to generate money\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jumin121","CreatedById":98333,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-02T17:44:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a whole discussion of facebook with everyone on a comment for KSP, there could be tons of possibilities with this, does anyone have an idea?, someone said it might be possible with dark MP\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shna_na","CreatedById":14950,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-03T22:07:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMultiplayer would essentialy be this, but much better.

You can imagine working together in space (or EVA together like in moon-base alpha) with other players to achieve common goal with other guys giving you directions from mission control. also mission control could take responsibilities of a server admin and game master (bit like in D\u0026amp;D... \u0022this mission it\u0027s going too smooth... maybe I add some unexpected failure\u0022) controlling the scenario and telling the story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso cold war wasn\u0027t best possible source of motivation for space exploration, and history shows it failed miserably after it lost it\u0027s political value.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-03T23:54:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2014 11:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by karolus10\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-04T00:18:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shna_na\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Shna_na\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMultiplayer would essentialy be this, but much better.
