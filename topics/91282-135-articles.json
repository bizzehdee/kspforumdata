Most aircraft with canards have engines to propel them and allows recovery from stall condition. On gliders, this is a very serious matter.\u00A0Most aircraft use a horizontal stabilizer on the tail to maintain stability. Let\u0027s take an example of\u00A0Cessna. With the center of gravity ahead of the wing\u0027s center of lift, the aircraft wants to pitch nose-down. However, the horizontal stabilizer on the tail acts as a mini-wing, generating lift downwards (called\u00A0tail down force) and pitching the nose back up.\u00A0The canard is essentially moves the horizontal tail up to the nose section, and places the wing\u0027s center of lift behind the center of gravity. To balance the natural nose down tendency, the canard generates an upward lifting force - which helps oppose weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHOWEVER,\u00A0If canards were that simple, every aircraft would use them. Aerodynamics are\u00A0never\u00A0that simple. Things get complicated in a stall.\u00A0On a Cessna, if the wing stalls before the tail, you\u0027ll still have elevator controllability to pitch down. If the tail stalls before the wing, the aircraft will naturally pitch down. In either case, stall recovery is natural. However, if your aircraft has a canard instead of a tail-mounted horizontal stabilizer, you\u0027re in real trouble if the wing stalls first. In this case, the center of gravity would drop the wing and tail, pitching the nose up. The aircraft now enters a deeper stall and becomes unrecoverable, and you\u0027re screwed. To solve this,\u00A0You need to make sure that the wing is always further away from the critical angle of attack than the canard. You can accomplish this by using a larger wing on the aircraft. This ensures that the wing never gets close to it\u0027s critical angle of attack before the canard stalls. However, this larger wing adds weight and drag, reducing the design\u0027s efficiency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCanards can also make an airplane unstable. Simply put, if a wind gust briefly increases the angle of attack on a Cessna, the aircraft tends to pitch nose down and return to it\u0027s original attitude. In the Cessna\u0027s case, the increased angle of attack increases the wing\u0027s lift. However, it actually decreases the tail down force, because it decreases the horizontal stabilizer\u0027s angle of attack.\u00A0However, the canard can actually make your aircraft pitch up further. The increase in angle of attack causes both the canard and the wing to generate more lift. If the canard\u0027s increase in lift is greater than the wing\u0027s, the nose will pitch further up.\u00A0To solve this problem, designers use\u00A0high wing loading\u00A0on the canard. This means that the canard generates more lift per square foot than the wing. At high wing loading, an increase in angle of attack causes a smaller increase in lift than at low wing loading. But here\u0027s the downside - high wing loading generates more induced drag. To counter this, designers often use a high aspect ratio canard - which means it\u0027s long and narrow. That decreases the drag, but makes a large canard hard to build.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-10-05T14:07:01Z\u0022 title=\u002210/05/2019 02:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 5, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by ARS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-14T07:52:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould you have easier access to space on a habitable planet smaller than Earth?

Is it geometrical complexity of 3D object? the textures? or special effects? Let\u0027s take an example of Call of Duty 1, which is a very lightweight game for current generation PCs. On high-end NVIDIA GPU, it\u0027s simply overkill to run it, but let\u0027s say we take for example Intel HD integrated graphic GPU (still a bit overkill, but insufficient for AAA games expecially newer CoD). If we increase the 3D object complexity (So a pineapple grenade no longer an egg-shaped 3d object, but actually have grooves like actual grenade, tank hulls have rivets, etc.) without improving textures and effects (so the grenade is still just plain dark green object, smoke and explosion effect still the same, no lighting whatsoever), will it still run fine on integrated graphic? Does 3D complexity has minimal or substantial impact on GPU load?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
