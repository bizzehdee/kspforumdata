So, time to revive the air races.\n\nRules:\n\n\\* Separate leaderboards for stock vs FAR.\n\n\\* Stock parts only.\n\n\\* Kerballed HOTOL aircraft, jet engines only. No rockets (RAPIERs okay; even in oxidising mode, they won\u0027t outrace a low-altitude jet).\n\n\\* Usual spaceplaner mods are fine (*Kerbal Flight Data, Kerbal Pilot Assistant, Kerbal Flight Indicators, Dynamic Deflection*, etc), but no obvious hacks or cheats. If in doubt, ask; obey Wheaton\u0027s Law at all times.\n\n\\* Aircraft must begin stationary on the runway, facing east as per usual.\n\n\\* Don\u0027t use the \u0022spool up engines with intakes closed, open intakes for instant 100% power\u0022 exploit. Spooling up the jets while the wheel brakes are on is fine, but once the jet overpowers the brakes it\u0027s time to start flying.\n\n\\* Post screenshots or video documenting the key parts of your run (before takeoff, making the turn through the mountain passes, landing and stopping).\n\n\\* Your time is your elapsed mission time after your plane is once again completely stationary on the runway. Make sure that this time is visible in your final screenshot.\n\n\\* Keep it below 5,000m for the entire flight; the idea is to go *through* the mountain passes, not over them.\n\n\\* No parachutes.\n\n\\* Keep all heat/drag/aero/etc settings at default levels. This applies to stock as well as FAR.\n\nThe first course is as shown below; \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/fSa7f)\n\nTake off, turn around, head to the mountains. As you get close, an extra-pointy peak will appear from nowhere. Fly through the V-shaped pass to the right of that, then pull hard left to come around the peak (below its summit, hence the 5,000m altitude cap). Then, back to KSC and land.\n\n**Leaderboards**\n\n**Stock**\n\nFlipNascar, 3:23\n\nJuzeris, 2:37 (off-course)\n\n**FAR**\n\nPhearlock, 2:57\n\nWanderfound, 4:23\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T01:25:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 01:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound**"},{"CreatedByName":"FlipNascar","CreatedById":137605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T06:56:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ll bite!\n\u003E \n\u003E 3m 59s with the FFP-A.

Main issue was slowing down enough for landing (the high AoA capability of delta wings helped out a lot in that regard).\n\nIn terms of top speed, aircraft could easily accelerate to 1490 m/s, though that was basically suicide in terms of reentry heating at this altitude.\n\nSkimped a bit on the fuel. Most wing surfaces had maximized strength/weight ratios except the vertical stabs, which were left at around 0.8-1.0\n\nSlats and engine gimbal were toggled on/off for takeoff and the single left hand turn to improve turn performance.\n\nCould possibly shave off a bit more if I resorted to the stock airbrakes, as those are somewhat more powerful than the FAR ones, but that would cause issues for deploying them above 1000 m/s\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/K70GrEvhQxQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T00:16:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 12:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Phearlock**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T23:03:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Here\u0027s another FAR entry for you. 2:58\n\u003E Edit: I realize I flew through the wrong pass, haha, oh well, I think the time between the two would be pretty similar, as taking the pass on the left meant I needed to slow down more to make the turn.\n\nThanks for the entry, but that one\u0027s going to need a re-do on the right route.
