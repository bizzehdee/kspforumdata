Can this mod take into account the fuel-intake ratios of the currently running engines? I can see this being useful in designs that are not made for a specific purpose only, such as reusable crafts where they may be forced to cross through an atmospheric area more than once or twice in a single flight. This way they are not stuck with loss of engine usage, but still having excess fuel of the wrong type in the tanks, and having to find a way to dump it all manually.
