A new addition to my not-so-peaceful skunkworks thread. As I said for the Punchball, recently I have begun applying a new design philosophy to my military fleet: A durable warship that can take damage and keep on fighting. This time, I present a light destroyer, that, at 60 tons, can do very decent light escort duties:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/3WfIU36\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3WfIU36.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223WfIU36.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow is she more durable than any other ship, you say? Well, my solutions are varied. The first one is pretty much a passive mostly unintended feature: it has a damn small cross section no matter which way you approach it! I had trouble hitting it with RCS smart missiles in testing due to that, and I shudder at the thought of trying to guide a high T/W torpedo from far out. Then, of course, it\u0027s armored. The armor is placed in small chunks with a slight inclination so there is some shock absorbing capability without jumping the part count unreasonably high (it\u0027s high enough as it is for such a small ship), and you don\u0027t lose it all if it is shaken off. But we all know with a big enough torpedo all armor is useless. So what do you do when a SRB has just riped through your hull like it\u0027s tissue paper? Well, you literally pick up the pieces and move on. Every pod in the ship is actually an independent craft with RCS subsystem and docking ports, so you can re-dock them to the biggest fuel tank you find in the debris filed. Then you grab the engines, which are mounted on similarly independent pods, and figure out a symmetric stable-ish arrangement for your new drive system. Then you grab some of the weapons still floating around out there, and go deliver some rightful vengeance on the guys that just made you do all that salvaging work. Enjoy blowing it up bit by bit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/31mGTXy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/31mGTXy.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002231mGTXy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor weapons, they are a bit on the light side. Four prow-mounted lance torpedoes are the main anti-ship armament (because having an I-beam rammed at you at a minimum of 750m/s is sure to guarantee a bad day), while the ring of six smart RCS missiles are there mostly for fighter defense (though they can do light damage to big ships). But hey, destroyers are supposed to be light fast ships that go after soft targets after all, right? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, it includes a launcher, but let me tell you, although I like the aesthetics of it, it\u0027s not the easiest way to get to space. Just aim really high, and once the last stage runs out, make sure you have upwards of 350m/s vertical speed and keep it pointed at 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA. Then go get coffee, it\u0027ll take a while to inch your way to orbit. Please don\u0027t mention efficiency at this point ^^\u0027. Oh, and the only modded part is kerbal engineer redux, but since this is going to my mod thread, I figured I wouldn\u0027t take it out... you know, I can just say less than 1% of the ship is non-stock \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIMGUR ALBUM:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/aYdCI\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
