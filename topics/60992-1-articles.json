You can set tanks to automatically pump fuel to lower level tanks whenever possible, or balance between tanks at the same level. Uses include refueling tanks at space stations that automatically top off the tanks of any vessels as soon as they dock with the station, refueling vessels with higher level pumps that automatically refuel the space station as soon as they dock, setting up fuel balancing while building a plane and having it saved with the plane and done completely automatically in flight, setting up more complicated fuel flow patterns for asparagus-like situations without fuel lines for fuel types that don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t normally flow that way (e.g. monopropellant and xenon gas), and many other uses!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118176\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGet the newest version from this thread!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis plugin requires ModuleManager to automatically add the pump to all tanks. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGet ModuleManager here\u003C/a\u003E.

The particular case I have is the FASA Gemini orbital parts (one engine with LF/O/mono, the command pod with mono, and the nose RCS block with mono). Only the engine and the RCS block have the GoodSpeed pump, configured to pump mono only. The RCS block is set at 0, the LF/O/mono part is set at 1, and has pump enabled. The command pod does not have the module, since it\u0027s excluded by the ModuleManager configuration. However, when I separate parts, both the RCS and the command pod have full tanks.
