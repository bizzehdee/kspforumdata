But that was mostly about possible exploits and nested cargo bays.\n\u003E Now, I wouldn\u0027t think that *any* aerodynamics model is going to like clipped parts, since we want it as intuitive as possible, and *intuitively or realistically* you can\u0027t have matter inside matter. It really all depends on how Harv chooses to simulate airflow. (That is, if we\u0027re just dealing with maths or if the code is taking, essentially, a snapshot of the craft and deciding how the air would flow around it. I\u0027m betting maths.)\n\nIm MAJORLY hoping that clipped wings will still work. If not, every single sci-fi replica will die, since i NEED clipped wings and control surfaces for half of these replicas to work. Yes it isnt realistic, but neither are sci-fi replicas and in general futuristic stuff. Also, its most likely a 50/50 chance. on one hand, it is unrealistic (not that i care), but on the other hand its WAY WAY WAY more hardware intensive to do dynamic modeling of wings. Worst case theyll make them shielded if inside another part, but there will most likely be ways to glitch this so its not visible but game thinks its outside (such as wings inside a open cargo bay, with another cargo bay covering the open side).\n\nStill, im so keeping 0.90 forever as there are just way too many epic builds i have that either rely on the overpowered jets to pull off crazy feats (laythe roundtrip with a single 150 LF fuel tank), or relying on clipping wings inside hulls. \n\nI know theres a large subvset of the community that probably hates me for enjoying overpowered parts and clipping, but if you arent at all interested in replicating real life, then this stuff comes in handy."},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T03:56:17Z","Content":"SteamDB linux update, probably the others will follow soon."},{"CreatedByName":"Mischief","CreatedById":105311,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T03:58:02Z","Content":"So is there some actual \u0027Countdown\u0027 announcement or was that just a pointless tease?"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T04:03:47Z","Content":"Well, that\u0027s a pretty big version ID jump that they made.\n\n\\*wonders if Scott Manley is one of those testing 1.0\\*\n\nHas he done experimentials testing for previous versions?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-17T04:26:51Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2015 04:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by smjjames**\n  \nScott, not Steve, lol"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T04:19:48Z","Content":"I am excited for this new aero."},{"CreatedByName":"tygoo7","CreatedById":57345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T04:25:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well, that\u0027s a pretty big version ID jump that they made.\n\u003E \\*wonders if Steve Manley is one of those testing 1.0\\*\n\u003E \n\u003E Has he done experimentials testing for previous versions?\n\nAre you talking about Scott Manley?"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T04:26:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Are you talking about Scott Manley?\n\n\\*facepalm\\*\n\nYes, Scott Manley.
