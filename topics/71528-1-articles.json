My son has a quad core AMD FX he\u0027s overclocked from 3.2GHz to 5.5GHz, on a five pound copper heatsink and the most evil electrothermal core heat exchanger I\u0027ve ever built! An entire 4cm^2 of Peltier heat pump running on 7V (should be 5V), for an idle gradient of over 50C. You bet that puppy\u0027s sealed with plastic caulk as well! And you can have all the RAM you like, unless you\u0027re running Linux and 64-bit Unity, you\u0027re gonna hit the 4GB wall.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
