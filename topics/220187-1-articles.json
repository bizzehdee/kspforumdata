I\u0027m pretty sad right now. I just did a short research project attempting to see if the USSR could have realistically landed on the Moon before the US... and it\u0027s more grim than I could ever imagine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStarting from this astronautix page here,\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.astronautix.com/r/russiawhydisethemoonrace.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.astronautix.com/r/russiawhydisethemoonrace.html\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0I went through the reasons and then tried to figure out how they could be resolved. I did this because I felt the author of that page, Mark Wade, \u0027s final assessment that if only the USSR \u0022started in \u002761, built the N1 to the original plan (24 engines instead of 30), and quote, had the full backing of the Soviet state\u0022 the USSR could have landed first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot only was the 24 engine N1 unlikely to be more reliable than the 30 engine one, but \u0022had the full backing of the Soviet state\u0022 is literally the easiest thing ever easier said than done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSumming up his reasons why they lost and trying to resolve them, I found this-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPoor management and quality control was an issue, but this was endemic to the Soviet system. Without literal magic, there is no way to change it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLack of political support is an issue, but even if Khrushchev got around the high cost of the program himself, the military was always going to be opposed because it was a distraction to the massive nuclear arms buildup. To provide an example, the first four Soyuz vehicles were supposed to be built in 1964 at a cost of 80 million rubles, Korolev only got 30 million.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLack of focus from the Chief Designers on the Moon was an issue. This isn\u0027t too hard to imagine actually. If Gemini caused someone to think up Voskhod, and the Mercury 13\u0027s appearance in US media influenced the decision to fly Tereshkova, it\u0027s not that hard to imagine the Chief Designers properly responding in 1961. But then #2 gets in the way- cost and other priorities.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPoor decision making was an issue. For a counterfactual, I didn\u0027t see this as too much of an issue on the part of the civilian politicians and chief designers, but getting the military to agree is pretty much impossible.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe N1 itself was a major problem, and the UR-700 or R-56 would have been better. But Korolev had too much clout, and I think even if he died earlier, Mishin would have been able to push the N1 through to approval. No first stage test stand would be built due to lack of funding, and therefore the first stage was always going to have major issues.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nastronautix listed \u0022bad luck\u0022 as a problem. I didn\u0027t have a problem handwaving this away in my counterfactual, but Korolev\u0027s death was impossible to prevent without preventing him from being sent to the Gulag- and perhaps changing the course of the Soviet space program- and no amount of luck could get around a lack of funding.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was really looking forward to a realistic counterfactual in which the Space Race continued. For All Mankind is borderline fantasy, IMO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly, this isn\u0027t possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was thinking of turning to the 1990s to see if the Energia program could continue and lead to a lunar landing, but it seems pretty unlikely. No one really wanted to go to the Moon in the 20th century, even Apollo was a sort of \u0022Kennedy memorial\u0022 rather than something people wanted to do (in fact, Quest magazine had an interesting counterfactual written by Asif Siddiqi, the author of the book I used as the primary source for my research, in which Kennedy survives assassination and goes on to cancel the Apollo program later in the decade due to it being too expensive).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIronically, Siddiqi calls the outcome of the Soviet lunar program \u0022not inevitable\u0022 in the coda of the book (Challenge to Apollo). But it\u0027s hard to see how the N1, or any 1960s Soviet crewed lunar program, could have succeeded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022;.;\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not quite ready to give up though. I\u0027m gonna being working hard to create a compelling world in which the Soviets landed first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and to elaborate on the title, Ron D. Moore, creator of For All Mankind, claims the Soviets could have landed on the Moon if Korolev survived his surgery. It was unlikely he could. The surgery was not \u0022botched\u0022 as Moore claimed in an interview. Korolev was very sick and had been in poor health through the decade prior to his demise, with a lot of stress brought on by the myriad of tasks associated with running the space program. He had a tumor the size of a fist around his pelvis. The Minister of Health of the USSR himself operated on him, albeit short staffed. The operation was actually completed successfully, he died 30 minutes later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-24T10:38:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nits an ok space show, its only down side is its dreamed up by people from the united states of california. the desire to edit history is just too strong for them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DDE","CreatedById":146349,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-24T12:15:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224332895\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022220187\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221698140356\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022206402\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SunlitZelkova\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, SunlitZelkova said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo provide an example, the first four Soyuz vehicles were supposed to be built in 1964 at a cost of 80 million rubles, Korolev only got 30 million.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022B29A69EC-4B57-4236-869F-C0A7F7AB7142.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022106.67\u0022 height=\u0022800\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://dpru.obs.ru-moscow-1.hc.sbercloud.ru/images/article/2019/03/30/B29A69EC-4B57-4236-869F-C0A7F7AB7142.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221644372083695.3298.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002268.75\u0022 height=\u0022665\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://static.life.ru/publications/2023/1/19/1644372083695.3298.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022First time?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-24T13:31:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, the premise is a fun one, but not realistic.
