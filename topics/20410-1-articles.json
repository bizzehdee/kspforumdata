It\u0027s pretty lengthy to describe. As far as RCS jetpacks go, press R while you\u0027re on EVA (by default) and the little guy will grab the controllers and you can fly around (in space) with WASD for directions and shift/control for up/down translation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERovers are mods. Check out the mod forum and the \u0022Carts\u0022 mod pack. You might have to search for it. It\u0027s under Plugin-Powered Mods.

There\u0027s a link to the playlist in my signature, but there\u0027s only one tutorial at the moment.

I hope you enjoy your newfound space program abilities!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the jetpacks, when controlling a kerbanaut you can toggle the jetpack on/off by pressing \u0022r\u0022 (or at least that\u0027s the default key). You\u0027ll see the character deploy the jetpack commands and then you can steer him using the same keys you use to steer the ship and its throttle. It doesn\u0027t handle quite like a ship, more like a normal FPS, but you\u0027ll quickly get used to it. Just try small maneuvers at first, lest you fly away from the ship. Right-clicking on your kerbal will also show you the remaining jetpack fuel (which recharges when you board the ship again).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rovers, like many unusual pieces and functions, are usually made using add-ons.

The how to forum has a tutorial on how to install add-ons. If that\u0027s not the one, have a look around the add-on forum to find the vehicle of your dreams. That being said, it\u0027s also possible, with some patience, to make a rover with the stock pieces, using the plane landing gear. They\u0027re a bit more explosion-prone than add-on rovers though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the moon, have a look at the orbital mechanics 101 tutorial, it\u0027s got a chapter about that that can probably explain it better than me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-26T17:17:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Pandi, welcome to the community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can find the carts \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/7854-PLUGIN-PART-0-16-Carts-v1-34-Cruise-Control-Compatibility-and-More\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E if you haven\u0027t already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there is a much heavier version available \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/20286-PLUGIN-PART-0-17-BobCat-Ind-Release-DEMV\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
