And you can get much better info by tweaking the display from the low-res scan. Change it to the multi-color mode and solid patches.

For instance, in my current test sandbox game, Kerbin\u0027s highest concentration (7 .5%) is in the shore biome. However, some of the islands, which are mostly shore biome, show up as having 20% or more on the low-res map. But when you get there with the NBS, they show the usual 7.5% for shore biome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ground sensor gives reports by biome, works without having doen the low-res orbital scan first, but doesn\u0027t give you context of how that compares to other biomes. The NBS shows you a map divided up by biomes and shows the concentration in each, but isn\u0027t permanent and only works after you do the low-res orbital scan. The NBS, however, works perfectly well on the ground as well as in flight and low orbit, and it thus makes the ground scanner somewhat redundant, except on mining vehicles to make sure you\u0027re really in the desired biome before you start mining, as determined previously by the NBS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brotoro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Brotoro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003EDeveloping Duna - Part 6.5\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy current research is roughly paralleling yours and is coming to essentially similar conclusions.

I\u0027ve run into this bug several times recently, where I return to a ship that had previously had its chutes repacked, only to have them pop out when I start to move the ship...without having pressed the related action group key. This is especially embarrassing when the ship is trying to take off to space and ends up dragging its chutes behind.

It\u0027s even visible from orbit, or at least you can see a hill that it\u0027s near. It seems likely that you\u0027ll find an artifact there that emits an audio signal that contains encoded pictures. Rather than return to Barsoom Base, we want you to boost your rover to the BANT 6 in polar orbit for refueling, then land by the mystery hill. Nelemy will be doing the same with the Lander Hab, so you can set up for some longerterm exploration of the polar cap that you\u0027ve been asking to do.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHellou: \u0022What about Emi back in Lesser Helium? Is she going to come as well?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThompbles: \u0022No. The DunaDog isn\u0027t useful that far south because of the low sunlight angle. She\u0027s still continuing the survey you set her to doing, and when she\u0027s done with that I\u0027m going to have her continue with the testing of the long-distance capabilities of the DunaDog.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStep 1 was to have Nelemy fly the Lander Hab up from Barsoom Base to the BANT 6 nuclear tug in its 88\u00B0 inclination near-polar orbit. This is inconvenient because your have to wait for the plane of the orbit to align with the launch site, but it\u0027s easier to be more fuel efficient than when LANDING from polar orbit. When landing, your ship will likely be in position along its to land when the orbit is not quite lined up with the landing spot...so there usually needs to be a small plane shift before landing. But when launching, you can wait until the launch site is exactly lined up with the orbital plane, then launch into a lower orbit than the target. Then all you need to do is wait until it\u0027s time for the transfer burn to rendezvous (or you can use a phasing orbit if you are in a hurry).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the second image below, the Barsoom Base site is just about to line up with the BANT 6\u0027s orbit (seen edge on).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022zbPLqEq.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zbPLqEq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Q2cXDLM.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Q2cXDLM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow we see the launch of the Lander (oops...paying too much attention to lining up the orbit, so I forgot to retract the antenna and ladder), and the boost to orbit (after some quick retracting).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022GbPGM35.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GbPGM35.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe BANT 6 nuclear tug was fortuitously located in a good spot along its higher orbit, so Nelemy was able to perform the rendezvous transfer less than one orbit later.
