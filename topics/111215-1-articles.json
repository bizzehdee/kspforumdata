Unfortunately there does not seem to be a hard and fast way to reproduce the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using MechJeb, KER \u0026amp; Kerbal Alarm Clock (all up to date versions).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue is that when setting up nodes with MechJeb and instructing it to execute the node it will orientate itself but not auto-warp to the time. This is the first hint that my squid (its no Kraken) is going to occur.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;When I manually warp to time the node will not execute, either via MechJeb or manual throttle, unless I toggle either the fuel or oxidizer off/on at or after the node. The engine will then fire (sounding pretty rough) and the burn will run as planned. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes the fuel toggle will not fix it and then I\u0027ll toggle the engine off/on. It that doesn\u0027t fix it them cycle back to KSC and then back to the vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else had this issue? Is there anywhere in the debug that I can pull info from?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChris\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtra info: I\u0027ve noticed on here (recent threads) that attaching ports to tanks radially can cause similar problems. I\u0027ve also had the odd vessel with the phantom acceleration even with no engines running (again no reliable way to replicate the problem). I\u0027ve since scavenged all the fuel from these tanks and de-orbited/destroyed them.
