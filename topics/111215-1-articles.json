Unfortunately there does not seem to be a hard and fast way to reproduce the problem.\n\nI\u0027m using MechJeb, KER \u0026 Kerbal Alarm Clock (all up to date versions).\n\nThe issue is that when setting up nodes with MechJeb and instructing it to execute the node it will orientate itself but not auto-warp to the time. This is the first hint that my squid (its no Kraken) is going to occur.  \n  \nWhen I manually warp to time the node will not execute, either via MechJeb or manual throttle, unless I toggle either the fuel or oxidizer off/on at or after the node. The engine will then fire (sounding pretty rough) and the burn will run as planned. \n\nSometimes the fuel toggle will not fix it and then I\u0027ll toggle the engine off/on. It that doesn\u0027t fix it them cycle back to KSC and then back to the vessel.\n\nHas anyone else had this issue? Is there anywhere in the debug that I can pull info from?\n\nCheers,\n\nChris\n\nExtra info: I\u0027ve noticed on here (recent threads) that attaching ports to tanks radially can cause similar problems. I\u0027ve also had the odd vessel with the phantom acceleration even with no engines running (again no reliable way to replicate the problem). I\u0027ve since scavenged all the fuel from these tanks and de-orbited/destroyed them. Will see if that sorts the problem.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T10:25:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 10:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ChrisD**\n  \nRemoving the   \ns \u0026 adding info"},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisD","CreatedById":144851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T05:30:16Z","Content":"So this problem is still afflicting my vessels, although I have found a funny workaround.\n\nYou can tell if the issue is going to strike if you engage MechJeb to \u0027Create \u0026 Execute\u0027 a node. The vessel will orientate but not time accelerate to the node. If I have more than one fuel tank on-board (that has some fuel in it) by switching off either the LF or O then the time warp will kick in and the node will be executed."}]}
