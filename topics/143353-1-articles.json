I never really tried those wheels due to the lack of a perceived reason to use them, as well as the difficulty of inserting objects of that size into orbit. So when I recently tried them out on Kerbin and other bodies, a few oddities struck me. First of which is that their motors only seem to work on the initial acceleration and then doesn\u0027t go fast. However when you rapidly alternate between turning left and right by tapping A and D, you can move over 90 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is on Kerbin, I cannot seem to find a way to use them on low gravity moons at all, which is another thing that puzzle me. The rover just keep spinning and hardly ever brakes. I have no such problem with the other wheels as long as I don\u0027t drive overly aggressively. Maybe I need to tweak a bit on the traction settings?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blaarkies","CreatedById":153700,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-08T10:45:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSend them to space as parts. Attach wheel to an i beam, and two small docking ports on the I-Beam. With this you could construct the massive rover in orbit. After landing you can move the rover around to a better/flatter spot...but all this could be avoided by planning ahead\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-08T14:26:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first part is a known bug:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/7564\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/7564\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(also reported as\u00A0#8992).
