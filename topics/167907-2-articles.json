To get higher than that you need to use EM or its surrogate charge propulsion and magnetism. In fusion you have to create a plasma and pressurize it, this can be used to expel the gas. THE BIG PROBLEM IS: you have to bring a power supply or battery along that can get this process going _and then_ after its completed you have to recharge.

Any movement to one side or the other and the yard stick falls off. Fission of unpurified uranium is not spontaneous, yes it occurs but only slowly. To increase the rate of reaction fast neutrons need to be slowed by water or graphite. However once you get the reaction going you want to moderate, oddly this is also done by water (circulation in the reactor) and by control rods that contain neutron absorbents. The control features of a reactor broaden\u00A0 \u0022the edge\u0022. If these features are removed the knife blade gets very thin and one can easily step into a prompt critical situation. If one moves to many control features into a reactor you can go the other way due to \u003Csup\u003E136\u003C/sup\u003EXe poisoning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is a clear prompt critical situation. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SL-1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SL-1 \u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChernobyl was a mixed situation, but the 33\u002B GW explosion that took place was the consequence of poor \u003Cu\u003Efission\u003C/u\u003E modulation of a subset of pellets within the reactor, part of this was do to poor reactor design (this reactor design allow the build up of nucleated steam pockets) that was exacerbated by poor power to the cooling pumps that were required during reactor shut-down (as this was a shut down test and not a full shut down the exact qualification is ambiguous). The steam that built up around pellets that were not modulated by control rods allowed the pellets to go prompt critical, even though this did not include the entire reactor, it included enough of the reactor to create a catastrophic, epic, steam explosion. The heat of the\u00A0 \u0026lt;190 MW contributed by isotopic decay helped in that the improper cooling that lead to the disaster the isotopic decay was contributing the steam-pocket generation potential. But the bad in all of this was there were some pellets that were too far from the control rods at the time and although they were a small subset of all the uranium, there was sufficient number to create a local prompt critical, of the 33\u002B GW of power generated less than 1% was from decay heat. THis is to say that Chernobyl could have happened in an ever so slightly different set of circumstances without decay heat. The difference between SL-1 was during its prompt critical the proportion was so great that all the water immediately boiled and threw the uranium over a wide area completely stopping all reaction. At Chernobyl the fraction was small enough to preserve the Uranium which then melted basically to the core and created the situation we see today. The people who died at chernobyl primarily died from the secondary effects of a reactor breach (one man died from being scalded by reactor water), at SL1 the people died from the primary effects of being at point blank range from a prompt-critical explosion, (i.e being impaled by a control rod).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFukushima was almost entirely caused by the decay heat. In this is to say if your reactor has a 6% off power rating and your reactor can ambiently remove 1% of that power, that over time (say 24 hours) the heat of the decay will cause the reactors to blow off steam and hydrogen and eventually melt down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy this has to do with space. Steam generation is the most efficient way of capturing the power generated by heat in the reactor. In general the water traps the heat, and the steam takes the power from that water and delivers it to one or two generators in a series and finally dumps the remnant to a cooling system before it is pumped back to the reactor. The steam/water separator depends on inertia and gravity. In addition nucleated steam on the pellets can become stable without gravity to remove the steam. For this reason steam reactors in space are highly limited in size and output.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-28T19:47:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo it looks like the choices for dealing with post-burn heat are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Open-cycle cooling: send propellent through the system, possibly into a smaller bell to act efficiently at 6-10% propellant mass, possibly switching to a non-propellant with either higher thermal mass/mass ratio or would suck heat better during a phase change (or two if using a solid).\u00A0 Ideally this can be \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E ice, but still it involves mass.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Closed cycle cooling: This is highly complex and has most of the issues PB666 just described.\u00A0 Expect *lots* of dry mass needed to do this.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Dumping the fuel: obviously you need all the fuel mass each burn, but expect it not to be much more massive than the cooling mass needed in open-cycle designs.\u00A0 Just don\u0027t count on any \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E uranium (unlike the ice example).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe major advantage here for dumping fuel is simplicity (it probably requires less total mass than closed cycle cooling as well).\u00A0 If you have a meltdown (and I\u0027d expect it to happen when leaving Earth or possibly leaving for Earth with failing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E material) you aren\u0027t going\u00A0 to be doing a capture burn and can expect to be lost in space in some sort of transfer orbit oscillating between Earth orbit and some other orbit.\u00A0 Trying to move the fuel into a graveyard orbit might be avoided simply to avoid failure: for some reason people will object if you try to avoid a .001% chance of Earth being hit by radioactive slag and fail vs. simply assume that \u0022it is all right\u0022 and ignore it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
