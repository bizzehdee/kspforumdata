If the speed of light was infinite then we would probably see everything in the universe.\n\n(Due to Albert Einsteins theory of relativity it is impossible to break this speed, we can send particles 99% of the speed of light but not fully there.)"},{"CreatedByName":"what-the","CreatedById":6885,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-14T14:20:36Z","Content":"I personally don\\\u0027t believe the expansion is accelerating. If you imagine the universe with just one direction and time with just a handful of particles all at one point.
