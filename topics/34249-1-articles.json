I tend to \u0022maintain\u0022 my own versions of various mods. One of the worst things I see is the use of \u0022MACROS\u0022 by people who don\u0027t know what a macro is (now whether C# actually inlines anything is another story.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with macros is that you should never treat them as variables. Using \u0022isNull(temp)\u0022 as a macro means you should have \u0022isNotNull(temp).\u0022 More so, macros like \u0022IF_IsKerbalEVA_GetKerbalEVA()\u0022 create the redundancy code of having multiple tests \u0022IsKerbalEVA\u0022 performed when you really want \u0022GetKerbalEVA.\u0022 Then it gets worse because the above is expected to return KerbalEVA, but then has to return null if it isn\u0027t KerbalEVA, this is then tested by \u0022isNull()\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWORSE starts to happen when people use macros to return LISTS. Now you\u0027re looping over to filter out what you don\u0027t want, only to loop over the list you returned (and have made a global variable for no reason). The macro used to create said list can easily be moved into the code that reads the list... but then people even call macros like that multiple times rather than simply have a conditional statement inside the original foreach loop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t on a single mod basis, this is on a whole. Many people use macros like crazy as a kind of \u0022self documenting code\u0022, even if it is just a single line that is called once or twice, it gets a macro. The simple use of macros causes great inefficiencies in code simply because people don\u0027t understand what macros should be used for. (Again, I doubt C# inlines anything; so there is probably no such thing as a C# macro. [and yes, the c\u002B\u002B inline directive is a little different than a pure macro, but nvm]).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*and no, macros are just one sin, the point is that there is a general \u0022lack of caring to try to optimize\u0022, multiple embedded if then else statments are a good example here; if there is repititious code in them, they can usually be turned into a far more efficient form (using a single return / break (basically, goto), can readily simplify many structures that have an \u0022if end condition is true, execute this... else execute this code on any other condition\u0022). [And, if the compiler can be trusted... *reads the microsoft label*... it would form that same structure anyways with JMP commands (basically, goto); but you, as a human, have an easier time maintaining the code.]\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"samstarman5","CreatedById":12469,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T21:51:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP is just about the most mod-friendly game out there, making it easier to add mods than even Minecraft, and you want Squad to make the extra effort to make the mod official?
