There is SO much snow on Christmas that when you go outside you can\u0027t see anything. You trip on a fire-hydrant and get hit by a car. However, you somehow live, but as you crawl towards your house, a snowplow comes along and buries you in a snow pile. You almost run out of oxygen and die, but you manage to shovel your way out and get to your house. You get inside, and only an hour later your house collapses under the weight of the snow, and you are trapped in an air pocket in your basement. As you begin to die from lack of food and oxygen, you remember how your family didn\u0027t get you any Christmas presents, and you die miserable. Merry Christmas!
