I was doing a test launch with the liquid fuel engine and some tourists. I had solid rocket boosters to lift off. Then I decoupled and started the second stage liquid fuel engine. it was ok until I started to press d so it can go into orbit. But When i stopped pressing d to make it stop tilting, it kept going! So i tried to press a to correct for it. But it just didn\u0027t listen and started to spin in a circle. I tired to use other keys, but it just went crazy. Then I tried to decouple the stage. The stage decoupled, but then exploded. then everything froze. Like one minute later it finally started again. I still had a third stage liquid fuel engine, So I tried to fire it. But it didn\u0027t fire no matter how much times I hit z. I r-clicked on it and it said that it was on and at 100%. But it didn\u0027t have thrust or smoke/fire. So I decided to just decouple that thing as well. But the decouple didn\u0027t decouple. So tried the parachute since I was already falling. But the parachute wouldn\u0027t deploy either. One second later, the thing froze again. When it unfroze, the engine went off and the decoupler decoupled and the parachute deployed. It was weird and I just want to know if this is a bug/lag or a normally behavior of the liquid fuel engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-28T20:40:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is not a problem of the engine, but of your rocket. The reason that your rocket kept turning is because it is aerodynamically unstable, i.e. on it own it wants to fly with the engine-end forwards through the air (in contrast to flying with the capsule-end forwards). And you didn\u0027t have enough control authority to overcome the aerodynamic forces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a reasonably built rocket the control authority from the engine gimbal is enough to keep the rocket flying straight even if it is slightly unstable. Which engine did you use?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get your rocket more stable you can reduce the drag at the top of the rocket (if possible) or add fins to the bottom of the rocket.
