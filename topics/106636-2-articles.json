I\u0027m currently of two minds on this. First, I personally have hit speeds well in excess of what he\u0027s showing without losing parts. However, I haven\u0027t hit those speeds for any length of time without control surfaces burning off. My concern was less of the heating issue and more of, how the hell did he go that fast at that altitude. My rapiers are only producing a minuscule amount of thrust at those altitudes, not nearly enough to reach those speeds.

Most east-\u0026gt;west circumnavigations take around 3,900km due to the fact that Kerbin is rotating. The slower you are, the more ground you cover, which is why mine was a bout 500km more. You were lots faster than I was and went a lot further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seriously doubt that jeb uses a great circle calculation to determine how far you are from the runway. I\u0027d guess it just draws a straight line whether it\u0027s through Kerbin or not. But, you end up flying in a great circle path so it kinda makes sense that ground distance and jeb distance don\u0027t agree and that jeb would show the shorter distance.

Since the radius of Kerbin is 600,000m, which makes the diameter 3,769,911m, how did you do a circumnavigation travelling only 2,527,423m?

You just went a lot further than you needed. Most east-\u0026gt;west circumnavigations take around 3,900km due to the fact that Kerbin is rotating. The slower you are, the more ground you cover, which is why mine was a bout 500km more. You were lots faster than I was and went a lot further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seriously doubt that jeb uses a great circle calculation to determine how far you are from the runway. I\u0027d guess it just draws a straight line whether it\u0027s through Kerbin or not. But, you end up flying in a great circle path so it kinda makes sense that ground distance and jeb distance don\u0027t agree and that jeb would show the shorter distance.

Symmetry mode can be turned on via the panel in the bottom left corner of your screen in the spaceplane hangar. The reason for this is that you want every little change you make to one side to be identical on the other. You may have already known this, but I mentioned it just in case. Also ensure that your angle snap mode, which is indicated right next to the symmetry mode, is set to either angle snap or smooth mode for your purposes. For fine tuned 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 or less angle changes, you\u0027ll want angle snap off and smooth mode on instead (indicated by a circle with a dot inside).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, you should know that the \u00221\u0022 key by default will put you into part Place mode, \u00222\u0022 into Offset mode, \u00223\u0022 into Rotate mode, and \u00224\u0022 into Root mode. Press \u00223\u0022 to go into rotate mode, or of course simply click that option which is displayed at the top left of your SPH view. Then, select either the engine itself, or whatever assembly it is attached to if you want to, for instance, like on my Sojourn 2, rotate both the engine and the precooler it is on. Now, you should see a brightly colored set of circles pop up which represents your axes of rotation. Carefully put your pointer directly on the axis indicator circle you want to rotate on, click and hold, and move your mouse to rotate it. Press \u00221\u0022 once you\u0027re done to go back into normal place mode. Now, sometimes shifting angles can cause gaps on one side of the connection. To remedy this, go into Offset mode (\u00222\u0022). Select the corresponding axis to translate the part on, and drag it until everything looks right. If ever during this process, you change an angle or offset, and you don\u0027t like the results, you can press LCtrl \u002B z to undo the action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m guessing the trouble you were having with part rotation is that you were doing all your rotation in place mode using the Shift \u002B letter keys, and as a result, those place mode-angled parts determined the angle of all the rest of the parts that got attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a good link to quickly reference the VAB/SPH commands:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Key_bindings\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Key_bindings\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T06:07:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 06:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MunGazer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T06:33:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022imthebait\u0022 data-cite=\u0022imthebait\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI saw this and thought i would try my hand, I \u0022borrowed\u0022 the tilted engine and intake design from MunGazer, but i was completing this on career mode, so i have limited tech, using turboram jets i managed speeds i thought you couldn\u0027t get with jets alone. topping out at over mach 3.6 i completed two circumnavigations in under two hours.

The circumference of Kerbin is 3,769,911m. Your distance is showing 3,939,677. That distance is very consistent with one circumnavigation. Kerbin rotates in the direction you were travelling meaning, the distance would be even further than 3,700km. In 2 hours, it rotates 628km. So, somewhere around 4,300km would be a reasonable distance. I could buy the 3,900 if it were one, but how did you get two circumnavigations? I\u0027m not saying you didn\u0027t mind you. I\u0027ve already seen some strange numbers coming from these flights. It just doesn\u0027t make sense though. Now if you managed an average of say 1,100m/s over 2 hours that would be 7,900km which does make sense for 2 circumnavigations. I\u0027m just curious why the F3 is showing something very different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe time for the speed you were travelling, that sounds about right.
