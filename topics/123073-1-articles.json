The engine depleted your electricity, and when you throttled down, it didn\u0027t actually shut down the engine because the engine drains the electric charge before the probe core gets it. Note how your Xenon is still being consumed - the engine is consuming all the electric charge coming from the panels, and he probe core doesn\u0027t get any, so it can\u0027t shut down the engine. The only way to stop it is by sending a kerbal to shut down the engine on EVA. However, you probably won\u0027t be able to switch vehicles because the probe may be still accelerating from the ion thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Or, you could disable the Xenon tank, if possible.

However, it runs at much less than 100% because there\u0027s not enough charge for full power operation. So the fuel doesn\u0027t get consumed instantly. But the engine still requests the full amount again in the next physics step. And so on and so forth - there\u0027s always a \u0027buffer\u0027 of unconsumed fuel in the engine. When you turn off the tank, that buffer needs to be consumed first. By repeatedly toggling it on and off, you only allowed it to be replenished.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically: turn it off, then wait until the engine flames out.
