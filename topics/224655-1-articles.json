Honestly just trying to get propellers, motors, hinges etc back in my RP-1 install as it looks like it removed the Breaking ground because it doesn\u0027t have an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E config. Is there anyway to get these parts back in that will work as it should?

Yes i was mostly looking for the hinges, robotics, and propellers/motors. I was hoping someone had a config for it as it is pretty hard recreating the dragonfly mission without these things.\u00A0 Thank you, I will use your config, at least until i can find a way to get a config that is also balanced (trying to get it as realistic as i can).
