Im gonna join that and ask the KSP community, I make videos \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/pinkieseb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u003C/a\u003E Im just an in-general gamer. But so far out of all the games I\u0027ve recorded KSP has been my favorite! But im running out of ideas, my 4th KSP video hasnt uploaded yet, in that video i make a space station (big one) and fly planes around. My skills in this game are limited, but I still need ideas. I can get to the mun and orbit/land easily. Coming home is the hard part xD Challenges for suggestions would be nice, because I can get much better at the game with those! So yes, please give me some challenges!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut please, I dont wanna go interplanetary just yet \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/pinkieseb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0000FF;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBIG LINK TO MY YOUTUBE HERE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"7499275","CreatedById":70640,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-21T14:20:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStart by launching a medium or large rocket carrying many small probes...

If you have mods I\u0027ve seen a lot of people use B9 parts to make an SSTO ( single stage to orbit ) go to Duna and land. Of course though if you don\u0027t have the best skills as you mentioned Eve may be a better choice for its thicker atmosphere.
