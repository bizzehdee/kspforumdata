I\u0027m not talking for me here considering I can\u0027t even make a SSTO in stock KSP.\n\nI guess using part mods you could make something that works pretty good, but is it possible using only stock parts ? And if yes would it be profitable to orbit satellites with it over other rockets ?\n\nIf you do have a RSS SSTO, I would enjoy seeing screenshots or videos of it.\n\nThinking about it, that might make a good challenge for SSTO-maniacs... ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) (probably already exists though)"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T14:03:47Z","Content":"I think there was a guy who made a Single stage to Mars, but I\u0027m not sure.."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T20:21:39Z","Content":"SSTO is fairly easy if you use an SSME and are willing to accept a tiny amount of payload.

IMO, I think you\u0027re better off with a regular rocket, even though that might be more expensive in the end.\n\nAnd about spaceplanes... Well, that *would* indeed be quite a challenge ! Making a plane with \u003E9k m/s dV in vacuum, able to orbit at 130\u002B km and withstand a \u003E7 km/s reentry and capable of taking some payload seems quite not very possible, IMO... Anyway, for this kind of SSTO, you\u0027re definitely better off with a rocket.\n\nStill, waiting for challengers... ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T21:46:36Z","Content":"I very much doubt it\u0027s possible with *stock* parts.

Sure. You just *really* have to work at it. Look at Skylon, for instance; it\u0027s pretty much the most advanced SSTO *proposal* out there.\nReal life SSTOs don\u0027t exist, and if they do they don\u0027t look anything like the fantastic \u0022spaceplanes\u0022 you can build under the toy-like conditions of Kerbin.

In older versions of KSP(0.23 or 0.24) with FAR, DRE, RF and AJE (and other realistic mods, but without RO, all coming from a mod pack he made called RKSP) installed, using the SABRE engine and extremely large wings, he made a couple of huge SSTOs.\n\nWell in my opionion, SSTOs in RSS is possible, but stock part spaceplanes are a bit difficult withoit RF."},{"CreatedByName":"TeeGee","CreatedById":82434,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T21:32:36Z","Content":"I made one using realism overhaul a while ago.
