Atm I\u0027m at the point, where the early game is hard, but still fun, but as soon as you can start jumping Minmus for science, you basically unlike everything. I\u0027d love to change the modifiers, especially for minmus and the mun, extending the mid-game and late game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DuoDex","CreatedById":107061,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T01:08:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, you can\u0027t using the stock game. All you can do is change the global science modifier when you start a save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure if you asked for a mod to do this over in General Add-On Affairs someone would throw it together for you - it seems a very easy plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T01:36:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDmagic already made one back in like 0.24.

I left funding at 100%, lower building upgrade costs have reduced the feeling of \u0022grind\u0022 compared to .90. I\u0027ve been to both Kerbin\u0027s moons several times, but am really having to hit every biome just to get into the 300 science tier of parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m resigned now to pushing on to farther planets, \u0027cause I know they pay better... but the time! The Uncertainty - If I\u0027ve forgotten a part, or get someone stranded, they will be stuck for a while. The... lack of ability to skill up Kerbals in the field. Three ships to Duna - science lab, exploration ship, and some extra fuel - will arrive in 290 days (didn\u0027t wait for optimal window.) Local contracts and activities are slowing, I will probably do a big timewarp soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts very different from my .90 career, where after about the same amount of game time, I had most of the science tree unlocked, mostly due to contract science payouts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
