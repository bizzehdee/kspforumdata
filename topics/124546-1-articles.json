I vowed not to play until 1.1 and 64-bit support was introduced, but then I watched a Scott Manley video and I gave in and redownloaded KSP from Steam. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first time I started it up after the download, it started in a 600x800\u0027ish window. I set the resolution to 1920x1200 (native res for my monitor), and turned all the graphics settings to 100%. Then I hit the accept button and KSP promptly crashed and gave me the below error:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i174.photobucket.com/albums/w83/Jason310019/KSP/KSP%20Error_zpsi0vqjqts.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP%20Error_zpsi0vqjqts.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve gone into the settings.cfg file and tried to change the resolution to 1920x1080 and even back to 600x800 but every time I start KSP it immediately crashes and gives me this same error.

Normally I force opengl for the reduced memory usage, so I wasn\u0027t using DirectX. Your request for dxdiag logs reminded me, Sal, so I removed the -force-opengl from the startup parameters and tried running it. KSP loaded with no issues. So I closed it, put the -force-opengl back in and now it works fine. Thanks for the help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
