In Green People Space Group, you must build a space car, possible of flying its people out into space, without killing them. You can use a lot of parts, which you use to make a space car that won\u0027t die. Each part has its own use and will make the way a space car flies (or doesn\u0027t). So get ready, and get ready to try some Space Car Hard Stuff! The game has different game types, you can play the Business Type if you want to manage your own Space Business, taking on things to do and learning new things. Or you can play Anything Type if you\u0027re only interested in flying and looking at the Green People land without needing money to buy space cars. There is even a middle point between these two, Learning Things Type.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd a shorter one which I just made without a guide:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreen People Space Group is a game where you send green people into space using large things that use fire to go FAST. You can send green people to places in space. They can put things on the space worlds. Or you can just fly things. It\u0027s up to you. Green People Space Group can be hard at times. However, the more you play Green People Space Group, you will be better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
