I would recommend a complete lightbar setup quite a ways out, but I\u0027d probably skip the strobes and communication lights on these, because they would be unnecessary bloat. There should be 3 diffent ways to render of these approach lightbars for different distances to allow for better range ov visability. (The same should be done for KSC itself. One is a landscape decal that appears when the light in question exceeds view distance. Then is a greatly simplified \u0022imposter\u0022 model for the long range, to allow for having some sort of model well beyond the clip plain for regular objects, finally is the standard model that is adjusted for LOD further by the game engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor angle systems, I would like to see a T-VASI type system, because it\u0027s easiest to use. I\u0027d also like to see a single-light Pulsating VASI system on each of the helipads, and on the launchpad for good measure. This will allow experienced to easily approach them with VTOLs for nice swift landings, and it would make nice eye candy for regular players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe desired flight angle range for each indicator position should be adjustable in .1 degree increments from a menu accessible at KSC. The managing of the visibility of the lights should be handled by a shader, so it even functions with just a decal, but there should be an actual model when you get down close to them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe purpose of all of these lights are three-fold.
