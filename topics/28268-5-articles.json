Build the lifter first, making your root part the topmost piece (docking port, decoupler, etc.). After you finish that, grab it by the root part (e.g. docking port), move it to the puzzle piece and save. Be sure to save the lifter to the VAB list, too, for future tweaking. Now start a new build and put together your payload. Then load and attach your lifter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done this myself with lifters that have many struts and fuel lines.
