Outside rockets look disconnected/separated from the center and begin spinning until they eventually blow up but if you turn off time warp, they will return to normal form. Aeroplane will hold a steady heading and speed but time warp will cause it to fly off course.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"quietghost","CreatedById":117566,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T22:05:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs this physical timewarp?
