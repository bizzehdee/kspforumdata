Outside rockets look disconnected/separated from the center and begin spinning until they eventually blow up but if you turn off time warp, they will return to normal form. Aeroplane will hold a steady heading and speed but time warp will cause it to fly off course."},{"CreatedByName":"quietghost","CreatedById":117566,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T22:05:08Z","Content":"Is this physical timewarp? (Physical timewarp only goes up to x4 and is the only option for timewarp in atmospheres)\n\nIf it is physical timewarp, the reason the ships look all disjointed and glitchy is because your computer cannot handle all the physics calculations so quickly, so in essence it \u0022skips\u0022 frames, allowing parts to separate and occasionally rip off the ship entirely.\n\nThe only solution to the physical timewarp glitching is just to avoid it altogether on large ships."}]}
