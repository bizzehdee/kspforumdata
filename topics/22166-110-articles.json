I took back off with 50% in the LFO tanks, and 7800/16000 units of Kethane in my reservoir, and by the time I got back to a 50km orbit around the Mun, I was down to 20% in my LFO tanks.

That said, we\u0027ve discussed licensing and he\u0027s in agreement with the current terms. You\u0027re certainly free to ask him for an exemption, but don\u0027t be surprised if he just directs you to me.\u003Cbr\u003E[EDIT] To elaborate on this: I don\u0027t own the copyrights, but I\u0027ve been authorized (by Keptin) to use and relicense those assets, which is exactly what I\u0027ve done in the case of Kethane. The license allows you to play the mod, share media of the mod in action, and modify it for personal use, but that\u0027s all it grants for these assets. So, if you wanted to retexture Kethane parts for fun, go ahead; that\u0027s allowed under my license, which has been allowed by Keptin; but you cannot distribute those retextured parts, and you cannot distribute derivative works thereof (e.g. screenshots and videos). Either Keptin or I can allow use of those assets; in practice, the only rights you\u0027re granted come from the Kethane license.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhat parts of the Kethane license are contradictory? It\u0027s fairly clear that the license enumerates rights that are granted and then declares all other rights as reserved; the \u0022you may not\u0022 list is provided for clarity. The license can be summarized in simple terms thusly: Kethane has an API that you may use, and you can share changes to source code since that\u0027s useful for submitting patches, but you can\u0027t use the mod in other ways and you can\u0027t reupload it somewhere.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI\u0027ve written at length (several times) on the reasoning behind the Kethane license. I realize it\u0027s unconventional, but Kethane also isn\u0027t an ordinary mod. Search through this thread and my Reddit history (be prepared for lots of k-pop) if you\u0027re interested.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIn the case of part assets, one of the reasons modification and use is disallowed is because they\u0027re high-quality parts meant to be used in a high-quality mod. Maintaining and building upon that standard of quality is important to everyone involved in the Kethane project. You may not agree with our philosophy, and you\u0027re free to produce your own high-quality parts and license them however you like.\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-25T02:45:23Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2013 02:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Majiir\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor9","CreatedById":67915,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T02:27:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KhaosCorp\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KhaosCorp\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA craft file is basically just a text file.

It\u0027s in vogue to complain that unlicensed, out-of-date mods can\u0027t be forked and then insist on mandatory abandonment terms, a common license, or some equally silly measure. The truth is that unlicensed mods \u003Cem\u003Ealready\u003C/em\u003E violate the addon posting rules for the KSP network, so more rules won\u0027t really change anything, and it\u0027s ultimately the creator\u0027s fault if their mod ends up unlicensed and abandoned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am always willing to have a healthy discussion about the Kethane license, but be aware that I\u0027ve put a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of thought into this. Also be aware that I\u0027ve been steadily making the license more open, but this is largely because it\u0027s become more specific; the most dramatic change came with version 0.6 when I opened up the Kethane module API for use. (Previously, you couldn\u0027t make something like a custom converter without my permission; now, if you want to make your own part that uses my module code, I can\u0027t stop you.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, be aware that I\u0027m a nice guy and I \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E grant exceptions, but there are certain cases that the license was specifically crafted to forbid. (Retexturing a part and releasing it as another pack is one of these cases.) Skykooler\u0027s Extraplanetary Launchpads started with an exemption to the Kethane license. Others have contacted me about building third-party mods, and I\u0027ve told them I\u0027ll be happy to grant them exemptions since they\u0027re doing things that don\u0027t necessarily fit within the license. Fundamentally, I\u0027m happy for people to use my work if it helps them to \u003Cem\u003Ecreate their own work\u003C/em\u003E, as in Extraplanetary Launchpads. (That mod really is skykooler\u0027s brainchild, and the fact that it uses Kethane is a technical detail.) Reskinning a part, on the other hand, isn\u0027t creating anything new; it\u0027s lazily reusing someone else\u0027s work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zgrillo2004","CreatedById":44211,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T03:13:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMajiir I can understand on the protection but they are small things like I was doing is being droven off by your license. you are driving away rookie modders\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gryphorim","CreatedById":57249,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T03:20:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould it be in breach of the licence to have screenshots on threads of this forum that contain images of reskinned parts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majiir","CreatedById":7550,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T03:31:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022zgrillo2004\u0022 data-cite=\u0022zgrillo2004\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMajiir I can understand on the protection but they are small things like I was doing is being droven off by your license. you are driving away rookie modders\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane\u0027s license is fantastic for rookie modders who are interested in actually creating something. Suppose you have a cool idea for a mod that allows you to collect and process resources, but you have no idea how to code plugins and only basic modeling skills. You whip up a few models quickly, add Kethane modules to the part configs, and suddenly your parts are powered with the full weight of the Kethane plugin. You might be the worst modeler out there, but you could still come up with a great idea, and it\u0027s incredibly easy to get up and running since you can make use of the Kethane code without ever having to worry about the programming yourself. People can get interested in your mod, and pretty soon you\u0027ve got more talented artists lining up to help you. I\u0027d argue that in this respect, Kethane is more friendly to other modders than any other mod out there. (What other mods actually provide a third-party API?
