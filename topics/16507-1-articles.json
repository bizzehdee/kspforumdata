Can someone talk me through the process. I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s a settings thing, or something with my computer, but just let me know, using small words as apparently I\u0027m an idiot in this regard, how to go from seeing something you want to photograph, to having a picture in a file which I could share with all of you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-10T04:55:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you saying that you don\u0027t know how or that it\u0027s not working? If the former, press F1 and whatever you\u0027re looking at (except the mouse pointer) will be saved in the \u0022Screenshots\u0022 folder within your KSP folders. Then the best way to post it currently is to upload that screenshot file to a service like Imgur, then take the URL that Imgur gives you for that screenshot and link to it in your post.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BillWiskins","CreatedById":12285,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-10T11:16:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn related news, F2 will turn off the instrument display for a clearer view.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrMadGameplay","CreatedById":20225,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-10T12:38:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be great if you could make it clear what you mean.
