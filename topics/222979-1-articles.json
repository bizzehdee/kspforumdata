To me, lower atmosphere heating seems correctly tuned, and the upper atmosphere is what needs work, so my suggestion is to raise the Clamp-O-Tron Shielded\u0027s temperature rating from 1200K to 1500K to match the Mk3 \u0022Condor\u0022 Spaceplane cockpit it seems this docking port was designed for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeq","CreatedById":172375,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-14T17:51:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you fit that into mk3 cargobay?
