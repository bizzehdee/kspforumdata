Additionally, ionocraft are terribly fragile - they cannot endure high speeds, which is compounded by their somewhat low power density, as each cell puts out only a small amount of thrust. The net result is that an ionocraft is a great engine for probes, but not so much for lifting things out of atmosphere.
