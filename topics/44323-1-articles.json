Simply put, i have some SSTOs that can get into orbit around Kerbin, with fuel for orbital maneuvers and I need to know if they need a wider margin of error if they are to operate around Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-30T08:30:54Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2013 08:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SofusRud\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrPopcup","CreatedById":75533,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T22:13:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELaythe has lower gravity, and also lower air-intake at higher altitudes than kerbin, but of course! if you have an SSTO and you can get it to orbit kerbin with a little fuel then it\u0027s fine, just send it to laythe but remember to put more air-intakes. and use action Groups to close/open them, that makes drag less, so at higher altitudes open them then just use rockets, but I guess you already know that! also, I\u0027d say it\u0027s the same thing, on kerbin you have higher gravity but more air in higher altitudes, and laythe has a low gravity and less air intake at higher altitudes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy launching!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
