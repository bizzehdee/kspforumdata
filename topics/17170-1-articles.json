At this point I feel I\u0027ve exhausted almost all of my options until the next release with some new planets and moons to explore. I\u0027ve done many different types of rockets with different launch vehicles and landers, big and small, stock and with mods, plain and eccentric. I\u0027ve done skycranes (not using the Lionhead mod), drop pods, unfolding gear/bases, have different space stations and orbiters around each of the three bodies available, unmanned missions with satellite delay and a whole bunch of other stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only things I can really see available to me are things I really don\u0027t care to dabble in since they don\u0027t add much to the game in my opinion. These are things like the ZO2, Electrical Energy and new Kethane mods. All it really is is sacrificing a few fuel tanks on my landers or some of the body sections on my landed habitation modules and replace them with the necessary parts for craft that would function exactly similar had they not been there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done a fair bit in the spaceplane hangar and have all different kinds of designs using as many different parts in as many different combinations I can imagine. I hardly ever fly the same aircraft/rocket twice since there really is no reason to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have any suggestions on stuff I can do?

I\u0027ve done the precision landing thing a bunch of times on Kerbin and both moons, ever since I learned about killing my horizontal velocity that\u0027s pretty much what I do every time - got big groups of bases of giant habitation modules and junk all over the place.

I\u0027ve done the multiple lander thing, also, but not with stock parts so I could give that a go. My biggest gripe with stock parts vs. mods is that I play on a non-gaming laptop so I mods help me limiting the amount of parts I toss on my designs since you get more bang per part with them. I think once I clear a dozen KM up and dump the first stage I might be alright.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the Kerbol thing, no, I still haven\u0027t done that - you kept pushing that on me in IRC, too \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E.

My solution last update was to localize every Munolith/Kerbolith (however they were finally called) and deploy a \u0022scientific station\u0022 right nexto to it. It is a very hard quest if you do it with no mods, if you don\u0027t feel like watching all over the place I suggest using the mod which has to parts that let you know if kerboliths are nearby. It is very entertaining since you need a plane able to fly enormous distances in kerbin, to localize the kerboliths, make power landings everywhere. Make a vessel able to hover on the moon so it\u0027s a challenge for disign and good landing skills.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing I tried and i was stuck with this one for several days is to have capsule on the sea and your goal is to retrieve the entire capsule to the ksc.
