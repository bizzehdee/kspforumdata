It\u0027s a Windows application that generates the .cfg files needed by TechManager (and ATC if you use ATC instead), by the use of a graphical tool.

You now choose from a list at the start of the game, instead of just picking one. That list of what you choose is then what\u0027s available in the drop down while on the R\u0026amp;D screen. I think this gives a better feel to the gameplay, as you aren\u0027t constantly being given options for tech trees you didn\u0027t want to use for that particular save game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/h1mmgBq.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022h1mmgBq.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdded a new feature. There is now an \u0027external\u0027 property that can be set in a tech tree node. This is essentially a way to reference only the techs that you want from another tree. Let\u0027s say i wanted to reference Ultra-High Energy Physics from the KSPI tree, but I didn\u0027t want to allow it to be researchable from my tree. That way, I don\u0027t have to worry about parts, or science cost, or its parents, just if its been researched or not. Such an external node has no parents, and you can\u0027t click on it to peak at what it is before you research it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/c6OXmjK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022c6OXmjK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, once its researched in another tree, it acts more like a normal node. You can look at it and use it as a dependency for later nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VksfFVN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VksfFVN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea here is to allow for a real sub-tree implementation. You can start your sub-tree with external nodes derived from the stock tree, the CTT, or whatever \u0027base\u0027 tree you would like, and then build from there. No need to include the entire tree from Start all the way to the few nodes you want to add. And the player still gets visual feedback -- they see a gray node that \u0027needs to be researched\u0027 before they can continue on the sub-tree. (Without the \u0027external\u0027 property, any node that doesn\u0027t have parents is automatically researchable. You can see how that would be a game breaking problem for sub-trees.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that makes sense, let me know what you think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I\u0027m ready for another release now, but i\u0027ll double check things first, after some sleep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFractal_UK, I would *really* like to get rid of part assignments as a part of the tree definitions. They can clash horribly. If one part is assigned to multiple techs in different trees, there is no obvious way to resolve that. I\u0027d rather part cfg files or MM sorted all the part assignments out before TM ever starts. Part assignment is still in there for now, but its a \u0027first come, first served\u0027 approach. First tree to assign a part wins. Although it is limited to only the trees you select for your game, not all of them. Let me know what you think of moving KSPI to a non-tree-cfg based way of assigning parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-03T08:21:57Z\u0022 title=\u002211/03/2014 08:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by anonish\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T09:16:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is looking incredibly sweet!
