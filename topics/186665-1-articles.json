I\u0027ve been playing the game since maybe .18 (I believe that\u0027s how the format used to go for versions), and I\u0027m coming back onto the scene in 1.7.3. I stopped playing the game for maybe a year or so, but out of nowhere recently I\u0027ve been inspired to start playing it again. I just got the Breaking Ground update, and I\u0027m ready to learn about everything I\u0027ve missed!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-24T01:34:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome back\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-24T02:20:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome back, you\u0027re in for quite a journey.

I like that there\u0027s actually customizable textures for the parts now. It lets me make my stages look different and lets the same rocket have a unique flare a few extra times if I have to re-use it. I could see myself using the metal texture of the larger tanks for fuel depots, for example, instead of flourescent orange tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"T-Bouw","CreatedById":21500,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-02T19:32:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome Cosmo!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5thHorseman is right about the changes in KSP. For instance, the parts have been balanced and re-balanced a lot of times, so some old favorite parts of yours may work differently now than you\u0027ll remember.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd for sure, making crafts more pretty is easier now!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Roskii Heiral","CreatedById":198829,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-03T00:36:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome back, its fun to see so many people returning w/ the new updates!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
