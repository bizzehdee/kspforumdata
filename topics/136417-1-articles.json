This could be very useful to obtain complex composed control winglets and more simple vertical launching aircrafts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn summary: I suggest do to winglets capable to move connected parts when these move.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-08T15:55:37Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2016 03:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Angeltxilon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EnderKid2","CreatedById":145622,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-08T16:39:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you know how hard that is to code?
