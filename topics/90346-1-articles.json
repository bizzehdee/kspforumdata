Now after completing my jool exploration i wanted to play around with asteroids but couldnt find a single one in the tracking station?!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to time accelerate in ordner to find asteroids which only appear on specific positions on the orbit and i tried to launch a new game (science, career and sandbox) but still no asteroids.
