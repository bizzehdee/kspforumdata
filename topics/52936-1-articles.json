If it were to become reality, would you rather have a solid body to land on or another gas giant with loads of moons? I think a couple odd entities would add a nice touch (i.e. rolling on a nearly 90 degree axis, orbiting Kerbol in a very inclined orbit such as 76 degrees, or even maybe a couple comet-like entities).
