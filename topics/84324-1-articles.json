It\u0027s based on a fixed point in the sky against the (not really) immobile starry field. So in our solar system, if you draw a line from the First Point of Aries (whatever the Hell that is) to the center of Sol, that line is always on the Sun\u0027s prime meridian, regardless of the Sun\u0027s rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KSP celestial longitude system is also fixed because LAN values in KSP actually have meaning (they wouldn\u0027t if it wasn\u0027t). The problem is, absolutely nothing in the stock game and damn little in a modded game gives you a clue in wich direction lies the celestial prime meridian of any body in space.

And the real annoyance here is that because you have to be in Kerbol orbit for these mods to show your current LAN, you can\u0027t set Kerbol as your target, which is the only way the game will draw your ascending and descending nodes in the map view. Thus, even though you now know your current LAN, you have to guestimate where your AN is by rotating the map so Kerbin\u0027s orbit is a horizontal line and eyeballing where that line crosses your orbit on your way up. Then once you know more or less where your LAN is now, you\u0027ll have to guesstimate from there where the contract LAN is, and figure out how to do the \u0022plane spinning\u0022 (as opposed to the usual \u0022plane tilting\u0022) to drag your LAN around from where it is now to where it needs to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TranceaddicT\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TranceaddicT\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow, assuming I have a better understanding of GA, I would imagine that the LAN issue is a matter of:\u003Cp\u003E1. timing the Kerbol approach trajectory such that it crosses at LAN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(this will mostly be determined at the time you make the burn for Jool)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAND\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. lining up the Jool assist so the Kerbol approach trajectory is approximates designated pro/retrograde orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(basically, the Jool approach should be above/below/aside opposite the final assist escape trajectory which subsequently will define the general direction of the target orbit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, it\u0027s just a matter of tuning the orbit for the specified parameters.

But the problem I have with your methodology here is that you have no idea where Kerbol\u0027s celestial prime meridian is in relation to the skybox background so you have nothing upon which to base your 1st step.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems to me that the best way to change your LAN is by burning prograde or retrograde (EDIT: or radial in or out) as required when you\u0027re still more or less but not quite coplane with your target\u0027s orbit. Because this changes the eccentricity of your orbit, it changes where your orbit\u0027s plane crosses your target\u0027s orbit\u0027s plane, as you can see when trying to rendezvous with something you\u0027re not quite co-plane with. The basic problem of the game interface remains, however. Because mods only give you a LAN value when you\u0027re orbiting the central body, and when you\u0027re orbiting the central body the game won\u0027t draw your ascending and descending nodes, you still have to eyeball where they are. But at least that should tell you whether a prograde or a retrograde (EDIT or in or out) burn will move your LAN in the desired direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of all this, I\u0027m thinking your only real option is to burn for Kerbin escape not quite in Kerbin\u0027s plane, so the mod you\u0027re using will give you a Kerbol LAN value. Then you burn prograde or retrograde (EDIT or in or out) as required to get your LAN set. This might require you to scrap that launch and start over with a retrograde instead of a prograde escape. Who knows? But once you\u0027ve got the LAN down, then you do the plane change to the inclination required, then burn your Kerbol Ap and Pe to where they need to be.

Then do a plane change where your orbit crosses the target orbit to set your LAN.

Doing the change in Jool orbital altitude without Jool is going to cost at least 4000 m/s (with 2000 m/s burn from Kerbin). Still better than trying to reach that transfer orbit directly from Kerbin (\u0026gt;10,000 m/s) but you still lose over 3 km/s compared to using the slingshot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yes, it is matter of taste.
