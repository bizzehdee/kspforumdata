One of the mods I\u0027m using is Kerbal Construction Time and anytime I try to launch a vehicle clicking launch doesn\u0027t do anything. The only buildings that do anything when clicked are the runway, launchpad, and astronaut complex, but they don\u0027t do anything besides open their respective menus.\n\nMods Installed: B9 Aerospace\n\nCommunity Tech Tree\n\nCross Feed Enabler\n\nDeadly Reentry\n\nDocking Port Alignment\n\nEnhanced NavBall\n\nFAR\n\nFlight Manager for Reusable Stages\n\nInterstellar\n\nKAS\n\nKerbal Construction Time\n\nKerbal Alarm Clock\n\nkOS\n\nKSPI Extended Configuration\n\nKW Rocketry\n\nInfernal Robotics\n\nMechjeb\n\nRealChute\n\nRegolith\n\nRemoteTech\n\nSafeChute\n\nStage Recovery\n\nStation Science\n\nTac Fuel Balancer\n\nTac Life Support\n\nTech Manager\n\nTweakscale\n\nWarp Drive\n\nAll mods are up to date\n\nReproduction steps: .... play the game for awhile I guess?
