I\u0027m OK with assuming circular, but obviously a more general solution would be great.\n\nI mean, once I\u0027m in orbit, I can use maneuver nodes to see what it will take. But I would find it useful to calculate them while I\u0027m designing my rocket.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T01:29:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 01:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by davidpsummers**"},{"CreatedByName":"NASAHireMe","CreatedById":131205,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T04:34:57Z","Content":"Easiest way is to consult a delta-V chart. [Any accurate one](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120030-1-0-Delta-V-Maps-and-Atmospheric-Charts) will tell you the approximate dV for all of the orbits that are important: low orbit around Kerbin to Kerbin escape to interplanetary transfer to capture to low orbit around the target body.\n\nFor orbits NOT covered on the dV map, you can calculate the dV requirements yourself pretty easily. You will need to understand [Kepler\u0027s laws of planetary motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion#Third_law) and the related [orbital period calculation](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/circles/Lesson-4/Mathematics-of-Satellite-Motion).

(A Hohmann transfer orbit, you probably know, is simple the where you burn to change your apoapsis or periapsis to the altitude of your intended final orbit, then burn to circularize once you get there.)\n\n- *r* is the distance of the orbiting body from the center of the central body (this means you have to add the *radius* of the planet to your ship\u0027s altitude, in the case of Kerbin it\u0027s 600km)\n\n- *\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BC* is the Standard Gravitational Parameter of the central body, which is the product of its gravitational constant and its mass. (Kerbin\u0027s is 3.5316x10^12 m^3/s^2)\n\nThe Delta-V for your first burn is calculated with this equation:\n\n![1b54b322a2dd6656ea92162ac419bb28.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/b/5/1b54b322a2dd6656ea92162ac419bb28.png)\n\nand the Delta-V for your second can be calculated with this equation:\n\n![d7f826b60051adf001ccd0f45159a618.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/7/f/d7f826b60051adf001ccd0f45159a618.png)\n\nand the sum of these two equations is the total Delta-V required to change from one circular orbit to another within a planet\u0027s (or sun\u0027s) SOI. R1 is your starting orbital radius and R2 is your destination orbital radius. To make the units work easily, use meters instead of kilometers (multiply by 1,000).\n\nAnd just for fun, I threw together an Excel spreadsheet that allows you to easily calculate the Delta-V between two circular orbits in Kerbin\u0027s SOI. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) To use for another body\u0027s SOI, just look up the body\u0027s Standard Gravitation Parameter and Equatorial Radius on the wiki and plug those in to the left side of the spreadsheet:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/2i5g65ic0ck4ihi/Hohmann%20Transfer%20Delta-V.xlsx?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2i5g65ic0ck4ihi/Hohmann%20Transfer%20Delta-V.xlsx?dl=0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T22:09:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 10:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jonboy**"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T06:05:57Z","Content":"The following should help,\n\n[Orbital Mechanics](http://www.braeunig.us/space/orbmech.htm)\n\nThere may be more in that page then you need, but you can always skim through it until you find the parts that interests you.
