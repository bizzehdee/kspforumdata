I was quite passionate about the game back then. Recently I had a relapse, and begun playing with SSTOs. And to be frank I\u0027m clueless on the cargo placement in the cargo-bay / cargo-hold (using the larges fuselage). Some times it works, some times it does not: I want to place a satellite with a rocket propelled stage, consisting of probe body, some equipment, clamp-o-tron jr, TR-18D stack separator, one FL-T800 fuel tank and LV-909. I have made it all into one nit assembly part, and the problem begun. It just will not connect to the interior: to the clamp-o-trons, to the separators, when the part snaps in place, its rooted deep inside a fuel filled fuselage part - not even its bulkhead. I have tried re-rooting, moving (it unfortunately stayed rooted and it just was \u0022floating\u0022 in the mid air, still being connected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a last resort, I have tried to rebuild the entire stack in the cargo bay, but it ended up in with similar problems, the funniest one being the engine separating within the separator and leaving a gap in the satellite\u0027s placement vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have searched for some time on info pertaining to this exact problem, but unfortunately couldn\u0027t find it on forum / on\u00A0Scott Manley\u0027s channel etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would be most grateful for any help on that matter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-14T10:07:08Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2017 10:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by JohnM_83\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-14T15:22:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, there are a few\u00A0things in general you should be sure of:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.\u00A0 When you make the probe subassembly, be sure its root part is the docking port you plan to use to attach it to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 So either start building the probe subassembly with that part or use the re-root too.\u00A0 This is because when you go to put a subassembly into another ship, the subassembly\u0027s only attachment node will be on the exposed end of its root part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.\u00A0 When building the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, attach the cargo back to the fuselage, then the docking port in it.\u00A0 Hold down ALT when positioning the docking port in the cargo bay, to be sure it will attach to the interior node in the cargo bay instead of the node of the stack part ahead of or behind the cargo bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.\u00A0 When placing the subassembly in the cargo bay, be sure to hold ALT so it will connect to the node of the docking port inside the bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oiff","CreatedById":182027,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-14T15:24:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you hold Alt to ensure that it snaps to the attachment node at the end of the cargo bay?
