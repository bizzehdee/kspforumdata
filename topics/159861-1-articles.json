If you use landing gear in a circle then the landing gear/wheels have to have the brake on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. if you find a loophole or something wrong with the rules please tell me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nremember, try to be as creative as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to do it but I messed up and crashed the game, the save file is corrupt and I don\u0027t want to build that monstrosity again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhat would be crazy if you made one that used landing gear in its design to have it rotate on and have low friction, but instead of landing gear you used a lot of small versions of that design, or used normal sized versions instead of the \u0022ball bearing\u0022 landing gear and have the whole design\u00A0be HUGE.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nanyway, good luck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOH I almost forgot the way to win, there will be leaderboards for: coolest design, highest top speed, smallest, least number of parts, and how much weight it can support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif someone can come up with a point system that could include all of those for an overall score that would be helpful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ngood luck. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-28T19:54:27Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2017 07:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by rockets-don\u0026#039;t-make-toast\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EpicSpaceTroll139","CreatedById":162839,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-28T13:00:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeems interesting.
