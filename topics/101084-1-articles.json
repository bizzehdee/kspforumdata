It seemed to be ok, but tonight after a few hours in game while using a plane on the ground on Kerban N of KSC, it started crashing again. It crashes with in a couple minutes every time. The plane does have a couple of Karbonite parts on it.\n\nHere are 7 crash report folders:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/ef5rpyki4wox5nk/Vorg%20KSP%20Crash.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ef5rpyki4wox5nk/Vorg%20KSP%20Crash.zip?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T09:36:48Z","Content":"Totally insufficient information here to even remotely troubleshoot this.\n\n(Edit)\n\nHow much RAM is KSP using?

You can only address about 3.5 GB for KSP, the other 12.5 GB can be used by windows and other programs, but not KSP.\n\nYou have too many mods installed. Karbonite is probably the mod that pushed you over the top. You probably need to use -force-openGL (how to do this is all over the forums), Active Texture Management, DDS4Win \u0026 DDSLoader, and/or TextureReplacer (which also has some memory management fixes). One of these might do it, or you might need to use all 3. Personally I\u0027m using -force-openGL and TextureReplacer.\n\nTextures are the main thing that eats up memory fast. RoverDude\u0027s mods are pretty extensive but really efficient for all you get out of them. Some modders use textures that are way too large. You can reduce their size by half and have no visual hit (this is part of what ATM does, and you can have DDS4WIN do)\n\nMods like ScienceAlert don\u0027t use much memory because they are mostly doing calculations and telling the engine to do things (unless there is a memory leak, I use that one myself and there isn\u0027t one there I can tell).\n\nParts mods are usually the memory eaters.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-04T03:53:25Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2015 03:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by helaeon**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vorg","CreatedById":74652,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T07:06:38Z","Content":"I wondered if it was memory cap, but I didn\u0027t think I had that many part mods compaired to what some do.

The other updater based on Debian design seems to complex. I mess with linux for my VDR and it can be a real pain getting the dependencies right. Sometimes it will require something that isn\u0027t required for the modules you use and have to manually edit files to get it to build.\n\nUpdated Scansat which had zero effect on memory usage. Saw a lot of talk about problems with using Ogl, getting stuck in window mode, no shadows, etc., so tried just changing the texture setting to 1/2 first which reduced memory usage by nearly a gig.
