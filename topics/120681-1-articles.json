I\u0027m aware of the current multiplayer mod, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s the right way to go. I think a better multiplayer system for this game would be a competitive \u0022Space Race\u0022 style multiplayer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe idea of this is to essentially create a space race between players. Players are matched up by science level, for match making purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, a level appropriate contract is given to them. Next, the players are given a criteria for winning, either do it cheapest, do it fastest, gather the most science, or do it the most efficiently. Whichever player wins gets earnings from the contract. Perhaps there could be lesser earnings for second, third, fourth place, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat would be the incentive for doing multiplayer contracts vs single player? More earnings. A player who wins a contract in a room with 2 players could say, earn 2 times the normal reward for that contract. A player in a room with 3 players could say earn 3 times the normal reward for that contract. and so on and so fourth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, this would be for single missions. 2 players could also enter a \u0022space race\u0022, which is campaign long. The 2 players start a new campaign in the room. Instead of going just by a contract by contract basis, the entire race could be won when one player completes an OBJECTIVE first. For example, whichever player does, say, a return mission from the Mun first (traditional). Now, to determine who does it \u0022first\u0022, to keep people from abusing time acceleration, the amount of \u0022time\u0022 has gone by could instead be determined by the number of science points level a player is at (not including unspent points, only spent points) when they complete the mission. The player who completes the mission with less technology unlocked would win.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, there are all kinds of scenarios, missions, rewards, etc people could dream up. There could even be a mission creator for people to make their own scenarios, and challenge their friends to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow of course, there should be anti cheating. I think there should be missions and mod packs for vanilla (maybe a couple different mission rooms for varying campaign settings), and some missions or space races should allow for certain approved mods and packs. If the game detects a part that has its values changed, or an unapproved mod, then the player cant join space races or mission rooms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELemme know what you guys think of this idea. The idea is to replicate space races and contract competition between space agencies. Perhaps AI players could be added to give players that experience in single player as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, one more thing, since things are done by spent science level, I also think the tech tree should be reworked to allow for spending science on individual parts, rather than whole packs of parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T07:20:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think most people would like a co-op mode, but PVP is necessary as well. Having major contracts in the same time could force players to compete on the same mission. If they are doing the same mission simultaneously, time warp could be done simultaneously too. So the game will only warp when both players want to warp. That\u0027s a solution. Winning from science? I don\u0027t like that. For multiplayer, the timewarp-problem could be also solved by locking the warp speed. If everyone can only warp on the same speed, the one with the better trajectory will always be the first. That\u0027s a good idea, the only problem is that you couldn\u0027t intercept hostile vehicles, as they would warp away... But there could be different gamemodes. Personally, I prefer that all players are in the same time, and they can accelerate that, if they all want to. If you\u0027re going to be the first to go to Duna, but you want to get there before your opponent performs a moonlanding, that won\u0027t work. Neither in real life. So while he\u0027s wasting time with a slow landing process, you have to wait on your interplanetary trajectory to Duna... Or go back to KSC, and use your time to build another craft. Maybe something that will get to minmus before your rival. AlarmClock integration is necessary, so while you approach minmus, you won\u0027t skip duna.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-12T07:29:02Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2015 07:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainTurbomuffin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"justmeman117","CreatedById":84618,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T08:34:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Winning from science?

I think it would encourage players to really push their limits in ship design. It\u0027s a solution that takes time warp out of the picture, as it is KSP\u0027s single biggest problem to solve in regards to multiplayer. But if you want a more realistic measure of time, then the game could just as easily register what date each player completes the objective by, as there is an in-game calendar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022If everyone can only warp on the same speed, the one with the better trajectory will always be the first.

Note that 2 of these came years before the 1969 lunar landings. And odds are, the US space program might go to mars around the same time the chinese one is just making it to the moon. Planets arent stepping stones, they can be conquered independent of each other if a space agency so chooses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-12T08:37:20Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2015 08:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by justmeman117\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T17:29:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it could be a KSP-esque space race, a long-term game created by a player and hosted, and it would be something like Rockomax vs Jeb\u0027s Junkyard or Kerbodyne, with custom tech trees.
