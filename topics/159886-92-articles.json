SpaceX may also be developing a rocket that may beat out SLS. NASA is likely hoping it\u0027ll be developed, but NASA, having outlived other companies promising the moon (in SpaceX\u0027s case, this is meant literally), and falling short. So it\u0027s no surprise that NASA continues development on SLS. It isn\u0027t to say that NASA won\u0027t use it, it\u0027s a fail safe for if SpaceX makes an irreperable mistake, ff SpaceX ends up shifting development, or even if SpaceX succombs to economic pressures, and goes bankrupt (giant companies have imploded rather suddenly in the past).

The Lunar Module was also behind schedule and overbudget, initially expected to be 500 million dollars before inflating to more than 1 billion dollars in development. As well as running behind schedule with Apollo 8\u0027s original mission profile basically being what Apollo 9 later achieved, but due to delays and the inability to launch before the end of the 1968 year, NASA launched a mission anyway without the Lunar Module.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAs said by someone acting as Tom Kelly in the HBO miniseries \u003Cem\u003EFrom The Earth To The Moon\u003C/em\u003E, speaking on the subject of the Lunar Module development- \u0022Perhaps the main reason we were behind schedule and overbudget was because budgets and schedules are based on previous experience with similar projects. We really didn\u0027t know how much it would cost to build a LM or how long it would take.\u0022 Simple fact is that NASA has no experience with building a super heavy lift vehicle. Even if every part is being reused from a previous design (which for the first stage is just the engines), that still leaves a large portion of the vehicle uncharted territory for NASA. Territory NASA will test, and retest until satisfied to put the lives of several people on top of that rocket in 2022/2023.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAnd an additional quote from the same is another reason for the SLS being costly, \u0022every LM will have to be handmade. There were no suppliers to buy LM parts from, and because everything on a LM was new, everything had to be tested, and tested, and tested again. The thrusters, the engines, the deployment of the landing gear, we would have to know how a LM would react when exposed to extreme sunlight or when pelted with dust. We had to know how the landing gear would perform if the LM would land on a slope. Thousands of tests, day after day, for years. Some of the tests went well. Some of them did not\u0022. Note, \u003Cstrong\u003Eof course I know the SLS is not the Lunar Module, and vice versa\u003C/strong\u003E, but the point is that new rocket, spacecraft or any development of a manned vehicle tested and put through developments for every aspect of every part so that when the launch comes, NASA is as confident as possible with the outcome and this is a style of operation built over 60 years of launching manned spacecraft. Some may claim that NASA has been unwise in the past to choose vehicles like the Space Shuttle, but the fact is NASA has always been pressured towards design compromises and changes by political ideologies, and without drifting into the politics, all that needs to be said is that a NASA has never had a day in it\u0027s existence, whether Freedom 7, Apollo 17, STS-135, or EM-2, the fact remains that there has been and always will be tests, and elaborate review panels on everything NASA does as NASA does not want to make another foobar like the shuttle again and certainly not make the same mistake which cost 14 brave astronauts their lives, and hasty decisions without their review is exactly what caused their deaths in the first place. As someone who\u0027s getting into the aviation industry myself, I can tell you there\u0027s a long and lengthy reason behind everything that agencies like NASA or the FAA does, always. It may not be the \u003Cem\u003Eeconomical\u003C/em\u003E choice, but it\u0027s has a good reason for it. Not that it needs to be the economical choice as again, NASA has the benefit of government funding. Which leads to my next point-\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNASA has the option \u003Cstrong\u003Eto be overbudget\u003C/strong\u003E. It\u0027s why it\u0027s government funded. Fact is large developments such as a super heavy launch vehicle incur unexpected and exceptionally large costs. Things that cannot be predicted as we haven\u0027t built one before. We\u0027ve theorized or conceptualized designs, but as any test pilot will tell you, what\u0027s on paper, does not always equate to what works in reality. And unlike your ventures into KSP, NASA does not use it\u0027s astronauts as test dummies.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAnd the easy answer to the SLS problem may be \u0022but SpaceX\u0022 or \u0022but Blue Origin\u0022 in reference to BFR and New Glenn launch vehicles respectively. They are corporate entities tied to a fluctuating economy with the only guarantee of funding coming from their investors and stock holders, whom can cause a large sway on the companies direction. Not to mention both companies, tied to that same economy, can falter and fail to achieve any of their promises and goals as they go bankrupt. NASA however, has the benefit of not having to worry about stockholder demands or ensuring profitability. \u0022But NASA is subject to Congress\u0027 demands\u0022 yes, but they are limited by the scope of the law, and once funding for a project is set, it is set in stone with NASA wholly set to achieve it and nothing else. Though NASA\u0027s objectives may shift with the change in the political party in the White House, and with the changing presidents dreams and expectations, their funding and their expectations set for them by Congress remain a priority with the president\u0027s demands having to run alongside the current obligations, not in competition.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNASA is not wholly wasteful either- they are \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003ETHE\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E driving force behind companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin, driving reusability and more importantly, ensuring that NASA\u0027s, and more importantly, the American tax dollars, return to the economy well spent, and well used. SLS isn\u0027t meant to be profitable. Like the Space Shuttle, it is intended to be a powerhouse, and more importantly, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ea first of it\u0027s kind\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E. Providing NASA the essential experience and knowledge from developing, operating and flying a super heavy launch vehicle. Information that will undoubtedly prove to be essential for companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin. Elon Musk having even come forward and stating that the knowledge and experience gained from the Space Shuttle helped Musk design and develop the Falcon 9 rocket. The fact is the technology they engineer on their \u0027inefficient\u0027 rockets, still comes around to benefit the aerospace industry as a whole. Though other companies could achieve the first more cost effectively or on a faster schedule, they are unreliable and are subject to changing their focus or failing altogether yielding no benefit whatsoever.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*sigh*\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think I\u0027ve gone on long enough and have made my point quite clear.

As a result, we get Gateway. A useless station that will cost yet more money, all to be occupied so briefly I\u0027m not sure what it does aside from exposing astronauts to higher radiation risks.

That said, it\u0027s galling to see them \u0022reusing\u0022 SSMEs (that saves money!, lol) at a cost of 127 million $ per engine. They cost 40 M$ brand new.
