Its very simple to done in KSP: please add THE MAIN GOAL in the game to stimulate us to reach it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ereach very far planet and build the base on it to collect some science data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo do it we should need:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Collect science \u0022core\u0022 data from all planets in the system (from some point on the planet)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. This data we need to build some blocks on the FAR-FAR planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Create base on far planet, which needs all this data from all planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we can see % of building the base - amount of science data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, for taking some data we should need 2-3 trips to the moon for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the game makes much much more interesting!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe need the main GOAL for the game. After reaching it - we achieve some goals in the steam account and got another more great goal, etc for unviersary time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Parkaboy","CreatedById":64208,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T18:43:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest, I\u0027d really rather they didn\u0027t do that.

The game should never have a \u0022final\u0022 challenge to complete. We should always be able to make more and bigger challenges for ourselves to strive for.
