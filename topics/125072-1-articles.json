The fog should get darker and thicker as you dive down, so that lights are required after reaching 300 meters of depth.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T16:59:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt does get darker and thicker, though I imagine you mean you\u0027d like it even more so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart of the reason it isn\u0027t darker is because the shader isn\u0027t the best, and it runs pretty dark already on some systems. But I think it\u0027s fairly tweakable, so I\u0027m sure some modder will come along to adjust it more.
