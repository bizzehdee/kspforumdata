With a cloud layer almost completely covering the planet[land could still be seen, so you won\u0027t need scansat to land on laythe], once you pass that layer it will be very hazy, and a visible blue horizon from orbit? I\u0027m still thinking of what color the layer should be, so if you guys are down with this idea, I would like if you suggested a color.(I dunno about orange, because titan is already orange and that would seem a tiny bit un-original, but if you guys would be okay with orange that could work very well)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/XseEL\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
