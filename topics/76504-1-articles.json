It could come in 2 forms, ice formations in deep craters and poles, and surface water around geysers. It could also perhaps be extracted from some off-world bodies of water like the oceans of Laythe. This water could be scanned and mapped from orbit, and would be limited enough to require some precision landing of heavy equipment. Once located, it could be extracted and refined into LFO using electricity, just as future real-life missions plan to. My idea is to not just have this provide fuel, but service life support as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew Parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EH20 Detector:\u003C/strong\u003E A long antenna used for mapping sources of H20 on other worlds, either from orbit or with rovers. Science could be earned from detecting it. Similarly, retrieving surface samples of water would have a science multiplier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDrill rig:\u003C/strong\u003E This should be an armature, perhaps 1.25m, and once a craft has landed it could be deployed, orienting and drilling into the ground directly below it. It should draw a decent amount of power, perhaps 2 gigantors to operate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EElectrolyzer\u003C/strong\u003E: This should be a large and very heavy component, and should draw a lot of power to operate at full capacity, perhaps 4 gigantors at kerbin. Its basic purpose is to convert water and electricity into LFO. Once attached and operating, LFO tanks could be filled via right-click either from water tanks or directly from the drill rig.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELife Support Canisters:\u003C/strong\u003E These should come in an array of sizes and shapes, in-line and radial. Each would could hold 3 resources, Oxygen, Water, and Snacks. Each will deplete slowly over time based on the number of Kerbals in the attached craft. As with electricity and monopropellant, crew modules could hold some small, nominal quantity of each as well. For the purpose of flexible mining operations, there should probably also be water-only tanks in a few sizes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGreenhouses:\u003C/strong\u003E Likewise with Electrolyzers these should be large and heavy. Like science modules they should also require 2 Kerbals to operate. Their main purpose is to use electricity (or sunlight when oriented properly) to convert water and oxygen into snacks. I imagine these could come in two forms, a 2.5m cylinder which rotates automatically like solar cells to face the sun, and a 3.75m glass dome. Inside I like the idea of banks of little plants that seem to grow pop-corn straight off the stalk. While operating, the snacks component of life support canisters could be filled via right click.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFuel Cell:\u003C/strong\u003E This should be a medium sized part primarily for on-the-fly resource conversion for long missions. A vessel with one on board could produce electricity and H20 from liquid fuel and O2. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know there\u0027s been a lot of talk about these things in the past, but I think this could be an elegant way of accomplishing a number of things, and would add a huge level of late-game dimension to the game, and make real colonization fun and practical. I think it also opens a number of cool opportunities for clever resource juggling and real problem solving without a maddening number of variables to consider, and ties into real-world ideas about the future of colonization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know there is a lot for the devs to work on before worrying about this.

Or maybe using the fuel cell to combine LFO (but more O) makes more sense?
