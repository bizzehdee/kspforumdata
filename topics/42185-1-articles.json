If you have such a high TWR you should be able to get quite a lot faster than 1.6-1.8 at 30-odd-thousand. This suggests to me that not all of your thrust is being directed into forward velocity, or to put it another way, it sounds like you might be forced to take a high angle of attack (nose up) at high altitude so that your engines can keep you up there, meaning some of their thrust is being \u0022wasted\u0022 as lift, which suggests you might need more lift so you can fly closer to nose-level. Add a couple of high lift surfaces, either delta wings, or the long straight ones, or even a couple of small delta winglets (0.7 lift each, and very light). This will also mean your intakes get more air, and you can fly even higher. I find that if you break 2100-2200 at 35000 getting to orbit only takes a little bit of a squirt (at 45 degrees nose up) to pop you up above the atmosphere, and usually only requires one or two quite small engines like LV909\u0027s or LVT45s.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-13T02:29:15Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2013 02:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iueras","CreatedById":76413,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T16:30:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank for all the answers guy, you are all awesome!
