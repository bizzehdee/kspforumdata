From the central tank hangs the sci modules, and capsule, anything that will be left at the desitination I usually attach to the bottom of the capsule, so that it can be dropped once the lander is down, and if necessary the lander then lifts out of the way. For larger items that won\u0027t safely fit in the clearance the landing legs give, I have successfully mounted items to the top of the lander, detached them, and used RCS to get them off of there. Best advice I have is find what works best for you. Well, I\u0027m off to send some probes off to Duna, or at least attempt to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T07:37:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWasted (it felt that way) a lot of time to get Kethane from Minmus to Kerbin - therefore I ruled: I have the infrastructure in place, I can rendezvous and dock reliably, high part counts will kill my performance and slow down my game, so as I have the Kethane in Kerbin orbit, I will just fill/empty the tanks of the ship/tanker via a savegame edit. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday I will dock my Dune Lander to my Duna-Return vessel and speed up time to reach my interesting mission points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am somehow completely inept to built a simple atmospheric plane to visit Kerbin\u0027s anomalies/easter eggs - maybe I will pass on them to finally get to a new career in .24 after finishing my .23 missions and try again later, yes, that will do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brapness","CreatedById":73986,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T07:51:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStarted up the new career mode, accepted first launch contract, Jeb launches on a simple pod on SRB rocket.
