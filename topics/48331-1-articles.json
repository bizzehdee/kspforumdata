We as players know that the end of Kerbins atmosphere is at 70,000 meters. BUT, did you know, that even though the atmosphere goes that far up, you actually hit the vacuum of space about 23,000 meters before that? Check this screen grab I got while launching a deep space communication satellite in preparations for .22 in the hopes that we keep our save files intact. Anyway, I turned on my pressure experiment prior to launch and watched the numbers.
