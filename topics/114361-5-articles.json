I pick the OKTO and start wiggling it around trying to bring it closer to the center, increasingly desperate as it tries to explore all corners of the VAB but absolutely refuses to move towards the center. Since the ship is in ghost state, I can\u0027t even pick a new root part and bring a new OKTO. In my increasingly desperate attempts an errant click makes me let go of the OKTO.
