Two separate models, or the same model with both internal and external placed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, how do I \u0022hollow out\u0022 the inside, so to speak? That\u0027s one of my biggest problems. How do I get the polygons facing inwards, and how do I get stuff lined up, etc, etc\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan I simply make the model have an \u0022internal\u0022 area, then make a windshield over it, then build the IVA inside?

The real trick is making sure as already mentioned that the parts line up, this can be a little tricky if your exterior doesnt have it\u0027s origin in the center of the cockpit but a bit of fiddling will sort it out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen its just a matter of putting the interior parts in the correct layers, its the layers in unity that enable things to be visible or invisible in camera views , and let items be used for or by kerbals. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took a while for me to work this all out for myself, but if you search out all of the various posts on IVA\u0027s there\u0027s enough info to mash together and come to some basic understanding, unfortunately it\u0027s not all in one glorious step by step tutorial.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps a bit, however if you find you cant work it out after repeated attempts bung me the model files and i\u0027ll do it for you no worries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-18T13:17:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2014 01:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SpannerMonkey(smce)\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypos format\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
