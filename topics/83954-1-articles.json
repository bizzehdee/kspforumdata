I\u0027ve found, though, if I could have one display, this would be immensely easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDe-orbiting is pretty straightforward. The part that\u0027s problematic is when it comes time for the vertical powered descent. Mechjeb, for some reason (perhaps due to me using RSS), likes to kill my crew (\u0022Oh, you told me to touch down at 0.2 m/s? You mean 200 m/s, right?\u0022), so I can\u0027t use it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsually I put myself in a position where after the de-orbit (nulling horizontal velocity), I\u0027m at an altitude of about 10 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the trick is getting the right vertical speed for the right altitude. This is fairly easy to calculate, though. If I\u0027m going only, say, 30 m/s at 8 km, then I waste a lot of fuel and time. But of course, if I\u0027m going too fast too low, then I\u0027ll end up smacking into the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve graphed this here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.desmos.com/calculator/hgxtqzadik\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.desmos.com/calculator/hgxtqzadik\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConstants to enter are a, g, and m.

That\u0027s okay. Just cut off the engine (or minimize the throttle if you\u0027re using the Engine Ignitor mod), let yourself fall into the corridor (you\u0027ll drift right and down with your engine off), and start using it when you enter the corridor.

See how the indicator arrows for altitude and hdot are on the same bar? As long as they\u0027re close to eachother, then your descent rate is probably pretty good. You only need a general feel of where they are until you get down to the last 20 meters or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for HDDOT; That\u0027s not two indicators, that\u0027s just a little bow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the little numbers at the top:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ET 61 is telling you your throttle is 61.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEST T is the computer\u0027s estimate of how long it\u0027ll take you to touch down (in seconds) based on your current altitude, speed, and throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFUEL is how many seconds of fuel you have left burning at your current rate. Because you\u0027re constantly hovering against gravity, this won\u0027t change by a whole lot, so you can trust this number to be a pretty good estimate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your EST T is larger than FUEL, be concerned.

Idea: maybe have a \u0022set abort limit\u0022 button, where you click it so this computation only has to run once, at the beginning of the descent, rather than always running? That would save a lot of processing and make the line solid, which would be nicer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lower green curve is the \u003Cstrong\u003Eprimary\u003C/strong\u003E curve I linked on desmos at the start of this post.

I got that idea from the Space Shuttle\u0027s re-entry display \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and little green bars indicate altitude. (8k, 6k, 4k, 3k, 2k)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no info on fuel, because if you\u0027ve designed the craft to be able to do this mission, and you stay in the envelope made by the two green lines, then fuel won\u0027t be an issue. If you go above the envelope too long \u003Cem\u003Ewith the engines on*\u003C/em\u003E, though, then you might have to start worrying about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the display can be dynamically scaled to work for any craft: simply have the upper altitude at 10km, and the maximum velocity will be determined by the \u003Cstrong\u003Eprimary curve\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPage 2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter you cross the 2 km altitude line, the display automatically flips to page 2 (Again, idea from Space Shuttle \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E ). You get the exact same data on this page, except the graph has been scaled for clarity. Also, a third line is added to widen the corridor, and because at this point you don\u0027t want to be so close to your limit, so it encourages the pilot to proceed at a safer pace.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPage 3:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 200 m you go into this mode. ALT, HDOT, and HDDOT now have graphical displays so you can immediately ascertain your situation. Note how altitude and hdot indicator arrows are on the same bar: with how this is set up, as long as they\u0027re close to eachother, you should be safe. You should only start getting concerned if the hdot side is way above the altitude side; and because of how it\u0027s set up graphically; you can tell at a glance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Hddot scale is determined by the planet\u0027s gravity; it goes from 1g to -1g (engines off). Note that most of the displays here are exponential rather than linear. This way you can know where you are if the number is large, and know with high precision where you are when the number is small. Also, it\u0027s one indicator; that\u0027s not two arrows, that\u0027s a single little bow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe compass on the right is centered towards the center of the moon/planet. The white cross is your nose\u0027 heading, and how far off from vertical it is in degrees (marked in white). The yellow indicator is your horizontal velocity. Either move the nose or tap the RCS to adjust so that it\u0027s in the middle. The yellow numbers are m/s surface horizontal speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ET at top-left is Throttle on the main engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEST T is estimated time to touchdown, based on altitude, hdot, and hddot, in seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFUEL is how many seconds of fuel you have left burning at your current rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESooo, yeah. This whole thing was inspired by Raster Prop Monitor, actually (RPM).

The upper curve is for 90% throttle, so use 2.25 m/s^2 for that.
