If you\u0027ve got FAR, you can give yourself a few degrees of pitch above retrograde for a lifting effect, keeping you in high atmosphere longer, bleeding off speed in the Goldilocks drag zone. It does increase risk of exposing a part to reentry burn: if you have asymmetric parts (particularly the Pegasus I ladders*), you will often want to rotate the capsule so that the bulky parts are on the bottom, since they will be more shielded from reentry burn that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*RCS thrusters are also frequent offenders, but since they\u0027re generally radially symmetric, there\u0027s no real solution to that, other than making sure your heatshield gives you enough of a shadow to hide the RCS, and not having too extreme of pitch. Also, what I call the \u0022Goldilocks drag zone\u0022 is that region of atmosphere which will give you substantial drag in a short amount of time, without immediately stripping your heatshield off. Spend too long in really high atmosphere, and you lose speed too slowly: you will start heading for low atmosphere without shedding much horizontal velocity. Go in too steep, and you go straight to lower atmosphere, do not pass Go, do not collect $200.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-12T01:59:25Z\u0022 title=\u002211/12/2014 01:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starman4308\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-12T01:59:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starman4308\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starman4308\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAt some point, my morbid curiosity will have me trawling through the DRE and RealChute threads to find out how many people have complained about parachutes burning up.

Unless perhaps the intent was to simulate skin temperature without raising the entire part\u0027s temperature, which makes a certain amount of sense. One might assume that the shield is going to pick up X amount from the shockwave. Involving air density seems a bit strange though because most of the shield\u0027s loss would be from pyrolysis. Using air density makes me think erosion, which should really only happen to the charred part of the shield.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t agree though that dissipation should be a constant because it\u0027s losing heat because some of it was carried away by the shield material that ablated away. It\u0027s like the water in the paper cup analogy. Where did the heat go that should have ignited the paper cup? Answer is, it boiled off with the water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line is probably that I\u0027ll come back and revisit this at some point. Maybe make loss dependent on part temperature outright instead of playing around with yet another curve. If I did that then I would bump the dissipation rate to compensate for letting the shield get so hot. (which is actually ok now because we\u0027re setting heatConductivity to 0.01 now for ModuleHeatShield. It can get as hot as it wants and not transmit any of that to other parts)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, I did reduce ridiculousMaxTemp, but not nearly as much as I was talking about doing before. Given your experience with high TWR rockets in full sized RSS, I\u0027m interested in how that turns out for you.
