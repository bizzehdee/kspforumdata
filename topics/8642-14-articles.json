Using parts from about a dozen plugins and such, the Mun is no longer a thing that Kerbals just look up and wonder about at night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, due to my lack of piloting prowess, I choose to use MechJeb a bunch. (Actually its mostly to land on a dime while my landings are \u0027somewhere over yonder\u0027 style). My latest Mun Project, MunLab I, stacks a re-designed MunBase module on top of a big ol\\\u0027 rocket and, I figured since I seem to lose BigTraks more than I can land them, I should throw a whole bunch on there. Using a radial mechjeb to control the now unmanned and autonomous Munolith and Public Transportation craft, I figured that these puddle jumpers would be the bees knees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, they are not. Upon reaching the mun and preparing to land them one by one (after I got the Lab down of course), I found that I had no control over the beasties like I would if they had a capsule in them. They are still orbiting the Mun, trash for the ages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was under the impression that the MechJeb modules would allow me to control my craft, sans capsule, as long as it had an SAS module.
