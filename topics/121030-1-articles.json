The part basically is an all in one part which has engines, IVA etc. My wish is to add some \u0022emergency boosters\u0022, just hit an action key and you can accelerate much faster thanks to extra engines. I have already put down thrustTransforms to support this on the model, my problem is that the extra engines I\u0027ve added don\u0027t show up in the actions group and hence, I can\u0027t even turn them on (they don\u0027t come on during staging either for some reason). Any help at all would be appreciated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany thanks for the time!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
