I went to Ike and back, with no issues. I decided to do the same with Duna, but I modded my lander by adding a propeller engine with 6 helicopter blades attached to it. I landed on Duna without issues. This craft has the gear on board to refuel, so I hopped out, planted a surface base, started the drills, and waited. Once the tanks were filled, I\u00A0quicksaved in case I messed up, and tried to take off. This is my problem right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy propeller engine seems to be broken. I\u0027ve linked it to custom group 9 for easy use, and it worked fine during testing at Kerbin. On Duna however, the blades only spin at 6-7 rpm, and all of the info the motor can give me is 0. Basically, it thinks it has no fuel, no air, and no power. This is most definitely not the case, and without my prop, I don\u0027t have the delta v to return to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdvice?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-06T10:29:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat kind of engine are you using?
