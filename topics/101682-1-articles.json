This means it would be practical to add a second rendering mode or some other feature to allow for far rendering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think KSP could be ported, but I suspect the project could take a year or so before KSP was capable of the same level of features it is right now. And, for what benefit? UE4 does have what have to be some of the world\u0027s best graphics, but you need a huge team of artists and modelers to create the content to actually display with these high end graphics techniques. Squad doesn\u0027t have such a team. They have, what, 1-2 artists and modelers, total?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason KSP looks like it does - pretty ok but not ultra amazing, is because of this limited budget and time for fancy art, fancy lightning, fancy models, etc. Unity, especially version 5, has more or less the same rendering features as UE4. (UE4 may be tuned a little better or something, but essentially you can do the same stuff in either engine)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
