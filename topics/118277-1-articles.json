Found out that a fully loaded 2.5 kontainer is too heavy for a single skipper or mainsail engine for reentry (even with a lot of parachutes). \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I kinda tweaked Stage Recovery\u0027s minimum reentry speed from 12 to 16 :\u0022\u0026gt; which didn\u0027t work under 70km altitude but does fine with a 80km altitude. My 2 tests at that height, going.... retrograde or prograde (I forgot which is which :\u0022\u0026gt; ) with a burn that would make the lowest altitude of my decent be between 5k - 10km while still above 70km while I can still switch focus to another ship.
