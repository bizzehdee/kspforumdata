Go into your KSP folder and go to Saves -\u0026gt; the current save game you were working on -\u0026gt; Ships and then look in the VAB and SPH folders for .craft files that are only 1kb in size and delete them. That should fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Carsogen","CreatedById":120905,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T04:52:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had this issue once as well and I have a solution:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck in the save folder you\u0027re currently working with that in the \u0022ships\u0022 folder, both the VAB and SPH folders are present.
