The 2 halves are shaped so they can\u0027t dock, and with SAS you pull the clamps farther apart. The clamp pulls the back half closer, which bumps into the front half accelerating it. So SAS pushes the front half away, the clamp pulls the back half closer, and when it bumps into the front it speeds up. Total violation of conservation of energy for sure. I\u0027m wondering if i can keep them connected if I could reach orbit via slow acceleration. Or, maybe an electric glider on kerbin? Powered by clamps!

Video proof attached of a release at **507 m/s**. However I cannot manage to hit Kerbin reentry that well anymore, maybe I\u0027ll give it a try tomorrow. I\u0027m always releasing at a bit of an angle and thus gain too much velocity perpendicular to the orbit plane to reach atmosphere. For the record I did not add a single strut for this, the only change is I emptied the monoprop from the capsules.\nIt can handle tension just fine, it\u0027s shear that destroys it, and if I spin it up slowly it holds up quite well.
