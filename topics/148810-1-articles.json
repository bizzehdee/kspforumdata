I am new to the kerbal community and really hoping y\u0027all can help\u00A0me out! I am writing a novel about life among the clouds of Venus and I need help figuring out some basic science about how people would do it. I have done quite a bit of research online but there still remains a number of questions I can\u0027t seem to answer. They are as follows:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. What is the range of atmospheric pressure above Venus in the range of 20-50 Km?\u00A0I understand that near the top would be about 1 bar.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. What would the temperature range be like in this 20-50 km area? I have heard wildly different estimates. Some say that towards the bottom of this 20 km the temperature would be near tropical climate and that higher up, close to the 50 km, the temp would be closer to sub-polar. Then again, others have said that even near the top of this range the temp would be well above 150 Fahrenheit. This would imply that it would be even warmer the lower you go.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. My third question should be fairly easy to clear up. The habitat design in my book mimics airships. The things I need to know are how much mass can a given quantity of air lift, and what would be the pros and cons of helium, hydrogen, and earth air. Should there be any other gases I should consider?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. The highest mountain on Venus is about 11 km as I understand. Would it be practical to mine resources from mountain tops to fuel an expanding economy? If it wouldn\u0027t, what other options would there be? My understanding is that asteroids would be too far away to be practical and that the atmosphere wouldn\u0027t have enough elements to meet all of the expected needs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. How hard would it be to get water from sulfuric acid?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre there any other things I need to know? Remember, I am a noob at this and really want my book to be scientifically accurate. Thanks a ton for any help you can offer me!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-28T01:23:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nOne atmosphere of pressure.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n80 degrees fahrenheit.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou could use oxygen, helium, or hydrogen.

Of course, earths fossil resources are long depleted and these have to be produced artificially. While it is certainly not wasted in cars anymore, it remains useful chemistry precursor (not least because there is a lot of inherited infrastructure) and one of best packages of chemical energy. Bioengineering is a good bet, so let\u0027s have some nice catastrophe that would lead to \u003Cs\u003Eworldwide\u003C/s\u003E earthwide ban. Answer would be to move all bioindustry outside earth, because anything spaceborne is by definition contained and tightly controlled. Obviously, there would have to be already established infrastructure to build stuff in space - hauling everything up the Well is not going to work out. So lets assume asteroid mining is a thing already and this dangeours biostuff is actually a last thing to poison earth. Conglomerates of biotech corporations just need to order development and production of necessary technology in Geo or Phobian shipyards and move their business to Titan, Io, Venus or anywhere useful really (IMO that would be mostly just plain space).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote this changes OPs scenario a bit, human settlement is just cream on top of much larger industrial complex, working at various \u003Cs\u003Eheights\u003C/s\u003E depths. And I mean LARGE - moving stuff around solar system is not going to work out unless we are talking some serious economy of scale. Energy budget of chemistry involved is so big that moving in a bit of uranium to power machinery is just negligible. Venus would be about most difficult of such places anyway, since one need to spend lots of produce just to make fuel to get stuff up to orbit. But inhabitants are proud of it because hey, at least we don\u0027t have to spend lives in pressurized radiation hardened cans like stinky martians.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andrew Zachary Foreman","CreatedById":169475,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-28T13:29:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222777385\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022148810\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221475030050\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022127797\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bill Phil\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, Bill Phil said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 \u0026amp; 2: I have no idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3: I can\u0027t help you there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4: They likely do, after all, living in Venus\u0027 atmosphere implies a space faring species.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5: I don\u0027t know about the GMO bacterium creating energy from CO2, breaking it down usually takes energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHydrogen can\u0027t explode when there is no Oxygen to oxidize it (like in Venus\u0027 atmo).

Answer would be to move all bioindustry outside earth, because anything spaceborne is by definition contained and tightly controlled. Obviously, there would have to be already established infrastructure to build stuff in space - hauling everything up the Well is not going to work out. So lets assume asteroid mining is a thing already and this dangeours biostuff is actually a last thing to poison earth.

Energy budget of chemistry involved is so big that moving in a bit of uranium to power machinery is just negligible. Venus would be about most difficult of such places anyway, since one need to spend lots of produce just to make fuel to get stuff up to orbit.

Not needed for your scenario. You won\u0027t be building new habitats unless that was your starting goal. But you can probably get by with as close to a closed loop as possible. The daily requirements for things like iron and calcium are incredibly low, a single block of iron will be good for your 100 people. So there\u0027s really nothing needed from the surface.
