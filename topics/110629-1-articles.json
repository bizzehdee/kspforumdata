I\u0027ve flown real de Havilland Chipmunk T10s which use the old Gipsy Major engine dating back to the pre-war Tiger Moth. It\u0027s basically a poor man\u0027s Spitfire, certainly the same tech level as the Spitfire and has been the official pre-Spitfire trainer from just after the war until the present day; it\u0027s just smaller and the most it\u0027s armed with is a recon/spy camera (used as spy planes over Cold War Berlin). It can\u0027t handle negative g to any great extent, the carbs just send the fuel back over the cockpit canopy instead of into the engine, stalling the engine if you let it (but it will windmill start again as soon as it gets fuel). Positive g, no problem at all. In that type of aircraft, the other reason for positive g only (inverted, or otherwise), is being able to see where you are going, with unlimited upward visibility and very little downward visibility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESitting in the cockpit, negative g is indeed unpleasant; positive g a whole load of fun.
