That\u0027s a reasonable choice when it\u0027s mostly supersonic flight that\u0027s being modelled. With that type of wing, it\u0027s all about angle of attack, namely the angle of the wing relative to the prograde vector, so it makes no difference which way up you are, only the angle of the wings to the airflow.\n\nInverted flight would only really be relevant with classic aerofoil shapes, and I\u0027m not sure that KSP\u0027s aerodynamics would even simulate that.\n\nThe end result should be the same for nose 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 below prograde with the plane normal side up, or 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 below (still down towards the ground) prograde with the plane inverted, assuming that the plane is basically symmetric vertically (simple tails and the cockpit bump shouldn\u0027t make a big difference whether they are on top or bottom).

I\u0027ve flown real de Havilland Chipmunk T10s which use the old Gipsy Major engine dating back to the pre-war Tiger Moth. It\u0027s basically a poor man\u0027s Spitfire, certainly the same tech level as the Spitfire and has been the official pre-Spitfire trainer from just after the war until the present day; it\u0027s just smaller and the most it\u0027s armed with is a recon/spy camera (used as spy planes over Cold War Berlin). It can\u0027t handle negative g to any great extent, the carbs just send the fuel back over the cockpit canopy instead of into the engine, stalling the engine if you let it (but it will windmill start again as soon as it gets fuel). Positive g, no problem at all. In that type of aircraft, the other reason for positive g only (inverted, or otherwise), is being able to see where you are going, with unlimited upward visibility and very little downward visibility.\n\nSitting in the cockpit, negative g is indeed unpleasant; positive g a whole load of fun. The Chipmunk is rated for \u002B6/-3.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T18:08:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 06:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Murph**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ruedii","CreatedById":57704,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T18:13:42Z","Content":"The wings in KSP are symetrical, this means they only create significant lift when they are angled upwards.
