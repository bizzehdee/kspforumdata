The point of the shields is to deflect the high speed air away from the vessel. This in turn keeps the aircraft from heating up as much from old devil friction, thus they must extend just a hair to create that gap. IRL the heat-shielding actually rolls up the side a little to create the seamless transition . For the fairing bases its so the fairings have a place to connect their bases to. Thus making a clean top down profile.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T23:34:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat part doesn\u0027t bother me, but the thing that does bug me about the heatshields is that the attachment node is so far below the physical part of the heat shield.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
