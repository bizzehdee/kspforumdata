Suppose I want 10 kN of sideways force and 1000 kN of upwards force, then using a gimballed engine I need sqrt(10\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u002B1000\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E) = 1000.05 kN of total thrust. But using a fixed engine and a Vernor I need 10\u002B1000 = 1010 kN of total thrust. The Vernor is using \u003Cem\u003Etwo hundred times\u003C/em\u003E as much fuel on turning as the gimballing engine is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t agree with your math.. \u00A0First, the total thrust of the gimbal engine is always along the hypotenuse and it can\u0027t ever produce more than its max thrust. \u00A0Thus, forwards thrust is reduced due to the sideways thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, you\u0027re assuming the gimbal provides EXACTLY the desired amount of sideways force at EXACTLY the right time. \u00A0This never, ever happens. \u00A0The gimbal is all-or-nothing and the\u00A0angle it can move is always (unless you take the time to tune it) considerably more than you really need at the time. \u00A0And the powerful lifter engine is running at full thrust. \u00A0The result is that you get WAY more sideways force than you want or need, causing the over-control oscillations and tail-wagging typical of gimbal-using rockets. \u00A0This reduces forward thrust to the frequent off-line thrusting,and increases drag considerably due to the rocket frequently being off the prograde heading in the oscillations and wobbles. \u00A0The result is needing a fair amount more fuel than not using gimbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird, have you ever even used Vernors? \u00A0They really consume utterly negligible amounts of fuel even on rockets weighing a over a\u00A0thousand tons. \u00A0I\u0027m talking maybe 5m/s worth in total for an SSTO lifter that big from the pad to a 100km orbit. \u00A0And the vast bulk of that is spent orienting the monster for the circularization burn at Ap, not during the gravity turn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the thing is, even for really big rockets, you only need a tiny amount of force, carefully applied, to do a gravity turn. \u00A0Certainly it\u0027s way less than you get from the gimbal of a powerful 1st stage engine at full thrust. \u00A0And Vernors give you that, in a smooth, carefully controlled way so you avoid the wobbles and shakes of using gimbal, and thereby stay more on the prograde line so have less drag. \u00A0Either way, you need less fuel keeping the main engine pointing straight ahead than you do by letting it rattle around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n43 minutes ago, cantab said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t see any advantage to using Vernors when a gimbal-capable main engine is running.
