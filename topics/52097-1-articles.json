This is on a stock game, except for the tree loader mod. Am I missing something? This is the only part that seems to give a false science gain report. Is this a bug with the stock part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kilmeister","CreatedById":65062,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T15:52:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI noticed the same thing last night.

Seismic Scan has 2.5, Gravity Scan has 3, and Atmosphere Analysis has 10, everything else has 1. I\u0027m not sure why they have that display multiplier, maybe immersion where your kerbals think it will be more useful than it is or something. I\u0027m thinking its just a misinterpreted feature since I haven\u0027t seen a developer confirm it as an actual bug.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T17:11:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERead HarvesteR\u0027s post \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/53793-Atmospheric-Analysis-reported-science-value-is-10-times-the-recovered-value?p=718132\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post718132\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the question has been answered and it\u0027s a known issue, plus there\u0027s nothing to really discuss (feel free to post in the above thread if you feel the need), this thread shall now be closed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
