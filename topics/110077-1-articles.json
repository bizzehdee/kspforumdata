I wanted to see if it would be possible to provide an in-game warning when a user set amount of RAM usage is reached. This would be your sign to save and exit the game, or at least give you a heads up that a crash is coming in the near future. \n\nI would love to see a warning to notify me that I have hit 3 GB of RAM and should prepare for a crash that is coming soon. I often do not pay attention to task manager when I finally get into a groove with whatever I may be doing."},{"CreatedByName":"Vectura","CreatedById":119212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T09:18:03Z","Content":"Well, sorry to say this, but [Moderator removed defunct website link] is a mod that does this\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-08-28T15:18:22Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2022 03:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by James Kerman**\n  \nlink removed"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T09:24:25Z","Content":"Seeing as this is in S\u0026DD, I take it you want Squad to implement an in-game memory warning, I\u0027d suggest making the game *not* require any such thing."},{"CreatedByName":"Vectura","CreatedById":119212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T09:52:03Z","Content":"Heh, I can agree that would be a good place to start ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"kungfufishstick","CreatedById":144240,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T09:56:30Z","Content":"Wow!
