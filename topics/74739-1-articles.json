If you do any survival training, you\u0027ll learn that the best place to store excess energy is often in your body. Got food that might spoil? Eat it before it does. Your body will store as much as it can. Gorging when you have the food available is a very viable strategy, but you won\u0027t be able to sustain really hard exertion for nearly as long as someone who can load-up on thousands of calories before a marathon can. Eat all the things, then take it slow and steady. Same goes for water. Best place to store it is inside you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECome to think of it...the human body is remarkable.
