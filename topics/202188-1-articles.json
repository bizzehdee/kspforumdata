Been on a nostalgia kick through the KSP fanfiction classics recently, so decided to write a wee story about it all. Enjoy!]\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWho was Roncald Kerman?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you asked Linus, the head of R\u0026amp;D here at the Kerbal Space Center, he\u0027d tell you Roncald was a brilliant but distracted student, whose mind tended to wander at the slightest provocation.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you asked Gene, the leading CAPCOM controller, he\u0027d tell you Roncald was a harmless layabout, scatter-brained and occasionally injury-prone.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you asked Agani Kerman, head of Reconnaissance and Surveys, she\u0027d flatly tell you Roncald was an aimless idiot with the common sense of a rock.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nRoncald himself would probably um and ahh before forgetting the topic and swiftly, awkwardly, moving on. But I was there. I can tell you that while\u00A0yes, Roncald was scatter-brained, distracted and certainly injury prone, he was certainly not aimless. He was an R\u0026amp;D intern, one of the new crop brought in by Linus after old Wernher died. Linus replaced Wernher as the head of R\u0026amp;D, but unlike Wernher, he was a practical kerbal, business-minded, realistic. The delusions of Duna landings and grand, gravity-assisted tours through the kerbolar system faded. Gradually, the R\u0026amp;D interns lost that special edge that had so defined the program in its early years. Sure, there were still brilliant technologies and ideas, but the mad grandeur and insane scale of Wernher\u0027s ambitions died with him. The Kerbal Space Program became a quieter affair,\u00A0managing what little budget it was given on retreading the worn paths rather than striving for the unknown. That was simply the way everyone worked.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEveryone, that is, except for Roncald.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe spark of creative insanity hadn\u0027t been dampened from within him: rather, it had grown, with an unquenchable thirst for adventure. Imaginary motherships of interplanetary missions danced in his head when he slept, and visions of Mun bases swam in the diffused darkness of his daydreams. Roncald was a dreamer, a visionary, and a madman. He was also what the Space Program desperately needed.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne sunny afternoon, while retrofitting on the last Dynawing orbiter was taking place in the Spaceplane Hangar, Roncald was sent off the Island Airfield, a few miles east of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Whether it was for genuine use or because they wanted him to get out from under their hair for a few days, the technicians told him to inventory the spare parts kept at the disused hangars there, and Roncald happily accepted. I accompanied him, although I wasn\u0027t sure whether I was actually interested, or just going along to protect him from himself.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe had provisions, a radio, and the outpost barracks from the war a few years back to sustain us. It was a bit like camping, if you call being surrounded by silent trees and old aviation parts \u0027exciting\u0027.\u00A0 For Roncald though, the main attraction were the radar-cloaking, high-altitude jet fighters secreted away in the back of the hangars. There were nine altogether in various states of dismemberment and disrepair: these things were nearly forty years old. Practically antiques. I couldn\u0027t deny, however, that the sleek, rocket-like fuselages and powerful Whiplash-class jet engines excited me. They were relics from an age of glory, discovery, and wonder...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen the ferry from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E came to pick us up, Roncald told them he had to stay, finish working on something. The crew back home were all too happy to keep him away for any extra amount of time, and agreed hastily. I gave him a wave, and asked how he\u0027d be getting home.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Ah, um, I\u0027m sure I can manage.\u0022 he told me, scratching the side of his neck.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI never did tell anyone that Roncald had neglected to note down one of the jets in the inventory takings. Gus didn\u0027t either, he just took the \u0027eight fighters\u0027 for truth with no questions asked. A pretty lax attitude from our Head of Operations.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe didn\u0027t see Roncald for a while after that. I wasn\u0027t worried; he had more than enough provisions for a few weeks at the airfield. The poor bugger\u00A0could\u0027ve lived there for the rest of the year if he\u0027d wanted to: like everyone else, I simply assumed he was taking some alone time.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nUntil, of course, the incident five days later.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI was roused from my bunk in the construction complex by a gibbering Gus, and ushered into Mission Control, to be met with disapproving glares from Linus, Gene, and PR Director Walt, making a rare appearance.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Whass tha matter?\u0022 I mumbled, my speech slurred with the aftereffects of sleep.\u003Cbr\u003E\nGene stepped forward and jabbed the nearest radar screen with a trembling finger.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022THIS is the bloody matter.\u0022 he spat, indicating a small green dot rapidly moving away from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNonplussed, I stared straight back at him.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022So... what? One of the Survey pilots couldn\u0027t resist a view of home on his way past. It happens.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLinus coughed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022We thought so too, until it appeared on the radar screens mid-flight. As you and everyone else at this facility well know, cloaking technology has been banned in any use for more than thirty years, so a random radar ping showing up from the middle of the ocean was very strange indeed.\u0022 he continued, shuffling over to a small terminal to my left.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Well, okay then,\u0022 I reply, \u0022but what\u0027s it got to do with-\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022We also,\u0022 interrupts Linus, cutting me off abruptly and impatiently, \u0022received this audio transmission from the aircraft.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe pressed a button, and a sibilant voice hissed to life from the terminal\u0027s speakers.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Unidentified flying object, this is the Kerbal Space Center. Please identify yourself or risk destruction, over.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere was a pause, and then a voice replied jovially. It was crackly and distorted with atmospheric sound and static, but it was quite clearly Roncald.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Kerbal Space Center, this is Roncald Kerman, flying the future. Just thought I\u0027d let you say hello before I burned for orbit, catch a glimpse, you know. Say hello to Barkley from the Construction Sector for me.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nGene grabbed a remote from\u00A0a nearby table and flicked it at the main plasma screen in the center of the room. he screen blinked to life and showed a picture clearly taken from Kerbin orbit. In it, Roncald grinned at the camera through the visor of an old spacesuit, with a crudely modified jet fighter visible off to the left: the central engine appeared to have been torn out and replaced with a prototype Aerospike rocket. Kerbin hung in the background, like a present under the Kerbmas tree.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022One of our lunar scopes picked this image up from Kerbin orbit. Care to shed some light on precisely WHY one of our R\u0026amp;D interns has entered orbit in a cobbled together, illegal jet-fighter and a load of museum pieces? Seeing as said intern explicitly mentioned YOUR name in his communications?\u0022 Gene shouts,\u00A0 his left eyebrow raised crossly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDespite the slightly precarious situation, I can\u0027t help but look at the craft. It\u0027s hard to tell because the craft is partially obscured by the lighting and the angle the picture was taken at, but it looks like it\u0027s all in one piece. Which means, for the first time in the Space Program\u0027s history, there\u0027s a single-stage-to-orbit spacecraft actually orbiting Kerbin. I look up to the ceiling, tuning Gene\u0027s angry rant out, and imagining Roncald floating above my head.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EGodspeed, you glorious idiot.\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022OoVYO4i.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/OoVYO4i.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
