A hotly contested piece of work, even today... especially today, although now it\u0027s been submerged into obscurity by the so-called \u0027intelligentsia\u0027. I\u0027ll always note to potential readers, that Jensen set out to prove bias in mental testing. Lo and behold his surprise when all his results showed naught.

Once a \u0022consensus\u0022 has developed that matches the social trends in society, real empirical data collection, as you (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/114700-LordFerret\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELordFerret\u003C/a\u003E) have correctly stated, the collection of data and the debate stops. One thing that made Western civilization great was the Enlightenment; what we are witnessing now is the Second Great Dark Ages (as I have named it) where real intellectual debate, study, research, and experimentation is beginning to come to an end.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
