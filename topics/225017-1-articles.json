They\u0027ll pivot. Their viewers are in the same boat as all of us, looking for the next game to latch on to, and the content will adjust. The chaos of the switch would have been distracting, but I think they got the view spike on the scandal that hopefully compensates a little. And I don\u0027t think there will be a vacuum for long. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a game quite like what KSP2 was meant to be anywhere on the horizon, but plenty of other games that would be interesting to that community in the mean time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dprostock","CreatedById":195079,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-04T23:53:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224395341\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022225017\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221717425593\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 6/3/2024 at 11:39 AM, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoney?
