Here\u0027s a link to the CurseForge page where it is maintained/released:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/221761-stanford-torus-0-5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/221761-stanford-torus-0-5\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt includes a Mass Accelerator part, but those parts provide FAR too little acceleration, and have far too high of a per-unit price (in Career Mode), to actually be usable...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mod is licensed under a CDDL 1.0 license, however- an open source lincense meaning that any part of the product can be modified, reproduced, and/or redistributed provided the source is still provided (the license also requires the Initial Developer to provide a copy of the source), and it is noted who the Initial Developer was and who made the modifications to the product...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://opensource.org/licenses/CDDL-1.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://opensource.org/licenses/CDDL-1.0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, I would like some help in creating a fork of just the Mass Accelerator from this awesome mod, and up-rating it to realistic force levels (giving credit to michaelhester07 for his awesome original work, of course). The part currently produces 250 kN of force per second (each part produces 250 kN of force for 0.5 seconds, and they can be stacked), whereas a real-world mass accelerator proposal as part of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarTram\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EStar Tram system\u003C/a\u003E would produce approximately 11,760 kN of force per second, according to calculations from the vessel size and acceleration (40 tons and 30 g\u0027s for Star Tram). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe original mod author has the right relation between power consumption and force produced, though: 1 MW = 100 kN/s. Which represents a roughly 10% efficient electromagnet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, I just want help in the right way to set up a thread re-distributing a forked version of this one part, which I will make the modifications to for up-rating its force and power consumption to realistic levels, and reducing its Career Mode costs by *at least* 80-90%... (currently it costs 185,000 per part)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I understand it, a fork needs to include:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The (forum?) name of the Initial Developer, and credit to him for creating the original mod\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- My name (forum name is acceptable, I presume?), and a notice on the modifications I made\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Copies of both the original and modified source code\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs that everything? Is there anything else I\u0027m missing? And how exactly would I get the source- I don\u0027t actually *see* a file or link labeled \u0022source\u0022 anywhere on the mod release site, even though the Initial Developer (the mod author) is legally required to provide it with that license.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-27T05:51:26Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2014 05:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T14:58:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, I had a look around for the source and it\u0027s not out there, presumably one of the reasons that the owner no longer updates his thread in the dev section.
