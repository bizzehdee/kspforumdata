(Edit: Tested with a simple pod\u003Efuel tank\u003E909 configuration too, so Kerbal X isn\u0027t necessary. Helps with other issues stated below.)\n\n3) ALT\u002BF12 and use the cheat menu to put the craft in to orbit around Minmus. Don\u0027t change anything, do not stage the craft, do not alter the orbit settings aside from the celestial body...do not pass go.\n\n4) The craft should be in a very high orbit around Minmus and unable to move because even though the launch clamps are not visible anymore, they\u0027re still attached. So, ensure throttle is zero (it should be from my experience) and stage the craft.\n\n5) Enable \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and use the lock heading to retrograde option. It will take a while to rotate...\n\n6) Switch to map view, right click the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E tag and carefully thrust until your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E reaches 6000m. This may be variable, I don\u0027t know, mine was around 5900.\n\n7) Switch back to flight view, focus the view of your craft with Minmus in the background then increase timewarp. I should have noted what rate but I would guess about 100x. (Edit: Just run this a few time, 10000x warp, didn\u0027t check others but this does it for me.)\n\n8) Hopefully, the solar system is now awash with a glorious ocean. If not, try again.\n\nThis was not a \u0022clean install\u0022 of KSP as such. I did clean out the gamedata folder and verify the local files through Steam however. If this is not repeatable by others then I\u0027ll look at completely wiping the game and reinstalling but I suspect my actual game files are fine.\n\n[Here](https://pastebin.com/ABsUNmQq) is a pastebin of the output log from entering flight mode, thru the procedure above, to reverting back to the editor once the flooding had occured. I don\u0027t see anything at the point I would expect, only an error relating to clouds earlier in the scene loading. If you want the entire log, let me know I just cut to the relevant part so it was perhaps easier to read through 600 lines than 12000 and up until this point, everything seems fine.\n\nEdit: Oh, I stumbled on this because I was experiencing a massive framerate drop when approaching Minmus in a flight. I noticed odd looking shadows so I quit out, disabled terrain shadows and godrays, then cheated the Kerbal X craft in to orbit to see if the problem persisted....and it didn\u0027t. So I think terrain shadows have been a source of framerate problems for me for some time but I just finally got round to trying to eliminate it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-07T22:12:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2017 10:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Manwith Noname**"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-09T13:28:57Z","Content":"Yep, its like club medspace, I love it, do not fix this\n\n![NXEGeQk.png](http://i.imgur.com/NXEGeQk.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"tkw","CreatedById":142638,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-09T18:13:58Z","Content":"\uFF41\uFF45\uFF53\uFF54\uFF48\uFF45\uFF54\uFF49\uFF43"}]}
