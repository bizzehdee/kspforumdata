I had a single save from initial Mun orbit so I\u0027ll need to pickup from there again. Maybe on a second try I\u0027ll get a better landing - I landed using the cockpit view and when I switched cameras I found I was on a gentle hill and very slowly sliding down it. I had to wait patently for it to stop before I could get out and plant the flag. It also made me a bit worried about getting back in - with no ladder my Kerman needs to jump or jet up about 2 feet to reach the ladder, and in past tests he has hit the craft with enough force to make it wobble. The lander was on the hill with the hatch on the higher side, so hitting the hatch hard risked tipping it over. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy flight leaves no debris either - the booster gets dropped a bit before stable orbit is reached and the rest of the craft comes back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I\u0027m done I\u0027ll probably try something along tavert\u0027s idea. I originally got on the idea of a light Mun mission after I did a very light orbital mission with some lander legs and realized I had a huge amount of delta V, so I took a detour to the Mun and landed (just not enough fuel to get back). That orbital craft was very similar to what tavert described (it was the MK1 pod, a T400 fuel tank, LV-909 engine, probe legs, and a 2x3 solar panel and retractable ladder).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-10T20:13:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI finished the trip. I landed on another hill, not as steep as the first one. Docking was touch and go - the orbiter doesn\u0027t have enough batteries to run the entire time it is behind the Mun and I was down to about 3 power when it got near the lander on the dark side. I didn\u0027t have time for zero-ing out my velocity so I eye balled a few burns that sent me as straight as I could toward the lander going a bit faster then usual (about 3m/s). Then I quickly switched to the lander and eyeballed the alignment as best I could in the dark. Fortunately the extreme light weight means that I really just need to get the docking ports about 2m away from each other at any angle and they have enough force to pull the ships together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal fuel left on Kerbin aerobraking approach was about 30 which I used to hasten my landing (instead of going around a few times, though I didn\u0027t burn it very efficiently).

Splash down all but guaranteed that one of the two engines would be damaged (with fuel removed always the big engine on the orbital module) but it is the second safest type of landing.
