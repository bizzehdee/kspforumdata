But when i got to duna, i wanted to circularize with my nuclear engines, and they were producing no thrust at all despite having 6 of them. so after running out of hydrogen i decided to detach the nuclear stage so i could circularize with the fuel in the lander, and after doing that THERE WAS NO FUEL IN THE LANDER, DESPITE BEING NOT USED!!! I do not understand what messes up the fuel so bad, Also the fuel lines DO NOT WORK.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOPINION 2 - PERFORMANCE\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe framerate drops dramatically just by looking at kerbin, i dont know what is causing this issue because ksp1 with parallax was running just fine. this issue is really annoying since the game lags a lot just by launching planes.

If that stops the fuel from draining, try putting the landing legs on a part that has no fuel, and a decoupler between that part and the fuel tanks. That worked for me, but I\u0027ve heard it doesn\u0027t work for everybody.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that you can also use the resource manager (button at bottom right) to transfer fuel to the tanks.
