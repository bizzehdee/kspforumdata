I have learned how to dock solely based on the details it provides, and after two training maneuvers with it active I was able to easily attach a fuel canister to my space station without MechJeb\u0027s aid. Most notably, the \u0027Closest approach\u0027 time and distance helps you learn what you need to do to get near the target.
