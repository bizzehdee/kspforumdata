Comins titled \u0027What if the Earth had two Moons?\u0027 It describes 10 scenarios for alternate \u0027Earths\u0027. One of those scenarios is the title scenario.\n\nGiven that the title scenario is now appropriate to Kerbin, I thought I\\\u0027d give the book a plug and share one of the predictions from the book:\n\nThe Mun and Minmus will eventually collide. Gravitational effects will cause the Mun\\\u0027s orbit to become more elliptical and tidal effects will cause it to spiral outwards over billions of years. The Mun\\\u0027s orbit will eventually intercept Minmus\\\u0027. When the collision finally happens, the Mun will approach Minmus from behind. One or both of the moons may even crack open prior to the collision. \n\nThe collision will appear to occur in slow motion as viewed from Kerbin. To paraphrase Comins, Kerbals on the side of Kerbin facing their moon\\\u0027s can \u0027prepare a jug of their favorite libations, set up a comfy chair and watch the first phases of the event over a period of hours.\u0027 Unfortunately for our Kerbals, debris from the impact will fly in all directions including towards Kerbin. The resulting impact events on Kerbin will probably cause mass extinctions.\n\nEventually, the debris from the collision of the two moons will coalesce into one moon. Debris that wasn\\\u0027t blown out of the Kerbin system or into a collision course with Kerbin would at first form a significant ring around Kerbin. \u0027Within a few years, the densest part of the ring would clump together due to its own gravitational attraction and due to relatively slow collisions between its pieces.\u0027 A single moon would grow as it collected more and more of what used to be the Mun and Minmus. \u0027Eventually this new moon would absorb the remaining ring debris and a new era in the life of [Kerbin] would begin.\u0027"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T02:57:54Z","Content":"It has been theorised that this is how the Moon came about."},{"CreatedByName":"lars","CreatedById":2083,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T03:57:36Z","Content":"Red Dwarf refers to the \\\u0027Big Splat\\\u0027 Hypothesis.

Tidal forces would probably also increase volcanic activity on both planets, making them unlivable.
