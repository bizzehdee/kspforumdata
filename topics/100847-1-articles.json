Oxygen extracted from the rocks would greatly reduce the mass of propellant that would need to be brought to the Moon for use on the return flight, this is because the oxidiser needed to get back to Earth is much heavier than the fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWater is known to exist at the poles in permanently shadowed craters. It might exist as small crater ponds of water ice, or it could exist as dilute permafrost spread widely over the poles.

At first glance, the Moon seems to be an ideal next incremental step after learning to fly in Low Earth Orbit. I would expect that a Chinese Moon program would result in a similar outcome to Apollo. China would benefit greatly from learning how to get to the Moon and return safely to Earth, but justifying a long term presence there would be much more difficult. There isn\u0027t really anything on the Moon that China needs, other than the Helium3, which is expensive to extract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost present day advocates of Moon basing argue that going to Mars is too hard, therefore an extended Moon base program is critical to evolving the technology needed to go to Mars. Others have tried to make a Moon base critical by insisting that it should be used to make fuel for huge interplanetary spaceships to go to Mars. Few are trying to justify a Moon base for it\u0027s own sake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMars is far more similar to the Earth than it is to the Moon. Unlike the Moon, Mars has the resources needed to support large scale colonisation and industrial development. Mars can support greenhouse agriculture without the need for prohibitively heavy shielding to prevent crops being killed by solar flares. Mars can be (at least) partially terraformed with presently understood technology (handy if you\u0027re a real estate speculator BTW \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E). Mars can not only support a major new branch of human civilisation in it\u0027s own right, but it can also offer fifty times less mass ratio to launch cargo from it\u0027s surface to the main asteroid belt compared to Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsteroid mining outposts, which would lack adequate division of labour for self sufficiency, and would be prohibitively expensive to supply from Earth, would be supplied with food and manufactured goods from Mars. This would allow a \u0022triangle trade\u0022 to operate, where high tech goods would be sent from Earth to Mars, food and low tech manufactures would be sent from Mars to the asteroids (and perhaps helium3 miners on the Moon), while inexhaustible supplies of precious and semi precious metals (and possibly helium3) would be sent to Earth. A later economic model of the Solar System would also add inexhaustible supplies of helium3 being sent to Earth from the gas giants. Helium3 also has sufficient enthalpy to fuel fusion thermal rockets with sufficient ISP for interstellar flight!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe key to unlocking the resources and economic potential of the inner solar system is Mars, not the Moon.\u003C/strong\u003E The worst possible case would be for China to expend a lot of resources getting to the Moon, only to realise that it\u0027s economic potential is poor (which is why Apollo was cancelled). The Moon has the potential to create an expensive and unnecessary diversion from humanity\u0027s real next step in space, which is Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would recommend reading Robert Zubrin\u0027s books \u003Cem\u003EThe Case For Mars\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003EEntering Space\u003C/em\u003E to understand how the economic development of the Solar System will be achieved in practice.

Planets in general are hard to get to, and the only thing they have in abundance as compared to Small Solar System Bodies of the inner Solar System is CO2 atmospheres. But this isn\u0027t limited to Mars - Venus has an even thicker CO2 atmosphere, and is easier and faster to get to, and arguably easier to establish a permanent piloted outpost on. Your primary assertion that growing food is only possible on Mars is false - we have grown plants in micro-gee environments, specifically the Bion satellites, Skylab, Spacehab, and Space Station. Small Solar System Bodies are much more accessible - just (relatively) small, airless bodies in outer space - the robot\u0027s natural habitat. They also are extremely numerous, not just among the Asteroids, they thickly populate the inner Solar System. Unlike the Planets, their entire mass is accessible (not limited to how deep you can dig) and they appear to vary enormously in composition. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can find volatiles like methane or CO2, water, and ammonia buried in the rock you have all the CHON elements right there.

With ammonia you can make hydrazine for rocket fuel, and you can process it with hydrogen peroxide to make nitrogen tetroxide.

They also provide you with a bunch of gravitational acceleration which, while it makes it harder to take off from, it makes a more comfortable environment for astronauts without rotating facilities, although with Kirk Sorenson\u0027s xGRF concept, rotating piloted spacecraft have been made very viable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T09:32:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Torquemadus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Torquemadus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe key to unlocking the resources and economic potential of the inner solar system is Mars, not the Moon.\u003C/strong\u003E The worst possible case would be for China to expend a lot of resources getting to the Moon, only to realise that it\u0027s economic potential is poor (which is why Apollo was cancelled).

China and Russia might like to get their hands on some of the materials there for industry, but the cost to bring them back to Earth will make them overpriced for anything beyond research and novelty. The base will not need to build anything really large, perhaps a 3D printer will come along, but it will be stocked with material from Earth. Though water might be available for drinking/fueling purposes at the pole, scientists will want to look at it carefully, not mine and melt and alter it.

They have probably the ability, technically, to begin a programme to do so, probably would feature a few more robotic landers, followed by brief manned landings, and then combinations which would land people, robots, and supplies to build longer term facilities. Slowly the length of time crews would spend on the surface would grow, but no one would really live on the Moon for more than a few months to a year probably. Is it possible? I think so. Not a colony but an outpost. The main issue is sadly political will. China wants to look good in space, but it also wants to do other things, and with major manned projects such as a base would be, there is ample risk.

The fact that the resulting plan is likely to be a complete mess is considered unimportant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic outline of the plan is that all of the propellants and consumables needed for the stay on Mars and the return to Earth have to be lifted from Earth. This requires the construction of a massive interplanetary spaceship (dubbed \u0022Battlestar Galactica\u0022 by it\u0027s critics), which uses advanced propulsion technologies to speed it through space, thus sparing the crew from the ravages of zero gravity and radiation. A small landing party descends to the surface for a brief \u0022flags and footprints\u0022 exercise. The spaceship then returns to Earth via a deltaV intensive Venus gravity assist, thus minimising the overall time away from Earth. If there happens to be a dust storm going on when the spaceship arrives at Mars, then the landing (which can\u0027t be delayed until after the storm subsides) has to be scrubbed and the mission can be considered a complete failure. The mission\u0027s woes are compounded by the fact that the huge spaceship is too big to aerobrake safely into Martian orbit, which adds yet more deltaV to the already huge ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe spaceship is far too heavy to contemplate launching from Earth. Therefore, huge on-orbit assembly facilities are needed to construct and fuel the ship. This means that in addition to the spaceship, the huge space station facilities where it will be built must also be constructed in orbit. This is a dream come true to anyone trying to justify a large launch manifest. The number of Space Shuttle and heavy lift launches required would be truly staggering!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo push the idea further, proponents of Moon basing have got in on the act. Due to the cost of lifting all that mass from Earth, Moon basing proponents insist that as much of the propellants and construction materials as possible should come from a mature Moon base. Never mid that due to the lack of an atmosphere for aerobraking, the deltaV to go from LEO to the Moon is actually \u003Cstrong\u003Emore\u003C/strong\u003E than LEO to Mars! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E The spaceship is either built in LEO and sent to the Moon for refuelling, or built at orbiting stations somewhere in the lunar vicinity, such as an Earth-Moon lagrangian point. Water is know to exist at to lunar poles, but it could be in the form of dilute permafrosts in parts per mission quantities, so the question of whether the water is available for fuel production remains unanswered. Otherwise, all of the fuel used for operations in cislunar space will have to come from Earth, with the oxidiser (which accounts for roughly 75% of total propellant mass) coming from the Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if lunar materials can\u0027t be used. Moon-basing proponents argue that we must go to the Moon first to learn how to live and work on Mars. Mars is much more like the Earth than the Moon. There are some quite hostile Arctic and Antarctic desserts on Earth that can serve as far better analogues. These can be used not only to test hardware, but to learn how to work and explore in an analogue environment. In fact, any desert on Earth would be a better Mars analogue than the Moon.

The first problem is how to get there. Conventional propulsion can be used to get there in eight months for a minimum energy transfer. This can be reduced to six months for a modest additional propellant expenditure. Supposedly, this is too long, even though an average tour of duty on the Space Station is also six months, and much longer space station stays have been completed successfully in the past.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe primary obstacles are claimed to be zero gravity and radiation. A big part of the medical research conducted on Skylab and the ISS has been to study the effects of zero gravity de-conditioning. These effects are well understood at this point. Astronauts can in any case be protected from the effects of zero gravity through the use of tethered artificial gravity. This approach has been objected to, not for technical reasons, but because it would de-justify future zero gravity research spending.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe effects of radiation on humans and other living things are well understood at this point. The key is to avoid prompt doses of radiation, which could lead to life-threatening radiation sickness. Solar flare radiation would produce such prompt doses, but can be mitigated by the provision of a storm shelter. Much of the shielding for the shelter can be provided by the hardware and consumables already present aboard the spacecraft, so the mass penalty of providing such a shelter is not crippling to the mission. The crew will be exposed to cosmic radiation during the flight, this cannot be stopped by shielding, but it comes as a chronic, rather than prompt dose. This slightly increases the crew\u0027s risk of cancer in later life (a small risk compared to the other dangers they face). Space station crew members are also exposed to this radiation at lesser dosages. Some of the longer duration space station stays have exposed astronauts to equivalent chronic dosage to a round trip Mars mission with no radiological casualties. Mars offers a good deal of protection from both kinds of radiation, especially if the crew observe to throw sandbags onto the roof of their hab to provide additional protection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also been claimed that the crew, confined as they are to a small spacecraft cabin during transit, will either go mad, or suffer dangerous breakdowns on morale and group cohesion. This is despite the fact that 19th century polar explorers endured far harsher conditions without encountering any such problems. There are many examples innhistory where human beings, often without specialised training, have endured incredible hardships far in excess of anything the astronauts would be expected to go through. Needless to say, the supposed solution to this apparent problem is spending vast amounts of money of \u0022human factors\u0022 research.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Torquemadus","CreatedById":97777,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T12:09:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest \u0022problem\u0022 that supposedly haunts Mars missions is the need to haul all of the propellants and consumables needed for the surface stay and return trip from Earth (or possibly the Moon). This problem can be eliminated by using indigenous resources. This allows the payload mass that must be sent to Mars to be reduced in scale to the point that it can be thrown directly from Earth by Saturn V class (or modern equivalent) heavy lifters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key is to find a way to manufacture propellants for the return trip in a way that minimises the risk of stranding the crew. An automated propellant manufacturing plant could be established in advance, but this would require the crew to either land within a hose length of the plant, or conduct convoluted tanking operations whereby the propellants are hauled to the return ship via a rover. The solution is to build the refuelling hardware directly into the return ship and send it out ahead on the preceding transfer window. Provided the crew can land within rover distance of the return ship, they can use it to get home. Apollo 12 managed to land within 200 metres of their Surveyor spacecraft target, so similar or better accuracy should be achievable with modern avionics. Further backup comes in the form of a second return ship, which is on course to arrive a number of days after the first crew, and is intended for use by a later crew. This second return ship can be diverted to land near the first crew if needed. Failing that, the crew have enough supplies to tough it out on Mars until further help can arrive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Martian atmosphere can be used to manufacture low grade rocket fuel in the form of carbon monoxide and oxygen. The performance they offer is marginal for Earth return. However, hydrogen feedstock can be brought from Earth in insulated tanks designed to minimise boil-off. The mass of the hydrogen is quite small compared to the total volume of propellants it can be used to produce. A Sabatier reactor is used to produce methane and oxygen, while additional oxygen is made from carbon dioxide, with the resulting carbon monoxide vented as waste. Methane and oxygen offer much better performance and (unlike hydrogen) are suitable for long term storage on the surface. Sufficient propellants are manufactured to allow some of them to be used to run combustion engines for use in ground rovers and auxiliary generators. Once an indigenous source of water is found, later missions no-longer need to import hydrogen as feedstock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe primary power source for the propellant plant is a small nuclear reactor, producing a power output of around 80kWe. This is deployed by a light truck, which is telerobotically driven away from the return ship, paying out a power cable from a windlass as it does so. The reactor is placed either in a depression, in a crater, or behind a hill, ensuring that there is plenty of dirt between it and the return ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crew remain on the surface for a year and a half, searching for past and present signs of life and looking for resources that would be of use to a future base. A key task would be to locate and drill into a source of geothermally heated water. This would not only provide a haven for any life that might have survived on Mars, but would also provide a source of water and geothermal power for a permanent base. Each crew would land their hab within rover driving distance of previous habs, which would be left behind on the surface. This would gradually establish a network of small outposts, gradually opening up more of the surface to exploration. Once a suitable location was found for a permanent base, all subsequent habs would be landed there and linked together. The emphasis would then change to developing Martian resources and supporting long range expeditions to explore Mars on a global scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing indigenous propellants to get back to Earth does away with the \u0022Battlestar Galactica\u0022 spaceship and the prohibitive logistical requirements it imposes. It also does away with the need to permanently strand the astronauts on Mars, as has been suggested for the Mars One mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead, each mission can be achieved with two launches of a heavy lift rocket equivalent to the Saturn 5. SpaceX and ULA have both offered to design and build such a rocket for a tiny fraction of the cost of SLS. NASA managed to operate the Space Shuttle, which had almost as much thrust at liftoff as the Saturn 5, for thirty years, with an average launch rate of six per year. A sustained launch campaign for Mars exploration requires only two launches every two years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch requirements are in fact so low that the personnel involved in preparing such rockets for launch would be left with little to do in between launch windows, and they still have to get paid. Therefore, a Moon base would probably be established to help fill the launch manifests. Hardware designed for Mars could be adapted easily for the establishment of a Moon base. The rockets would probably also be used to throw large nuclear powered probes on missions to the outer solar system. This would allow them to support high data transmission rates and active sensors, greatly increasing data return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA nuclear thermal rocket could be introduced to power the upper stage of the launch vehicle. This would double the payload mass that could be thrown to whichever destination is required. While not essential, it could be used to save money in the long run by reducing the number of launches required.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T13:23:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etldr; off-topic for this thread, and already discussed at length on this forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of asking \u0022how to get to Mars\u0022.
