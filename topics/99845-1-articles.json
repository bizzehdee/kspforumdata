Does this happen or do your thrusters continue firing indefinitely?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the ship, is it possible that you have one of the SAS buttons (i.e. prograge, retrograde, normal, anti-normal, etc.) selected? The SAS system uses RCS to control the ship and because of something with precision (someone else can probably explain that much better than I can) it can never quite achieve the selected orientation so it continually fires the thrusters. Try switching to the default \u0022stability-assist\u0022 button to see if that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T03:13:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMethinks it\u0027s a trim problem: Try hitting the key combo \u0022Alt\u0022 \u002B \u0022X\u0022 to disable all trim.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you using mods, namely MechJeb?
