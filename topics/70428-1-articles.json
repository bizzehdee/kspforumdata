This actually works. Props to Kashua for understanding the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tested it with this craft and I can see now how having the torque applied \u003Cem\u003Ethrough\u003C/em\u003E the asteroid to the control point (didn\u0027t realize it had to also be the root part) will produce extremely low strain on the linkage between the control point and the asteroid. In that sense both your workarounds are similar. I see now, regardless of the shape of the part tree, a single vessel (meaning single claw) can never apply torque without straining the links between the root part and the asteroid. For my test I also disabled the reaction wheel in the probe itself so the root part / center of control is 100% passive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn VAB the root part is on the right, just below the claw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BLGeNdxl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BLGeNdxl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1rciT3ml.png\u0022 alt=\u00221rciT3ml.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still need some work on aligning the engines and control point to the center of mass, but at least now it is possible, whereas with the maneuver indicator and velocity wildly there\u0027s no way.
