Here\\\u0027s the issue: ASAS uses angular momentum to determine the strength of its response; it effectively tries to bring it to 0. The control parameters in the .cfg are how strongly the ASAS unit responds to a given amount of angular momentum. With me so far?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, ASAS doesn\\\u0027t apply force directly itself, like the old SAS modules did. It uses whatever control systems you\\\u0027ve got on the rocket, ones that you have (if you\\\u0027re designing reasonably! 8) ) set up to give you control authority throughout the flight, right? That means you should be able to steer your starting stage with small taps for small corrections and larger swings for stronger control, right? A smooth, analog process, especially with a stick (or precision controls). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, ASAS sees these big angular momentum changes due to large mass, and so, unless your gain is very small so that it ignores them, thinks the rocket is out of control and fires all your control systems full blast. Because you\\\u0027ve got enough CA to make your rocket drivable, this causes it to pass back through the plane, whereupon the ASAS fires them all full blast again in reverse. The net result is that you have a rocket that might be going in a straight line but that burns through its RCS fuel like crazy, looks like a caffeine addict, or quite possibly (in the case of spaceplanes primarily because of their much larger control forces) tears itself apart,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, for a large and heavy rocket, for smooth control response, you want a very low gain ASAS system to avoid that. But then you have a new problem: Suppose you drop your first stage off; suddenly your rocket is both much lighter and much shorter, and so there\\\u0027s much less angular momentum for the ASAS to respond to. That means that it no longer corrects anywhere near as strongly as it did for the same gain-- but a bunch of your control systems just vanished with that stage, too. Now, the softer commands are being sent to something with, say, around the same amount of control authority; that means your rocket doesn\\\u0027t correct as quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat means your ASAS control may now be \u003Cem\u003Etoo soft\u003C/em\u003E and unable to maintain a given attitude or even kill spin properly. It\\\u0027s the opposite problem; for a lighter, smaller rocket, you want the ASAS to respond strongly to small changes in angular momentum, hence have a higher gain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, ASAS outputs seem to be additive. That means having a high-gain ASAS at the top of the rocket to control your light terminal stages will result in having far, far too much gain for your early flight, and adding multiple ASAS units lower down will only make it worse. They ain\\\u0027t magic torque machines like the old SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am looking into the possibility of creating ASAS modules that respond to angular momentum \u003Cem\u003Ein reverse\u003C/em\u003E so that you CAN add extras to the machine and have gain rise as you stage, but so far progress has been minimal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
