Thermometer, Barometer, and Negative gravioli detector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft works by having a probe body with science tools on it, attached to basically a normal rocket. This rocket in turn has wheels on it. The rocket is driven to the coast and carefully dipped into the ocean, We then begin to burn downwards, recording milestone depths\u0027 Gravity, pressure, and temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the science:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the submarine right at the start of its plunge. At 22 meters into the sea, these are the statistics:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPressure: 1.0057\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETemperature: 020.07\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravity: 00.10m/s^2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i39.tinypic.com/1etbh4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221etbh4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ve just reached the 150 meters mark. The statistics for this altitude is as such:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPressure: 1.0181\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETemperature: 020.08\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravity: 00.10m/s^2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i39.tinypic.com/muzcj6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022muzcj6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter about 5 minutes of slowly cruising through the depths, we\u0027ve reached the bottom of the sea. Which surprisingly is not even 20,000 leagues!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bottom of Kerbin\u0027s ocean is a measly 470 meters. But here are the statistics for said depth:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPressure: 1.0941\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETemperature:020.07\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravity: 00.10m/s^2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i42.tinypic.com/hst6va.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hst6va.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here is the measurements taken from sealevel on dry land:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPressure: 0.9864\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETemperature: 019.51\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravity: 09.81m/s^2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurprisingly there is no clear pattern in these measurements, other then pressure, which increases the deeper we go, but by such unrealistic small amounts. The temperature also does not seem to decrease at all, as the bottom has the same temperature as the top. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever by comparing it to coastal measurements, there are some strong differences. For one the gravity is actually stronger in the water then out, which might be why landing in water is so painfully brutal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe temperature in water is actually warmer then out of it, which is also strange.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pressure however, is as expected, stronger then out of the water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConclusion: Kerbin\u0027s ocean doesnt make much sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope someone can appreciate this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E It was my attempt at doing some science at Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bacterius","CreatedById":69384,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-05T23:16:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow is the gravity so weak underwater?
