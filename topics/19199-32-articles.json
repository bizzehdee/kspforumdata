I like BobCat\u0027s stuff, I really do, and I have several of his mods/parts in my game as I speak, and I use them quite a lot. However, they are ALL woefully outdated, and I\u0027ve had to use a lot of workarounds and config editing to keep them functioning, and NONE of them have the full functionality that they did when they were first released. Why? Because BobCat has obviously had no interest in keeping them up to date or replacing them with newer versions. Is he required to do that? No, of course not. But I, also and therefore, have the right to criticize that state of affairs, do I not? I realize he may have commitments to things in life other than modding for KSP, however, when he periodically releases videos on YouTube showing progress on mod development, or new parts that are obviously functional IN GAME, and then never releases those parts, I view that as a bit of a slap in the face. It\u0027s like he\u0027s saying \u0022I COULD take the time to package these parts up and release them to you, my fans, for YOU to play with... but I WON\u0027T.\u0022 For myself, it\u0027s more a point of principle, or honor, if you will. If I say that \u0027I am going to create a certain thing for you to use, and I am going to show you that I\u0027m working on it by providing evidence of progress in the form of pictures and videos\u0027, to me that\u0027s a form of a promise. \u0022I will do this thing.\u0022 So, then, when that thing doesn\u0027t EVER happen, that means that I broke my word. I said I was going to do it, then I didn\u0027t. Simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be different if this were an isolated incident in BobCat\u0027s history, but unfortunately that\u0027s not the case. And you and I know he\u0027s not unique in that regard, there are plenty of other modders out there that do the same thing. Devogen is one I could name as a specific case. Lots of stuff \u0027in development\u0027, ready to be released \u0027next week\u0027 or \u0027Soon\u003Csup\u003Etm\u003C/sup\u003E\u0027, and then you never hear or see anything about them again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, after having been involved here on the forum for a while, the result is that I\u0027ve stopped assuming that a mod project will ever be released until I actually see a download link. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E But that\u0027s not going to stop me from occasionally \u0027calling them out\u0027 on it, as it were.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, here\u0027s the main gist of what I\u0027m trying to say. I don\u0027t think that ANY modder should be completely above any and all criticism. I hope that they, BobCat and Devo and anyone else that I or anyone else choose to criticize in this fashion understand that it is intended in a constructive way, as in \u0027hey, YOU SAID you were going to do X, remember? How\u0027s it going with that?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I\u0027d like to think that we\u0027re all (well, somewhat) grownups here, so whether or not the modder to whom any criticism is directed AGREES with said criticism, I think that they can handle it and go on about their lives without any major scarring or ongoing trauma. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, Bobcat, sir, I continue to be a fan of your many mods and parts packs, and I hope you continue to work on updating and improving ALL of them, in your own time and in your own unique way. Just remember, you have A LOT of very eager fans of your work out here, and we are all very VERY anxious and excited to have the opportunity to play with all of the great stuff we\u0027ve seen in your videos and screenshots. We hope you understand that asking (begging?

Im sorry for not including more, but we all do think about what you guys have done for all of us. Last but first on my list.......STUBBLES. Its kinda sad that when I thank a Modder, I only get a \u0022your welcome\u0022 about 8% of the time. But I still take the time to say THANK YOU\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDREN\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-12T08:00:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2014 08:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ArkaelDren\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T11:47:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re welcome. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E TBH, my personal philosophy is to generally give ETA if I can (though after many a fiasco with the CSS overhaul, I\u0027ve started to become a bit superstitious about it), and to take criticism respectably, fixing and correcting what I can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027d say, it\u0027s probably not BobCat\u0027s fault that he disappeared, but he could at least give indication what\u0027s going on (I recall a vague indication that RL has been hard on him, but no details). He posted a lot of teasers, but so far only released the upgraded Soyuz, and even that\u0027s a single test version. I suppose he might just be very very busy (as it often happens to people), but he could at least give a definite confirmation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and a tip to all vicious \u0022defenders\u0022 of one modder or the other: I consider such \u0022anti-criticism\u0022 an insult, because it implies that the modder can\u0027t adequately respond to the criticism himself. Many modders actually take it better than most of their fans, in fact. Best example: OLDD thread. I complained about red struts on Saturn V LES. I got flamed by the fans and even moderators jumped in on the action. And what Denny did? Repainted the struts white for the next release. Noone complained after that. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
