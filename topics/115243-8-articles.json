The thing is, many times MJ does not behave as expected. For instance, I used the stock Kerbal X for a Mun landing and return. The only change I made was adding MJ (obviously) and radiators because the new areo/heat is killing me - and Jeb way too often. So course corrected for 50k closest Mun approach after transfer burn, warped to the change of SOI node, and what do I find? The ship is on a collision course.
