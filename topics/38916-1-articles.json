Looking into the matter, this was apparently caused by a bit of shorthand used by the game when a vehicle doesn\u0027t have focus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince this is obviously quite a setback for my plan, I was hoping for a kludge that would guesstimate whether a despawning object had enough parachutes to land safely (say, 1 ton per parachute for Kerbin). If it is, find the center of drag/center of parachutes and the center of mass, and declare that it landed in an orientation with the former directly above the latter. This would not be intended as a substitute for a controlled landing so you could set the numbers lower to err on the side of failure, but it would be nice as a way to let us land boosters and fly our rocket at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blueshark15","CreatedById":71004,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T07:15:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have this same issue, in fact, I made a thread about it, although mine was more about the issue than a possible solution but anyway, this is good.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T21:15:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got to admit that even if it\u0027s way \u003Cstrong\u003Etoo complicated\u003C/strong\u003E or \u003Cstrong\u003Etoo soon to implement\u003C/strong\u003E this, I look forward something like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut more seriously, that\u0027s more career feature than Sandbox for now, because :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...you have infinite budget anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...so you don\u0027t actually re-use component unless you can refuel them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...you don\u0027t even have a (ingame) reason to go look if it landed correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...and as of now the recovering process is still manual, if you only jettison one or two stages it\u0027s ok, but if you have 10 boosters to recover manually it will rapidly become annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand I bet everybody saw the Shuttle\u0027s Booster and SpaceX reusable plan and wish to mimic it NASA-style.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rodion","CreatedById":75111,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T21:20:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kegereneku\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kegereneku\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve got to admit that even if it\u0027s way \u003Cstrong\u003Etoo complicated\u003C/strong\u003E or \u003Cstrong\u003Etoo soon to implement\u003C/strong\u003E this, I look forward something like this.\u003Cp\u003EBut more seriously, that\u0027s more career feature than Sandbox for now, because :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...you have infinite budget anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...so you don\u0027t actually re-use component unless you can refuel them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...you don\u0027t even have a (ingame) reason to go look if it landed correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...and as of now the recovering process is still manual, if you only jettison one or two stages it\u0027s ok, but if you have 10 boosters to recover manually it will rapidly become annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand I bet everybody saw the Shuttle\u0027s Booster and SpaceX reusable plan and wish to mimic it NASA-style.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou fail to completely understand the mindset of the reusability fanatics...they don\u0027t do it because it is practical, or because reusability is naturally well-supported by KSP, or because it\u0027s convenient or simple, they do it because they \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E and because \u003Cem\u003EEVERY\u003C/em\u003E part will come back safely...\u003Cem\u003ENO MATTER WHAT\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"marach","CreatedById":72245,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T21:27:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enot to mention its fun to do...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
