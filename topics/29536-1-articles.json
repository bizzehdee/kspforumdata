Typically 4 or 6 cubes on a large tank. It\u0027s important to link fuel tanks if Mainsails are going to be pushing because their thrust is intense. Wobbly rockets also waste fuel correcting so it\u0027s allways a good idea to secure things. In the screenshot below, the sets of two orange tanks are well connected as is the large RCS tank because it would be the weak link. The outer droptanks are also secured with several connections as radial decouplers are fairly weak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re not sure what or where to strut, launch and examine the rocket. Once you see what lacks stability end flight and go back to VAB. If you add rigidity by strutting things near the bottom section of a rocket, usually the parts higher up will begin to wobble. Ideally you strut the whole thing together nicely bottom to top. Part count is fairly meaningless if you\u0027ll be dropping tanks as you ascend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe payloads come in all shapes and sizes and since undocking or otherwise separating breaks links, you can go nuts. You want minimum flex and no breakage. If you achieve that further strutting is pointless.

You want your biggest engine on the central stack, usually providing about 30-50% of the total thrust of the lifter\u0027s initial launch stage, with the radially mounted tanks having just enough thrust under them to bring up the total TWR to about 1.7ish. You can launch with as little as 1.3 safely, and it is kinda cool watching the rocket slowly pull away but it does cost a little more dV. I\u0027ve launched 25 ton payloads with only 3 struts on the whole rocket using this technique- those three struts were because of the inherent wobble when using stack decouplers on the upper stages of taller rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T20:14:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pbhead\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pbhead\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewe really should assemble some sort of guide.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re in luck; someone already has.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/20773-Tutorial-Six-places-you-should-be-using-more-struts!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESix places you should be using more struts!\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nao","CreatedById":23462,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T00:26:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stochasty\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Stochasty\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhere\u0027s that booster/strut flowchart when you need it?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/S0nt8YS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/S0nt8YS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022S0nt8YS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy ships usually are really low on struts.

(sometimes one strut fulfills both roles)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf something moves one (or two in symmetry) struts connected to a part close to CoM solves it. No need to make a web of struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s important to take staging into consideration, especially in asparagus staging, i tend to strut to the center tank so that it doesn\u0027t matter which tanks are staged and the ship keeps its rigidity up to last stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo negate rotational forces when using asparagus staging due to twisting of its stages, its nice to connect like this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E  O\u003Cbr\u003E | |                | - strut\u003Cbr\u003E  O                 O- fuel tank\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso placing connections at a distance from each other (one on top one on bottom) can be enough for even large, complicated stages if the middle section is stiff.

Making sure there is as little vibrations wobble, and bending induced from long stack of tanks. Its good to have almost all parts connected to something else (1-3 connections are well enough usually)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELoad transfers are harder since the more struts are in the system the bigger tensions there will be. Picking the right part to connect outer stages to is important. There also is a trick of mounting a docking port (or something similar) on either side of the strut connection. This is is making connection less rigid and allows wider distribution of load throughout the other strut-docking port pairs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso when there are many struts involved my first reaction to something exploding during launch is, removing struts, searching for the one that over-stiffens the construction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the exploding part doesn\u0027t have struts connected to it. It can mean either there is a natural load convergence in it, so more struts in parts around are needed to make more ways for the loads to go through. Or if there are enough load transferring struts its because rest of the construction around it is over-stiffened (it\u0027s hard to explain). The point is that not always more struts is better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso when removing struts there is a point where not enough stiffness creates a resonance or wobble that amplifies forces.
