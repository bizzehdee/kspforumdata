It\u0027s not the power of the reactor that you must consider when determining thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut rather, as it is with all reaction engines. How much mass are you throwing out the back how fast?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChemical rockets throw huge amounts of mass out the back of the rocket at moderate speeds. Most of the speed is developed by the combustion process heating the burned gas mixture and causing it to expand and force its way out the nozzle like a giant garden hose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe nuclear rockets operate more on the function of throwing smaller amounts of mass out at much higher speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this case, nuclear thermal uses reactor heat to increase the temperature of the propellant and throw that out the back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn ion engine uses xenon or argon gas for its electrical ion properties and shoves that out the back with a magnetic field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlasma thrusters and the like are pretty much the same mechanic, different configuration under the hood. At that point, it\u0027s really just finding the best way to add the most energy to the fuel so you can shove it out the back.

I would love to have one Interface for all scannable Ores/Materials instead of several - it would make everything more streamlined.\u003Cp\u003EEither way, still a pretty awesome mod.

Interstellar requiring a Kethane install is out of the question and the reverse is likewise true. The only option that remains would therefore be a third plugin that could be distributed with any compatible plugins to provide the interface for the mods wanting to make use of it but this has issues that have been discussed recently, e.g. in the ModuleManger thread. Particularly, if a user downloads one plugin with an older version of this resource handler, a newer version might get overwritten and cause bugs that are quite opaque to the user.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane has a very good API for third parties and I know that Majiir is helpful to people who want to make use of it. I\u0027m likewise happy to help anyone who wants to make use of Interstellar\u0027s resource system, which I have tried to make very easy to use and to mod but I obviously have no feedback about this aspect yet. I would however recommend these features mainly to modmakers who are interested in making resources a supplemental part of their mod. Obviously this is definitely not the case of Kethane and while it\u0027s probably true of Interstellar as of 0.8, it will become less so over time as many of my plans for expansion revolve around use of the resource system - particularly using the resource system for new science experiments, maybe even some science experiments that require a bit of thought from the operator, as well as things like Helium-3 mining from regolith and potentially tracking abundances of more common materials. Of particular interest amongst these is obviously Aluminium, which already has a place in the mod but is currently a binary thing that is either present or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it\u0027s nice for players to have common frameworks so that everything appears to be unified and tidy but it\u0027s unclear whether such a mechanism will become viable by any means at this stage. Additionally, the two resource systems are already quite different and I guess it depends on the direction of both Interstellar and Kethane as to whether they evolve to be more or less similar in the future - I actually hope for the second because two systems that do more or less the same thing are far less valuable to the community than two systems that have unique strengths.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Telanor","CreatedById":94360,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T01:36:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou have to shut down the reactor and then wait a while for the decay heating to subside, after that the option should appear (with an EVA Kerbal).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk so I shut down the reactor, waited, got the option to switch fuels.
