going to say no. Tau Ceti e has too many problems and is only a fair candidate for potential habitability at best, for several reasons.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.) It may not be rocky. While it has a minimum mass of just under four Earths, if the planets are on the same inclination as the debris disk, then Tau Ceti e is somewhere around 7-8 Earth masses. Most rocky planets are no more than 5-6 Earth masses, and at that mass, Tau Ceti e has a greater chance of being a small ice giant. However, there is hope for it. Tau Ceti is very poor in metals, or any element heavier than hydrogen and helium. This actually facilitates the formation of rocky planets because it takes so long for them to form. By the time they\u2019re big enough to start accumulating large layers of volatiles, the hydrogen in the planet-forming disk is all but blown away by the star. So there is a chance Tau Ceti e is rocky, maybe similar to the 7 Earth mass terrestrial habitable zone planet LHS 1140 b.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) Even if Tau Ceti e is a rocky planet, there is one huge problem that could kill its chances for hosting life: the amount of sunlight it gets from its star. The planet receives an insolation about 80% higher than Earth, which may not seem like much, but is slightly less than that of Venus, which is in no way habitable. Tau Ceti e, therefore, has dangerously high odds of being a hellish Super-Venus with a runaway greenhouse effect and no surface water. But like before, there might be a way for things to work in this planet\u2019s favor. If it\u2019s tidally locked \u2014 which isn\u2019t too unlikely at its orbit \u2014 then it could survive insolations as high as 2.2 times that of Earth. However, this probably isn\u2019t the case.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.) If Tau Ceti e somehow beats all the odds and is not only rocky but hasn\u2019t turned into a Super-Venus, one more challenge remains. I mentioned before that there\u2019s a large debris disk in the system. That is bad news for the potential habitability of any Tau Ceti planet, because that disk contains around ten times more asteroids and comets than are in our Solar System. This means that Tau Ceti e, f, and any possible undiscovered habitable zone planet would be frequently struck by space debris, disrupting the peace and stability needed for complex life to evolve. If life did miraculously get a foothold on Tau Ceti e, there\u2019s a good chance it has since been wiped out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo despite all the hope that the Tau Ceti solar system is something like in Star Trek, I highly doubt that is the case. Is it still interesting and worth continued observations and studies? Absolutely. Is it one of the best potentially habitable nearby systems? Absolutely not. I put my bets on Luyten b or LHS 1140 b having at least some form of life, since both are well within their systems\u2019 habitable zones, orbit very quiet red dwarfs, and are likely rocky (the latter actually is confirmed to be terrestrial).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-11T10:27:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenerally speaking to the topic title: no, I have no reason to think that is more likely than not.

Is it still interesting and worth continued observations and studies? Absolutely. Is it one of the best potentially habitable nearby systems? Absolutely not. I put my bets on Luyten b or LHS 1140 b having at least some form of life, since both are well within their systems\u2019 habitable zones, orbit very quiet red dwarfs, and are likely rocky (the latter actually is confirmed to be terrestrial).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem with Red Dwarves is that the habitable zone is so close to them, that all planets in that zone become tidally locked in short order. Without thick atmosphere, you then have a hot side and a cold side. The problem with a cold side is that if the atmosphere is thin enough, it gets very very cold. The atmosphere can then start to liquefy and freeze on the cold side. Then there is even less convection, and more freezing, and the atmosphere collapses. With a thick enough atmosphere, there is enough convection to prevent freezing on the cold side. Venus, for example, doesn\u0027t have a cold side in its extremely long nights (it rotates very slowly). So there\u0027s then a narrow range of possible atmospheric thickness that lies between \u0022runaway greenhouse\u0022 and \u0022atmospheric collapse\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLuyten b, having 3 earth masses, likely held on to a thick atmosphere, and is a venus analogue. Even a 10% increase in the brightness of our sun will lead to loss of hydrogen, and the evaporation of our oceans. The suns brightness increases over time, and we\u0027ve got about 1 billion years before its too bright.

They thought Proxima might have a habitable planet, then they detected a flare from Proxima that would have devestated any life on the planet. Its flare activity was high enough that it was concluded that any atmosphere was stripped away long ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRed Dwarves have planets that orbit close, their atmosphere gets pummeled by the solar wind/flares, and has a high escape rate.

But, as we know, at the end of the Archaean 70% of today\u0027s continental crust (*) had been formed. The processes were much faster, a softer mantle had higher convection rates, etc. I only wanted to present different views on the matter, i am not siding with the one or the other (but accepting all if reasonable).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so I concede radiogenic heating may have played a role, how big i do not know, but i can imagine that radiogenic heating is less needed for the modeling than other effects, that is probably the difference in our views.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: according to other sources \u0026gt;80% by 2.5Gy (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674987118300501\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674987118300501\u003C/a\u003E).
