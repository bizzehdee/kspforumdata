Is this something that just fizzled out, or does anyone know if it\u0027s something that\u0027s been worked on by the devs or the mod community. I think this sort of addition is crucial to make career mode feel more realistic and challenging. After all, NASA, Sace X and ULA don\u0027t lunch satellites they design. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-18T14:03:39Z\u0022 title=\u002204/18/2017 02:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 18, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Regiampiero\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-18T15:42:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere should be some standard sats that show up as subassemblies when you accept the contract, and those are the payload.

Also you shouldn\u0027t be able to use it as a relay satellite or accomplish another lateral contract, whit the exception of the Record Keeping Society Contracts.

The vice versa can be true too: build a satellite or payload for a given launch vehicle. In both cases, once the contact is complete, the vessel can disappear once the player leaves the flight scene. As far as stations, once it\u0027s spawned it should stay permanently, unless the game lets you at least watch the fireworks when it deorbits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StupidAndy","CreatedById":171175,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-20T00:00:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhow about a mode where you\u0027re like spacex and theres already space stations and such in orbit, and the career mode advances like that\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
