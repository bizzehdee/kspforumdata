That got me wondering and I of course did some searching with little results. But, if there is any one single place where this question might be easily answered, I bet it might be right here. I know there are many very knowledgeable people that browse this awesome forum. Of course I dont mean lesser flights and such or multisat launches like some of the amazing launches in the past. Single rocket launches the put something in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know the answer to that question? 5 seems like a lot for one day provided they all go off as scheduled. I hope to watch or follow them all if I can. Maybe a new record?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ultimate Steve","CreatedById":161505,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-14T16:32:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to your question, I have no idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut may I ask what the fifth launch is?
