The RCS tanks are just to give me enough RCS fuel to start lift off with RCS on, so many to remain symmetrical, may not be necessary with this version of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn earlier version had a smaller lander stage at the top, less height. It might be that it does get unstable at the top as that version was more stable, but had a smaller first stage. It enabled a Minimus landing, take-off, traverse to Mun, land, and take off with the final stage and make it home, but it was quite marginal fuelwise on the Mun landing, hence the attempt to lift a further few tanks into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ll experiment a bit with the suggestions, thanks.

That does tend to imply that the fins are needed for directional stability and that the thrust is not quite as symmetric as I would like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can build smaller craft, I want to lift more into orbit though. Might try using more large parts and reduce the staging. There\\\u0027s a fairly fine line I\\\u0027ve found between a reasonable stable craft and something with just a bit more power. Can be frustrating trying to get the balance just right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a 0.15 craft that did about 20 Mun and/or Minimus landings quite easily, and want to get someone larger to enable more flexibility.

Holy kerbals that\\\u0027s big. It looks to me like you\\\u0027re missing some struts between your top stage and the next one down. Those decouplers may very well be causing a wobble because of all the thrust and pressure below it. 15km? Sounds like you have excessive gforces working on the ship at that point.
