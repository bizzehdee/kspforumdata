The best thing I found was to get into an orbit that is generally close to Duna\u0026#39;s and then drop more manuever nodes to try to get something closer and closer to an intercept as you close in on it. You\u0026#39;ll have to do multiple burns to get a good course set up and then zoom in on the map so you can better see how you\u0026#39;re coming into the system and where you\u0026#39;re going pass relative to the various bodies.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T19:23:22Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Giacomo\u0027]With the intercept. Whatever I try, it will never get an intercept onto Duna.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOK, that\u0026#39;s a good starting point!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe first thing you have to do is make sure the planets are in the correct position for a transfer. The correct position is when Kerbin is at 3 o\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2clock and Duna is roughly between 1 and 2 o\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2clock. Go to the tracking station and move the camera so you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re looking down at the solar system from the top, then time warp until they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re in the mentioned position. Now you can launch.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo get an intercept, once you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re in orbit around Kerbin, place a maneuver node on the night side of Kerbin and pull on the prograde arm until you achieve an escape from Kerbin. Then zoom out and keep pulling until your trajectory barely touches Duna\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s orbit. Now zoom back in and make sure you will eject Kerbin in the same direction as its orbit around the Sun. If your ejection trajectory seems to be pointing in or out, drag it back and forth along your orbit to adjust. This will affect your final trajectory so you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll need to zoom back out and check it and make adjustments. You\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll likely find yourself zooming in and out and pulling back and forth on your maneuver several times until you get it right. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CRigth\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u009D means (1) you are ejecting exactly prograde in relation to Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s orbit around the Sun, and (2) your solar apoapsis barely touches Duna\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s orbit. If those 2 requirements are met and the positions of the planets were correct, you should now have an intercept.
