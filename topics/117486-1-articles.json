Hot, sunny, light breeze, the perfect Kerbin summer day. The only noise was the occasional bird, or rustling from the breeze. But all in one moment, the silence was shattered. The ground started shaking, animals running wildly. Everything was in panic, except for one little boy who had been wandering around the meadow outside of town. Instead of running, curiosity overtook him. The sound seemed to be coming from the other side of a soft hill in front of him, and compelled with curiosity, and quite a bit of adrenaline, he started up. Before he could see over the hill, it came into view. Shooting straight up, like an arrow shot at the sky, it rose quickly towards the clouds, leaving a thick, dark grey trail of smoke. All of the sudden, the very top shot off from the rest, just before the bulk of the thing catastrophically exploded, sending large metal pieces and a large fireball into the air. As the pieces started to fall, a parachute appeared above the very top of the object, and it fell slowly and softly back down and behind the hill. After his heart rate slowed down, and his adrenaline came to a reasonable level, only one thought overtook his mind. \u201CThat looked like a LOT of fun.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Little Jebediah had just witnessed the first manned rocket launch of Kerbal history, the first craft propelled from Kerbin\u2019s surface using exploding liquid fuel with a living kerbal on board. Although, he didn\u2019t remember anything being on the other side of that hill, so he quickly trekked up to the top to see where the rocket had come from. As he crested the hill, a newborn space center greeted him. There was a large main building, maybe 10 stories high, and a few other buildings scattered around. And there was a launch pad, with a little support tower on it, which at the moment was in flames from the wreckage raining down on top of it. Little Jebediah raced back into the village, finding his house as quickly as he could, and as he ran up the steps and in through the front door, he exclaimed \u201CMom! You\u2019ll never guess what I just saw!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m guessing it had something to do with all the shaking we just had? I thought it was a small Kerbquake!\u201D His mother, Sally Kerman, replied.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt wasn\u2019t a Kerbquake! It was a rocket!\u201D He exclaimed with glee.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA rocket? Are you sure? The last rocket I ever heard anything about was only the size of a few trashcans, and didn\u2019t even make it 100 feet into the air.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh yes mother, a rocket! It was really big, and it went really high into the air! Well, before it exploded. But the top part survived and parachuted down!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat? You mean there was actually a kerbal on that thing? I can\u2019t believe they are letting people endanger themselves so much!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt looked like a lot of fun. Can I do that when I grow up?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGoodness no, Jeb. You\u2019re way too smart to be in such danger.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWait, Jeb got to see a real rocket launch? No fair!\u201D little Val said, entering the room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt probably would\u0027ve scared you silly Val, just be glad you weren\u2019t there.\u201D Jeb sneered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJebediah Kerman! You be nice to your sister!\u201D Sally said. At this point Jeb and Val were having a contest to see who could stick their tongues out the most. It was quite funny to watch as each one tilted their head more forward to make it seem like their tongue was farther out. Suddenly, Jeb slurped his tongue back up into his mouth and smiled really big, before saying, \u201CWe\u2019ve got to go tell Bill and Bob!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Jeb and Val raced out the door and down the street to Bob\u2019s house. just outside, Jeb yelled \u201CBob! Meet at the clubhouse ASAP!\u201D and they continued down the street. Making a left turn, they rushed down the street to the very end, where Bill lived. Jeb shouted the same announcement as before, clubhouse ASAP. Then they turned right and went between two houses and into the woods. Ducking and dodging branches, they made their way to their clubhouse, which was three trees that had fallen together, forming a small triangle, with boards between them to form walls, which Bill\u2019s dad put together for them. Once inside, they panted until a crazy eyed Bill and Bob stumbled in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat\u2019s\u2026.going on? \u2026...What happened?\u201D Bill said between breaths. Bob continued to gasp, unable to say anything at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI just saw a huge rocket launch! And there was a kerbal on it!\u201D Jeb shouted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou mean\u2026...a bunch of buckets\u2026.with exploding liquid in them\u2026..just launched a kerbal?\u201D Bob wheezed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes! And it exploded!\u201D Bill and Bob both shared a look of horror.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut the top of the rocket survived, which is where I think the kerbal was. It parachuted down safely!\u201D They breathed a large sigh of relief, followed by coughing caused by them holding their breath.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt sounds really dangerous and scary.\u201D Bob said, finally regaining his breath.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI wonder how it works...how does it stay together? How does it go up?\u201D Bill questioned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI have no idea, but I sure do wanna try it!\u201D Jeb said while grinning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMe too!\u201D Val chimed in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0After this, they furiously discussed how they thought it worked, and how much fun it would be. A while later, they decided they should head home, as Kerbol was getting low in the sky, and they didn\u2019t want to be out past dark. That night, each of their heads was filled with dreams of rockets. Jeb and Val both dreamt of one day flying the rocket, being in control, feeling all the crazy forces. Bill\u2019s dreams were of figuring out how the rocket worked, and how to build one. And poor Bob had a nightmare of being on a rocket piloted by Jeb and somehow disassembling.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/117486-before-they-were-orange-chapter-three-rocky-path/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2142298\u0022\u003ERead Chapter Two Here!\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/117486-before-they-were-orange-chapter-three-rocky-path/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2191796\u0022\u003ERead Chapter Three Here!\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/117486-before-they-were-orange-chapter-three-rocky-path/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2517579\u0022\u003ERead Chapter Four Here!\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-16T22:46:15Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2016 10:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Endersmens\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T22:26:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOMG!

They continued out of the village and into the fateful meadow. Climbing the hill, they came to a stop at the top, and all but Jeb gasped at what lay before them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Yet after a moment, even Jeb gasped, as not just the space center was in front of them, but a new rocket!

Bob seemed worried about going that far away, but didn\u2019t want to be left behind either, so he followed. Jeb was so excited to get there that he wasn\u2019t thinking about the hill, and started going faster and faster, until his legs couldn\u2019t keep up, and he took a tumble. Bob gasped, Val laughed, and Bill said \u201CAre you alright?\u201D But before he got an answer, the dust settled and they saw Jeb there with a huge grin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CThat was awesome!\u201D He exclaimed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CIt looked painful, are you hurt?\u201D Bob asked, quite concerned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI\u2019m fine.

They walked up to the gate, and after a few seconds it opened. They scrambled in, and found a building to walk behind. The workers were so busy frantically preparing for another launch that they paid no attention to the half sized kerbanauts running around. As they rounded a corner, there it was. The biggest building they had ever seen. It was very tall, taller than they could\u2019ve imagined from far away. Once they had gotten around it, they saw tracks leading out to the launch pad. As their eyes followed the tracks, it led up a small ramp, and then all of them gasped. There is sat, almost as tall as the building behind them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CIt\u2019s...so much bigger than I thought it was!\u201D Jeb said, nearly stammering.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0They all shared the awe, until it was shattered by a sound. A sound none of them had heard before, but they all knew what it meant. It was an alarm siren. All of the workers scrambled into buildings frantically.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CUm. Guys?

The ground was shaking, and they all fell to the ground. Jeb tried to stand up, but as soon as he did, the blast from the engines got there, hot, smoky air blasted them and knocked him over again. Even he was scared at this point. Luckily, the rocket had gotten high enough that the ground stopped shaking, and the air settled down. The sound of the rocket soon faded, and it disappeared slowly into the sky, arching over the ocean. No explosions this time, to Jeb\u2019s slight disappointment.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWe almost died!\u201D Bob exclaimed, with a hint of anger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CNo we didn\u2019t.
