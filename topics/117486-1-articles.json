Hot, sunny, light breeze, the perfect Kerbin summer day. The only noise was the occasional bird, or rustling from the breeze. But all in one moment, the silence was shattered. The ground started shaking, animals running wildly. Everything was in panic, except for one little boy who had been wandering around the meadow outside of town. Instead of running, curiosity overtook him. The sound seemed to be coming from the other side of a soft hill in front of him, and compelled with curiosity, and quite a bit of adrenaline, he started up. Before he could see over the hill, it came into view. Shooting straight up, like an arrow shot at the sky, it rose quickly towards the clouds, leaving a thick, dark grey trail of smoke. All of the sudden, the very top shot off from the rest, just before the bulk of the thing catastrophically exploded, sending large metal pieces and a large fireball into the air. As the pieces started to fall, a parachute appeared above the very top of the object, and it fell slowly and softly back down and behind the hill. After his heart rate slowed down, and his adrenaline came to a reasonable level, only one thought overtook his mind. \u201CThat looked like a LOT of fun.\u201D\n\n    Little Jebediah had just witnessed the first manned rocket launch of Kerbal history, the first craft propelled from Kerbin\u2019s surface using exploding liquid fuel with a living kerbal on board. Although, he didn\u2019t remember anything being on the other side of that hill, so he quickly trekked up to the top to see where the rocket had come from. As he crested the hill, a newborn space center greeted him. There was a large main building, maybe 10 stories high, and a few other buildings scattered around. And there was a launch pad, with a little support tower on it, which at the moment was in flames from the wreckage raining down on top of it. Little Jebediah raced back into the village, finding his house as quickly as he could, and as he ran up the steps and in through the front door, he exclaimed \u201CMom! You\u2019ll never guess what I just saw!\u201D\n\n\u201CI\u2019m guessing it had something to do with all the shaking we just had? I thought it was a small Kerbquake!\u201D His mother, Sally Kerman, replied. \n\n\u201CIt wasn\u2019t a Kerbquake! It was a rocket!\u201D He exclaimed with glee.\n\n\u201CA rocket? Are you sure? The last rocket I ever heard anything about was only the size of a few trashcans, and didn\u2019t even make it 100 feet into the air.\u201D\n\n\u201COh yes mother, a rocket! It was really big, and it went really high into the air! Well, before it exploded. But the top part survived and parachuted down!\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat? You mean there was actually a kerbal on that thing? I can\u2019t believe they are letting people endanger themselves so much!\u201D\n\n\u201CIt looked like a lot of fun. Can I do that when I grow up?\u201D\n\n\u201CGoodness no, Jeb. You\u2019re way too smart to be in such danger.\u201D\n\n\u201CWait, Jeb got to see a real rocket launch? No fair!\u201D little Val said, entering the room.\n\n\u201CIt probably would\u0027ve scared you silly Val, just be glad you weren\u2019t there.\u201D Jeb sneered.\n\n\u201CJebediah Kerman! You be nice to your sister!\u201D Sally said. At this point Jeb and Val were having a contest to see who could stick their tongues out the most. It was quite funny to watch as each one tilted their head more forward to make it seem like their tongue was farther out. Suddenly, Jeb slurped his tongue back up into his mouth and smiled really big, before saying, \u201CWe\u2019ve got to go tell Bill and Bob!\u201D\n\n    Jeb and Val raced out the door and down the street to Bob\u2019s house. just outside, Jeb yelled \u201CBob! Meet at the clubhouse ASAP!\u201D and they continued down the street. Making a left turn, they rushed down the street to the very end, where Bill lived. Jeb shouted the same announcement as before, clubhouse ASAP. Then they turned right and went between two houses and into the woods. Ducking and dodging branches, they made their way to their clubhouse, which was three trees that had fallen together, forming a small triangle, with boards between them to form walls, which Bill\u2019s dad put together for them. Once inside, they panted until a crazy eyed Bill and Bob stumbled in.\n\n\u201CWhat\u2019s\u2026.going on? \u2026...What happened?\u201D Bill said between breaths. Bob continued to gasp, unable to say anything at all.\n\n\u201CI just saw a huge rocket launch! And there was a kerbal on it!\u201D Jeb shouted.\n\n\u201CYou mean\u2026...a bunch of buckets\u2026.with exploding liquid in them\u2026..just launched a kerbal?\u201D Bob wheezed.  \n\n\u201CYes! And it exploded!\u201D Bill and Bob both shared a look of horror. \n\n\u201CBut the top of the rocket survived, which is where I think the kerbal was. It parachuted down safely!\u201D They breathed a large sigh of relief, followed by coughing caused by them holding their breath.\n\n\u201CIt sounds really dangerous and scary.\u201D Bob said, finally regaining his breath.\n\n\u201CI wonder how it works...how does it stay together? How does it go up?\u201D Bill questioned.\n\n\u201CI have no idea, but I sure do wanna try it!\u201D Jeb said while grinning.\n\n\u201CMe too!\u201D Val chimed in.\n\n    After this, they furiously discussed how they thought it worked, and how much fun it would be. A while later, they decided they should head home, as Kerbol was getting low in the sky, and they didn\u2019t want to be out past dark. That night, each of their heads was filled with dreams of rockets. Jeb and Val both dreamt of one day flying the rocket, being in control, feeling all the crazy forces. Bill\u2019s dreams were of figuring out how the rocket worked, and how to build one. And poor Bob had a nightmare of being on a rocket piloted by Jeb and somehow disassembling.  \n\n[Read Chapter Two Here!](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/117486-before-they-were-orange-chapter-three-rocky-path/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2142298)\n\n[Read Chapter Three Here!](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/117486-before-they-were-orange-chapter-three-rocky-path/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2191796)\n\n[Read Chapter Four Here!](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/117486-before-they-were-orange-chapter-three-rocky-path/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2517579)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-16T22:46:15Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2016 10:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Endersmens**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T22:26:55Z","Content":"OMG!

Hanging a right, he stopped in front of Bob\u2019s house. Right on cue, Bob came out the door and down the steps. \n\n    \u201CWhy are you in such a rush? This isn\u2019t a good idea anyways\u201D said Bob, with a concerned look on his face.\n\n    \u201CJust come on, let\u0027s go!\u201D Bill replied.\n\n    Bob scrambled to keep up with Bill, and as they neared Jeb\u2019s house, Jeb and Val ran out the door and joined them in step. They continued out of the village and into the fateful meadow. Climbing the hill, they came to a stop at the top, and all but Jeb gasped at what lay before them. \n\n    Yet after a moment, even Jeb gasped, as not just the space center was in front of them, but a new rocket! It looked like the one he had already seen, but he wasn\u2019t positive, as it was moving very quickly. \n\n    \u201CWhen do you think it will launch?\u201D Val asked, practically youmping with anticipation.\n\n    \u201CI\u2019m not sure, but I\u2019m gonna find out!\u201D Jeb replied.\n\n    Jeb started down the hill towards the space center. Bob seemed worried about going that far away, but didn\u2019t want to be left behind either, so he followed. Jeb was so excited to get there that he wasn\u2019t thinking about the hill, and started going faster and faster, until his legs couldn\u2019t keep up, and he took a tumble. Bob gasped, Val laughed, and Bill said \u201CAre you alright?\u201D But before he got an answer, the dust settled and they saw Jeb there with a huge grin.\n\n    \u201CThat was awesome!\u201D He exclaimed.\n\n    \u201CIt looked painful, are you hurt?\u201D Bob asked, quite concerned.\n\n    \u201CI\u2019m fine. C\u2019mon slowpoke!\u201D\n\n    They continued now, at a much safer speed, to the bottom of the hill. It seemed like the space center was really far away from the top, but now at the bottom it loomed over them. \n\n    \u201CDo you think they\u2019ll let us in?\u201D asked Bill, as they approached a fence and gate.\n\n    \u201CI doubt it, grownups are always no fun.\u201D Val said with a frown.\n\n    \u201CHey, look over here!\u201D came Jeb\u2019s voice from a little ways away.\n\n    He was standing next to a pile of presumably old test helmets. All but Bob shared a devious smile. \n\n    \u201CAre you sure this is a good idea?\u201D He asked.\n\n    \u201CSure it is! Now come on, put it on so we can sneak in!\u201D Jeb replied, muffled by the helmet.\n\n    Reluctantly, Bob slipped on the helmet. They walked up to the gate, and after a few seconds it opened. They scrambled in, and found a building to walk behind. The workers were so busy frantically preparing for another launch that they paid no attention to the half sized kerbanauts running around. As they rounded a corner, there it was. The biggest building they had ever seen. It was very tall, taller than they could\u2019ve imagined from far away. Once they had gotten around it, they saw tracks leading out to the launch pad. As their eyes followed the tracks, it led up a small ramp, and then all of them gasped. There is sat, almost as tall as the building behind them. \n\n    \u201CIt\u2019s...so much bigger than I thought it was!\u201D Jeb said, nearly stammering.\n\n    They all shared the awe, until it was shattered by a sound. A sound none of them had heard before, but they all knew what it meant. It was an alarm siren. All of the workers scrambled into buildings frantically. \n\n    \u201CUm. Guys? Shouldn\u2019t we be getting out of here?\u201D Bob asked, seeming desperate to get away from there.\n\n    \u201CI\u2019m not sure. Maybe we should-\u201D Jeb said, before getting cut off.\n\nA loud static filled voice cut him off. \u201CTen, nine, eight\u2026.\u201D\n\n    \u201CGuys! Let\u2019s get out of here now!\u201D Bob screamed.\n\nAs they turned around they heard \u201Cthree, engine ignition, two, one, liftoff!\u201D And were deafened by the roar of the engines. The ground was shaking, and they all fell to the ground. Jeb tried to stand up, but as soon as he did, the blast from the engines got there, hot, smoky air blasted them and knocked him over again. Even he was scared at this point. Luckily, the rocket had gotten high enough that the ground stopped shaking, and the air settled down. The sound of the rocket soon faded, and it disappeared slowly into the sky, arching over the ocean. No explosions this time, to Jeb\u2019s slight disappointment. \n\n    \u201CWe almost died!\u201D Bob exclaimed, with a hint of anger.\n\n    \u201CNo we didn\u2019t. We were fine. just don\u2019t tell your dad about this.\u201D Jeb said.\n\n    \u201CUm. Who\u2019s that guy?\u201D Val said, pointing at one of the workers running towards them.\n\n    \u201CHey! What are you doing out here - wait, you aren\u2019t pilots!\u201D\n\n    \u201CUm\u2026\u201D Jeb stammered. \n\n    \u201CWait, you guys are just kids! What are you doing here? How did you get in here? You guys are coming with me.\u201D\n\n    \u201CGreat.\u201D Bob murmured.\n\nHe led them to a small building behind the massive one. Inside were some offices and desks. They walked down a long hallway to the last door. The badge on the door read \u201CVon Kerman\u201D  \n\nAs they walked in, there was a kerbal sitting in a chair, facing the other way. \n\n    \u201CSir, I found these kids outside. They were out by the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E during the launch.\u201D\n\n    The kerbal turned around in his chair swiftly. \u201CVhat did you say?\u201D He said.\n\n    \u201CThey were out by the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E during the launch.\u201D\n\n    Wernher turned towards the four, with a concerned look on his face. \u201CAre you ok?\u201D  \n\n    \u201CWell, actually- OOF! Hey!\u201D Bob said, before getting a hit in the gut from Jeb.\n\n    \u201CYes, we are fine.\u201D Val said calmly.\n\n    \u201CI thought ze whole reason ve vuilt the vunkers was that nobody could survive a launch from ze outside.\u201D \n\n    \u201CI guess we were wrong.\u201D The worker said.\n\n    \u201CYou may leave now, Dunly. Now, how did you kids get in here?\u201D\n\n    \u201CWe found some old helmets and put them on.\u201D Jeb said, getting a look from Val like he shouldn\u2019t have said that.\n\n    \u201CHmmmmm\u2026.Interesting.\u201D he said, scribbling \u201CImprove security\u201D On his notepad. \u201CVhy did you sneak in?\u201D\n\n    \u201CBecause I saw the launch yesterday, and I needed to learn more.\u201D Jeb said.\n\n    \u201CAnd I needed to find out how they work.\u201D Bill said.\n\n    \u201CAnd I wanted to see a launch, because it wasn\u2019t fair that Jeb got to.\u201D Val said.\n\n    \u201CAnd *they* wouldn\u2019t let me stay home.\u201D Bob said under his breath.\n\n    \u201CInteresting. Such curiosity. I haven\u2019t seen such enthusiasm yet in this business. Well. I supposed I should call your parents.\u201D\n\n    \u201COnly call mine.\u201D Jeb said. \u201CMy dad won\u2019t be mad.\u201D  \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-31T10:53:34Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2016 10:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Endersmens**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T15:22:03Z","Content":"Nice!

Admit it, the rocket launch was cool.\u201D Jeb said, giving Bob a smile. Bob was trying hard to keep himself from smiling back, and eventually gave up.\n\n    \u201CYeah. It was pretty cool. Scary, dangerous, and possibly insane. But it was cool.\u201D Bob said, as the others chuckled. A knock was heard at the door.\n\n    \u201CYou may come in\u201D Wernher said. Dunly appeared again.\n\n    \u201CI have a mister Edlie Kerman here.\u201D Dunly said, looking behind him.\n\n    \u201CAh yes, mister Edlie Kerman. you are zis one\u2019s father, correct?\u201D He said, motioning towards Jeb.\n\n    \u201CYes, that one\u2019s mine. What did he do this time?\u201D\n\n    \u201CHe snuck into ze space center, vith his friends.\u201D  Giving a concerned look, Edlie turned towards Jeb with the you\u2019re in trouble look. \u201CBut do not worry, I am not upset at them.

Edlie nodded at Jeb.\n\n    \u201CI saw a rocket launch yesterday. Well. Almost launch. It was really cool, and I found this place. And I told my friends and we all decided...well, all of us except for Bob, that we needed to come find out what\u2019s going on here.\u201D\n\n    \u201CSo, you saw something cool and couldn\u2019t help your curiosity. I see. Are they in any sort of trouble?\u201D Edlie questioned.\n\n    \u201CWell, zhey snuck into our space center, impersonated staff, and stayed outside during launch. Zhey should be going to jail. However, I\u2019ve found a fondness of them, I zhink with some teaching, zhey will learn a lot about what we\u2019re doing here, and maybe someday, zhey can be ze reason zhis program works.\u201D\n\n    \u201CI don\u2019t know about that, I\u2019m only Jeb and Val\u2019s father, I can\u2019t speak for Bill and Bob\u2019s parents.
