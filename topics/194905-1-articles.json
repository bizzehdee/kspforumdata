I wanted to try a new challenge, but i\u0027m having troubles creating the ship. So i thought to ask you guys for a ship that can take 3 Kerbals and some science to an simple Eve flyby and bring\u00A0them back to Kerbin. Preferentially, a fully stock ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lewie","CreatedById":203745,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-20T19:18:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow about we help you design one? We can help you get what you need, but you can add your own touch to it. It\u2019s much more satisfying doing this type of mission with a craft that you created.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingPete","CreatedById":127384,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-10T06:44:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI \u0027borrowed\u0027 a contract space station to flyby both Moho and Eve in the early game. The contract involved\u00A0just a science lab, living cabin, batteries and solar power. I launched a boarding party in a 3-man pod with extra fuel and a poodle engine, docked with it and commandeered the station. Remember to add some science experiments to one part or the other. It worked well!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have fuel left on arrival at Kerbin, feel free to put the station back where you found it, otherwise just abandon it and do an aerobraking reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
