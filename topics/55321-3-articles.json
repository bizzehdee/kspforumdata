I have to come up with some standard to list Epic Engineers of the likes of Wackjob and Mulbin. If you guys have better ideas, I\u0027m open to it. For now I figured that epic builders are those who have designs posted in the main Spacecraft Exchange forum which garner over 100 responses.

I thought 100 posts for a design thread in Spacecraft Exchange would be sufficient, though not perfect (there isn\u0027t really a perfect standard), would at least give a baseline to being considered for the Epic Engineer listing.

If we put some kind of rule, like, say, rep (would seem to make sense), or number of responses to a thread, well, those things can be farmed and/or inaccurate because of reasons. And if you just pick the guys you think are \u0022epic\u0022, well, someone will think different. Obviously the thing we can agree upon is that they should have some kind of thread showcasing their builds at least, but other than that...
