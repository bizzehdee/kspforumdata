The first few flights were easy enough but when I build a larger ship there turned out to be a design flaw in it and started pointing towards kerbin while still the boosters were still on. An escape plan is more a necessity and mistakes are a horrible tragic. I lost Jeb and Bill because the boosters I had to test were so powerful they just destroyed the entire ship.
