To all those coming back after whatever time you\u0027ve been away, what brought you back? For me, I got disinterested for a while after around 1.2-ish, I can\u0027t remember exactly, and I came back just before the game released the breaking ground expansion, witch ultimately brought me back for good. Since then, I felt like I was having the same fun I was having when I first got the game, and with the newer quality of life features, like the maneuver node tweaks and\u00A0kerbal engineer-like features, I feel like I\u0027m better than I ever was with the game. (Note, in the past I had never downloaded anything like kerbal engineer, I thought they weren\u0027t necessary. While technically true, I don\u0027t think I could play properly now without things like a delta-v readout.) In summary, you could say I was brought back by features I have either wanted for a while, or didn\u0027t know I wanted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-23T22:01:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t say I ever \u0027went away\u0027 as such.\u00A0 Though I have had several\u00A0longish gaps where I haven\u0027t played.\u00A0 Recently I lost inspiration\u00A0to play and start any big \u0027projects\u0027 in anticipation\u00A0 of KSP2, as well as having \u0027other stuff\u0027 to do, so hadn\u0027t played \u0027properly\u0027 for a few months.\u00A0 But fired it up again today to get my fleet of survey probes in their orbits in preparation\u00A0for more crewed\u00A0 missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"archiebald","CreatedById":195579,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-24T07:10:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI bought a better computer that would run KSP how I wanted to see it without too much lag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-24T13:18:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, you\u0027ll just raise up the details \u0026amp; effects level to see how it looks on the better computer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUntil you achieve the appropriate lag which you had gotten used to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-24T14:34:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI quit so long ago I don\u0027t remember any particular reason for moving on...
