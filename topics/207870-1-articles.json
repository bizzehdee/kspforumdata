The argument goes that you can measure the precise species of, say, an ion through spectroscopy, knowing exactly what element and what isotope it is based on using its fine/hyperfine electronic structure. Thus you know enough quantum numbers to meaningfully know its state, which would be relevant in taking advantage of the effect. The strong conjecture is that you can generally halt particle-emission decays by rapid enough measurements of its state, as a change to its nuclear or electronic structure would be detectable via energy level shifts that your lasers would be tuned to take advantage of (perhaps even a gamma decay could be affected if your apparatus was sensitive and precise enough to tune a laser to the very-super-ultra-fine splitting that would [presumably] be caused by differences in nuclear volume between the excited and relaxed nuclear states). The weak conjecture is that this would only work in something such as \u003Csup\u003E7\u003C/sup\u003EBe\u003Csup\u003E\u002B3\u003C/sup\u003E, which decays via electron capture and has only one electron, and so the spectroscopy would be directly acting upon a particle actually involved in the decay. Importantly, a distinction is made in this latter case between a change in decay rate due to the Zeno Effect and a change due to changing the electron capture\u0027s cross-section via literally just changing where it\u0027s spending its time. Additionally, if you could directly address nuclear energy levels and nucleons, would this change anything?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe null conjecture is that this is nonsense, which I\u0027m inclined towards by gut but don\u0027t have the quantum theory chops to argue or mathematically demonstrate. feel free to laugh at our brief episode of insanity if none of this makes any sense. also feel free to talk about random cool quantum stuff if any comes to mind\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-04-22T00:57:42Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2022 12:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Vanamonde\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMind the language, please.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-22T05:05:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fundamental law of the physics, known as the Sod\u0027s law, tells us that once you have prevented one statistically random event, you get ten at the other side of the preventing device.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, maybe it\u0027s possible, but be ready for\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022maxresdefault.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002260.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u_RzlhR4Uac/maxresdefault.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nof\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002260c03ee67c64a.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://images.gamebanana.com/img/ss/mods/60c03ee67c64a.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nin the statistically connected part of your emitter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-04-22T05:06:03Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2022 05:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
