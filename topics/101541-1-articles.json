Before I started using Extraplanetary Launchpads, I had set up a Kethane base on Minmus and found that the old adage \u0022Once you\u0027re in orbit, you\u0027re halfway to anywhere\u0022 is very VERY true. All you need to do is build a ship that can get into orbit, and then ferry down all the fuel from your base on Minmus to that ship, fill it up, and then that ship can get anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEasier (though more wasteful but now that Karbonite has unlimited supplies of fuel at any drilling station wasteful is not an issue) is to make the ship a little bigger at launch time and make it so it can arrive at Minmus with dry tanks. Then fill it up there, and from there burn down to a low Kerbin periapsis at the correct time and use the Oberth effect to launch out to your destination. And as a bonus, you will feel like a BadS for nailing that maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith EPLP installed, things go from cheaper to free, as you can just build the ship on Minmus (or in Orbit) and fly off from there. The only thing you need to launch from Kerbin then is the astronauts, and all they need is enough dV to get from the launchpad to Minmus orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T17:32:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s an old adage saying \u0022time is money\u0022. It applies in a surprisingly large number of situations. Also in this one, for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHauling fuel to orbit is expensive, yes. You can probably save a lot of money mining your own. But do you know what you will be doing then? You\u0027ll be mining and hauling fuel for a mission instead of actually flying that mission. Everything will take you a whole lot longer, and certain tasks will quickly get repetitive and unexciting. As such, there\u0027s a tradeoff: do you pay money and fly now - or do you pay with your playtime, spending an hour to procure your \u0022free\u0022 fuel from a mining station, conducting orbital rendezvous and docking maneuvers and other such things?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe resource mechanic is probably not truly suited as a long-term primary fuel infrastructure. I mean, I don\u0027t doubt that it will work as such, sure - but you\u0027ll be doing tasks that are not particularly fun to play. At the same time, you don\u0027t want to ignore the refueling mechanic completely, either. Where it is really going to shine, I think, is when it enables you to fly missions that would involve excessive launch and transfer costs. Prime example: a vessel designed to make manned landings on all of Jool\u0027s moons and return. That Tylo lander is going to be \u003Cem\u003Eheavy\u003C/em\u003E, and that\u0027s not yet taking care of the other four moons. Maybe, depending on how the mining equipment turns out, it might actually weigh less than the contents of the tanks of the Tylo lander - and in that case, well you just launch towards Jool with all your lander tanks empty. That will greatly reduce the weight, launch cost and assembly tedium of the vessel. Once at Jool, you hit up Bop and/or Pol, and mine them for fuel for the larger landers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T17:41:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy costs are low anyway, because I use SSTO\u0027s to do nearly everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERefueling in space will open up new capabilities for spacecraft.
