If I couldn\u0027t make the rocket aerodynamic, the craft would flip and burn from the behind while reentering.\n\nNow in 1.02 the craft never burns. Like, never. I\u0027ve reentered from a steep orbit Minmus-Kerbin, at 3k m/s, and nothing, the heat shield stayed at 200. Also I enjoyed the fact that in 1.02 the atmosphere wouldn\u0027t completely stop your craft descending. Now it goes to 100 m/s at a couple thousand metres, and stays like that. In 1.0 if you went too fast for reentry, if the craft didn\u0027t burn up, then it would horribly crash at crazy speeds (if you consider the invincible parachute a bug, I mean)\n\nWhat do you think about that? Also do you know whether it was more realistic for reentry to slow so much, like in 1.02 (compared to real life reentry)? I\u0027ve read a lot of complaints about the atmosphere for the rocket to go to space, but little feedback for the rocket to reentry. I\u0027d like to know your opinions (for realism sake and also because I\u0027ve been unlucky and I didn\u0027t play a lot of 1.0 before the 1.02 patch)"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyomoto","CreatedById":64780,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T18:41:21Z","Content":"They are clearly playing around with the heat mechanics as they seem to have adjusted greatly between 1.0 and 1.0.2. I have questions as well on this topic. Previously you are correct, coming in too fast was a recipe for disaster, but now it works more like FAR does where you are slowed down the deeper into the atmosphere you go. Because of this, heating doesn\u0027t seem to be as big of a deal as it was before because heat is pretty generous in general.\n\nAs an alternate though, I love flying planes. Now I have issues where my planes overheat just from the friction of flying through the atmosphere for long periods of time. It might be a byproduct of using physics warp, I haven\u0027t tested that out, but now I have questions about cooling. Once I land the craft, you\u0027d think sitting it idle for a while would be enough to cool it a bit but that isn\u0027t what seems to happen.\n\nSo I go back to my original sentence, it seems the heat mechanics are more in-development than finished mostly because feedback about them is very limited. The overheat bars only show up once they hit 50% so it\u0027s hard to see how they are heating/cooling based on the world around them."},{"CreatedByName":"LameLefty","CreatedById":57336,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T18:46:37Z","Content":"You must have messed with settings in the Debug menu or config files - return from an 100km orbital mission (targeting a 30km periapsis) took the ablator down to about 185.
