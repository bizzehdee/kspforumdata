I have questions as well on this topic. Previously you are correct, coming in too fast was a recipe for disaster, but now it works more like FAR does where you are slowed down the deeper into the atmosphere you go. Because of this, heating doesn\u0027t seem to be as big of a deal as it was before because heat is pretty generous in general.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an alternate though, I love flying planes. Now I have issues where my planes overheat just from the friction of flying through the atmosphere for long periods of time. It might be a byproduct of using physics warp, I haven\u0027t tested that out, but now I have questions about cooling. Once I land the craft, you\u0027d think sitting it idle for a while would be enough to cool it a bit but that isn\u0027t what seems to happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I go back to my original sentence, it seems the heat mechanics are more in-development than finished mostly because feedback about them is very limited. The overheat bars only show up once they hit 50% so it\u0027s hard to see how they are heating/cooling based on the world around them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LameLefty","CreatedById":57336,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T18:46:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou must have messed with settings in the Debug menu or config files - return from an 100km orbital mission (targeting a 30km periapsis) took the ablator down to about 185.
