I\u0027ve tried to push its boundaries, but the only boundary I\u0027ve found so far is overheating. However if you feel so inclined, you can switch of heating and get up to 1200m/s (Mach 3.5) at 1km. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite it\u0027s entire design being based solely on speed, this plane doesn\u0027t sacrifice agility nor aesthetics to achieve its goal. This plane can easily pull off 15G\u002B turns, and no matter what your speed going this thing will still turn fast without breaking. If you don\u0027t mind me saying so, the lines look pretty smooth and the plane has a very polished look. Even the top airbrake blends seamlessly with the rest of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe\u0027s got a lot more lift then you would think; you can glide comfortably below 40m/s without worries. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone\u0027s interested, I\u0027ll upload a craft file.
