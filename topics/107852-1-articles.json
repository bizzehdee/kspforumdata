Mach 2.3 at Sea Level.","CreatedByName":"CitizenAerospace","CreatedById":107486,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T10:40:39Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"CitizenAerospace","CreatedById":107486,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T10:40:39Z","Content":"This is the Streak; its a small, one seater plane that will go as fast as you want it to. I\u0027ve tried to push its boundaries, but the only boundary I\u0027ve found so far is overheating. However if you feel so inclined, you can switch of heating and get up to 1200m/s (Mach 3.5) at 1km. \n\nDespite it\u0027s entire design being based solely on speed, this plane doesn\u0027t sacrifice agility nor aesthetics to achieve its goal. This plane can easily pull off 15G\u002B turns, and no matter what your speed going this thing will still turn fast without breaking. If you don\u0027t mind me saying so, the lines look pretty smooth and the plane has a very polished look. Even the top airbrake blends seamlessly with the rest of the craft.\n\nShe\u0027s got a lot more lift then you would think; you can glide comfortably below 40m/s without worries. \n\nIf anyone\u0027s interested, I\u0027ll upload a craft file. For the mean time, enjoy the pictures and take my word for it when I say there is no magic involved. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I\u0027ve found that size isn\u0027t really an issue (the jet engines can basically just power over drag no matter what the size), I\u0027ve got a larger one that hits 1km/s a lot faster at sea level but I find smaller planes funnier to fly. \n\nAs for the download, sure, here you go: \n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/xhqmpxix7joqelx/Streak%201.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xhqmpxix7joqelx/Streak%201.craft?dl=0)\n\nAlso, just found out that if you angle this thing right you can shoot the Ap. to 80km ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nYep, stock jets are insanely over powered.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T06:14:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 06:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CitizenAerospace**"}]}
