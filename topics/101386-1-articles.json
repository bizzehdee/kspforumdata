Dunno about Unity (default answer for Unity is \u0022no\u0022 or \u0022yes, but with the following 8,235 caveats that are game-breakingly bad, which basically also means no\u0022...).\n\nOne problem with editing the config file, however, is that if you change any settings, KSP instantly and automatically derps and forgets the custom-set resolution, and defaults to 1024x768. A workaround is creating a custom resolution in the graphics driver control panel, which will let you set it with the arrows, and KSP won\u0027t insta-derp it away the moment you change any other settings.\n\n(I set up a custom 1900x1000 resolution - it gives me a window that covers most of my 1920x1080 desktop, but leaves enough space for easy centering, and the taskbar/etc. Note that it\u0027s important to not actually set your desktop to that bogus resolution..just the game ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) )"},{"CreatedByName":"seb-eisdrache","CreatedById":95643,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T00:09:51Z","Content":"With this option the resolution will change dynamicly, also the position of the ui elements."}]}
