Results can and will effect the game plot. Making things alternately easier or harder for you. And yes... you would also get to do your reporter job as Clark Kent and chat it up with coworkers. There would be first person action gameplay to for rescuing people too. Characters included would be Lex Luthor of course (would make for interesting RPG choices and chats), Lois, and Perry White who would always be a tough work boss with you, forcing you to choose between developing office relationships\u00A0or being Superman at certain points in the game. You would need sone combo of both to get a good ending, and it would be easier to get a bad ending than not to. You would actualky need to understand what makes people tick to not fail badly. Since as powerful as Superman is, sone stuff he cannot punch his way out of. Some stuff he needs help with (time bombs for example). Oh yeah.. include Batman. The Batman who distrusts Superman. Just fir extra challenge. Yes... you can crush the annoying Batman\u00A0like a bug... but you might need him later so was that really wise?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow about you?
