The world outside KSP has already solved this problem for shopping on a computer, which is effectively what we are doing as we search for parts when building our rockets and other contraptions. The problem was solved with filters and advanced searches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022XkF0VhW.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002289.90\u0022 height=\u0022926\u0022 width=\u00221030\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/XkF0VhW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo why not add this kind of capability to KSP as well?

I know people personally that were largely turned of by KSP because when they went into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to make a rocket they had no idea what they were even looking at. Not only\u00A0will a better implementation of filters be a great quality of life improvement but it can also guide newer players in pointing out what kind of specs a part type has that matters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
