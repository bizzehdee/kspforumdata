It says it when I try and place a node and the node doesn\u2019t let me place it, it just keeps saying Map/OutOfFuelManeuverNode. I still have fuel in my rocket too. It seems like it\u2019ll happen randomly. Like when 2 rockets are docked together, I had to get my kerbal out of the ship he was in and into the other docked ship attached. Which doesn\u2019t make sense because the ship I had to transfer him to already had a probe to control it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-08-09T12:30:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2023 12:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Aug 9\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Runestedt\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moocheen","CreatedById":144350,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-10T14:51:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeeing the same issue.
