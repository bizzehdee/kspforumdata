I\u0027ve just had the experience of trying to land an automated kethane drill rig, only to find that the seemingly flat bit between a couple of large craters (as seen from orbit) was actually on something like a 30 degree slope; having then hopped away and tried another site almost as untenable, I then managed to come down on a mere 9 degree slope, enabling my reaction wheel and dwindling supply of monopropellant to keep the rig from falling over (it\u0027s tall with a centre of mass just above the top of where the landing legs attach) whilst it drilled for kethane to produce enough fuel for a further hop - and then luckily found a patch no more than 3 degrees out of horizontal.

Having been rather spoiled by how easy it is to get to and do useful/interesting stuff on Minmus, trying to repeat that with the Mun has proven much harder than I expected. I\u0027ve had to rejig my thinking on ship design somewhat in order to come up with a lander that\u0027s also capable of returning to Kerbin. But it\u0027s pretty much a one attempt or bail out affair even now (that is, if a piloted ship can\u0027t safely land, it has to abort by returning to Kerbin), because the fuel margins are that thin. My drill rig was a special case, in that it landed near empty but was then able to refuel itself a bit, hop to somewhere a bit safer, refuel itself a lot, hop to somewhere within a few degrees of flat.
