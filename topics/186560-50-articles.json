Artemis II will be the first crewed flight of the combined system and NASA has committed to a launch readiness date of no later than April 2023, but slippage in the Artemis I launch date likely will result in a delay of the Artemis II launch to August 2023. According to our estimates, by the time Artemis II launches the Agency will have spent $19 billion in development costs on Orion ($6.3 billion of which was spent on development of the crew vehicle under the predecessor Constellation Program). NASA plans to spend an additional $3 billion in production costs on the Orion Program by the time Artemis II launches, $2.2 billion of which will fall under a new contract with Lockheed for future Artemis missions signed in September 2019. Artemis III, which is included in this new production contract, will support the return of humans to the Moon in 2024.

And SLS is much less capable than the Saturn V when it comes to TLI throw weight - the result of using a vehicle configuration that is optimized more-so for sending light payloads to high energy trajectories. Part of it is the use of the RL-10 on the upper stages. Good engine for low payload masses, but you need higher thrust to better combat gravity losses. The S-IVB had something like ten times the thrust of the ICPS, and more than twice the thrust of the proposed EUS. Add to that a sub-optimal staging set up and limitations brought on by other engineering problems and you get a vehicle that really just isn\u0027t as useful.

No idea why they went with the dumb sustainer idea with SRBs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAres V launches Altair (the lander), and Orion docks and they go to LLO. Since Orion (the CEV* at the time) was supposed to also be an ISS vehicle, it was similarly not very capable SM wise. So Altair does the LOI burn (Orion only needed enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E to get home from LLO). Altair lands, returns, Orion goes home. Ares V also seen as a cargo vehicle to deliver parts for a Mars rocket to LEO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ARM mission was make-work for SLS/Orion. SLS/Orion was getting built, but since they had no lander (and no money to get one), and no actual mission, they needed something to DO in a distant lunar orbit. So they were to send a robot to grab a chunk of asteroid, then bring it to lunar orbit (for reasons), then rendezvous with it way out there (for reasons), and EVA to take pieces back to Earth. The samples? Totally useful. Collecting them by hand? LOL.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, from Constellation, the bit worth keeping was the Ares V concept\u2014even if it needed to go RS-25 so it could actually work. Cargo SHLV. Instead, they took Orion\u2014too heavy, and designed with a small SM because they had the lander doing more work in Constellation\u2014and stuck it on top. That is the fundamental reason why SLS just can\u0027t work as it stands. If you stipulate that the program must use Orion, SLS can never be good enough as it is. If you stipulate you must keep SLS, then they must dump Orion, and use a smaller capsule\u2014at best SLS will send almost Apollo level mass to TLI, so instead of a more massive capsule, they need a lower mass capsule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think an architecture using SLS ever makes much sense. It\u0027s super expensive, but that would not be an insurmountable problem if it was also \u003Cem\u003Esuper capable\u003C/em\u003E relative to any competing vehicle. It will certainly be more capable for a while, but not nearly enough for the cost. To be really useful it needs to be able to send, well, substantially more than Apollo to TLI, I can\u0027t see any alternative to that. And I mean that as just a \u0022naked\u0022 upper stage. If they could fly a bare EUS with a docking port that could send 60t to TLI, then commercial vehicles can send a lander to LEO, NG could send Orion, they attach to EUS, and go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*edited, thx \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/185383-barzon/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022185383\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/185383-barzon/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Barzon\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-17T14:16:31Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2020 02:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RCgothic","CreatedById":132560,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-17T06:35:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be completely fair, 34t-37t to TLI (Block 1B) works with a stretched service module\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eif 2 can launch in quick succession.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003ELunar Orbit Rendezvous with a lander works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut SLS can never fly that often.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Barzon","CreatedById":185383,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-17T11:16:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223821744\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022186560\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221594940559\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119411\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, tater said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(the MPCV at the time)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrion was CEV during\u00A0 Constellation, current Orion is MPCV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Barzon","CreatedById":185383,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-17T15:19:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed3623113168\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=https://twitter.com/NASA_SLS/status/1284133630210707460\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jadebenn","CreatedById":41164,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-30T16:58:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223816501\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022186560\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221594133907\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022132560\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RCgothic\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/7/2020 at 9:58 AM, RCgothic said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEUS is so going to be cancelled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUh, no?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nML-2\u0027s entered fabrication.
