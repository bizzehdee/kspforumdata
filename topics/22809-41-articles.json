Is there something special about the 64-bit Windows version that makes it buggier?

Personally I think it is related to the Unity Player as other 64-bit Unity apps display some of the same issues (an easy example is the mouse right button issue), but I hope there are some tweaks that can be made in the KSP code or mod code to resolve the crash one. The Linux version was very buggy to start with, so I think we are just going through the same steps as that, but a little further down the road game wise\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Trann","CreatedById":83801,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T04:30:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI came across a situation which might (barely) warrant another feature to KAC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarning: rambling story ahead; skip for TLDR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a spaceplane stuck in orbit with only a wisp of fuel remaining (29m/s d-v).
