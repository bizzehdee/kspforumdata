They and the ISRU are not heating up that I know of in a way that warms other things(Although that would be a nice effect assuming it\u0026#39;s realistic. I don\u0026#39;t know how much heat that should be.) They are heating up internally with a different vallue and need to gain heat to be 100% efficiency. It\u0026#39;s like getting an engine warm to be at max performance. The numbers for it are displayed in their info when you right click as you use them. You need to to gain max heat to be 100% efficiency. If there is some effect of radiators on drills and ISRUs I would love to know what it is. It would be interesting.

I could have sworn that my radiators were cooling down my whole craft.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I ran a little test. I flew my spaceplane to orbit and turned on the temperature overlay to monitor my heat. As expected, lots of heat, shown in yellow on the overlay, accumulated on the cockpit, air intakes and wings, i.e. the leading edge of the craft. Sadly I was stupid and didn\u0026#39;t get a pic of this, but you can take my word for it, I wouldn\u0026#39;t lie to you guys. ;) \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnce in space, the yellow started to dissipate from all around the plane while the radiators (the smallest static kind) started to get yellow themselves. [URL=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/L0rw0Ap.png\u0022]Here I am just beginning my circularization burn[/URL]. As you can see, the yellow is practically all gone from the plane and has gotten to the radiators.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDuring the circulariztion burn, as expected, the nukes started to get hot and thus yellower. [URL=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1ELNTYg.png\u0022]What to you know, the radiators start getting hotter too. Now they\u0026#39;re even showing temp gauges.[/URL] This leads me to believe they were absorbing the heat from the nukes as it was being generated.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think this test suggests that radiators can somehow pull heat from all over your craft and are not limited to 2 parts away, given the radiators were attached to a payload inside the cargo bay. Maybe this can be explained by parts transferring heat form one to another in a chain until it finds its way to the radiators.

The small drill runs at 500K(100% efficiency) constantly while it is running now. Without the radiator it would overheat. But this is as much as I\u0026#39;ve gotten tested so far.

If you look into the radiator panels\u0026#39; config files, you\u0026#39;ll see that they actually have a maxHops=2 entry that the folding radiators don\u0026#39;t have (i.e. those are not limited by distance from the part).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAn easy way to test this:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Get the mod that Snark linked, so you can turn radiator panels on and off\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Also get HyperEdit\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Build a ship with command pod -\u0026gt; 10 fuel tanks -\u0026gt; LV-N\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Attach one radiator panel to the command pod, and one to the tank immediately next to the LV-N\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Attach one folding radiator to the command pod\u003Cbr\u003E\n- HyperEdit this into orbit\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Use the Alt\u002BF12 menu to activate display of thermal info in rightclick menus\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow, turn off the radiator panel next to the LV-N, and start a nice long burn. Only the radiator panel on the command pod is active now. Observe what it does in its rightclick menu. Also rightclick the various tanks along the length of the vessel, and the LV-N itself, to see its heat status and the conductive flux values. What you should see is that the rear of the vessel heats up, and that there is a temperature gradient developing along the stack of tanks. The radiator panel at the command pod will be largely idle. If you then activate the folding radiator on the command pod, you will see that despite being in the same location as the panel, it immediately starts gobbling up large amounts of heat.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow revert to launch, and HyperEdit it back up again in order to achieve the same starting condition. (Verify that this is true!) Now turn off the radiator on the command pod, leaving the one next to the LV-N active. Start the burn, and observe how the heat state of the vessel develops differently from before.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you see a difference between test 1 and 2, as I described, then there is indeed a limited range to the panels. If you see a behavior that does not match my description, then there is probably a bug and you should report it! ;)\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tranenturm","CreatedById":143304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T12:54:28Z","Content":"\nThanks all.
