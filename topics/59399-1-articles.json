So I download 1_5_6 and put it in gamedata. And ever since I get a pop-up when I start the game saying that im using an old version. And I cant for the life of me figure it out. Ive gone though everyone of my mods to see if there are any loose .cgf\u0027s anywhere and nothing. I had tried ECLSS earlier and it seemed that was not functioning. This and many other mods use MM so this has to work. Any advise?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T06:12:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis thread made me smile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot longer than five minutes ago, I started looking around the forums for the same exact answer!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t even know what happens if I don\u0027t update it.
