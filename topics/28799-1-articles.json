In the beginning i did like to build rockets, but after a few days i wanted to reach something. So i did make my first topic on this forum: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/29998-2-questions\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/29998-2-questions\u003C/a\u003E. It was short but, it was the begin of something. I did try to fly to the mun but i did still fail every time i did try it. So i did start to do the tutorials, that did help me a lot, but then i did came to the last tutorial flying to the mun, but i did really understand what to do, so i did make a new topic: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/31253-Tutorial-Help/page1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/31253-Tutorial-Help/page1\u003C/a\u003E. This one did help me a lot to. So today i did finally succeed to bring my kerbal in space and now it is flying around the world, sad enough for him he wont come back i think, because it doesn\u0027t have engines to return to his family \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E. In the future i hope that i can buy the full game, and do even more stuff. right now i will stay at this forum, and look and learn, and i hope to update this thread example when i reach the mun.

Once you\u0027re there a mun landing is a cakewalk. Just burn prograde at your periapsis until your orbit intersects with mun orbit, then burn retrograde when you get caught in the mun\u0027s sphere of influence. You\u0027re now orbititing the mun. From there a landing should be easy. Try to make sure you have enough fuel to get home (I\u0027d recommend using the same method, get in mun orbit and burn until your orbit reaches kerbin.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest of luck.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T08:37:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rowns","CreatedById":66524,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T12:37:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo today i did succeed to orbite(is it the right word?) the mun, with my own rocket i was lucky because i was almost out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i40.tinypic.com/20gb2ux.png\u0022 alt=\u002220gb2ux.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i41.tinypic.com/1fzk9k.png\u0022 alt=\u00221fzk9k.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xiphos","CreatedById":60680,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T13:33:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks like you\u0027ve got a nice space program going there!
