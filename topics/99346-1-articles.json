I haven\u0027t really dabbled in aircraft much beyond \u0027see what weirdness I can crash into the control tower,\u0027 so I figured that this would be a good time to make a new SSTO. The name is rather hopeful; as of this writing it hasn\u0027t seen Laythe. On Kerbin, however, it is able to reach a 100x100 orbit with fuel to spare, so I\u0027m hoping that will be more than enough for a round trip down to Laythe and back. Hopefully two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/stargate525/screenshot4_zps65f263ab.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot4_zps65f263ab.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere she is in space. Note the enclosed cargo bay filled with scientific equipment (This could, I\u0027m certain, be swapped out for a satellite or small station payload), as well as the parachutes. I know Laythe\u0027s atmosphere is thinner than Kerbin\u0027s so I\u0027m worried about potentially coming in too steeply in the landing glide. Those are emergency parachutes to avoid a catastrophic landing lithobraking scenario.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/stargate525/screenshot5_zpsede17f27.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot5_zpsede17f27.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd coming in over the KSC. I began my insertion too early, and was coming in over the desert on the western continent. The Interceptor had enough fuel to fly to KSC and then some. Handling in atmosphere is strange. It\u0027s a very floaty aircraft, and despite having the proper CoL and CoM had a tendency to want to nose up on takeoff. When coming in for the landing I was able to stall the craft easily; I suspect that I might have too many control surfaces, but I\u0027m not sure. Anyone with insight, please enlighten me!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft file, for those interested: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/o5fk0cn3de4b4oi/Laythe%20Interceptor%201.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u003C/a\u003E (note, I changed the ladder placement in the final version)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
