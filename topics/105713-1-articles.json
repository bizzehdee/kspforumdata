Meaning you may have an issue with Kerbin\u0027s scaled space model? I\u0027m not really sure if that\u0027s possible or not. But ehre\u0027s some suggestions:\n\n1.) Backup your saves and screenshots, remove KSP completely, and then do a fresh reinstall.\n\n2.) If that doesn\u0027t work, open a thread in the support forum (or ask to have this thread moved there)."},{"CreatedByName":"Denco","CreatedById":111224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T14:13:23Z","Content":"I have the same problem as the OP ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) which was not happening in previous versions."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T05:18:51Z","Content":"I have seen this occasionally, and my impression is that it happens when you approach Kerbin at high warp.
