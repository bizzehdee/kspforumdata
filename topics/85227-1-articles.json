For instance, if you\u0027re on the launch pad at high noon (sun straight overhead), the rocket is nearly black. There\u0027s very little ambient light in this context (while arguably too much while in deep space). On the surface, there should be a lot of reflected light. Even more so in an atmosphere that scatters light, such as Kerbin\u0027s Earth-like bright blue sky. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also get irritated at how often, when I land on some moon/planet, and I go to take a screenshot after planting a flag, both my Kerbal and the flag appear completely unlit, because the sun is straight up. Again, we\u0027re on the surface at high noon, so there should be a lot of reflected light from the surface around me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I suggest as a visual enhancement, is a dynamic ambient-light system that adjusts the brightness and color of the ambient light based on what surface you\u0027re over (taking into account day/night side of course), and have it fall off with altitude. Though of course, even in low orbit, you can, and should, get a lot of reflected illumination from a planet as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-22T20:35:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a semi-related aside:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENvidia sinks moon landing hoax using virtual light\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.cnet.com/news/nvidias-new-gpu-sinks-moon-landing-hoax-using-virtual-light/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.cnet.com/news/nvidias-new-gpu-sinks-moon-landing-hoax-using-virtual-light/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mentions how well illuminated you can be on the lunar surface, even while in shadow (such as Buzz Aldrin descending the ladder).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-22T20:43:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs I understand it there are some Unity limitations for lighting, it\u0027s part of the reason we don\u0027t have proper occlusion effects from eclipses.

There\u0027s a mod out there that lets you set the ambient light with a slider (saw Scott Manley use it for some night-side video). Usually ambient lighting is fairly static, but as long as it can be changed periodically within the same scene, then what would be needed is just a calculation based on altitude and position over the planet\u0027s surface, which is data they definitely have.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-22T20:51:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this will change with Unity 5.
