Until I figured out how to edit the config file (which was long after I bought KSP), by frame-rate would drop to at most 10 fps. This obviously makes the game so much less fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seriously think a new method of rendering the oceans of KSP is long overdue, and I bet plenty of people can agree.
