Every time I put anything in symetry in my craft if looses fuel and other settings and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E goes to one side. Refulling the fuel does not put the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E back. It\u0027s permenantly to one side of the craft although everything is symetrical and in symetry. The wings do this badly and I loose fuel in most of the wing parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m on linux on 1.9 with both expansions. Not sure what is the cause. The craft was made in previous versions though and copied over to 1.9. I may have redone the craft from scratch as far back as 1.7 or so. Not sure though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis will be a nightmare if this isn\u0027t simple as the plane it\u0027s bugged out on are 630 parts and 780 parts respectively. The smaller is a half tonnage version cargo \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003Essto\u003C/abbr\u003E...
