If that means you have now closed the final communication channel, so be it. The last thing the satellite was told was that it should no longer communicate. However, it is very easy for you to render a satellite inoperable by doing something to some other satellite, or just passing through a black spot for those few satellites it is set to communicate with. In which case, for me at least, I would like to still be able to tell this now connectionless satellite where to point to to try to get that connection back, and I would rationalise it as saying it is a tiny boot strap program on the satellite but it is easier for the mod to simulate it via having me tell it where to connect to. Now I realise there are some who feel even that is too \u0027cheaty\u0027.

I can see the appeal of options 1 for most players, it is the most stringent way of dealing with the situation. Options 4, 5 and 7 all allows dishes to be activated, which I think is a bit too much, especially when you consider the last thing you told that satellite was to stop listening for commands. I think 6 is nice ideas from a players point of view, but implementation wise would be too much. So yes, option 2 or 3 is where my money is at, I think that the delay imposed by option 3 would be a PITA to have to deal with, but it would be a fair punishment for not planning things out properly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"calkurne","CreatedById":42098,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T08:19:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI almost got to orbit in RSS, then the communications line was severed. despite the engine having plenty of fuel and being put to full thrust before the end of the connection, it was deactivated by Remote-tech.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhy is this a \u0022feature\u0022?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"krenshala","CreatedById":76062,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T08:20:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile for the most part I agree with you, thecoshman, having omni\u0027s sweep for signals would be perfectly reasonable but dishes would need to be properly oriented to receive the target signal. \u003Cem\u003EUsually\u003C/em\u003E this would be by uploading a targetting program so the dish points in the correct direction, however, I can also envision the sat being preprogrammed with at least one fall-back target in case its primary comms link goes down and the satellite in question isn\u0027t the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know how much extra work it would take to change the targetting behavior to allow a secondary target to be specified.
