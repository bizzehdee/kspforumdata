After starting a new Ship from Launchpad, the Game crashed as i reached the Muns influence. I started the game new and in the Gamemenu, i wanted to load a Savegame, but nothing happened. Till this time, no savegame can be loaded or will displayed in the game. I started a new career for testing and saved it, restarted the game and this savegame is away too.

You can figure out exactly which save file is broken (if you previously had multiple) by opening the console with Alt\u002BF2 before attempting to Resume Game; the error should reference a specific save file. Once you have located the problematic save, you will need to open the save folder and delete the \u003Cem\u003Epersistent.sfs\u003C/em\u003E file. That done, if you have a recent quicksave, you can then rename it to persistent.sfs to recover your save file to that point in time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"XSparrow","CreatedById":116368,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-17T01:07:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow thx, it worked, repaired it with an older file from automatic savesystem.
