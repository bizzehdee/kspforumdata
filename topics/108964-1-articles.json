This makes a little sense to me, because it makes achievements more authentic, and since so much effort was put in, the payout is more satisfying. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nFrankly i\u0027m just here for the ability to create my own spaceships and fly them around, something which so few other videogames provide, at least in a scope equal to KSP\u0027s. Orbital mechanics and all that was just a little tidbit of knowledge that i\u0027m glad i know now. For this reason i\u0027m slightly against the drive for realism, as more limitations=less capability=less capacity for creativity. But Whatever.

For example - you need to expel mass for a craft to move. No infinite electrical engines ala Space Engineers. Solar power obeys the inverse-square law. Aero has at least a passing resemblance to reality (nosecones help, not hinder, and long craft are better than wide craft, for example). That sort of business.

Something more than the \u0022push button, number goes up\u0022 thing it\u0027s got now. Also, more stuff to do on planet surfaces would be nice, and more purpose to satellites. I don\u0027t care about real-sized planets. It would make a great option, along with random/procedural starting solar systems. The miniature system is fine by me, as long as the physics is scaled to keep the same challenges that are faced by actual spaceflight. Heating should be an issue on re-entry, SSTOs should be a challenge, aerodynamics should treat planes like planes, etc. I\u0027ve really grown tired of the \u0022craptastic\u0022 aesthetic that\u0027s been attached to the game. Parts found by the side of the road or junkyard was cute at the beginning, but it\u0027s become kind of annoying to me, along with the \u0022treat KSP as a lolsplosion generator!\u0022 thing. I\u0027m not a big fan of fluffy sci-fi stuff like warp drives. I\u0027d like to see future technology kept more to the hard sci-fi aspects. Colony building could be an interesting way to get younger people to start thinking about what it would actually take to make us a multiple-planet species. I would love to see a career mode that takes you from 1930\u0027s level sounding rockets and propeller planes and drags you through early uncrewed launches, the beginnings of the jet age, pushing the envelope further, faster, and higher with every flight, until you\u0027re finally ready to put a Kerbal into space and beyond. (Ok, yes. I want a game of *The Right Stuff, Kerbal Edition*.)\n\nAs for the hard/challenging/realistic vs. creativity/fun, I think that there is plenty of room for creativity in a realistic system. It took a lot of creativity to make Apollo happen. There were a lot of challenges to be conquered, and a lot of people came up with some very creative ways to make it happen. Just because Armstrong didn\u0027t ride a SSTO plane to the moon doesn\u0027t mean the LM wasn\u0027t creative. Lunar Orbit Rendezvous was a creative solution to the problem of a building and launching a massive lander. Hell, the even made a folding car!\n\nRealism just means that you have to be creative in a different way. Some people find their fun in finding a creative solution to a challenging problem. \u0022I can\u0027t build a spaceplane the way I want\u0022 doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027re prevented from being creative. It just means that you need to find a different way, just like the fact that I can\u0027t build a spacecraft that flies with no engines doesn\u0027t mean I can\u0027t build something else. It just means that propulsionless rockets aren\u0027t an option.\n\nThat\u0027s my thoughts on what I like and don\u0027t like. They don\u0027t match yours, but that\u0027s doesn\u0027t mean that neither of us can have fun, or that either of us is wrong. We just have different ideas. (It most likely means that neither of us is going to get the perfect game we want, though.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T23:16:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 11:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by razark**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tourist","CreatedById":143403,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T23:12:06Z","Content":"Honestly, for me, this game felt almost feature complete when they added docking, even though career mode had not been implemented yet, everything else has been gravy. Squad has done a good job. \n\nHaving said that, I think career could use a bit more work. An end state would be good. For instance, land (and return science from) at least Mun, Moho, Duna, and Eve and/or Tylo (maybe not Eve). Also, a purpose for science after the tech tree has been opened up... I say this because in my last shot at Career (before 1.0) I\u0027d opened up the entire tech tree, having only gotten as far as Minmus.... and I wasn\u0027t even really grinding science (not sure if I could manage that since release, not that far yet.)\n\nOne way they could do it would be to have some uber expensive tech at the very end of the tree, which requires you to get a lot of science... this tech being essentially just a win state. A \u0022warp drive\u0022 or some such (I was thinking along the lines of Scott Manly\u0027s interstellar series.)\n\nAlso more complex contracts would be good to. Perhaps, a Mun shot, which requires you to place satellites around Mun and Kerbin first (for the TV signals of course) so that completion of the contract has multiple stages to it. Ie placing and arranging the satellites, launching the mission. etc. This would not be too hard, the contract types already exist, they just need to merge them. \n\nI know much of these things can be done by mods and community challenges, but would be good to see it implemented in stock."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T23:18:54Z","Content":"My one true (and unchanging desire) for KSP was, is and always shall be for SQUAD to fully open up the game\u0027s API and provide more parameters/options/documentation for the stock PartModules, so that add-on authors can fully extend the core game to cater for any and all playstyles ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T23:21:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E My one true (and unchanging desire) for KSP was, is and always shall be for SQUAD to fully open up the game\u0027s API and provide more parameters/options/documentation for the stock PartModules, so that add-on authors can fully extend the core game to cater for any and all playstyles ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nThis.
