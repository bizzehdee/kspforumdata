Something more than the \u0022push button, number goes up\u0022 thing it\u0027s got now. Also, more stuff to do on planet surfaces would be nice, and more purpose to satellites. I don\u0027t care about real-sized planets. It would make a great option, along with random/procedural starting solar systems. The miniature system is fine by me, as long as the physics is scaled to keep the same challenges that are faced by actual spaceflight. Heating should be an issue on re-entry, SSTOs should be a challenge, aerodynamics should treat planes like planes, etc. I\u0027ve really grown tired of the \u0022craptastic\u0022 aesthetic that\u0027s been attached to the game. Parts found by the side of the road or junkyard was cute at the beginning, but it\u0027s become kind of annoying to me, along with the \u0022treat KSP as a lolsplosion generator!\u0022 thing. I\u0027m not a big fan of fluffy sci-fi stuff like warp drives. I\u0027d like to see future technology kept more to the hard sci-fi aspects. Colony building could be an interesting way to get younger people to start thinking about what it would actually take to make us a multiple-planet species. I would love to see a career mode that takes you from 1930\u0027s level sounding rockets and propeller planes and drags you through early uncrewed launches, the beginnings of the jet age, pushing the envelope further, faster, and higher with every flight, until you\u0027re finally ready to put a Kerbal into space and beyond.

It took a lot of creativity to make Apollo happen. There were a lot of challenges to be conquered, and a lot of people came up with some very creative ways to make it happen. Just because Armstrong didn\u0027t ride a SSTO plane to the moon doesn\u0027t mean the LM wasn\u0027t creative. Lunar Orbit Rendezvous was a creative solution to the problem of a building and launching a massive lander.

It just means that you need to find a different way, just like the fact that I can\u0027t build a spacecraft that flies with no engines doesn\u0027t mean I can\u0027t build something else.
