I was just wanting to suggest/request a mod that automatically forces a quicksave before any major event in the game (ie. Decoupling a node, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E change, entering a sub-orbital trajectory, etc.). I, due to my own lack of saving the game,\u00A0lost about 10 hrs of gameplay last night. In my frustration I thought to request this mod. Anyone else think this would be useful or know where this feature already exists?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-10T01:57:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve seen a few backup mods - might not go quite as far as you want - but the one that came to mind first was:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/94997-12-save-automatic-backup-system-141-2315/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought I read somewhere in the thread that it made a backup on every scene switch (you might want to verify that) so while you would lose a bit it wouldn\u0027t be a whole day (at least if you switch vessels as often as I do).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
