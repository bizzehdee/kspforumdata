I performed a new, clean install on a dedicated, formatted hard drive of 1.3.1. It would always hang at certain files (in my case \u0022smokepuff1\u0022 and \u0022adminbuilding-lvl1\u0022). It would sometimes throw an error and create a \u0022game crash\u0022 folder in my root KSP directory. At other times it would work through these hang points and finish loading. I tried defragging and starting on a clean boot...finally got the game to load every time...but still had the long delays at the 2 files mentioned above. Herein lies the warning...there were several times when I would come back to the game...and all my settings were lost (Graphics, Sound, etc.)...and none of my saved ships, which I added to my \u0022Saves\u0022 folder after install,\u00A0had disappeared. I redid the settings, re-added my saved ships and sub-assemblies and all went well again for a few days. It would then happen again. Now, in a completely boneheaded move, the last time this \u0022loss\u0022 occurred, I didn\u0027t \u0022copy\u0022 my ships and sub-assemblies over...I moved them (Yeah, go figure). And you can guess what happened...it lost all my settings again and all my saved ships from my years of KSP\u0027ing...and I had no backup to replace them with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point (well...after the weeping and gnashing of teeth). I deleted the game, re-formatted the drive (just because) and re-downloaded the 1.3.1 install exe. I installed from the new download and I have NO hangs while loading the game (the progress bar moves smoothly and continuously until complete) and after 6 days I have not had any issues with the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe moral of the story (as if you can\u0027t guess the first one? LOL)...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNEVER forget to keep a backup of your saved ships and sub-assemblies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore importantly, if you are having long load time hangs during loading of 1.3.1\u00A0(I\u0027m talking 2-3 minutes per offending file)...give it up. Start over with a new download and a fresh install...before the \u0022settings reset and ship loss\u0022 occurs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVic\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corona688","CreatedById":2511,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-06T00:51:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat mods do you use?\u00A0 I suspect the repeated crashes and hangs are related to those.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal101","CreatedById":157058,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-06T01:13:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you manually install files into Gamedata, there is a wild chance that you move the mod directory inside other mod directory, as opposed to moving inside Gamedata itself.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere is also chance to have multiple ModuleManager.dlls, hidden inside individual mod directories.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese two trivial things can contribute to very strange errors, long loading times and weird behavior.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"strider3","CreatedById":199830,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-06T01:53:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223236479\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022168256\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221512521485\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u00222511\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Corona688\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n45 minutes ago, Corona688 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat mods do you use?\u00A0 I suspect the repeated crashes and hangs are related to those.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sorry, I did not relate all info.
