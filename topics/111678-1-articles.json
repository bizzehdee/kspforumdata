If you don\u0027t want Tweakscale you can use the devpost version of the ubizur welding mod. Ubizur is not yet fully released for 1.02 but i tried the devpost and its mostly working. It allows you to weld parts together. I built stations that normally contain more than 2000 parts but in reality they are only 50 parts since i welded most of them together to create single part. Still i would recommend you to use this mod only for big projects since it is not fully functional yet.
