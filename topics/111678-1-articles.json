Looking at OP\u0027s rover, it would be prohibitively big/heavy to try to put a fairing around that thing. Just give it a big rocket and brute-force your way to space. Just be sure to keep the speed down low until you\u0027re up above at least 15 km, and start your gravity turn late. Make sure to put some tail fins or something on the back to keep the draggy payload from flipping you.\n\nOne way to mitigate the mass of rocket needed: use the rover\u0027s own fuel storage to help get to orbit (e.g. during launch, you can transfer fuel from the rover to the ascent stages), so that you end up with an empty rover in LKO. Then you can refuel it with tankers that have a more sane aerodynamic profile, before heading out to the Mun."},{"CreatedByName":"ArchGaden","CreatedById":116362,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T16:50:58Z","Content":"\u002B1 for no fairing launch \n\nMake sure the center of mass for the rover roughly sits above the center of thrust for the launch vehicle.
