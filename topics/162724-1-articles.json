Those are the only mods. I am running 1.3.0, but the station was made in 1.2. The issue I describe below began happening in the KSP version in which the station was started, so I know that\u0027s not an issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, let me explain my issue and what I have done to try and fix it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my career mode game I have put up an orbital station around Kerbin. I attached the first few modules, and everything was ok. However, once it got large enough, it would begin to wobble uncontrollable, and within 30 seconds it had torn itself apart (don\u0027t worry, I quicksaved\u00A0as soon as I saw it vibrating).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are the solutions I have tried:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. I exited KSP and got back in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. I perused the forums and reddit to try and find a solution, but the only solution I found was to go into the save file and make every part have\u00A0auto strut. I did this, and when I went back into the game, my framerate had slowed to a crawl.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far nothing has worked, and for now, every time I dock another ship, I keep manually autostrutting until the wiggling stops. That is my current method for stopping the wiggles, but it is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0annoying to do, and my framerate is a little laggy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a picture of the space station:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther ipsEmbeddedOther_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=http://imgur.com/a/KgfU2\u0022 style=\u0022height:416px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can share a save file, if that\u0027s necessary.

Turn them off. ALL of them, except maybe one or two nearest whatever the control part is.

They assume they are perfectly in line. Also, while in a perfectly rigid system it doesn\u0027t matter where reaction wheels are, in a bendy one like your station they can introduce local torque that turns the area of the station they are on more than the entire station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if you get a bit of a bend in your station (which happens as it\u0027s turning to align with whatever \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E tells it to align with. It can happen also while just holding a line) then the wheels will turn slightly incorrectly. And in disparate parts of the station other wheels will be turning as well, slightly incorrectly. This causes the control point to swing in an odd way, which causes the wheels to turn in a different - also incorrect and usually slightly larger - way. This can easily become a feedback loop that destroys your station, as you\u0027ve seen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-30T19:35:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2017 07:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by 5thHorseman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CoreI","CreatedById":173589,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-30T20:53:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223107538\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022162724\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221498851222\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002273725\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, 5thHorseman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is reaction wheels.
