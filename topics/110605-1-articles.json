Top 10 easily, if you restrict it to current games. If, like me, you remember a time when processors were 1\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u01532MHz, RAM was in low kB, disk was in kB, colour displays were a premium upgrade, and some upgrades involved a soldering iron, then it\u0027s much harder to quantify.\n\nEdit: It\u0027s not a perfect or best metric, but factually it\u0027s currently ranked #7 of all games on Steam, sorted by user reviews. 98% positive reviews. That\u0027s a HUGE achievement for a relatively tiny developer on their first big project.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T09:02:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 09:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Murph**"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T09:10:35Z","Content":"It\u0027s the game I\u0027ve wanted ever since I heard of Orbiter.\n\nOtherwise, rocket science isn\u0027t my favourite, but it\u0027s definitely top 10 of all time.

The only other game I\u0027ve played continuously for such a long time is Elite Dangerous. In terms of playtime it\u0027s likely to become one of my most played games ever, and therefore one of my favourites.\n\nThen again given it\u0027s nature, it has no story or proper characters, which makes it harder to love than more emotionally involving games like Mass Effect, Xenogears, etc, so it s very difficult to classify it compared to those narrative games. Attachment comes in a different way for a game like Ksp, I think it comes with the time spent on it, which makes your involvment grow as you play.\n\nAll that to say, I guess it will eventually be in my top few games, but I must wait a bit before I can really say ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) It\u0027s definitely one of the more original games, and for it\u0027s type it\u0027s very well made and complete."},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T09:42:23Z","Content":"just given the number of hours it would compare in gameplay time for me between counter-strike, battlefield series, Larry the Lounge Lizard and Elder Scrolls Series."},{"CreatedByName":"pvtnum11","CreatedById":58904,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T10:20:04Z","Content":"Definite top-ten.

I have played this game for years, the game play is outstanding (could do with some more EVA features and maybe immersive IVAs) However the one thing that REALLY holds this game back from being #1 is the graphics.

I am fully aware that the devs can\u0027t do anything to change the RAM issue but its just a shame were stuck with blobby planets, poor lighting and no clouds. Just saying."}]}
