My thinking was specifically centred around how (in 0.22) I can\u0027t dock a lander with a station/mothership and transfer the results over for physical return. I also dislike the data transmission loss. I don\u0027t feel it\u0027s realistic. I don\u0027t doubt some/all of these have been suggested before but maybe not quite in this way!?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Split collectible info into physical and data components, so that you can only transmit the data and have to return the physical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Treat both types as a resource, like electric charge, fuel etc, that is shown in the top right. Craft would need sufficient free physical and data storage to hold collected science (options are here for new parts). Transfer between docked craft could be handled like fuel transfers. Physical resource could even have weight to simulate returning rocks. I really like the idea of having to manage data and sample storage and plan ahead, and having storage and computing components to add to your craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Data transmission should be lossless but there should be maximum ranges for each type of transmitter, and considerations like more power for larger dishes (which i know is already in) and line of sight (you can\u0027t transmit through a blocking planet!!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Allow transmission of data between craft. I envisage a lander with a low power transmitter sending data up to a craft in orbit that has the power to then return it to Kerbin. This does present a problem of having two distant ships active at once though. Perhaps a system that pairs transmitters together and can temporarily have both craft active during transmission only. I dunno if this is easy/possible but it feels a more intuitive way of performing data management.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere you have it!

So we should be looking at a balance of being able to get the appropriate analysis tools (assuming they are implemented!) to destination compared with bringing physical samples back to kerbin. Then instead of having a %loss due to transmission we have a % effectiveness of certain tools to extract data from physical sources. So perhaps you could get 90\u002B% data from a lifeless planet like minmus, purely based on local analysis, but with a more complex planet with atmosphere, like laythe, you would have to bring back samples to allow proper intesive searches for life and other substances outide the range of your tools...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe that\u0027s overcomplicating things....?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T23:16:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Atoning Unifex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Atoning Unifex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMaybe that\u0027s overcomplicating things....?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly, as much as I would love this kind of science system, I have to think this. Something like this would provide benefit for manned missions, as some information could be gained directly through observation, and just about all types of information would require less equipment if the equipment only has to take the measurements and doesn\u0027t have to deal with acquiring the sample and moving the sample from instrument to instrument. One way trips would need heavier equipment because they\u0027d need to do the analysis in place, etc. It would also allow you to separate out consumables from the actual equipment, so if you plan running a materials science experiment once, you wouldn\u0027t need as much consumables as you would if you were going to run it 10 times, but you also wouldn\u0027t need to duplicate all the equipment 10 times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, however, I realize that if they were to design the game exactly how I would design it, I\u0027d probably be the only person playing it. Playable game mechanics tend to trump realism, and I think they should. The current retransmit-until-no-more-science game mechanic is broken, not fun, etc., and it\u0027s getting fixed. Without knowing exactly how they fixed it, all this discussion about how to improve the science system is purely theoretical, as we don\u0027t know how much of it will apply to the 0.23 science system, where that game mechanic is getting fixed.
