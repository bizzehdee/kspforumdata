If you must wait for a discount, there\u0027s likely to be one in a Steam Summer Sale which last year started on June 19th. Video games also have a general trend of going on sale a few months after release, after the early adopters have paid full price and the developer is trying to entice more buyers to keep their market momentum up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Conclusion - buy it now if you can.

If price is your major concern, the only way you\u0027ll make out solid for sure is to wait until a good sale comes along. If play is your major concern, I\u0027d recommend waiting for 1.0... a lot will be changing, and it will take those of us who\u0027ve played a while already some time to adjust to the new mechanics... if you wait until 1.0 is released, you won\u0027t have to unlearn any habits from previous versions (and you have the advantage that there won\u0027t be many sweeping changes afterward... you\u0027re basically getting a polished product).
