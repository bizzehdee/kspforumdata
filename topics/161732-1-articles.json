This makes it significantly harder to build with... for me. However I can\u0027t say that others don\u0027t find this a saving grace, so my request is that the pylon have various length sizes so those of us who like it longer can keep it as is and those of us, like myself who like it shorter can adjust the length.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nOr Squad could just had it be like this B9 engine and not have any structural pylon at all and let players use the ingame pylons instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022DdEQgAXb.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DdEQgAXb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nNow some may say that the pylons being like this is being realistic to the real life jet engine, the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_%26_Whitney_JT9D\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJT9D\u003C/a\u003E which the engine is likely based on. However I say that the choice to include it is down to those who use it to build and if they desire it, they can recreate it easily using the parts provided. If the current ingame pylons do not suffice then maybe a newer larger pylon would work better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nJust a thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-07T18:47:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2017 06:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by ZooNamedGames\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qzgy","CreatedById":160994,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-08T11:10:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, a slider in this case could be nice.
