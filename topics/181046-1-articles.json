It\u0027s a pretty simple thing; just a lander with a big fuel tank, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E stuff, various ore containers, etc. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1611290250\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s a pic if your interested\u003C/a\u003E.

It\u0027s the largest payload I\u0027ve ever gotten off Kerbin before, so I\u0027m pretty proud of it \u003Cspan\u003E:3 It has four detachable landers that can individually\u00A0deorbit and do science, and it\u0027s\u00A0composed out of lots of different kinds of tank to attach the NERV rocket to the Kerbodyne tanks without making it look ugly. While the redundancy added by the landers is helpful at times (functioning as emergency boosters if I need to do quick maneuvers\u00A0that the NERV can\u0027t pull off in time), it also makes the probe rather\u00A0complicated. It has lots of individual tanks, some of which accept liquid fuel and oxidizer, and some of which only take liquid fuel (as I limited them for use with the NERV).\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAfter getting the heavy Jool probe in orbit around Dres and rendezvousing with the lander,\u003Ca href=\u0022https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1611215371\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E I docked them successfully\u003C/a\u003E. Afterwards, I reopened the Mining landers Solar Panels and thermal gear (turned off during the rendezvous to avoid accidental damage) and turned on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E, to finish processing the leftover ore\u00A0(which at the time was nearly full, over 1000 units of it). The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E reached it\u0027s optimal\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Etemperature and stayed there, and the ore started to get depleted. The overall stats in the corner said that ore was getting used up, and that Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer was being added to the ship...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut none of the tanks showed any signs of gaining any fuel! I checked all of them, and they all seemed to stay at the same levels. I used time warp up to ten times (I couldn\u0027t\u00A0do any more due to my orbit being very close to the surface), and while the overall counter said more fuel was being added, none of the tanks showed it. So I left the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E on, went to the tracking station, and time warped at full blast for a couple of seconds to let the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E do it\u0027s thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I went back after that, the ore tanks were completely empty, and none of the fuel tanks had gained any fuel at all\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this some sort of bug?
