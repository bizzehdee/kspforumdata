I don\u0027t use the MechJeb ascent module, though, just SmartASS. On the pad, set SmartASS to the proper heading (remembering that a zero deg. inclination is a 90 deg launch, so launching at the ascending node of a 160 deg orbit would be HDG of 290), pitch 90, and then just adjust the pitch for your gravity turn as you go up. Once your navball switches to orbital mode, you\u0027ll notice your prograde marker moves off of your intended heading due to Kerbin\u0027s spin (for anything other than a straight east or west launch), so you\u0027ll need to adjust your heading slightly to put it back where it should be.
