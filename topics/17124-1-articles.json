It\u0027s done using the same logic as RCS thrusters. That\u0027s why all the control surfaces in KSP behave a bit differently than standard airplane style.

That actually has a beneficial effect of pushing the wing up when you pitch up, and pushing the wing down when you pitch down. It\u0027s more responsive to your commands. Unfortunately, that means breaking the rule of putting the wing slightly aft of the CG.
