You can also have a look at the differences between having angled fins vs. angled exhaust. But any details like the amount of rotation to aim for or a good angle for the fins or rocket motors are not well represented by KSP.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd that ignores other practical considerations: e.g. you\u0027ll never get the ropes of a parachute tangled in KSP, because that just isn\u0027t simulated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order to \u0022learn KSP\u0022 I\u0027d suggest to just forget about the model rockets for a while and just play the game.
