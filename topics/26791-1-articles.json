Or at least they did last time I took notice of it. Ill try to remember next time I return to Kerbin to see if theres parachute noise or not. Are you using modded legs or parachutes? They may not have a deploy noise, or they may rely on a stock noise that was renamed, thus making them play silence.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Muttonstache","CreatedById":55896,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T11:48:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe landing legs don\u0027t have sound for me, either, and i\u0027m playing vanilla.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T12:43:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am sooooooo glad that the deployment sound of the medium landing legs got taken out. It was cool for the first few times, but when editing videos, hearing that sound again and again, it was driving me nutts! Not saying that legs shouldn\u0027t make a sound, but that was just a pretty harsh sound. I also use those legs for other things than their intended purpose so I got a bit of an overdose of that sound.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still get a sound when parachutes deploy and that\u0027s a softer sound so it doesn\u0027t offend when heard countless times.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Francesco","CreatedById":58274,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T12:51:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI still hear both. the medium sized (0.05 tons) landing legs produce a sound when deployed, while the big ones (0.1 tons) don\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand the parachutes produce 2 sounds, first when deployed, and then a more \u0022violent\u0022 one when they fully open.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat I actually miss from 0.17 is the sepratrons sound - now it\u0027s effing annoying \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
