And a reinforcement of 4 Imperial II Class Star Destroyers per each Venator.\n\nAlso 1/2 of all combat ships based on the Death Star I and II are deployed on patrol so no lucky shot\n\nAnd only Death Star I would be gone \n\nLet alone the fact atleast 1,000 of the best ships are on your tail.\n\nI look forward to your counter statement.
