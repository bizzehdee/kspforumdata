Those might come later though. I do want to get a copy of this out fairly soon. I might even go ahead and get a copy out in the next couple of days and worry about some of my other plans until after the first release too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far the #1 priority to add is the second set of heavy lift engines (the 3.75m single, and 7.5m quad cluster). But something else I\u0027m tempted to do, is to redesign the M and R series engine bells to be a little prettier. It would be easier to do the R-series in both mods at the same time, before the new one\u0027s release, but it\u0027s not a huge deal. I can circle back on that later without too many worries.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Michaelo90","CreatedById":98783,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T15:26:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you make cargo bays for 3.75m, 5m and 7.5m?
