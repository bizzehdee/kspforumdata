I treat it like a flight computer. Especially the instrumentation. Mechjeb calculates what I tell it to, I fly. I find no fun in pushing-pulling maneuver nodes. Yes I do some of it manually when it makes sense. But those routine things that I know how to do but it\u0027s faster, easier, and more precise to have mechjeb do it.

MJ does usually execute nodes really well though if your tolerances are set well, but I find I can do them better if I have a read-out that shows me real-time the parameter I\u0027m trying to change.
