It has no problem with 100 kilometer orbits around Kerbin and reentry without re-fueling (with a competent pilot). The Chipmunk could \u0027probably\u0027 go as high as 300 kilometers and return without refueling but I have not tried it.\n\nTest it and let me know. It\u0027s downloadable through my KerbalX sig.\n\nThank\u0027s for watching my video!"},{"CreatedByName":"CaelumEtAstra","CreatedById":109360,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T19:20:52Z","Content":"What a lovely little spaceplane!
