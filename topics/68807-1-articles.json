The solution is simple: Make sure that you are moving as little as possible when you \u0022Press \u0027F\u0027 to Grab\u0022. If possible, try to align the ladder in such a way that it is extremely easy to float the Kerbal to and latch on. If the ladder is (relative to your Kerbal) on the underside of the craft, rotate it so the ladder is parallel to the Kerbal when using the jetpack.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, it\u0027s a simple fix.
