Another poster already covered that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Timewarp. If you started timewarp, even a modest 5x, throttle keys don\u0027t work during timewarp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Input locks. KSP sporadically decides that a key is stuck. It\u0027s a common enough bug that the alt-f12 debug window had a button to clear input locks. It would be unusual for all the throttle keys to be locked at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) Dumb mistakes: make sure you have a functioning rocker with probe/pilot, engine, electricity, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
