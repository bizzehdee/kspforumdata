December is circa-0.3, and since then a new detector was added, deposits were shaded by quantity, the hex map was added which reduces the number of cells you have to scan for a full map from 32,768 to 10,242, scanners skip already-scanned cells which dramatically increases scan rate in some situations and makes multiple scanners on a single satellite work efficiently, and altitude attenuation was changed to be multiplicative and \u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E reduced on top of that. As a result of all that, a medium scanner at 500km altitude now scans twice as fast, has fewer cells to scan, shows more useful information when you \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E get a scan, and coordinates with other detectors to increase overall scan speed. There\u0027s also the bit where Kethane data isn\u0027t lost all the time now, so once you scan, you can be confident your data will remain even through updates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nutt007\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nutt007\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow for an actual Kethane related discussion, \u003Cstrong\u003EMajiir\u003C/strong\u003E, how do the particle effects work in Kethane?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wrote the KethaneParticleEmitter module to be a wrapper around the Unity particle effects system (legacy, not Shuriken). This module lets me configure the entire particle system in a part config file, but I can also interact with it from other plugin code. For example, the extractor module positions the particle emitters at the point where the drill head enters the ground and turns them on and off. A lot of the fun happens in the KethaneParticleDynamics module, which is responsible for all the \u0022realism\u0022 effects on particles: gravity, atmospheric pressure, et cetera. This changes the emitter properties in real time to reflect the emitter\u0027s surroundings, and it\u0027s why you get long plumes of gas when you mine on Eve but only fast-escaping wisps of vapor when you mine on Gilly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sunfang","CreatedById":58823,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T09:17:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Majiir\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Majiir\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOne issue was the KethaneData module not starting after it was created, and the other was the KSPAddon issue that causes mod compatibility.

E.g. Seeing the kethane map from the tracking station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was an issue where if you had several addons that did this (TAC Fuel balancer, modular fuels, Crew Maifest, MANY others) then there could be.... breakages depending on how they were coded to use the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fix was to help avoid the breakages. Nothing to do with other addons that use the Kethane Resource system. The API for that is clean and public and fine for other addons to use.

It may not be mechanically exactly the same, or impossible for a experienced user of the mod to min/max the system for optimal speed scanning but, for a new / inexperienced player who will most likely just slap on a single detector on a probe and send it to orbit (like I did), it is still slow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not arguing the system is slow or needs to be fixed, I was merely answering that particular question and basing my answer on the context ie the person considered the slow scan a nuisance before and has the current system been sped up enough for a person who didnt like the slow scan before, and in my opinion the scan is still slow and needs patience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally it doesnt bother me, I just put a single detector at a nice angle so it criss crosses the target planet and gives me a rough idea of where the deposits are and I send in a land craft with a scanner to those spots to mine...
