I attach them and, Crap! I forgot to add some small radial sphere tanks for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, so i pull the interstage from the bottom of the tank only to find that the green nodes have expanded to 2.5 meters in diameter for no reason at all, it happens alot, probably all the time, but I didnt test for that. Why is this happening, how do i make it stop please?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. when working with small parts for a small lander or probe, not only are the green nodes way way too big, they also do the magi trick that i mentioned above. i have also read regarding this that the visible node size is the last digit in the \u0022attach node\u0022 sequence, and that 0 represents 0.5 meter sphere and theres 1 and 2 which are larger. Is there a way to make them smaller by, for instance using a negative number, because on smaller parts I am telling you its just a bunch of green blobs everywhere and its very frustrating. what can I do? i am going to try to give you guys a pic. I dont know how.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIs there a mod that I can download that can change the size of these or am i screwed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
