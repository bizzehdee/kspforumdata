To add to the confusion I also just launched a 100\u002B part ship and discovered my performance is now higher whilst in the clouds than at around 30,000m.\u003Cp\u003EDoes KSPRC also add any atmospheric effects that typically wouldn\u0027t be in the game too? I already removed the rockets mods but I\u0027m still seeing new atmospheric effects that weren\u0027t in the stock game and I get the feeling taking them out would also get me an extra nudge to the performance.

Also I just found what was causing a lot of performance problems for me when heading towards LKO. I also installed the recommended Atmospheric Sound Enhancement mod (which is really cool by the way) but unfortunately that was messing with my FPS more and more the further I was getting into the vacuum of space, it was also the place where those atmospheric effects were coming from. It still stays locked in the yellow when looking directly at Kerbin from an LKO of about 80,000m but a quick change in camera angle can give me back a lot of those frames. I can totally work with it from here. I might even see if I can squeeze Hot Rockets and Cool rockets back in just without Smoke Screen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darknighthb","CreatedById":84143,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-30T16:17:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeautiful!

I can\u0027t wait to try it out! Second, I know that it takes a (very) long time to load the game, especially on the first load after downloading, but I was stuck on the loading screen for about 30 minutes while it tried to load the Texture Replacer Command Pod Mark 1 re-texture. That, and the fact that there was a message on my screen the entire time saying \u0022KSP is not responding\u0022 makes me think there\u0027s something wrong with the files. Do you have any idea what it is?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first loading could take a long time in some machines... Have you all the depencencies? Especially ATM?

I started with a fresh KSP install, Downloaded all the dependencies(and Atmospheric Sound Enhancement), Deleted the tga texture files from Coolrockets, Downloaded the KSPRC mod and it freezes when I start the game.\u003Cp\u003EOkay well it froze for like 10 mins then as I was about to send this post the game unfroze and is now loading.

I have a sneaking suspicion that this has to do with soundtrack replacer, since something similar happened the last time I tried it by itself (or just the fact that I have a gajillion mods). Would it be possible to get a version without that dependency?
