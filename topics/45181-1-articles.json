Once that fades out (around 1m 7 I think) the rest of the piece is lovely.

I wanted something odd to catch attention then to fade off as the song went more soft and flowing. Thanks! I am glad you liked the piece. BTW \u0022No Heroes Here\u0022 is one of my favorites so far along with \u0022Vampire Slayer\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am hoping to find some company that can use these LOL.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
