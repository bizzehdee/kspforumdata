I followed the 1.8.1 install instructions for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/RP/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E exactly, including the dll for DeadlyRentry and the folder thing for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E.

I also have principia installed, but both Mechjeb and Principia don\u0027t affect the install, as removing them doesn\u0027t help with the crashing from my testing.\u00A0I\u0027ve also tried forcing OpenGL and uninstalling MSI Afterburner with no luck.
