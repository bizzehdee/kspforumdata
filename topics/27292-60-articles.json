Hello Folks! First Post! I\u0027ve been a lurker and a player since May 2013 but just now registered. Also, today (this weekend) I finally got to see my weeks worth of planning come to fruition when I launched my first colony mission since updating to 0.21.1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst a little background. The mission was originally going to go to Duna, but upon doing some entry and landing tests I discovered that some of the equipment just didn\u0027t have what it takes to successfully land on a planet with too much gravity for having very little atmosphere. Everrything worked like a charm however for low gravity locations, or places with proper atmospheres and decent amounts of gravity (Minmus, Eve). So I decided to set up the colony on Minmus. At least if something went wrong a rescue mission would be relatively short. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I set about this last week designing several \u0022ships\u0022 or modules that would be part of this colony mission. These modules would be launched to orbit around Kerbin individually, then docked together to form a couple of \u0022super ships\u0022 that would then travel to Minmus, where it would separate and modules would then be landed on the surface one at a time. I would have the capability to mine Kethane, and convert it to various fuels. I would have 3 Kerbalnauts, who would take turns driving the mining rover while the other 2 would do science-y things or goof off on the hovercrafts(!!!!). I planned (in my opinion) some cool stuff, and finally got to launch it all. And now here I am to share it with you. I hope you enjoy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELengthy imgur album follows.

The idea was that I could produce a heavily modified derivative that could be used to create imagery for the story I\u0027ve been working on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it dawned on me that while I\u0027m having a hard time with organic modeling in that program, I already have some pretty solid experience with Sketchup, which is really sweet for mechanical/architectural stuff. Since 3DS Max can import the ripped meshes, and Sketchup can import Max\u0027s .3DS format, I realized I had a conversion path that would allow me to pull assembled ship models over to a program I know how to work with very well. Sadly Sketchup can\u0027t deal with the .dds textures that are produced with the rip, but that\u0027s okay because I don\u0027t want the final product to be an exact reproduction of the game model. If I did that, I couldn\u0027t (easily) produce the neat shine effects on some of those parts (the RollKage, wings etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe initial model after cleanup (the ripping process results in two versions of the mesh, intersecting each other at an angle, so the \u0022extra\u0022 parts have to be removed and the remaining final model aligned with the primary axes)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DNAxR6h.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DNAxR6h.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter initial cleanup, the model is then further refined to remove extra lines and faces. When it\u0027s all ready, I can begin texturing the model using Indigo\u0027s (a third-party renderer) materials editor, which lets me bring in materials that have surface texture and reflectivity like the wings and RollKage \u0022paint\u0022. Other parts get simple colors because they aren\u0027t expected to have special visual qualities to make them stand out. They can be considered to have been simply painted with a flat matte paint. From there, the model is copied into another model of an appropriate-looking hangar facility, complete with customized textures on the lights that Indigo understands to be actual light emitters. A little experimentation results in lights that are dialed in to the appropriate intensity and color for the scene I\u0027m looking for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/X6Z3zcF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022X6Z3zcF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndigo does the rest of the really slick work in producing the final render, providing the actual lights and reflections in the final image. Each render takes about three or four hours (with this particular complex model) to get to a point where I can consider it done. Since Indigo is what\u0027s called an \u0022unbiased renderer\u0022, technically it would keep crunching almost forever, tracing light rays again and again, refining the image further with each pass that gets successively longer. As it proceeds, it fills in missing pixels which are called \u0022fireflies\u0022, resulting from surfaces that are lit primarily from third-hand or greater light reflections. You can see them in the driving lights on top of the cage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4bSrKoh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224bSrKoh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s the result of allowing Indigo to have its way with the model overnight instead of just a few hours\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bGpnTjH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bGpnTjH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, I\u0027m pretty excited to have figured this out, as I can then start bringing in kerbals that have been dressed and posed the way I want them for specific scenes in the story, instead of doing simple crop-n-chop Photoshop images like these\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Eexki\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
