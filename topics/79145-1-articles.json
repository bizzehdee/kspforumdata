Instead of actually having the information of the parts given to you rather then have the max thrust and the ISP at various altitudes given to you, you have actually have to test the part at these altitudes to unlock this information, I feel like this would make the part tasks less of a boring task although doing this for every engine could get tedious. Information such as cost and weight would be given to you beforehand. Yes, you could just look up the values in a sandbox or on the wiki or have them mesmerised if you are so hardcore but eh, i feel it would give a bit more reasoning for testing a SRB at various altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has already been said before i believe, but for the experimental contract tests, after you complete the test, you should be given a discount or if the idea above is implemented the data is given to you making the task of testing every engine a little less tiresome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and first post hi.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
