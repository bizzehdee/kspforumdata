I was thinking more of overheating fuel tanks/parts of the ship while burning for encounters, like he was doing on the stream. The nukes obviously generate a lot of heat which was destroying nearby parts. You would only need 1 thermometer next to the nuke to see if you are approaching critical temperature. Also Winterowl mentioned that environments have ambient temperatures. If that is true, craft on EVE will probably die within minutes of landing due to overheating, just like on Venus. In that case you still only need 1 thermometer, since all of the craft would be heating up at the same rate."},{"CreatedByName":"Redshift OTF","CreatedById":78679,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T11:02:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E A ***cool*** way to do it, perhaps in a future update, would be some sort of colour scheme where hot parts would go from red to white depending on how hot they are.
