The nukes obviously generate a lot of heat which was destroying nearby parts. You would only need 1 thermometer next to the nuke to see if you are approaching critical temperature. Also Winterowl mentioned that environments have ambient temperatures. If that is true, craft on EVE will probably die within minutes of landing due to overheating, just like on Venus.
