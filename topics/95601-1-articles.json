An orbit is a speed more than it is an altitude, but, OTOH, from an aircraft perspective altitude is speed in the bank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo long as you can continue to gain speed without rockets, keep the nose down and the climb rate low. Try to avoid losing altitude, but don\u0027t panic if you do; so long as you keep your nose a bit above the horizon, a dive should eventually turn back into a climb (reductions in altitude and increases in speed both reduce the AoA required for level flight; it\u0027s all about how many air molecules hit your wings in a given time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreviously, a flat-as-possible ascent was the most effective and efficient in FAR, and Mach 5 was easy to reach on jets alone. With the improved skin friction effects introduced in the latest FAR, things have changed a bit. You still want to maximise your jet speed, but you also want to get above the drag (\u0026gt;50,000m) as soon as possible. And it is now much more difficult to accelerate above Mach 4 with jets alone. So, as flat as possible while maintaining a shallow jet climb, but pull the nose up as hard as you can without losing control as soon as you light the rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Climb steeply (but not so steep that you lose airspeed and stall) up to about 15,000m.

Shutting down surplus jets and gradually throttling down can increase your flight ceiling substantially.
