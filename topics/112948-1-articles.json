I picked the best shots from my now swollen screenshot folder and put them in the gallery above.\n\nThe funny thing is I\u0027m considering changing it back. I never document my plane outings like my rocket ones, so having these shots is nostalgic in a funny way.\n\n![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-14T16:40:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2015 04:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by moogoob**"},{"CreatedByName":"trash0551","CreatedById":88568,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T17:47:27Z","Content":"Maybe off topic, but I\u0027d like to play KSP on my Shield Tablet using GameStream.

It\u0027s great for landing, launching and docking and so-so (but manageable) for flight. I couldn\u0027t map Kerbal movement so rely on the keyboard for that. Finding one binding that works for everything is tricky. Here\u0027s what I use:\n\nLeft stick: pitch and yaw\n\nL/R: roll\n\nRight stick: move camera\n\nD=pad: translate up/down/left/right\n\nLeft and right bumper: translate forward/back\n\nA: Throttle down\n\nB: Throttle up\n\nX: Brakes\n\nY: SAS toggle\n\nLeft stick click: Gear toggle\n\nRight stick click: IVA toggle\n\nStart: pause\n\nSelect: stage"}]}
