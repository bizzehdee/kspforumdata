As long as something can have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, it\u0027s toggled with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and ONLY with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E. I think you should be able to remove and change this binding via the action groups menu. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E group would be automatically applied to every command pod/probe core/???. This way, you can toggle \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E with other action groups and have an action group that can invert itself briefly without any unintended results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn (extremely complex) example of where this would be useful is in a supermaneuverable fighter plane with an ejector seat; something I just happen to have. On launch, I could hit the space bar and permanently turn on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E (unless I right click the cockpit and turn it off), and toggle the afterburners with T. If I needed a brief pulse of extra power (or if I wanted to turn it off for some reason), I could tap F to quickly turn the afterburners off and back on when I release it. Or the other way around because it can invert itself. The reason I mentioned the ejector seat is because the second stage is the ejector seat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s really no reason NOT to make it this way. It (probably) doesn\u0027t take that long to change, and doesn\u0027t get in the way of gameplay if you don\u0027t want it to. Parts are already set to do things on certain action groups (gear, brakes, and lights), and it would open up a whole new action group behavior; inversion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. - I know about the brakes action group but that doesn\u0027t invert. It just turns off on its own. What if I want to briefly turn it off and then have it stay on?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-07T05:05:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, you want something like an \u0022invert while holding\u0022 button that you can asign any actiin group to it?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
