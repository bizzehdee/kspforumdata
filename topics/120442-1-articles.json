The more speed you have, the more thrust you get. As a result, when trying to make a VTOL, you get the lowest possible thrust. As part of making intakes unique, the currently useless engine nacelle could solve this problem. Just like in real life, the engine nacelle could generate airflow. As a result, with an engine nacelle, you could start with higher thrust, due to the velocity curves. This could also be useful with cruising planes, as you could\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etake-off and accelerate to your cruising speed faster. For example, if the nacelle provides a mach 1 airflow, your engine\u0027s performance will be as good if you were flying at mach 1. After exceeding mach 1, the nacelle becomes useless. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(This would mean that you get a constant thrust until mach 1, wich is inappropriate.

In past, this was the only tool. The number of air intakes determined the performance of jet engines. Those were mad times, when we added about 10 ram intake per engine, and we could get to orbital velocities. But luckily those times are gone. Now, to avoid such jet-to orbit desgins, a new stat, atmospheric curve, was introduced. Not only the speed, but the atmopheric pressure also determines your engines\u0027 performance. You can\u0027t go too high, because your thrust is automatically lowered, and cutted around 26000 m. This is a quite balanced system, but it completely abandoes the usage of intake air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I ran a test: I locked my heading, and did a fully automatic horizontal acceleration (you know, the second phase of orbiting) and I wrote down my altitude, speed, and thrust at the main events of the acceleration: Max thrust at the engines, Max speed, and flame-out. I had 2 turbojets on the plane, and 7 shock cone intakes. After completing a test, I reloaded the save I took after leveling off, and repeated it with different intake-setups.

The results showed, that running 2 turbojets on 7 shock cone intakes, and 1 shock cone intake, is IDENTICAL. I didn\u0027t bother trying 3 jets with 1 intake, but this is bad, isn\u0027t it? You need one intake for 2 engines. )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem there is that why we still have 8 types of air intakes, if even one from the cheapest can run 2 jets. In past, when we had to spam intakes to have better planes, this diversity was vital, but now, it\u0027s useless. Also, note that there was NO difference, in practice, between open and closed intakes.

I don\u0027t say I want 5 intakes per engine, but half intake should be miserable, one intake should be good, one intake and a radial should be perfect, and adding more intakes should be horrible, due to the increased drag. And than, replace atmospheric curves with air intake. atmospheric curves are so... intangible. If jets wouldn\u0027t flame-out because the pressure\u0027s too low, but because of the lack of air intake, it would be fine. This way atmospheric curves could be extended slightly by adding more intakes, but not like in the old times, because drag would be increased significantly, and something that\u0027s described soon\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Csup\u003E\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E2\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E, the intakes\u0027heat apllied to the engines.

Now, it\u0027s not an SSTO-engine. Many people claim that yes it is, because it\u0027s short, and it won\u0027t be smashed, but that\u0027s a far-fetched argument. The good thing in an aerospike is that it produces relatively constant thrust and isp, making it useful for EVE landers. However, I\u0027d like to make it a perfect spaceplane-engine. The high atmospheric isp is useless, as there\u0027s nearly no atmospheric pressure on the altitudes where your jets flame-out. The good thing is that it offers a rather good efficiency even on orbit. Because on spaceplanes, you usually don\u0027t have many engine slots, but you have a large, heavy fuselage, high thrust is essential. What I would like: an aerospike, wich has nearly identical vacuum stats with the Poodle engine, but it\u0027s size 1. This would be awesome for spaceplanes. Maybe some more mass, as aerospikes have high mass, not simply 1 ton... But the best idea, is that due to its pointy shape, it should have minimal drag! With spaceplanes, regular rocket motors produce a HUGE percentage of your drag! If the aerospike had less drag, it would be awesome for spaceplanes again! But if the aerospike is same as the Poodle in vacuum, and a lot better than it in atmo, why should we even use the Poodle?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022margin-left:2px;\u0022\u003E-Cheaper\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022margin-left:2px;\u0022\u003E-Lower-tech\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022margin-left:2px;\u0022\u003E-Can be stack attached\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022margin-left:2px;\u0022\u003E-When stack attached, it has less drag due to that fairing\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022margin-left:2px;\u0022\u003E-Aerospike having a bit higher mass (so that they are not identical)\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022margin-left:2px;\u0022\u003E-It\u0027s rocket style\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut wait a second!

If you add more nukes, you\u0027ll have enough TWR, but you won\u0027t have enough DV than, due to the significant extra mass. My idea is that, due to the fact that there\u0027s a nuclear reactor in them, they could either be switched on and off limited times, or that they could only run for a limited ammout of time, before their core is depleted. Than, they could have more thrust or less mass. But spaceplanes than...

[ spoiler= here I describe how the RAPIER could be made more beginner-friendly and super easy to fly until 1400-1500m/s. After that, you would need 2 additional precoolers (totally 3) and you could proceed until 1600-1700m/s, but in a harder-to fly way, so veterans could take advantage of it too. ] Somewhere being a rocket, not only a ramjet, it could have more... constant thrust. Higher base thrust and lower thrust multiplier from vel.curves could make it more... rocket like. Also, it could behavie exactly like a rocket... Anyway, this would help a LOT to those players, who are new to planes, but are experienced with rockets. (every new player). The engine could have greatly extended vel.curves, allowing it to reach hypersonic (1600-1700?)speeds. The RAPIER wants to be a replica of the real-life SABRE engine, am I right? The SABRE is made of an air-breathing rocket, and a cluster of ramjets. Altough it\u0027s not working like that, but KSP RAPIERS could be made of an air-breathing rocket, that produces a rather constant thrust, and a ramjet, that produces more thrust at higher speeds. You would start with the constant thrust of the rocket, and as you hit larger mach numbers, the ramjets will start to produce more and more extra thrust. After reaching large speeds, the ramjets might eventually flame-out, due to their lower vel.curves. At the very large speeds, you could still proceed with the rocket, crippled by the really large speeds. With this small thrust, you could get to about 1700m/s, before you eventually flame-out due to the high vel. or atm. curves. I know it\u0027s not how it works with the SABRE, but it could be nice for KSP. Normally, you could get a 1400-1550 m/s from it, with a classical setup: Shock cone, Precooler, RAPIER. To stick to this setup, and for other reasons\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Csup\u003E5\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/span\u003E, the Max. temperature of the RAPIER should be lower. You would just not get overheated. But if you want to go further, you might add 2 extra precoolers. Than you can proceed using the rocket only, crippled by the high speeds, but still producing about 70-80kN thrust. You could go until 1600-1700, before you eventually flame-out, either due to the atmospheric or the velocity curves. After that, you could continue like a powerful rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the SABRE is rather optimized for operation in vacuum, while the nozzles of the KSP RAPIER are more effective in atmo. Playing with this could help to balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause precoolers determine the atmospheric performance of most engines, they should cost more.\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Csup\u003E4\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/span\u003E Also, the RAPIER engine should cost less. Expensive precoolers, cheap RAPIERS.

So the cheap RAPIER, witouth an expensive precooler, could get to approx.700m/s, before having to switch mode. Excellent for a rocket booster. Why is that good?

Also, in my suggestion, it\u0027s opposite. So where RAPIERs are low, scramjets come into place, and where scramjets don\u0027t work, RAPIERs excel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, a scramjet is a Supersonic Cumbusting Ramjet; a ramjet that can work on much higher speeds. However, it\u0027s heavier, and consumes more fuel. Also, even more fuel consumption on lower speeds, not to talk about not being able to operate at subsonic or sonic speeds. It needs a rather large speed to be able to operate. (200-300m/s?) After that, it works, but on a hideous low efficiency, and a rather low thrust. ( Isp 800-1000?) After reaching really large speeds, the scramjet will be able to operate optimally, around 1000-1400m/s. Here, it can have a greater thrust and Isp (1500-2000?). Altough it consumes loads of LF; it\u0027s still incredibly efficient, because you can use it to reach most of your orbital velocity. Scramjets should flame-out around 1800-2100m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlame-out on a such high velocity, not only because of the vel.curves, but also the atm.curves. Altough it\u0027s the next tier in spaceplane engines, it shouldn\u0027t have much higher atm.curves than the turbojets. That\u0027s insanely OP! Instead, I suggest that they have similar acceleration altitudes, but the scramjet reaches much higher horizontal speeds, but due to the similar atm.curves not much higher vertical speeds, leading to a relatively low apoapsis, and limiting the use of nukes for orbiting.\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Csup\u003E7\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/span\u003E Of course, it should have slightly better atm.curves, to be able to handle the increased acceleration province. And how about raming the air on such INCREDIBLE speeds? Well, scramjets are heavy due to their strongly heat-resistant materials. This allows them to bear the high temperatures, even witouth using the precooler, that couldn\u0027t operate at such airflows. So they need no expensive precoolers at all. But the engine itself is made of heat-resistant materials, leading to a higher mass. Instead of having a very high max. temperature, I recommend ignoring the majority of heat. If it had a very high max temp., it would survive, but this very high heat is spread to other parts, wich would not survive. I recommend that it ignores a large percentage of the intakes\u0027 heat, so at very large speeds, a little heat is still being spread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, unlike the RAPIERs, a scramjet-setup requies lots of engine slots, as you need not only rockets to finish orbiting, but some kind of other propulsion to accelerate them to the efficient speeds. Also, if the scramjet\u0027s thrust is not increased compared to its mass, you might need more of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow about an aerodynamic shape? Something that has about as much drag as a RAPIER with the nosecone at the back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the scramjet is an engine that takes you to LKO with relatively a proper ammout of LF consumed, and with minimal rocket fuel requied. Witouth precoolers, and with not so much fuel consumed, it\u0027s the cheapest, most efficient way of orbiting payloads. The downside is that you won\u0027t have more engine slots for nukes, and due to the really high mass of scramjets, you even couldn\u0027t take it anywhere further. So while RAPIERs are excellent for going further, the scramjets can\u0027t support that. \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Csup\u003E7\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/span\u003EAlso, if the atmospheric curves are rather low, you can\u0027t go on a steep ascend path, meaning that you couldn\u0027t take advantage of the high starting velocity for orbiting, and use only nukes. Finally, trying to take advantage of high vel.curves at low ascend paths, is really difficult, believe me. Also, piloting something at 1800-2100m/s, in the not so high atmosphere, is also difficult. Wouldn\u0027t the plane itself overheat? Well, I did a similar test, and I found out that plane parts can bear really high temperatures, using radiators.
