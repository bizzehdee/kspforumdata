I can reproduce it with my way too many parts and mods ship, I haven\u0027t reproduced it with a stock ship \u002B mechjeb yet.

Maybe 50. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it happens, it shuts off all the magazines and then it acts like it does when the game is accelerated -- you can highlight the engine but when you click you don\u0027t get a menu.

Or like it thinks all the magazines are empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did find out something else with the stock ship though -- I put six stock liquid fuel tanks on top of the magazines, and the radial mount engines could only get fuel from one of the six. I could manually transfer fuel between all the rest, so the game thought they were connected, but the engines could only use one of them. Which reminds me that when I use the large spherical tank on top, I\u0027ve started always adding multiple fuel lines to connect it to the Orion because otherwise the engines can\u0027t always see it. It\u0027s like only one of the seven attachment nodes on top is letting fuel through to the engines.
