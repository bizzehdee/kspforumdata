When I was trying to reenter into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, I kinda altered the orbit a TINY bit, radially. It made the entry point notably shallower (around 57,000-59,000 \u002Bkm, instead of the initial 30-thousand).\u00A0THAT wasn\u0027t the bug. What WAS, however, was that my orbit began to radically increase instead of decrease the moment I got into the upper atmosphere (and I was using my Monoporp to attempt to slow my entry speed, while being locked onto the retrograde), and my speed ramped up from 2,500\u002B m/s to.... get this... 5,000\u002B m/s, while I entered the atmosphere;\u00A0I was surprised my lander didn\u0027t explode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, the orbit grew and grew until it ended up leaving the SOI and showing that I was headed in the vicinity of Moho. If this wasn\u0027t Career Mode, I would\u0027ve kept it. But I can\u0027t help but wonder whether I somehow accidentally made\u00A0some sort of bizarre\u00A0slingshot maneuver while I was attempting to re-enter Kerbin... if did I encounter some strange bug?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDiscuss.
