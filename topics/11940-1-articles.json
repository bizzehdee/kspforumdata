As always, a noob is incoming! I stumbled across the game from a KurtJmac video (youtube person, plays minecraft and other games.)! I watched all his videos then knew I had to get the game. I\\\u0027m a bit of a space person myself, even have a poster of some of the planets and a rocket launching. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaven\\\u0027t really played that many space games in my time, but I bet Kerbal will be the best. I already bought the game, and messed around with a few of the rocket designs. I tried to go to the launch platform thing, only to have my game lag out. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve tried to tweak all the settings to down to the lowest setting - but still seem to lag. Is there a mod out there that would help me deal with this lag? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve been looking around on the forums, and found that this place seems to have a pretty nice community! I\\\u0027m glad for that, and hope this game will be extra successful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, Deanol signing off.
