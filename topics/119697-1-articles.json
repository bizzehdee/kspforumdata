I do however feel that, in part you have brought this upon yourself. You released a craft under the stock banner that does nothing but explode on the runway. Also you neglected to say that without a certain mod the craft won\u0027t work. If so, it\u0027s not stock. People like clarity. If it needs a mod, say so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I really hope this doesn\u0027t put you off because you have a good eye for detail.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-31T16:13:24Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2015 04:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Majorjim\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T15:36:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, don\u0027t go, you\u0027ve got talent and people recognize it.

Many of us contributed to Columbia\u0027s B-17, I got lots of feedback on my Wellington. This thing looks amazing, and people want it to work for them and for everybody. It\u0027s constructive criticism, and best of all, people are actually downloading it, and trying it out, to give this criticism. We all have crafts that get released and not a single comment, so you have been very lucky. I think we have all probably noticed a post release slowing down in the forums, people are waiting for 1.1 to play again and yet this garnered a lot of attention by people who know and build good craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
