If the condition that you want to test doesn\u0027t fall neatly into a pre-assigned category, then you have to use a lot of cleverness to make one (or a combination of more than one) do the same job.

You draw a connection between the arrows just by clicking and dragging your cursor from one arrow to another. That creates a white line. Once you have a line drawn, you can click on it again and you will get a color palette. You can change the colors of each line to be anything you want.
