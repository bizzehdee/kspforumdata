Really, it\u0027s Squad\u0027s fault for every using 0.625m as crew transferable docking port size. It doesn\u0027t make any sense really. They should have made it just a mechanical docking port like on the Gemini missions for early tech-tree docking. It\u0027s a perfect IRL counterpart.

Honestly, I think Proton could be a bit lighter in color, and have more contrast in bricks, but I don\u0027t think it needs stripes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another note, I\u0027ve started working on TMA! It\u0027s not too hard, since I\u0027m largely copy-pasting from my old .psd files, but I\u0027m looking to make it look even nicer. Progress-TMA will be totally unchanged, since Beale did not remodel the Progress parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LMXkkff.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LMXkkff.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Revenant503","CreatedById":130479,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T20:35:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs for the save breaking...I don\u0027t play anything besides career and while I\u0027ve been caught out a couple of times (castor Engine B and redoing remote tech ranges for example) most of Beales changes are easily fixable...some other mods are absolute horrors to use consistently over a month or two and I\u0027ve had to drop them entirely, keeping the old sizes in the docking ports is a major help in that though I look forward to using the new ones when visually appropriate \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spacecookie","CreatedById":101953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T20:45:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStripes is the new style of your parts isn\u0027t it ? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I really like it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy apologizes if this has already been said, I have issues with the tanta dishes, they doesn\u0027t clip anywhere and the bug seems to occur with the IGLA too sometimes, I don\u0027t have all the tantares parts installed but the SOYUZ and SALYUT folder are kept intact.
