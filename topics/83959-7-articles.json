The last part I\u0027m putting together for the new version is a 3.75m quad-engine. Its stats are very close to the NASA-SLS style one from the ARM pack. This one is in the category of \u0022alternate appearance for a previous stock option\u0022. The existing quad-engine has always bothered me, in that its engine bells look tiny compared to the thrust it generates (each nozzle is equivalent to a skipper), and also the bi-radial symmetry doesn\u0027t do it for me. So I wanted something functionally similar, but with a much beefier set of engine bells. Plus, from a realism standpint, atmospheric rockets benefit from longer bells, whereas vacuum rockets benefit from wider ones, so having some length makes sense for lower-stage lifter rockets. \u003Cp\u003ETo differentiate it a little, I gave it a tiny bit more thrust, but with the caveat of costing slightly more, and also having a slightly lower vacuum ISP. Basically what that means, is that it gives you just a hair more thrust \u0022out of the gate\u0022 for your heavy lifters (3330 vs 3200), but the efficiency improvement with altitude is a little slower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tested the new quad-engine today, and I really like them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T04:16:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starman4308\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starman4308\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey Necrobones, were you aware that you don\u0027t seem to be listed in the stickied mod library?\u003Cp\u003EAlso, thanks for the parts: I am very much anticipating Raptor\u0027s configs for RF so I can use those quad-nuclear engines, the cargo bays to put rovers in, and I\u0027m already using the 3.75m-3x2.5m adapter for my current Duna mission*.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*There is a certain feeling to be had when, despite doing your level best to minimize weight, your unmanned Duna/Ike sample return mission still requires a 1400t launcher (6.4x Kerbin), right about as much as the Falcon Heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAwesome!

Would it be feasible to partition the pack up so it\u0027s easier to remove bits which are not needed, or are redundant with other installed mods?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s probably some redundancy in some places, true. But to my knowledge, there aren\u0027t any mods that address the same set of \u0022gaps\u0022 in the stock line-up, which was one of the main foci of this mod. Having it all in one place works well for people who don\u0027t use large part packs and want a mostly stock-like experience, without managing dozens of packages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe good news is that it\u0027s not too heavy on the RAM usage. So far the \u0022Parts\u0022 folder is 71 MB (or 0.069 GB), and that includes uncompressed MBM images, so the RAM usage shouldn\u0027t be any higher than that. It\u0027s not like adding KW Rocketry or B9 Aerospace, in terms of the RAM hit. I try to keep the textures a reasonable size, and in some cases re-use them for a few parts (for instance, both of the 2.5m cargo bays share one texture file). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you wanted to delete some parts out that you\u0027re not going to want, it\u0027s pretty easy to do so. For instance, all of the engines are in the \u0022Engines\u0022 folder. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, with all of that in mind, when certain ideas strike that can stand on their own, I\u0027m already doing those separately. For instance, I made my fairings package a separate mod, and I\u0027m considering a 5m ARM-like package, which would also be separate. Most of the \u0022fill in the gaps\u0022 type of stuff really belongs here I think. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022E.Nygma\u0022 data-cite=\u0022E.Nygma\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi again \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00C2\u00BA\u003Cp\u003EYour modpack continues to amaze me and congrats to the1.0 release!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you planning on adding an ion engine in your style to 1.1? *hint* \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlad you\u0027re enjoying it!

If you attach something in the VAB/SPH to a moving collision mesh (that is, a collider that animates, like a landing leg, or cargo-bay door), the part stays fixed in position relative to the rest of the rocket. Even though conceptually, you think in terms of placing a part onto another part, as far as the game is concerned they\u0027re all attaching relative to the root-node of the ship. That\u0027s why plugin mods, like Infernal Robotics, are needed to make this sort of thing work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Noio","CreatedById":119519,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-05T16:16:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NecroBones\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NecroBones\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s true, the 0.625 stock line-up is still pretty sparse, even with some of the parts I\u0027ve already added. What I\u0027m trying to decide is if maybe a 1.25m version of the ion engine would be more useful than say, an alternate 0.625 version. In general I think the ions tend to be under-used in the game, but that leaves me also asking whether it\u0027s worth expanding on that, or leaving it alone and putting my time into other things. I\u0027ll think on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I find the gap between the biggest size-1 engine and the smallest size-2 to be more distressing than the lack of ions. Try and make a lifter using your 5 size-1 to size-2 thrust plate and the stock engines and you\u0027ll see what I mean. The double-bell size-1 engine is the reason I still keep the KW engines around...even though the texture cache of just the KW engines is 50% bigger than all of ModRocketSys \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I just realized that\u0027s not true. I keep around the KW LFO engines AND the SRBs, because in my opinion, the stock SRB lineup is pretty lacking. Well, and they sound pretty cool too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that may be because I pair MRS with RLA and, between, the two, I feel like nukes, monoprop, and ions are now plenty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Crown\u0027s assertion about rocket people and plane people certainly holds true for me. Spaceplanes and I have never gotten along. Mk2 parts are a waste of my texture cache and that\u0027s why I asked earlier about making sure things were easy to remove. To me, that\u0027s part of the allure of MRS - the focus helps it target its audience, IMO. Kinda like the way the plane people I know wouldn\u0027t be caught dead without B9, but I\u0027ve never glanced twice at it...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-05T16:32:20Z\u0022 title=\u002211/05/2014 04:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Noio\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
