Once I get close enough to visually see and click on my targets docking port, I\u0027ll turn on AD and get up to get a drink and food. My only objection is how far away it\u0027ll move me before handling the approach. My space station is about 50m from top of bottom, and MJ will put me about 150m below/above/sides... but since it successfully gets me there in the end I live wiht that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, onto my real reason for posting... I\u0027m really getting into spaceplanes, and especially SSTO\u0027s now. I have gone to guru\u0027s and gotten some really great personalized builds that fly great, but MJ\u0027s auto-ascent feature is crazy with them. After getting to about 5km up from the runway, on occasion, MJ has decided to put my SSTO\u0027s into negative 15 degree climbs, despite checking the \u0022limit angle of attack of 20 degrees\u0022. Luckily my jet has insane amounts of TWR so it pulled it off without a crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, since SSTO\u0027s have a different launch pattern, is there any plan to make a more customized to plane takeoff routine? The previously mentioned negative climbs happens erratically, some launches it\u0027ll do it, others it won\u0027t even if I do not change the ascent path between takeoff\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love the autoliftoff when it comes to my rockets, it\u0027s allowing me to have more fun actually exploring Kerbol space than spending 50% of my time in liftoff, and LKO work. But even after setting the ascent path to ~15km, with a mere 10-15 degree ascension, and a 20-30 degree AoA limitation, I get very different takeoff runs, using the same jet in 10 sequential takeoff\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apollo13","CreatedById":74572,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T18:16:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI started a new game with only MechJeb plus SelectRoot (VAB-only use) plus KJR and kData (in-flight) In this image, the red-circle vessel is docking with the orange-tank vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom 57 meters away, MJ Auto-Docking was flawless.

Ideally, that means parking a satellite directly over KSC but I realized that the easiest way to do that is a launch aiming for 2868.75 km and using the Kerbal Engineer HUD to keep horizontal surface velocity at 0. So, what I\u0027d like is a button in the launch profile or some such suitable location to launch directly into a geosync orbit directly over the current location (keep horizontal surface velocity at 0), and a button to land at the current lat/long.
