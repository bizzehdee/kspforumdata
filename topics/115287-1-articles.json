During descent, I accidentally hit the wrong action key and deployed my solar panels instead of my parachute. Needless to say, the solar panels did not slow my descent, rather decided to disintegrate! First mistake. Second mistake was not utilizing F5 prior to entering the atmosphere.\n\nI think I recall reading somewhere sometime ago that it\u0027s possible to go into my game save file and locate the solar panels in the vessel and change their status from \u0022broken\u0022 to \u0022working\u0022. I tooled around in it, but could not find anything that resembled their status. Am I mistaken, or am I not looking for the right line of code? \n\nAny assistance is appreciated!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-07T13:59:16Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2015 01:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Project Pluto**"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T13:48:07Z","Content":"It should definitely be in your persistent.sfs file, I\u0027ve pulled the same dirty trick with a Minmus base that tilted a bit too far on landing ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Just searching it for \u0027broken\u0027 should find it."},{"CreatedByName":"Project Pluto","CreatedById":94830,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T13:57:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It should definitely be in your persistent.sfs file, I\u0027ve pulled the same dirty trick with a Minmus base that tilted a bit too far on landing ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Just searching it for \u0027broken\u0027 should find it.\n\nawesome! found it. just need to know what to change it to! fuctional? working? normal?\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nfigured it out\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 cheers."}]}
