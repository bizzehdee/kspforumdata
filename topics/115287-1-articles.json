During descent, I accidentally hit the wrong action key and deployed my solar panels instead of my parachute. Needless to say, the solar panels did not slow my descent, rather decided to disintegrate! First mistake. Second mistake was not utilizing F5 prior to entering the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I recall reading somewhere sometime ago that it\u0027s possible to go into my game save file and locate the solar panels in the vessel and change their status from \u0022broken\u0022 to \u0022working\u0022. I tooled around in it, but could not find anything that resembled their status.
