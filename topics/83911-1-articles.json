At any rate, check out the spaceship exchange. You might have to go digging between \u0022modded\u0022 ship threads to find one using KW parts. As far as I know there isn\u0027t a dedicated KW ship thread...the parts for KW aren\u0027t much different than stock other than different textures and slightly more powerful engines. If you want inspiration for KW ships you may as well just look at stock examples but replace the stock parts with KW.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CDK","CreatedById":114733,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-06T02:37:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess I\u0027m not the most patient person.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-06T05:19:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the KW Rocketry .zip download there should be a folder labelled \u0022ships\u0022 this goes in the saves/(your save name here) folder.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CDK","CreatedById":114733,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-06T20:54:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you!
