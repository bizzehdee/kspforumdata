I sure have and so I made a replica of my favourite Wing Commander II fighter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I proudly present the \u003Cstrong\u003EYF-95 Morningstar \u003C/strong\u003Eheavy fighter\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tH27phY.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tH27phY.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bKZrj1E.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bKZrj1E.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/ITkCT\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/ITkCT\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI absolutely adored that thing back than and I still do now. Everything that dared to go infront of the three particle guns was doomed to a firey death. Even the infamous Gothri fighter introduced in Special Operations I became very managable with this beauty. The Morningstar was also the only craft that carried a very awesome missile weapon: The \u0022Mace\u0022 torpedo. The Mace was a tactical nuke which was the only weapon that could destroy a capital ship in one hit. You needed two regular torpedoes to do this normally. You better were out of the way fast though because it really took no prisoners. The Mace was also capable of nuking an entire squad of enemy fighters a trick that I managed only once as a vee lad. I fired it and \u0022Maniac\u0022 your wingman started firing on the enemy ships, hit the Mace, and boom 5 enemy fighters destroyed at once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince it is a space superiority fighter of course I had to make my replica be able to go to orbit. As you can see it does with two RAPIERs, but it is a pretty sluggish affair. You first have to climb slowly to about 13000 to 14000 meters and than fly down in a 5 to 10 degree angle so it picks up enough speed for the RAPIERs to really kick in. It is much more fun to fly with two Whiplash engines. Since the Morningstar is basically an atmosphere fighter put into space this replica works REALLY well. It has great flight characteristics in stock and was so well balanced from the get go that you can fly this machine the same way if the tanks are full or empty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI created a replica previously but it was nowhere near as good and true as this one, thanks to the Aviation Cockpits trainer cockpit. It uses a lot of procedurally generated parts so it is light on the part count with around 60 parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMods used: Aviation Cockpits, B9 Procedural Parts, B9-Aerospace, Aviation Lights\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-25T20:14:31Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2016 08:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Flashblade\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DarkOwl57","CreatedById":161624,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-25T20:27:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPRETTY!!!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flashblade","CreatedById":99058,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-26T02:15:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/161624-darkowl57/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022161624\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/161624-darkowl57/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@DarkOwl57\u003C/a\u003E Agreed, Origin created a beautiful fighter back than.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA fun bit of trivia on the reveal of the existence of the \u0022Mace\u0022 torpedo to the player character in the Wing Commander Kilrathi Saga:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTodd Marshall: \u0022Hey, Maverick, remember when I told you that this baby had capabilities I couldn\u2019t talk about?
