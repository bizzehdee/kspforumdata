Their ravenous expansion drew their burgeoning society into the expanses of space, where they drew the attention of the mighty Kraken. This is an old tale, and has been disseminated many times and in many variations- though that itself does not demean the merit of it alone.

City after city fell to his fury, until hope had faded. Soon, all that remained was the hidden valley space center of the eastern continent, the island air-field, and the Kerbal Space Center we know and cherish today. Libraries fell, theaters vanished, government buildings were vaporized, and every military base that ever existed was snuffed out like a tasty morsel- all that remained from the wanton rampage were these three bastions of society. Gathering for their final attack, the valley space center kerbals raced to KSC- and as the Kraken approached the island and began exuding his destruction upon the hapless victims there, inexorably looming toward KSC, an asparagus rocket of Whackjobian proportions was launched at the beast, it\u0027s name emblazoned valiantly on the side of the core rocket. The Kraken was summoned to the immensity of the challenge, and thus the final battle of Kerbal-kind ensued over the crumbling island airbase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage after stage was volleyed, as Delta-V bled away in a rushing torrent upon the Kraken. SSTO\u0027s pushed and shoved, SRBs were lobbed relentlessly, and the unbelievable happened. The Kraken roared a resounding roar, sated beyond measure by the gluttonous desire for Delta-V consumption. His very strength became his greatest weakness. Bloated, the armor that held back the onslaught slowly expanded and let in the searing furnaces of oxidized liquid fuel and the chilling sprays of hyper-cooled monopropellant. Wounded, the beast turned tentacle and fled- with the Kerbals in pursuit, captained by the fearless Jebediah Kerman and his two best friends, Bob and Bill. Though young at the time, they knew they were the last hope. Every other more qualified Kerbal than them had been spent; Werner von Kerman had injured his leg that day, and was sleeping it off in the lab, snoring uproariously. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPouring Dv out relentlessly, the trio pushed the Kraken to the system limits at Jool, where they lost sight of him in the depths of the gas giant. They waited many orbits, scanning and seeking, hoping and praying that their nemesis was gone. No sight. No sound. In disbelief, they took stock of their life support, ran the calculations, and at the last moment they broke their vigil and headed toward a Tylo gravity assisted maneuver back to their ravaged planet Kerbin in what remained of their Kraken-buster ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe jewel of Kerbin expanded large in their eyes as they returned- the green of life returning over the scars of decimation.

Broadly speaking, kermol are rural dwelling farmer/priests and kerman are the more technologically inclined urbanites. There\u0027s no particular friction between the two groups - kermol are quite happy to use whatever technological conveniences the kerman can come up with and likewise, kerman have long since concluded that Agriculture is Hard and are similarly happy for others to grow their food for them. \u003Cem\u003EFirst Flight\u003C/em\u003E, my fanfic story goes into this in much more detail if anyone is curious. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin has a world government. At the top is the Council of Twelve Pillars which consists of six Presidents and six Chief Ambassadors, one of each from each of the six principal regionalities of Kerbin. Presidents are elected representatives of the kerman, whilst Chief Ambassadors are appointed representatives of the kermol. Each regionality has its Ruling Council (kerman) or Conclave (kermol), which deal with regionality governance and also appoint/elect a Chief Ambassador or President.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn turn, each regionality is divided into a number of sub-territories and each sub-territory elects a representative to the Ruling Council. (Havn\u0027t decided on a name for the council members yet) and appoints an Ambassador to the Conclave. Elections would be familiar to anyone from Earth but Appointment is fairly complex - any kermol is free to stand as Ambassador but does need the unanimous acclamation of the Conclave. Age, experience, judgement, good works, community involvement all tend to be positive factors - in general kermol are a pragmatic lot and tend to be more concerned with appointing a competent Ambassador than faffing around with politicking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe larger sub-territories have added another similar sub-layers of governance to ensure adequate representation at the town or village level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, any kerbal whatsoever can demand his or her Right of Conclave, or personal audience with the Council of Twelve. This is not taken lightly, that kerbal will get his/her audience with an absolute minimum of delay... but there is a general unwritten understanding that he/she better have a very good reason for requesting it. If nothing else, requesting the Right to deal with a matter that could be adequately addressed by Ruling Council or other lower tier of governance will be severely frowned upon.
