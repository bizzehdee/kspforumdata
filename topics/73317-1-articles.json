We meet up with the recon engine, dock (OMG - without RSC engines ... #ksppain), and head back to Kerbin. After breaking Duna gravity I start to match planes with Kerbin - my burn time grows 21, 22, 23, 24 ... totally confused. I try to circularize ... 1m 20, 1m 21, 1m 22 ... Now I\u0027m thinking the Kraken is coming up behind me. Quicksave and exit ... restart the engine and the exact same thing happens again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally I zoom in on my craft and noticed that after I docked, I was still controlling the unified craft from my lander ...

The thin red lines show two craft control points (Sr decoupler and 2 man can) and which way \u0022North/Up\u0022 is considered by the game engine - so if you try to thrust in a given direction, your burn time will go up - not down. Secondly in the diagram, the little green arrow show control point (Sr decoupler) and the big green shows engine \u0022North/Up\u0022 ... which is where you always want to control your craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://smokeygee.com/ksp/burn_direction.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022burn_direction.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETO THE MUN!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-24T23:13:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYea I\u0027ve had this a few times to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s extra fun if you let Mechjeb\u0027s autopilot try to take off from Kerbin with an upside down control point.
