Hope it\u0027s relevant to Kerbal engineering.\u00A0Post pictures of your plane if possible, please!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe most unique\u00A0issue with getting a seaplane to take off is essentially drag. Water has a huge resistive force on a seaplane, and that force has to be overcome with the thrust from the engine(s). The faster you go in water, the deeper you sit in it, the more surface area you have in contact with it, and the angle of your body relative to the direction of travel through it all dramatically increase this already large force preventing you from accelerating. So, for design, I would say:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) Reduce drag. Decrease the parts sitting in the water--a wide fuselage and two very small outriggers under the wings if necessary. Mount them higher than the main fuselage, so that when the boat is sitting stationary in the water, they sit very gently on the surface. Once you start accelerating, the lift generated well below takeoff speed should be enough to lift them both out of the water, reducing drag.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) Reduce density (float more!). Your plane should want to float, not sink heavily in the water, barely buoyant. To do this, I would empty fuel from the tanks that comprise your fuselage where it meets the water. Store the fuel high instead. This will also help manage your center of mass a little for point 4. It\u0027s okay to not have every tank full to the brim--for effective atmospheric aircraft, I rarely take off with more than a half tank overall.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) Increase lift generation in water. Do this by gently angling up the front of your fuselage and under-wing outriggers relative to the water\u0027s surface, if your design allows. This way, as you start moving through the water, the water will be pushing your aircraft up and back instead of just back. (Look at the Grumman Albatross for reference... see the upward-angled belly and outriggers. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-L6Pj0tK9Seo/TgDJUGolY6I/AAAAAAAAARE/m_f--qchV8Q/s1600/GrummanAlbatross10oClock.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://4.bp.blogspot.com/-L6Pj0tK9Seo/TgDJUGolY6I/AAAAAAAAARE/m_f--qchV8Q/s1600/GrummanAlbatross10oClock.jpg\u003C/a\u003E) Sure, this will cause greater drag once you\u0027re airborne, but it\u0027s necessary for water takeoffs so you\u0027re going to have to accept that.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n4) Increase thrust. I know you said you added more jet engines, but the placement is important. Consider a plane with engines on the wingtips. If you shut one engine down, the airplane intuitively spins out of control in the direction of the shut-down engine, right? Well that happens because the assymetric thrust creates\u00A0a yawing moment on the aircraft around its center of mass. If you have two engines pointing through the center of mass and shut one down, however,\u00A0the plane doesn\u0027t spin. This doesn\u0027t just apply for placing engines on the sides of the plane--it applies everywhere, including above and below. Thrust vectors above and below the center of mass cause unwanted pitching motions. To counteract this, you want to place the engine(s) in a place where their thrust vector--the line pointing straight forward through their center--runs as closely through the center of mass as possible, or at equal distances on either side of it. Maybe this means angling them up or down a few degrees, or moving them back or forward a meter or two from your initial design. Note: Real-life propeller engines are much more practical for this mass balance than KSP jet engines, which require you to mount the heavy parts rather far back. Turn on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003ECoT\u003C/abbr\u003E markers in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and move things around until you get something that lines up.) I assume you\u0027re placing your engines high, to keep them out of the water. This is wise, but the thrust vector still needs to be balanced in relation to the center of mass.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n5) Increase lift. Make your wings bigger! More wing area means taking off at a lower speed, which means less time going fast in the water before getting out of it on takeoff and slower speeds for landing, which means a\u00A0better seaplane. Yes, you\u0027ll have a much lower top speed, but that\u0027s what comes with making a plane that can do unique things. Tradeoffs. Which brings me to my last and most important point...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need to understand that, again, engineering is about trade-offs. Especially in aerospace. If you want a boat plane, don\u0027t expect it to perform perfectly as a boat or as a plane (HU-16). If you want a\u00A0plane that handles well at\u00A0low speeds, don\u0027t expect it to reach high speeds (Piper Cub). If you want a plane that\u00A0reaches high speeds, don\u0027t expect it to handle well at low speeds (F-104). Everything comes with its opposite in another category.\u00A0My favorite simplified explanation of this is in the\u00A0example characteristics of\u00A0Range, Payload, and Maneuverability for military aircraft. You can only pick two, or spend both points on one at the expense of the others. In reality, there are dozens of parameters to balance.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWell, I\u0027ve got to get back to work. Post a picture of your plane, and let us know if you still have problems after taking this stuff into consideration in your design. Good luck!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-04T17:38:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222910344\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022154470\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221483546599\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002277793\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jrolson\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, jrolson said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow do you make a fully working seaplane?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake a close look at Squad\u0027s premade seaplanes \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Gull\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGull\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Mallard\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMallard\u003C/a\u003E, and \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Osprey\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOsprey\u003C/a\u003E for inspiration and engineering concepts. \u00A0You\u00A0can see them\u00A0if you allow default crafts in the difficulty settings of a new sandbox game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegolius13","CreatedById":165625,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-04T18:10:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just made a seaplane for Laythe\u00A0science collecton, with Mk 2 body, \u00A0Big S\u00A0delta wings and one Panther. \u00A0I started out with pontoons but it actually worked better with just the fuselage in the water - it could go faster with lower drag.

particularly adept at flying them, so I tend to overengineer them to have lots of wings and fairly modest takeoff speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne factor that can make a big difference:\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003Eis your plane a \u0022tail-depressor\u0022 or a \u0022nose-lifter\u0022 for takeoff?\u00A0 \u003C/strong\u003EBoth work equally well on land, but the latter tends to have an advantage in the water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s what I mean by that:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nForget seaplanes for a moment, and think about a regular plane that goes down the runway and needs to pitch upwards in order to lift off.\u00A0 Pitching upwards on takeoff basically requires one of the following:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nPush the tail down, or\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLift the nose up\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(of course, one can always do both)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost \u0022conventional\u0022 airplane designs seem to rely on pushing the tail down.\u00A0 That is, they have the rearmost landing gear not very far aft of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, and they have a tail assembly that sticks out pretty far behind the rearmost landing gear, and the tail assembly has elevators on it.\u00A0 So when it wants to take off, the elevators on the tail push the tail down, which \u003Cstrong\u003Erelies on the rear landing gear as an immobile fulcrum\u003C/strong\u003E and thereby points the nose upwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s also possible to achieve runway pitch-up by \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Elifting the nose\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E rather than depressing the tail.\u00A0 This requires having canards (or similar) on the \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Efront\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E of the plane.\u00A0 The result works out to be pretty much the same, but it has some design implications.\u00A0 Notably, it\u0027s not relying on the rear gear as being an immobile fulcrum-- it\u0027s exerting an \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eupwards\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E force on the rear gear, not a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edownwards\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E force.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis becomes significant for seaplanes.\u00A0 Tail-depressors tend to have difficulty lifting off the water.\u00A0 They need to rotate up, but the way they try to do that is by pushing \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edown\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E on the tail.\u00A0 That works fine on terra firma where, 1. you don\u0027t have to worry about pushing the rear gear down under the ground, and 2. your tail is held high off the ground to start with, so you don\u0027t have to worry about it smacking into the ground on takeoff.\u00A0 But in the water, tail-depressors don\u0027t have either of those, and exerting the downward force on the tail causes the plane to sink into the water which brings up drag and kills your takeoff ability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhereas nose-lifters do better in the water than tail-depressors, because the mechanism they use for rotating up involves an \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eupward\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E force rather than a downward one, which tends to make the plane ride \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehigher\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E in the water, thus reducing drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect that part of the reason I\u0027ve had such (accidental) luck with seaplanes is that I tend to design my planes as being nose-lifters rather than tail-depressors, so they have kind of a \u0022head start\u0022 on seaworthiness even when they haven\u0027t been explicitly designed as
