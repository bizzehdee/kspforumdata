What I was thinking is that long use science modules can be made that need to take a long time as well as maintenance to operate, but the science you would get would be very rewarding. It would provide a reason to keep some sort of base on another planet or moon in order to maintain this science module.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt Snuggler","CreatedById":65092,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-07T10:08:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking of something like this too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat about experiments like temperature and seismic sensor need to be logged in more than one location to get significant science gain.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"running","CreatedById":82033,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-07T12:10:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emore than one location = rover, not base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETemperature and seismic activity over time makes sense as valuable data, but that can be done with a (small) probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA (manned) base would be required if you are doing something there that takes a lot of time and room.

Making a profit from mining would be tricky in real life and currently in KSP everything is free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, after building several bases on Mun, Duna and Dress, it would be nice if there was a reason to do so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy bases on Duna and Dress had one functional reason and that was that each part contained a little bit of fuel.
