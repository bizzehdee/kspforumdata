Now reduce your orbit so you overshoot your landing spot, the trick here is to reduce your speed at increments:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint your rocket at the retro grade vector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eat 100KM reduce to around 500M/S\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eat 50KM reduce to around 400M/S\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eat 20KM reduce to around 200M/S\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eat 10KM reduce to around 50M/S\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are just guides you may need to adjust these to get you desired landing spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow when your at 5KM burn slowly you have to balance your thrust so you reduce your speed and land at no faster than 5M/S\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut also keep your rocket pointed at the retro grade vector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETIP:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have trouble landing and are going sideways then a cool tip is at 5KM burn retro grade until your speed is zero you should then fall straight down so you just have to manage your landing speed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you suceed then you can class yourself as an engineer in training no longer as this is one of the hardest tasks in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood job.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
