Now reduce your orbit so you overshoot your landing spot, the trick here is to reduce your speed at increments:\n\nPoint your rocket at the retro grade vector.\n\nat 100KM reduce to around 500M/S\n\nat 50KM reduce to around 400M/S\n\nat 20KM reduce to around 200M/S\n\nat 10KM reduce to around 50M/S\n\nThese are just guides you may need to adjust these to get you desired landing spot.\n\nNow when your at 5KM burn slowly you have to balance your thrust so you reduce your speed and land at no faster than 5M/S\n\nbut also keep your rocket pointed at the retro grade vector.\n\nTIP:\n\nIf you have trouble landing and are going sideways then a cool tip is at 5KM burn retro grade until your speed is zero you should then fall straight down so you just have to manage your landing speed. \n\nIf you suceed then you can class yourself as an engineer in training no longer as this is one of the hardest tasks in KSP.\n\nGood job."}]}
