And what is really keeping me from doing this is the lack of proper robotics in the game. Because sometimes when you want to launch something really \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E large, you can\u0027t put it under a fairing. And when they come with this problem in real life, well they make it as a contraption, so that it can expend in space but in the meanwhile it fits under a fairing. As they will do for the James Webb telescope. But for now I can\u0027t do that and I really don\u0027t feel like brute forcing a not aerodynamic 100t payload in space, so I guess I\u0027ll have to wait :l\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T01:23:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETV Aerospace, B9 Aerospace and pWings will all work correctly; I believe that Firespitter is also compatible. A quick way to check is to open the part.cfg for one of the wings in the mod and look to see if it has a \u0022FARWingAerodynamicModel\u0022 or \u0022FARControllableSurface\u0022 PartModule defined. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI\u0027ve heard people complain about both. If your planes and rockets are already aerodynamically stable, then you will find it easier; proper aerodynamics reduce the dV loses to orbit. If they aren\u0027t stable, then your rockets and planes will flip and you won\u0027t go to space. Generally, smaller payloads are easier to launch while larger payloads become a severe engineering challenge. Docking lots of parts together becomes important if you want to have anything truly gigantic in space. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYep!
