I have provided info on how to set up a Regolith harvesting config. On a philosophical note, this is KSP not Earth. So splitting hairs over what is in a Mars or Jupiter atmosphere is pretty irrelevant since you can override all of these for something like RSS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in any case, if you wish something to be harvestable for KSPI, please provide the Regolith config for review. These can also be added after the fact, so no rush. And we will happily seal up the 1.0 version without them. You can just include them with KSPI, since Regolith is going to gather them all up anyway and automatically merge everything (i.e. it is a LOT more tolerant of multi-mod than ORS ever was).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESort it out.

We cannot keep flagging stuff as \u0027YES\u0027 in the document but then come back here to work through it. As noted previously, the costs, densities, etc. are up to the curating mod. If there\u0027s an issue, take it to the relevant thread.

FreeThinker - I need your resource config file ASAP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Anything not sorted is going to be pulled out and not considered part of CRP until such time as I have configs. These will at this juncture be KSPI and NFT. Since I know Nertea is on vacation, I will be using existing CRP values for him unless something else is provided. Since the old KSPI values are KSPI-L not KSPI-E, I\u0027ll need FreeThinker\u0027s numbers, otherwise (as noted) they will be dropped until I have config files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Once this is done, each new proposal will be handled case by case like it always has been done, and negotiated between the folks who use that resource and the folks who curate it. Normally this is an extremely brief process. My concern is that the amount of back and forth on downright trivial stuff is getting more than a bit nuts, and that is absolutely going to cease now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Yemo - this is not the place for EC, AKA one of the many Viet Nams of KSP Modding. But that being said, the most commonly accepted definition is that 1EC/Sec = 1KW. We use the KW definition since EC is almost always discussed in terms of consumption over time, not storage. It\u0027s an important distinction given how totally out of whack the mechanics of storage are in stock. And yes, as a result, half of the stock stuff is off.
