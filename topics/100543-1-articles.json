I might go back to that general design, though I like the mission flexibility (though not the physical flexibility) of the open structure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m doing a lot of smackin\u0027 it into stuff so far.

On the plus side, once you master VTOLs on Kerbin, landing anywhere else is a breeze. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne trick I found to stick the landings: while you have a lot of vertical speed, zeroing it out is best done controlling from a top-facing docking port, but when the vertical velocity is very little you can\u0027t see where the damn prograde went (i.e: precision landing on, say, a helipad), and you start picking lateral speed. For those times you would prefer to control form a horizontal position, so the controls are like instinctual like in a plane, but clicking around in the middle of a delicate maneuver is a recipe for disaster. Well, you can switch from any other control point to the cabin by pressing \u0022C\u0022 twice: the first will put you in the eyes of a kerbal and reset the control scheme, while the second will get you back outside with the same camera angle. Can be done in like one second! Sadly, there is no handy way to do the opposite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
