I made my own ship using bits from Sunday Punch and Liquid Warp packs. The first few times, I tried to get as far away as possible on the Narsal engines, then flip around and go back if I could, but I kept screwing up and just ended up flying away from Kerbin backwards at a slower speed than before. On the third try though, I accidentally lost control of the ship, and never quite reached escape velocity. The eventual result of this? My pod was put in a high altitude orbit around the planet. I don\u0027t know how many times I\u0027ve gone around, since I fell asleep, but I do know that Bill, Bob, and Jeb have been up in the air for five and a half hours now, just circling.
