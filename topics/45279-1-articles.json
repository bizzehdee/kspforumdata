When I run out of intakeair, and need to switch the SABRE over to Rocket Mode, the spacecraft starts doing death flips:huh:. The COM is towards the back, but way in front of the COL. Although I don\u0027t trust COL measures with Pwings. It seems suspicious... I do not have FAR installed, by the way, unfortunately. My friend doesn\u0027t want it and we try to keep the same mods.

I switch to rocket before I run out of intake air. The angle of attack issue occurred to me, but it doesn\u0027t flip out when running on jets. Could it be because the rocket is just that much more powerful? I seem to get about the same amount of thrust. Sorry for the confusion... Its still puzzling me. I managed to get a tiny little SSTO into orbit, but I plan on adapting this design further once I know its capable of orbit.

Your CoL is really far aft compared to your CG-- and as the atmosphere gets thinner your control surfaces have less authority. You mentioned P-wings lies about the COL, which if it flies well I believe you\u0027re right. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could have to do with your intakes-- are you closing them when you switch to rocket mode? Could be that the drag from the ones in back is stabilizing you. Try leaving the furthest back pair open.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blue--Tempest","CreatedById":81893,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T22:12:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, it flies pretty well. But, like some of my other designs.. It wont take off until it \u0022falls off\u0022 the runway, or according to my friend who was experimenting with it, retract the gear. I\u0027m guessing that\u0027s just poor angle of attack though. Whats up with the Pwings is when I hover over where I want them to be placed, it shows what I believe to be the correct CoL. Then when I actually place them, it shifts, normally backwards. Here is a pic with me just hovering. Ill try the intake suggestion in a bit, and get back to you on it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blue--Tempest","CreatedById":81893,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T22:13:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, forgot the picture.
