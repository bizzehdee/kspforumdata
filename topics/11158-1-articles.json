These videos were made in the style of the ones you see of the old launches from Kennedy Space Center. There are some readouts that I miss, but I really am pressed for time throughout the narration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my most advanced SaturnV craft and it took a while to make sure all the staging was set. If you notice, I make the skirt separation on stage two fairly early, because due to a glitch, the engines won\\\u0027t accelerate the craft while the skirt is there. To properly achieve orbit, I had to get rid of that pretty quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, of course, MechJeb thinks that skirt sep wants the rocket to then fire its escape tower and the whole skirt sep, LES/BPC jettison is done too quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another note, I do realize that Apollo 8 was not a night launch, but the \u0027ignition sequence\u0027 only shows up at night, and that\\\u0027s my favorite part! (Save for the staging, of course!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may have noticed that the Ignition Sequence started at 6 seconds when it should have started at nine seconds, but that was due to a narration error and it was something I could not fix until I noticed it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\\\u0027s just pretend the engines delayed a little bit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was shot in version .15.
