I shall start by telling what i did before this problem occured: I had just downloaded DCK Combat Kit, which included some cool camos/paints\u00A0and BDArmory. I had and have a lot of important mod stuff in my KSP Gamedata file. Even more so after downloading DCK. Now, the problem is, when i take any plane i have\u00A0 (painted or not) for a flight around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, the game lags for 15-30 seconds at random times. Essentially the whole game freezes. Sometimes it works well for a few minutes, then lag, work for 1 sec, freeze and so forth.\u00A0\u00A0Also i got a pretty low fps (only when flying near \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E).\u00A0 In my gamedata file i have two BDA files, could this be one cause to this? And also i deleted physics range extender because it didn\u00B4t show any of my ships, only the markers (deleting fixed this). Could one of the causes also be the fact that i have a to of stuff in my gamedata, which i mentioned earlier, and the reason for low fps maye colud be that\u00A0my computer has to work a lot to get all those cool camos showing? I wouldnt like to delete BDA and DCK. I have no idea about the specs of my pc, all i know it\u0027s and HP Envy 15-af109no. And one more thing, after the laggin started occuring now my KSP can just crash at random times, usually when changing a scene (for example recovering a vessel and then the game shows that loading screen). My KSP version should be the latest up to date one btw.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jammer-TD","CreatedById":173970,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-23T14:01:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyour hp should have more than enough resources and should easily handle the game, I would ask (having no logs to work with) if you have any planet packs running as well?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed9747352561\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/163863-how-to-get-support/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:228px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nplease submit logs for further diag\u0027s\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhope this helps\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJammer\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kspguy77","CreatedById":189458,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-23T15:54:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo i don\u0027t have any planet packs at the time.
