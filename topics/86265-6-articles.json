It didn\u0027t work or help. The lander broke up in Eve atmosphere, and the parachutes completely tore the remains apart. My only other plan now is to add parachutes to the spaceplane as to save fuel on burning retrograde to stop my steep descend, since I plan on landing close to water. Next up is just the capabilities of the spaceplane.

I don\u0027t use mods in my current career mode series on youtube and I would\u0027t consider doing so for (my first time at least) such a grand challenge as this. However, your description of my lander is pretty accurate. I also sadly only use a command seat for the lander (if that\u0027s okay?) I hope that isn\u0027t cheating in some way. One day I may attempt a the man lander but currently I\u0027ve never returned from Eve so i\u0027ll stick to basics. I also built my design around using a rover to get to the highest point on Eve. However, after the wheels broke I decided to test launching from Eve from my current position and i turns out that my lander can get into an orbit with plenty of fuel to spare from an altitude of about 5100m. (I had aimed at launch from the highest point but more on that later).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E36.6 tonnes if I remember correctly is what my lander weighs. It is either 346 or 446 parts (either is quite a lot!) and uses an extensive but simple asparagus system. I cannot post pictures now but I will do in the future! I\u0027ve gone through many versions of my lander, some using aerospikes but I have since settled for the lightweight appproach (although I though 36 tonnes was a lot). My lightest Eve lander that is capable of orbit weighs 23 tones but requires being launched from the highest point on Eve, about 7500m above sea level. This is very hard to do, however, as I am not an expert in precision landings. I\u0027ll continue this mission log/profile/whatever later when I also have screenshots to back everything up and show you what I mean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully using a command seat and lots of asparagus has\u0027t made my attempt seem less impressive \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s any consolation, one of my initial concepts has a 54 stage asparagus system that took my about 90 minutes to get my head around and build at 2fps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astrobond","CreatedById":127649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T23:05:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi All \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my Eve Rocks Challenge (Eve sample \u002B Eve sea sample) \u0022without Kethane\u0022 no refueling one shot last try \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Craft file of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2QsqoF78kPFQmx3WU5VQkxGMjg/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u0022Eve Jeb Landing AR 9\u0022\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E379526$ ( - 279124$ reuseable SSTO Lifter - final kerbin lander = less than 100000$ final cost ) less than 99 Tons at launch from Kerbin, and less than 20 Tons ready to Launch at 7500m on Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E553 parts full stock \u002B MechJeb2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP 0.25.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found this 7500m landing site some month ago with SCANsat.v6.1 mod and some hours of testing.... xD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have to reach Eve with about 24\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 inclined orbit and wait to be above to reach the landing site without burning to much fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso wait to be in the plane of the orbiter waiting for you before to leave Eve...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to reload several times to undock the glider without breaking it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAND MechJeb2 Helped me a lot \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso Thank You very much for the other players posts who helped me a lot, and mostly Tavert in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76153-Lightest-Eve-Lander\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u0022Lightest Eve Lander\u0022\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Odyssey Album:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/mf1na\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
