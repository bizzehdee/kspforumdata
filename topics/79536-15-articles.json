In the interim, being an open source project, I\u0027ve begun to puzzle through the code. most parts of PF convert 1:1 with Kopernicus, and are quite easy to map. Or are just direct PQSMods which can be read straight in (more or less; they will probably also need some relevant data pulled from a template). The one part I am a bit confused on is PF\u0027s \u0022ScaledExport\u0022 module. It seems to take a template planet, apply some simple changes and then export a .bin file of the modified planet for use with a custom planet as a sort of \u0027custom template\u0027, but i\u0027m just not sure. It\u0027s the only part of their configs that dont seem to map cleanly, anyone able/willing to chat with me about how that part works?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I plan to keep dabbling, but if you would consider a contribution valuable, perhaps myself and whoever else around here who has the skill and time could collaborate on some development? We could work in another fork or forks, and submit pull request(s) in for whenever you guys get back? I\u0027m not trying to steal the project, or anything of the sort, but wasn\u0027t half the point of Kopernicus to make it so the community could pick up the slack when the mod\u0027s core devs are busy or away? I just want to see this project take off, and what it needs before that happens is PF config comparability and/or be used by RSS. My personal interest is in PF configs.

I see it copying a stock planet as a template, taking user/custom config values, altering the mesh, then creating a \u0022_.bin\u0022. OK. Then looking at the PlanetFactory.cs, the bin is openned in LoadScaledPlanet (static void function) where it loads the material (colorTexture or \u0022*_map.png\u0022) and bumpmap, then calls LoadScaledPlanetTexture which sets textures and such. OK. Next, if the _.bin exists, it fiddles around with the values, does some opperations inside the if context, and finally calls PFUtil.RecalculateTangents (another static void function) using the resulting mesh. OK. Now RecalculateTangents runs a bunch of vector and math, and ends with \u0022theMesh.tangents = tangents\u0022 where theMesh is the Mesh object in the GameObject object in from the previous function. I just wish I knew why all this crazyness is necissary or even useful. What do these parameters......DO?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does taking the template and adding/removing/changing oceans do that is so special?

Picking through three code bases is taking a while to figure out, but I\u0027m starting to get a grasp on this. Another question for you (or anyone else knowledgable), ScaledSpace only impacts the map view/tracking station view, correct? More over, it\u0027s basically just render distance and some ocean quirks? If so, it seems this could be auto-generated unless I am missing something? Doesn\u0027t seem like custom settings are really necessary here...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: So.....looking at RSS, you export .png files for the scaled textures/normals not too unlike PF does, but Kopernicus doesnt export files. I am guessing Kopernicus is doing something special with the maps such that exporting is not necessary. Moreover, RSS and PF call CreateMaps, while Kopernicus does not; which seems to imply Kopernicus is using other methods of generating the materials. Will look more...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 2: OK, far as I can tell, maxHeight and mapWidth are irrelevant to Kopernicus, as it computes these values itself. templateName and removeOcean map cleanly to Kopernicus in the Template (removeOcean inverted). oceanHeight and removeAlpha, however......still not sure if Kopernicus has anything like them implemented. Luckly oceanHeight isnt used too often in PF configs I have seen. For now I will just focus on the PQSMods, meaning I am finally writing code!

That\u0027s controlled by the scaled space fader PQSMod (PQS fades out, scaled space fades in). You can see it happen at something like 30-40km in stock KSP I believe. Note that Jool doesn\u0027t have a PQS, just a scaled space mesh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, it replaces the dynamic PQS with a static mesh (hence the need to, on load, make that mesh fit the PQS terrain) which has a diffuse and a normal map. These maps should be pregenerated (hence the 1GB of PNGs that RSS ships...). Usually you\u0027ll want to tweak them by hand anyway, but for a base RSS allows you to export the maps based on the PQS itself if you want (using, presumably, the same function call that Squad uses before hand-retouching).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EmaxHeight just lets you specify how to convert meters-above-sea-level (or above-reference-point) to shade-of-gray.
