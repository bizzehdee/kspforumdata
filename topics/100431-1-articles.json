Say \u0027Mun Base 1\u0022 for the non-creative. So you might then get a contract to add more habitation, and instead of having to dock them together, you need only place the new hab modules within whatever range is specified, say 200m in this case. Note that SOME contracts might require docking parts on the ground, just not all.

It cannot possibly be an annual budget, as you can unlock the entire tech tree in a couple game-months.
