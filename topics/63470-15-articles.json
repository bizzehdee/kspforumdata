Personally, I find art schools to be a load to ****, at least here in the UK. They follow the same grading criteria and teaching methods as academic subjects, and this just is not suited to anything creative. Sure you\u0027ll learn a few technical skills, but you wont learn to be creative at all. A guy working at Ubisoft once told me, you dont need great technical skills to be a great artist. Art is about the idea, not how photorealistic you can make it (A great example is the difference between CoD/BF/Halo, and KSP. The prior may look quite realistic, but the actual design and idea of it all is so bleh. KSP on the other hand looks far less realistic, but has way more original ideas behind it, and is way more fun). I can guarantee that if you can loosely sketch a fantastic idea, another artist will take it to the next level for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeres the part where I noticed that I rambled a bit.
