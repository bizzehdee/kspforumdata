It makes no attempt to stop a roll and the only way to get it to lock onto the heading I want is to turn SAS off and back on. Otherwise, it likes to drift back towards the previous heading, even if my last steering correction is much closer to the current heading. The command authority from the pod is definitely weaker than 0.21.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Flying a probe with an ASAS part also isn\u0027t bad, though a little more frustrating due to the weaker reaction wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Flying a probe without an ASAS part is nothing short of a micromanaging nightmare. Since probe cores don\u0027t have the \u0022SAS-equipped\u0022 tag in the VAB, that\u0027s understandable, except that turning on SAS definitely does something, just nothing helpful. It feels like \u0022utrafine\u0022 controls, where even in a 2 ton ship, you have to hold keys for several seconds to see any change in movement. It will not, however, stop a very slow tumble even in vacuum, so it\u0027s not acting like the pre-0.22 SAS, it\u0027s just seriously reducing command authority. It feels like all it\u0027s doing is fighting my commands, but not anything else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI kind of have to question the \u0022ASAS built into capsules but not probes\u0022 decision, especially given that probes don\u0027t even have the pre-0.22 SAS functionality any more. This means that either we micromanage the launch, or we consider a part with a flight computer mandatory. I launched probes without ASAS in prior builds, and while SAS wasn\u0027t as helpful as ASAS, I could do it, but there\u0027s no way I\u0027m doing it again in 0.21. The weaker control wheels are completely understandable, and the 2.5m probe core finally has enough rotational authority that adding an unmanned capsule for more rotPower is no longer a given.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have to question the fact that the 1.25m ASAS (now named Inline Advanced Stabilizer) got a reaction wheel but the 2.5m ASAS didn\u0027t. Since the flight computer is redundant on a craft with a capsule, the part will only get used on probe craft, and any probe flying a 2.5m stack is probably going to need more torque than a probe flying a 1.25m stack. This also means that if we want to add stock reaction wheels to a 2.5m craft stack, we have to add the 1.25m reaction wheel or a command pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, I\u0027m not sure that changing the way ASAS worked at the same time as reducing the rotational power of capsules/probe pods and removing SAS functionality from probe cores was a good idea.
