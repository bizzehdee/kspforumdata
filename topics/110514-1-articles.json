This is the result:\n\n![0yUZUyE.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/0yUZUyE.jpg)\n\nThe craft features advanced aerodynamic features that make it easy to land, easy to fine tune heading and pitch, and its very sturdy construction means that as long as you are subsonic, you can\u0027t make the plane break apart. In fact it has been so carefully designed that it has enough fuel to circumnavigate Kerbin without the drop tanks (which are actually only there for fun or for when I\u0027m spending a lot of time messing about doing important science stuff).\n\nOf course, at a certain point one will unlock the turboramjets and that\u0027s when you get this:\n\n![H3bI7eK.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/H3bI7eK.jpg)\n\nWhich is the exact same plane but with turboramjets.\n\nAnd yes, the picture was completely necessary!\n\nWhen flown at 20km\u002B it can cruise at over 1000m/s and sips fuel so slowly that it is possible to circumnavigate Kerbin at least once, perhaps even twice.\n\nHere\u0027s a beauty shot of the RJ variant going transonic:\n\n![4Wmz1uQ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/4Wmz1uQ.jpg)\n\nYou can get the base craft [here](http://kerbalx.com/MaxSimm/KDX-Thunder.craft) and the turboramjet variant [here](http://kerbalx.com/MaxSimm/KDX-Thunder-RJ.craft).\n\nACTION GROUPS:\n\n1 - Toggles the Ladder\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T17:20:03Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 05:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Scoundrel**\n  \nAdded some more visual aids"},{"CreatedByName":"SHiftER2O","CreatedById":141087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T17:04:12Z","Content":"That...

There\u0027s some nice aerodynamic *side effects* of this design (sorry couldn\u0027t resist!), which makes it pretty docile to fly. I\u0027ve actually managed to land it on a mountain... unfortunately I knocked it with Jeb while being a goof and planting a flag for a photo doing important science and PR work, and sent it sliding to its certain death, so maybe landing it on mountains isn\u0027t a good idea.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T17:31:34Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 05:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Scoundrel**\n  \ngrammar"}]}
