I\u0027d like to assure you that your mod is far from irrelevant; I love it and use it a lot. I\u0027m having a blast so far, it\u0027s really really fun.\u003Cp\u003ESo thank you for all the time and effort you put into this, it is definitely appreciated. I\u0027ll be sure to show more love from now on if you need motivation.

I love Voyager, but it\u0027s not much of a cargo ship. So I\u0027m trying to find parts to build one myself; unfortunately, my computer doesn\u0027t like big ships with more than 150 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried using the Daedalus from Mjy, but I can\u0027t seem to fly it; SAS tries its best to slam it into the ground somehow as it spins out of control. I\u0027m not much of a cfg editor so I pretty much gave up. It\u0027s too bad, it\u0027s a really nice looking ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConcerning the new features of LCARS, I haven\u0027t tried the cargo bay yet, might make Voyager capable of delivering bases. I\u0027ll try it out. The crew quartiers are definitely a most welcomed addition. It makes Voyager a great rescue craft!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, thanks again to everyone involved in this.
