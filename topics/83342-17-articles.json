If you don\u0027t want to add another mod you can either 1) wait a few days, 2) remove the vessel that\u0027s causing the issue from the save file manually, or 3) remove KCT, load the save and go into the Tracking Station, then exit the game and add KCT back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case you want to know precisely what\u0027s going on, here\u0027s the rundown. A ship is being destroyed by KSP for being too low in the atmosphere while being unloaded. KCT kicks in and checks for parachutes and for a probe core (if there\u0027s enough parachutes then the parts get put in the inventory, if there\u0027s a probe core you get more funds back). When it checks for the probe core it tries to view some information in the COMMAND module, but since the current scene is the Tracking Station and not flight, that information doesn\u0027t exist (aka, the module is NULL). Then it spews out an NRE which causes the rest of the game to go crazy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStageRecovery avoids the issue most of the time because the default mode doesn\u0027t care if the destroyed vessel is controlled. When trying powered recovery it does care though, so there\u0027s a chance the issue could appear then.
