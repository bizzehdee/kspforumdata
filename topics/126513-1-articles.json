You always want the lowest, most horizontal ascent possible when there\u0026#39;s no atmosphere (the only reason you don\u0026#39;t do that on Kerbin is because of all that pesky air). Not only does that make optimal use of Oberth effect, but on a craft with a relatively low TWR like yours it will minimize gravity losses.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI say \u0022low\u0022 because even if your TWR is around 2 (Moho-relative), that\u0026#39;s still low enough for significant gravity loss if you\u0026#39;re flying up rather than sideways. For example, if you were to take off straight up on Moho with a local TWR of 2, you\u0026#39;d pile up over 250 m/s of gravity loss by the time you reach 12 km altitude.

Basically, you want your landing procedure to be the same as taking off, in reverse. Come in low and shallow, slam on the engine at the last possible second so that you brake to a halt right when you get to the surface. Judging that \u0022last possible moment\u0022 is tricky, which is why it\u0026#39;s called a suicide burn. :) There are some tricks you can do with a surface-placed maneuver node to assist with that, not sure if you\u0026#39;re familiar with the technique.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Shirt","CreatedById":147465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-27T00:23:36Z","Content":"\nWith the spiders thinking I can slow down quickly is suicidal. :D That said my approach was terrible.

Ideally, you want to be going at a fairly shallow angle when you get to the surface-- i.e. coming in mostly horizontally, not straight down. Doesn\u0027t have to be \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E horizontal, a descent of 20 degrees below the horizontal is fine. Basically, the closer to horizontal it is, the more efficient, but the trickier the piloting will be.
