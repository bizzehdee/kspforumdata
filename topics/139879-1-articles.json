You don\u0027t need the extra step of going to CO acyually, plenty of catalysts get you there directly from CO2. But the big reason no one does it is we drill for oil for the energy it gives us. These reactions you describe are all uphill, so you will need an energy source to drive them. You\u0027re limited by where you get energy from, either nuclear or renewables. So really this is about energy storage, and while yes hydrocarbons make a great energy storage source, you\u0027re competing with hydrogen, supercapacitors, and batteries.

Engine give just third of it\u0027s power on it, and generator need to be restocked with dozens of kilos of wood every couple of hours. And you cannot use just some waste, gas generators need high quality dry wood, cut to cubes of certain size. Some generators may run on pellets, made of pressed ships, but pellet making consumes power and labour too. So \u00AD\u2014 combination of good cheap workforce and of total lack of other fuels is absolutely must to use wood gas generators. And it happens only in wartime or similar conditions.

If you were going to design a process to make fuel, the better choice is to genetically engineer an algae to make Hydrogen which as we know readily dissolves across thin membranes.
