Likewise, for some hypersonic swing wing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E with very high torque and pressure on the wing at low speeds, the parts are likely much too floppy and light and fragile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same is largely the case for fuselages. Often times things are much stronger or weaker than necessary and when stronger are quite massive indeed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI propose that parts be given a structural reinforcement resource that increases most forms of strength and toughness and durability of the part in exchange for weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would also allow more nuanced part damage in a crash or overheating or similar. Say, converting structural reinforcement into a dead weight resource, thus weakening the part,\u00A0instead of full on deleting a part, just bending a joint, or doing no damage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-01T06:55:21Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2019 06:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Pds314\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
