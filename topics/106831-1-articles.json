What I was thinking is something simple and light that a plane is meant to land on but not take off from (launch vertical, air launch, dropped landing gear, ect.). It could be low in the tech tree around one of the very early flight nodes. Some notable aircraft that have used landing skids are the [Komet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messerschmitt_Me_163_Komet), certain models of the [Ar 234](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arado_Ar_234) the [U-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_U-2) and the [X-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_X-15). If anyone knows of a mod that adds these as well that would be great."},{"CreatedByName":"NasaSpace101","CreatedById":140410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T11:55:53Z","Content":"Kerbal Foundries, or LLL both have skids. LLL is a bit sci-fi same with kerbal Foundries but you can just throw the sci-fi stuff away.\n\nEDIT: Ohhhh up to date, well I\u0027d just wait because 1.0 broke alot of mods."},{"CreatedByName":"TKFT_ExTr3m3","CreatedById":105704,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T13:32:02Z","Content":"Ah didn\u0027t know they had skids in them, thanks. I assume they will be updated, the only skid mod I had found was really old and outdated."}]}
