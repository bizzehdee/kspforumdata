Since Gratian has an atmosphere I can\u0027t keep a Communotron 88-88 opened as I enter the atmosphere. So what I\u0027m trying to do is have a short range Communotron 16-S on the lander that won\u0027t get ripped off by the atmosphere, and have a probe orbiting above with an 88-88 connected back to command to relay a signal to the lander. I also have an RA-2 relay antenna on the orbiting probe. When I cheat everything into Gratian\u0027s orbit the orbiting probe part functions fine, has a good connection, but when I decouple the lander part it gets no connection to the relay, even when they\u0027re right next to each other.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLander: has Communotron 16-S\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbe relay: has Communotron 88-88 and RA-2 relay antenna\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLander won\u0027t connect to probe\u0027s signal.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverything has power, line of sight, probe cores...what am I doing wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gordon Fecyk","CreatedById":157121,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-30T18:23:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this is anything like trying to land a probe on Eve, which would be hasher plasma-wise, you\u0027re likely going to lose comms at some point during the descent and then regain it after the worst of the re-entry process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt almost sounds like the lander is missing a probe body of its own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you make craft files available for inspection?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MickB","CreatedById":166911,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-30T18:49:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://pastebin.com/4vTaxtGR\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://pastebin.com/4vTaxtGR\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the only two mods for parts are B9 and Interstellar Extended.

I found I could fit three relay probes using RA-100s into a 3.75 m fairing and then use a 3.75 m craft to take it anywhere.

All you\u0027d have to do to this craft is attach an additional probe core to control the empty scaffolding after deploying these guys, build the fairing, then use an appropriate launcher to get this package where you need it. Or just make sure you deploy that top probe last, so you can take advantage of its solar arrays and signal strength to control the launcher until you don\u0027t need it anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile these RA-100s will certainly maintain a connection to Kerbin from as far as Jool, it\u0027s only at 55% strength and you\u0027ll need additional relays for some of the worlds in Galileo\u0027s Planet Pack. You should also mount a couple of \u0027regular\u0027 antennas to your launcher so you can control the empty scaffolding. Or just delete it via the Tracking Station, I suppose. Some additional tips: Set the force percent on those decouplers to zero, disable staging on them, maybe even disable staging on the fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
