The other one would be visited during EVA3. Once ontop of the peak, John left the MRV to collect some samples and make pictures of the surrounding area. He also used the view to chart out their further course towards Gauss. From the there John drove the MRV down into Laplace and from here over the two lowered ridges into Leibniz. Halfway between Laplace and Riemann the Kerbonauts stopped to collect several samples of Leibniz rocks. They continued into Rieman, an impressive crater inside Leibniz. Once the samples from there were bagged, they left toward their main target.\n\nOn the small stretch between the two craters John was able to push the MRV to [45.5 m/s](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=45.5\u002Bm%2Fs\u002Bin\u002Bkph\u002Band\u002B45.5\u002Bm%2Fs\u002Bin\u002Bmph), a new speed record, before jumping into the Gauss crater. During the 2000 meter descent the MRV accelerated to [71.2 m/s](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=71.2\u002Bm%2Fs\u002Bin\u002Bkph\u002Band\u002B71.2\u002Bm%2Fs\u002Bin\u002Bmph). At this point the guys at mission control got the key for the locker with the pre-written obituaries. But to everyones surprise John, Charles and the MRV survived the landing on the bottom of the crater. However the MRV lost all it\u0027s wheels, so while Charles collected a few samples from the surrounding area John replaced their tires so they could head back to the MEM.\n\nBut first it was time for some science! After all this daring jump wasn\u0027t done to entertain the kerbonauts. Close to their landing spot John and Charles found indentations, similar to the clusters on the highlands. They stopped and collected several samples for later analysis. Next stop where two big craters within Gauss. Driving the MRV along the crater, Charles collected several samples of ejecta before heading to the northern ridge of Gauss. In a small accident the MRV lost two wheels, but the two Kerbonauts where by now used to replace them. While one collected a few interesting samples of stone, the other one repaired the MRV wheels.\n\nOnce John and Charles started climbing the ridge of Gauss they realized, just as Val and Bob did on Odin XV, that the MRV suffers from low torque. Progress was painfully slow and they had to stop several times to reload the batteries. At mission control people were starting to get worried. Maybe they would have to shorten EVA3.\n\nWhen the MRV reached an altitude of 2000 meters above zero, it had only 35% fuel left in it\u0027s tank and it was using it up fast. The engineers at mission control became very worried while consulting their slide rules. The MEM was waiting for the Kerbonauts at an altitude of 5000 meters. EVA3 would have to be scrubbed, there would be not enough fuel left in the MRV.\n\nOnce John and Charles reached 3000 meters above zero, only 13% fuel remained. Mission control informed them that EVA3 would have to be scrubbed. Actually the engineers on the ground were not sure if the two kerbonauts could make it back to the MEM with the MRV.\n\nThe tough, little mun buggy carried the kerbonauts to 4081 meters before giving up. While the machine had held up admirably, mission morale was at a low point. John and Charles went through their collected samples and picked the most important ones before abbandoning the MRV six kilometers off the MEM. They activated their jetpacks and headed back.\n\nThey entered the MEM and sorted through their remaining samples before eating some snacks - hoping to ease the gloom.\n\n![Nk3HhOA.png](http://imgur.com/Nk3HhOA.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-30T17:22:33Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2015 05:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xeldrak**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharkman Briton","CreatedById":148040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T17:30:21Z","Content":"Woohoo!"},{"CreatedByName":"Xeldrak","CreatedById":57228,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T04:38:26Z","Content":"Sorry for keeping you guys waiting so long, but I don\u0027t have just as much free time on my hands as in the last few weeks.

Since the MRV had to be abbandoned the kerbonauts mobility was severely limited. But they came up with something and once the men on the mun had eaten their morning-snacks they donned their space suits and left the MEM.\n\nThey headed to Laplace by foot and collected a few samples on the ridge of the crater before activating their jetpacks. They jumped right across the crater to the southern one of the twin peaks. Once they had assembled ontop of the peak, John started to make pictures of the view while Charles collected samples.\n\nWithout the MRV they soon had to return to the MEM. Using their jetpacks they jumped back across the Laplace crater. After collecting a few further samples along the way they climbed back into the lander. Once safe inside the lander they stored the remaining samples, ate the last snacks and prepared the MEM for liftoff.\n\nThe MEM fired it\u0027s ascend engine once the preparations where completed and the CSM was in the righ position. After the circularization burn, a comparatively long burn was neccessary to match orbital planes. Due to their extended stay on the munar surface, John and Charles had drifted far out of the CSM plane.\n\nNonetheless about one hour after liftoff the ascend-stage approached the CSM and John docked the two spacecraft without any complications. Thomas opened the hatch to the MEM and welcomed John and Charles back on their spacecraft. The crew moved all samples and experiments from the MEM to the CM before jettisoning it and leaving it to crash into the munar surface.\n\nThere was just one more thing to do before leaving munar orbit. Thomas opened the CSM instrument bay and launched the subsatellite. The small, solar-cell clad satellite slowly drifted out of the CSM bay and into orbit. With this done the crew activated the SPS and once in the right position over the far side of the mun made the trans-kerbular injection.\n\nThe trip back to Kerbin was rather uneventfull. Thomas listened to John and Charles\u0027s stories from the munar surface while they had some snacks in the Odin capsule. Just enough time for a nap before they had to prepare for reentry.\n\nAbout 100 kilometers above Kerbin the crew jettisoned the service module before the dived into the atmosphere at 3200 m/s. Thanks to improved planing by the guys in mission controll the capsule didn\u0027t have to reenter over the dark side of Kerbin, as it had on Odin XV. Just a few minutes after being engulfed in a firery ball of plasma the parachutes deployed and the crew safely descended to the ocean below them.\n\n![XrfnFzu.png](http://i.imgur.com/XrfnFzu.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-30T17:23:21Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2015 05:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xeldrak**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharkman Briton","CreatedById":148040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T07:37:05Z","Content":"Reading it right now, but whats the MRV?\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nNever mind, it\u0027s the Munar Roving Vehicle \u003E.\u003C"},{"CreatedByName":"Xeldrak","CreatedById":57228,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T12:44:15Z","Content":"correct ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nOh, it\u0027s missing in the glossary.
