To land you need to match speed with the surface, or in other words, by the time you\u0027ve descended to the ground, you need to have come to a dead horizontal stop.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf the planet is spinning in the same direction as you are orbiting, you don\u0027t need to slow down that much - you still need some horizontal motion, enough to equal the speed of the surface\u0027s

rotation.\u00A0 However, sometimes it may not make that much of a difference, depending on the orbital/rotation characteristics of the body itself.\u00A0 For an example that a lot of players have discussed prior, is whether or not to enter into a prograde orbit around the Mun, or approach the Mun on a free-return trajectory, but requires entry into a retrograde orbit.\u00A0 In the specific case of the Mun, which has a rotational period the same as it\u0027s orbital period around Kerbin, the delta-V savings of landing prograde\u00A0is quite small.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can determine this by comparing your \u003Cem\u003EOrbit\u003C/em\u003E speed readout to your \u003Cem\u003ESurface\u003C/em\u003E speed readout.\u00A0 A 20km equatorial orbit around the Mun requires 544\u00A0m/s, but is 534\u00A0m/s across the surface of the Mun, meaning that the \u0022speed of the Mun\u0027s surface\u0022 in the direction of rotation is about 10 m/s.\u00A0 Now if you flip it around and compare the two speeds during a 20km retrograde orbit, the craft\u0027s orbital speed is the same, but the surface speed is 554\u00A0m/s.\u00A0 So in reality, choosing to land on the Mun from a prograde orbit versus a retrograde orbit only equates to 20 m/s difference of horizontal velocity that you need to cancel out from orbit to touchdown.\u00A0 If you have a ship or a probe that has such tight propellant margins that 20 m/s of delta-V is the difference between success or failure, I doubt many players could perform such a landing with consistent results given such a\u00A0margin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther planets/moons that have insignificant (less than 40m/s) prograde/retrograde \u0022speed differences\u0022\u00A0are Minmus, Moho, Gilly, Ike, Tylo, Bop, and\u00A0Pol.\u00A0 Due to either really low gravity, like Gilly or Minmus, or being tidally-locked with their parent planet, like Tylo.\u00A0 Even Dres is hardly worth mentioning with a difference of 55 m/s.\u00A0 These comparisons were done from low, circular equatorial orbits, but I doubt they would be much different from higher altitudes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-08T20:40:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022
