Limiting the parts we start with is a great way to force some creative thinking, as a lot of the sandbox designs we take for granted are literally impossible early on. It also helps grant a tangible sense of reward for completing a mission - instead of just some pretty screenshots, we can earn new parts to play with! That being said, there are some downsides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECareer Mode Downsides:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EToo much emphasis on grinding out science points instead of challenging yourself\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EExperimenting gets repetitive - not enough experiment types, not enough variety in how the experiments work.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMinimal guidance on what to do next\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENot much incentive to keep earning science once you have your favorite parts unlocked\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProposed Improvements:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERemove the whole \u0027redoing\u0027 of experiments. Experiments have value once and only once - no need to repeatedly grind the same experiment. Science values for experiments will probably need to be adjusted.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIncrease the variety of experiments available, using real-life science programs for inspiration. Slam a probe into the Mun, then fly another probe through the debris cloud for mineral analysis! Land a nuclear science-tank on Duna and search for rocks to laser apart so you can look at the pieces! Stick a kerbal in a space-station for six months just to see what happens!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EImplement science modules that have special requirements for how they are used. For example, some experiments require a kerbal on-site to be performed. Or perhaps certain experiments can only be performed while on an ice cap, or while floating in liquid.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EParts unlock as-normal, but can be upgraded by completing challenges. For example, your first successful Mun landing might grant certain engines an improved ISP in vacuum. Landing a probe on Eve could upgrade your aerospike engines, etc. The research lab would have a list of \u0022Unanswered Questions\u0022 - basically specific science goals that haven\u0027t been unlocked yet.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMake some planets/moons hazardous due to high temperature, high radiation, a corrosive atmosphere, or some combination thereof. Landing unprepared kerbals on these celestial bodies will result in a tragic mission failure. Landing probes lets you perform experiments, which in addition to the usual science rewards also unlock the special spacesuits needed for kerbals to survive these worlds.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-28T03:28:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThread moved to suggestions \u0026amp; feedback.

Sure, mission X gets more science than mission Y, but if mission Y has a better expense to science ratio, it might be more lucrative, or even necessary, depending on how tight your budget is. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for repeat science experiments, it sounds like the devs are already doing something like that. Personally, I don\u0027t think the science rewards need to be balanced too much for this, I\u0027ve been playing this way for weeks and have never run into \u0022I need more science to get to where I want to go next, oh woe is me!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-28T05:52:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll never understand the current complaints about grinding of science.

Science DONE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven without that, you don\u0027t need to repeat experiments until you\u0027re transmitting 0.1 science points in order to unlock stuff.
