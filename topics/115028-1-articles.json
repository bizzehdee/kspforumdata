I have 2 Ideas for ways to add a radar altimeter to the HUD UI.\n\nA radar altimeter is a pretty handy thing for me, as (most of?)the IVA views all have one somewhere, and it makes my occasional IVA landings possible and more reasonable. Still, the 3rd person views could use the radar altimeter.\n\n*Idea #1. When you click your current speed on the navball, you can select between \u0022Orbit\u0022, \u0022Surface\u0022, and occasionally \u0022Target\u0022 modes. I suggest that when in surface mode, the altimeter defaults to displaying the distance to surface height, instead of the \u0022sealevel\u0022 height.*\n\n*Idea #2. As stated above, you can click the navball speed window to change modes. When you click the altimeter numbers at the top of your screen, it would toggle sealevel or radar altimeter.*\n\nMy only problem with #2, is that moving the mouse up there might drop down the \u0022return to KSC\u0022 or the \u0022Recover vessel\u0022 buttons. It would be unfortunate for misclicks to result in accidents because of this feature.\n\nThere are various mods/plugins that add radar altimeters, this suggestion is for the stock game."},{"CreatedByName":"Merandix","CreatedById":135352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T11:27:18Z","Content":"Modular GUI! Just let me select what is on my screen, perhaps with keyboard short-cuts to toggle them. I\u0027d REALLY like to be able to bring up the radar altimeter in default outside view on demand. Because I do not really need it apart from landing."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T11:36:32Z","Content":"How about base it on the navball mode?\n\n- Orbit mode: Altimeter is height above \u0022sea level\u0022\n- Surface mode: Altimeter is distance to the ground (or liquid) between you and the center of the current SOI\n- Target mode: Altimeter is distance to your target\n\nAnd we could have a little light or indicator of some sort next to the number that indicates it\u0027s for that mode."},{"CreatedByName":"Merandix","CreatedById":135352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T11:48:20Z","Content":"Rather not because I\u0027d really like to have both visible simultaneously (helps in judging the bumpiness of the terrain below). Also, I really love my altimeter to function reliably, putting too many auto-toggling functions in there will likely only be annoying in my humble opinion. Our airspeed indicator switching automatically can be annoying in it\u0027s own right (flying up to your runway flag and it spontaneously changes to target mode is something to be aware of, or you\u0027d stall)."},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T12:38:58Z","Content":"Man, did we really start a thread about the same thing almost simultaneously? ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d like to have a laser range finder as a science part, that puts out readings like the resource surface scanner does.
