I know this has been asked before, and I\u0027m aware that there is a site I can go to to get the new MechJeb Mod. But the problem is I am an idiot with computers. I know how to install a mod, and thats about it. I just want to make sure that when I update MechJeb, all my existing flights with MechJeb parts won\u0027t get destroyed (this happened when I was trying to use Karbonite and I did some dumb stuff). Anyways, basically what I\u0027m asking is for some kind soul to take the time to tell me the steps I need to take to do this properly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks a ton!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MatterBeam","CreatedById":133334,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-27T03:01:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should not worry at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
