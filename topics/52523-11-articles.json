It launched first since it has a nuclear reactor (for electricity and propulsion out at Sentar distances where my Microwave Beamed Power network won\u0027t reach, and sunlight will be EXTREMELY weak, thanks to KSP-Interstellar\u0027s accurate implementation of an Inverse-Square Law for stellar radiation...) and two Microwave Beamed Power Deployable Transceivers- which allow it both to receive beamed power to help maneuver, and beam its excess power to other ships to help them get off the ground on Kerbin while itself sitting idle in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Sentar Mission Vehicle forms the heart of my Sentar Armada- its reactor will be beaming power to all the other ships for both electric/thermal propulsion (plasma engines and thermal rockets) and routine SAS/navigational use. It\u0027s an idea I\u0027d been playing with in my head for a while, and it\u0027ll be interesting to see how it works out for this mission. Though, at a peak of only 54 MW of beamed power it can transmit to other ships (for short periods of time, until its reactor starts running hot and power output declines), it won\u0027t exactly be the (comparable) walk in the park using the system that maneuvering near Kerbin has become...

Luckily, Extraplanetary Launchpads\u0027 ground-based launchpads work fine, even if its space-based ones are still buggy for anything more than small probes- so eventually I\u0027ll land a launchpad on the Munar surface and ferry the RocketParts from the Munar Spacedock to the ground-based launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, that will add greatly to the inefficiency of the whole process, as it will force all my rockets to interplanetary destinations to launch from the Mun before heading for their eventual destinations- adding greatly to rocket fuel and mass requirements.

Due to the phasing and altitudes of the orbits, it will have the next transfer window to Sentar (remember, the ideal Angle to Prograde of ejection was approximately 160 degrees- meaning the Seaplane is already a bit past its idealized ejection angle in an East/West direction, as well as past Periapsis- but it also has not yet reached its Ascending Node- the best angle to eject with respect to the North/South component of its inclined orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, it makes the most sense to eject this module first- as it lacks any Microwave Transceivers (it is equipped with smaller Receiver dishes) that could be used to relay power from the KSC to the other mission components for their ejection burns while still in Kerbin orbit...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PFi1pjO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PFi1pjO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, for those of you wondering- I still haven\u0027t decided what to do with the Sentar Mission Vehicle Mk1.
