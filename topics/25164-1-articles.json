Once you\u0027re at about 13km the atmosphere significantly starts to thin out and you should be starting your gravity turn if you haven\u0027t already. Once the gravity turn has been performed, small SRBs may help if you want to throttle back on your main engines to conserve fuel for orbital maneuvers. The problem with doing that though is that they will sort of hinder you as you need gimballing engines to finish your turn since aero control surfaces will be less than useful, and RCS is kind of wasted on anything except translation.
