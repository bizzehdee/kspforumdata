For some reason, no parts explode or considerably heat up even at a 90 degrees 3000m/s reentry without heatshield, not even science parts or other things with low temperature tolerance, and not even to mention something like capsules. Heatshields do not lose more than 10-40 ablator units, even at extremely steep reentry angles and high reentry speeds. At first I thought this is normal, but then there\u0027s a friend of mine telling me about his reentry problems and how everything always explodes in his games, so could my problem possibly be a bug? I have already set the heating to 120 percent, reinstalled KSP and started a new world, but it didn\u0027t change anything. What should I do?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T13:22:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I have gathered (I haven\u0027t played a lot of 1.0.2 cuz I need my mods, ALL OF THEM ^^) they tuned down reentry heating so far because players started crying when their ships burnt up and they didn\u0027t want to relearn what is an essential part of flying.

I\u0027m experiencing the same thing. Either it\u0027s as TheXRuler suggested, that Squad turned down reentry heating, or it\u0027s a bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m playing 1.0.2 on Hard. It\u0027s a clean install \u002B RemoteTech2 and Kerbal Alarm Clock. I haven\u0027t fiddled with any of my settings, although I DID turn down aero graphics fx and other graphics settings so my computer would run a little faster. Don\u0027t know if that was it, but I assume that the graphics settings shouldn\u0027t be affecting the gameplay mechanics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had 25\u002B ships reentries so far in this new install, and I think I\u0027ve lost a grand total of one part to reentry heating. I haven\u0027t used heatshields on anything because, well, why use them if nothing is exploding? I just point my ship prograde (usually have a parachute or something at the tip) and let it reenter. A lot of the external components will heat up, some even getting close to the tops of their heating bars. But very rarely do they explode before my ship has decelerated to a safe speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sky_walker","CreatedById":113214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T14:36:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep.
