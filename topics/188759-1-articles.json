way everyone overlooks the growing of food.\u00A0 I have a fairly well rounded background in agriculture, and I have spent a lot of time learning about the complex symbioses that a lot of plants depend on to survive.\u00A0 I know that NASA has been growing salad greens and some types of wheat in a very small experimental area on the ISS, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s enough to get a good picture of what agriculture will look like on space colonies.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all, any system that has colonists reliant on it for sustenance must be 99% sustainable at a minimum.\u00A0 NASA\u0027s experiments have been very closely monitored with sensors giving real-time data on all sorts of parameters to a team back on Earth, and the most they\u0027ve gotten out of it is a few salads.\u00A0 For a serious system, it has to be somewhat robust, and able to handle some shocks and variation to conditions.\u00A0 It also needs to be able to reprocess all the wastewater produced by the colonists in a safe and efficient manner.\u00A0 These things are very possible to achieve, but they do present some challenges.\u00A0 Growing food is maybe one of the easier ones to handle.\u00A0 The most logical solution, in my mind, is aquaponics.\u00A0 Aquaponics is like hydroponics, but with fish.\u00A0 Turns out that fish poop has pretty much everything plants need to grow, and the plants are great at filtering the water for the fish.\u00A0 This means you only have to figure out how to feed the fish.\u00A0 Initially, formulating food for the fish might require some supplemental nutrients, but over time, it should be possible to stabilize the intake/output of the various micro-nutrients in the system.\u00A0 Probably the best species of fish to use is Blue Nile Tilapia, a fast growing breed used around the world in commercial fish farms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other challenge to the system is processing the human poop.\u00A0 If composted properly, human waste makes a fantastic fertilizer for plants, but it is illegal to use human waste for growing food crops in the US.\u00A0 This is due to the possibility of spreading disease via unwashed vegetables.\u00A0 This can be avoided in our application, since we aren\u0027t growing our plants in soil.\u00A0 We can, however, reduce the possibility of spreading disease by using human waste to grow things like cereal grains and even fruit trees.\u00A0 The cereal grains can be used to formulate food for the fish, as well as for things like bread or beer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously, setting up a self-sufficient system like this will require a large enough population to support it, but the advantages are many.\u00A0 Fore one, you won\u0027t have to have carbon scrubbers, since the plants will easily take care of that.\u00A0 Another aspect is the psychological benefits of having green things growing about the base.\u00A0 One of the largest challenges, however, will be maintaining healthy populations of bacteria in the system.\u00A0 Here on Earth, bacteria do a lot of the work in the treatment of wastewater, and in converting waste from both fish and humans into nutrients plants can use.\u00A0 These bacteria are everywhere on Earth, and can be relied on to just show up and start growing where conditions are favorable, but on an off world base, we\u0027ll have to bring our own.\u00A0 This could be extremely challenging, due to the high radiation environment in space, and any system on a moon or Mars base will have to be buried deep underground to protect it from radiation.\u00A0 There is also the potential issue of symbiotic organisms that are present here on Earth, that could affect how various plants in the system grow, or don\u0027t grow.\u00A0 It is also likely that we will have to introduce some species of insects into the ecosystem to pollinate plants for us.\u00A0 We might also bring earthworms and other species that help decomposition, so we can compost things like food scraps, plant fibers, and solids that settle out of the various wastewater systems.\u00A0 Worms would make great food for the fish, and they are excellent at breaking down fibrous materials.\u00A0 As you can see, the biodiversity of a sustainable life support system is immense and complex, and certainly not possible in a sterile space station.\u00A0 Sure, you could grow only certain plants and feed them with chemical fertilizer, but this would be very difficult to make self-sufficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnywho,

everything from lettuce and spinach, to things like ginger and sweet potatoes, and everything in between.\u00A0 You could easily incorporate things like chickens and rabbits into the system for eggs and meat (rabbits are one of the most feed efficient sources of meat, as well as having almost entirely fat free meat).\u00A0 With a large enough colony, you could incorporate goats into the system for milk, and start making things like cheese and yogurt.\u00A0 Any crop you can grow here on earth, you could grow in a fairly simple space farm.\u00A0 In fact, I would hazard a guess that in a hundred years, life expectancy will be higher on Moon and Mars colonies simply due to a better diet and cleaner air, as well as possibly reduced radiation exposure, since we\u0027ll be building mostly under ground, and Earth has had a few nuclear accidents that have done a great job of distributing radioactive materials throughout the

Sure it could be done but we\u0027re talking about places that are far away (in the case of Mars, this is true both in terms of distance and energy, but mostly true just in the case of energy for the Moon - but it has low gravity which could be problematic). Similar to how Antarctica isn\u0027t inhabited, I doubt the Moon and Mars will be anytime soon. It will probably happen eventually (and who knows? maybe Musk\u0027s crusade to colonize Mars will actually bear fruit...) but likely after some time. Research facilities will likely be established - but orbital settlements are so advantageous that planets and moons look pretty lackluster in comparison. The biggest advantage is probably ease. If we were to do an analysis of settlements on the Moon, Mars, and in orbital space (specifically Equatorial Low Earth Orbit (or ELEO) for now, but eventually we might be able to dispel the Van Allen radiation belts - freeing up a lot more orbital real estate...) we would likely find that the mass requirements for a given population size are pretty close - this is because the Moon and Mars settlements can use local regolith as radiation protection and the radiation doses in ELEO are actually pretty mild - as well as life support mass likely scaling with population more directly than other factors. However - the energy and logistical requirements requirements would be far different. The largest object ever landed on Mars is about 1 tonne (Curiosity). The largest on the Moon is about 15 tonnes (Apollo LM). But the largest in LEO? Over 400 tonnes (ISS). Of course SpaceX might be able to change the game a bit but it seems like it\u0027d be far easier to build a settlement in ELEO than anywhere else. Eventually the industry for building settlements can mature and extraterrestrial resources can be acquired to provide shielding (provided some kind of powered shielding method isn\u0027t developed - there are some ideas for this), expanding the locales where settlements can be built.
