My data has elevations, but I\u0027m finding that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/Kopernicus does not really match elevations very well, sometimes it is off by 1000s of meters.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Can I use Cartographer to generate a height map of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E-Earth as it exists in game?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Does it work with Kopernicus planets?\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Assuming I can have it generate a height map, what are the limits of resolution? I\u0027m thinking I should go to 0.01 degrees/pixel.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Again, assuming I can export a height map, can I control the extents? That is: have the longitude axis go from -180 to \u002B180, with the prime meridian right in the middle, or it like kopernicus where the map goes from -270 to \u002B90 (with -90 in the middle).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks for your help\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
