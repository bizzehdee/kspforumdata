In the past a few people have, on occasion, commented on the fact that it\u0027s (comparitively) easy to launch the pad itself and get things running. Yes, getting things self sufficient is hard, shipping up the smelter, parts factory etc, but the pad itself is fairly light weight, and the new one is even fairly small packed. Is it realistic for a small ship to send a construction facility that can build ANYTHING in KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, leaving aside how to limit such small, portable construction facilities, I think a larger, base-like system could be the way to go. However, how to ship something up to another planet when you\u0027re trying to make it seem like a base rather than a ship component. Making it too heavy to mount on a ship stops it from being used... mostly. There\u0027ll always be people who can strap enough boosters on to make ANYTHING fly, but you know what I mean. This of course means you can\u0027t lift the base. So, the old tactic of taking a base and splitting it into dockable sections. Send them up separately and dock them after landing on a planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, docking on planetary surface. I tried doing this a very long time ago, using sideways docking ports and either landing legs or undercarraige to lift a rover up so the ports would mate. I gave up on this approach, instead trying Damned robotics (this was before Infernal robotics came out)... anyway, more recently I saw that Brotoro had done something similar to my old method, but he\u0027d got it to work by having vertical docking ports instead of horizontal ones. Thus since then I\u0027ve been redoing my old method with upgrades and had quite a bit of success. No KAS required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, plan is a central base \u0027hub\u0027 with extendable support legs to stop it tipping sideways (see why in a moment). This hub has four arms spread out between the legs, and on the end of each arm is the equivalent of a senior docking port facing down. This hub (and all the parts docking to it) should be heavy, probably larger than an orange fuel tank. This makes it quite a challenge to design a rocket to take it off planet, but not insurmountable. The hub has docking ports and the launch pad itself, but none of the support gear. Docking to this are four modules. Two of these are just storage containers (one for liquids, one for solids), and the other two are processing centers (again, one for liquids and one for solids). Since even the modules will be heavy (perhaps not so heavy for the two storage units when they are empty of materials) even they will need quite a bit to haul it up into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe modules have standard wheels but I think they\u0027d have to be welded on to the model to make sure the height is right. Similarly they also have undercarraige wheels welded on. These lift the module up when it\u0027s in position to dock. A bumper in the hub stops the module when it\u0027s at the right distance in so as long as the drive in is lined up right it should dock fine. The port should be sturdy enough to hold the module completely so it can retract it\u0027s undercarraige after docking. On my ships using the vertical dock technique I\u0027ve noticed that when the ship loads physics if there is any difference between the ground heights between different parts that are docked together, the wheels bounce them. Most of the time this isn\u0027t an issue, but if the modules hang from the central hub it won\u0027t be an issue at all. This is why it needs the long support legs. If you dock one module on one side it would throw the center of mass off and tip it over. With the legs this long the center of mass would still be inside the stability square of the legs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, now I\u0027ve bored you with tons of words, try pictures! OK, it\u0027s just a rough scribble and I know the different types of module will look different in the end, but it gives you an idea of what I\u0027m thinking of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Construction%20Hub.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Construction Hub.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone think this is a viable possibility for ELP? If so the current models (or replacements) would be slow, underpowered parts for mobile factories/processors. The heavy stuff would do things better for a central hub/base. I\u0027m not sure how you could restrict such mobile devices to make a significant difference between the two types of construction equipment without making it really annoying to use the mobile stuff. Maybe limit them to certain Techlevels? Maybe only nodes two or three below what you\u0027ve currently researched?

Thanks for the responce. I didnt mean i want things to be easier. I love the idea of having to struggle to get these parts into orbit. And more resources required and time to construct is also a really good path to take. I had an idea of making combined resources like mineral rich rock, mineral poor rock, lavarock etc that output different resources and ratios in the kethane converter module. For something like a simplified version of eve onlines ship and component construction. One could also seperate the build requirements to each part on the ship but i fear that would require lots and lots of manual configs on your part unless you just use a scalar system with mass calculation etc like missioncontroller does. I already have made working configs for an expanded fuel resource mining system(made from the chart squad published a while ago) for kethane with overlay colors and all and with opensource container models made by zzz with retextures i made(also for ore/metal/rocketparts). if you are interested in trying it out i can send it to you in a pm perhaps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn regards to the models its mainly the estetics that could use some work.

I mean the parts need to at least be relatively close to those in KSP to be sensible. As an extreme example, the Hooligan Labs airstrip for your mod is just plain silly in it\u0027s physical dimensions, and breaks ones sense of disbelief during play. It\u0027s the mass that counts anyway, right? A steel furnace lined with brick isn\u0027t going to be light, no matter how it\u0027s shaped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for Aeon\u0027s furnace, those power requirements, while possibly realistic, aren\u0027t very playable. Of course I play with the \u0027near future\u0027 mod as well, so I could just use a nuke reactor or three to power that baby. But seriously, the ancient Chinese were using blast furnaces, without the requirement for all those solar panels. Perhaps instead of using pure electrical power for some sort of arc furnace mathematics, use fuel and oxidizer as well? I mean what more do you need for a blast furnace afterall? Just a big rocket engine in a container to melt and separate the ore from slag? Then we\u0027d need a supply of fuel and oxidizer as well, which either needs to be mined or flown up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if you make the items massive, once it\u0027s up, it\u0027s up. It\u0027s really just a one time issue to get the basic items into space no matter how heavy they are. Currently all you need to get up into space is a launch pad and a container of rocket parts and build everything you need on site. It\u0027s getting the resources up there that\u0027s the continual challenge, which is why I didn\u0027t feel too put out about adding the conversions and drilling directly to the kethane items. It\u0027s also easy enough to make them weigh more, or consume more energy to do the work, or make the drills extract at a much slower rate, all of which I will probably do as I balance game play with my dirty kethane hack. The hack is also just an interim fix. I think the continuing difficulty from the need to find or transport resources offsets the fact that I don\u0027t need to transport a bunch of large clunky items up into space. If you add in the need for fuels as well as ore for the refining process, you\u0027ve created more difficulty too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as creating my own models, I\u0027d love to, but that\u0027s the problem...I suck. It\u0027s not that I can\u0027t learn, it\u0027s that they\u0027d end up looking horrible! Hah. Gotta know your limitations! Believe me, if I could make decent models and textures, I would and I\u0027d post them all over this forum. I\u0027m competent enough to modify other\u0027s work, but that\u0027s about it. Making your recycle bin grey for example was within my limits. Hah. As I think I stated, I was already in the process of stealing models from other mods (I had actually converted a small and large fuel to electricity generator I found in an older mod pack to replace your smelters) and converting the kethane drills to replace the augers when I hit on the idea of why bother when kethane already has the stuff I need. Change the kethane configs and I\u0027m done. On top of that I can\u0027t really share out models and configs I stole from other mods :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour work is greatly appreciated too, if us complainers don\u0027t make it obvious sometimes. If all people have to complain about is how something looks (now that things exploding on the launch pad has been fixed up! Hehe!) in your mod, you\u0027re doing a pretty good job.
