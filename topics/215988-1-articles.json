Again, 2X as many at 1/2 the price? Seems like there is not actually demand for that. Even if there was, and even if there was $40B to be made in total, a decent % is not available to all providers, some will be necessarily attached to national launchers. In addition, $40B is chump change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApple made $394B in 2022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAmazon generated revenue of $356B in 2022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTesla had $81B in revenue in 2022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo by 2030 they project the total world launch revenue as equal to 5 weeks of 2022 Apple, 6 weeks of 2022 Amazon, or 6 months of 2022 tesla.

I think that launch quadrupling seems unlikely\u2014and even if it does it\u0027s not a great business compared to just those 3 examples above unless there is a real shift in what can generate customers for spaceflight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI honestly think that for a company set on launch to space as it\u0027s\u003Cem\u003E raison d\u0027\u00EAtre\u003C/em\u003E, the killer app would be tourism.
