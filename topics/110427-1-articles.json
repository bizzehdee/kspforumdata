To really eliminate it, the way resources flow would need to be reworked, which I suspect is unlikely to happen. Your best bet is to alternate the placement of intakes/engines. Intake, engine...intake, engine...etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side note, asymmetric flameout is a thing on realy high performance airplanes. Some airplanes (like the F-15) have a system that detects when one engine has a problem, and automatically adjusts the other.
