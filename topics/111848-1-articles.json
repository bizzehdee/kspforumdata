There could also be a \u0022keep relative target prograde\u0022, or something.\n\nIn addition it would be great if they worked on unfocused vessels too. Imagine mid-air refuelling or atmospheric docking with something like this."},{"CreatedByName":"Kaos","CreatedById":110849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T22:32:06Z","Content":"I also have thought about this one. Perhaps it could even be a little more complicated: Give a maximal speed at the surface and an additional speed per 1000 meters. Lets say we pick 4 m/s as maximal surface speed and 20 m/s per 1000 meter. In a flight height of 2000 m we would limit the speed to 44 m/s and have a soft slowdown on the ascending."},{"CreatedByName":"Bug_","CreatedById":140851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T01:45:07Z","Content":"I\u0027d be happy with just a \u0022fine\u0022 knob to go along with the \u0022coarse\u0022 knob that is the shift/ctrl key for the throttle.
