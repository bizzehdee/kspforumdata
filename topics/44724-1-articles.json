I have a mother ship that uses a quad adapter to have 4 Atomic engines attached to a large fuel tank. In order to get it into orbit, I attached fuel tanks beneath the engines with 4 decouplers and an inverted quad adapter below it. When I had to jettison the fairings for the atomic engines, all four engines detached from the ship. I suspect that the fairings are to blame. Is there a way I can fix this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheDarkStar","CreatedById":37056,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T17:30:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPut docking ports underneath instead of decouplers, or put the engines to the side.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jaredkzr","CreatedById":73023,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T17:30:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried to do this as well.
