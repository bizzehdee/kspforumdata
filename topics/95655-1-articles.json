I\u0027ve been playing Kerbal since 0.23 and had a load of fun on it since. When I discovered KSP it was just what I had been looking for in a Space sim after years of playing Orbiter I wanted something more creative, I\u0027m sure your stories are very similar. I\u0027ve had a blog for a while where I posted quite a few photos of my previous exploits, but I haven\u0027t updated it in a while.
