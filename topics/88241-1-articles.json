For simplicity, to not invent a whole new UI, it would be just enough to generate a 10-digit alphanumeric hash (like on youtube, aBcD0123eFg, maybe with a prefix like a hashtag: #kspcrft123bnXtD, #kspsv123bnXtD), and copy it to system clipboard, and be able to paste it from a clipboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m aware that easy reading files from internet may lead someone to find and exploit a buffer overflow error.
