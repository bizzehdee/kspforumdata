If you are adding multiple fuel types to the game, but still want to keep some of the simplicity KSP1 had with it\u0027s fuels and engines, an all round fuel type for most legacy engines does seem like the best choice to go for. While it\u0027s not perfect, methalox does fit the best with what KSP1\u0027s liquid fuel can do, which, let\u0027s be honest, is essentially magic powder. What fuel in exsistence can power conventional rocket engines (some that don\u0027t even take the same fuel), jet engines, a nuclear powered engine, vernor engines, and could be found and extracted from any celestial body in the solar system? Not even methalox fits all these, but it\u0027s still the best fit for what they\u0027re looking for. And while it would have been nice to have a little more variety in fuels than just methalox and hydrolox, that\u0027s something that can easily be fixed by mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the change in the Mammoth engine, first of all RIP, but this change makes sense when you think about it. What is Mammoth 1 but 4 swivels taped together? That\u0027s not that hard to recreate on our own, especially if they give us some kind of adapter for it. Heck, this would be like if instead of having an adaptor tank for the Mastodons in the making history DLC, they had made something like Mammoth 1 and put all 5 Mastodon engines into one clustered engine. Then for KSP 2 they just replaced that with a single big engine and had the adapter for the 5 engines like we do now. Not really much different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Also, just would like to point out, a real life Mastodon is considered a smaller variant of a Mammoth, so having the Mastodon engine be the F-1 and the new Mammoth being the F-1B I think is a genius move on their part)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-17T07:49:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLots of opinions here to unpack!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe have to walk a fairly fine tightrope when choosing to represent the complex reality of real rocketry. For a lot of historical space applications, a specific need was often defined (go to the moon), which drove the selection and development of all components of the spacecraft, including choice of fuel(s) and development of the engines (from scratch, from a study, or upgraded from a previous vehicle). With KSP, we\u0027re kinda working backwards - we get to make guesses like \u0022here are the missions we think a player will want to do\u0022 and strive to provide a set of engine options that let them do that. That\u0027s a pretty big space - players want launch engines, space engines, efficient engines and such for their missions. Filling that need for even a single fuel type requires a \u003Cstrong\u003Elot \u003C/strong\u003Eof engine parts. There\u0027s 20 in KSP1 and there\u0027s sill frustrating gaps to me. I do like playing Engine Selection Simulator myself, but providing enough options for player flexiblity with several liquid fuel types causes the number of engines to go up fast. I should know, I made at least one KSP1 mod for that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApproachability in this space is a huge problem too. New players end up with a lot of confusion over parsing through even the basic set of engines. More engines that use different fuels create more approachability challenges, particularly when trying to match them with their fuels and understand when to and when not to use them. That\u0027s a teaching challenge we have to bite off with our later, fancier engines, but there we have the advantage of being able to use fairly unique models and well-defined, different performance envelopes to do that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll this is why we are effectively sticking with a single liquid bipropellant engine resource, at least at the beginning of Early Access. There\u0027s a long road ahead of us though, and room for a lot more things! Of course - like Nate indicated, you will see hydrogen for use in nuclear engines at EA launch as a new fuel as well as the old standards like Xenon.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s lots of good discussion about methane as a base fuel in this thread, with some strong pros and cons. I\u0027m always encouraged to see that these matched our internal design debates and I believe that we\u0027ve made the right choice. Think of it as Kerbals taking a slightly different technical path to rocketry than humans. To quickly reiterate, we\u0027re not rebalancing our engines to be considerably different just because they use methalox or anything - you\u0027ll see craft with the same engines behave more or less the same in KSP1.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll the above being said I immediately expect modders to do what modders do, and show up very quickly with mods that add, for example, the 150-odd resources in the Community Resource Pack into KSP2.
