A local control point is defined as a spacecraft that has a remote control capable probe core (currently only the 1.25m and 2.5m models have this feature) as well as a crewed command pod (not crew cabin) that contains a pilot Kerbal (as in, of the pilot profession, not just any Kerbal tasked to sit in the pilot\u0027s seat).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think \u0022a pilot\u0022 is enough. I have an extremely fuzzy memory about a discussion mentioning two pilot Kerbals (one for the ship and one for the remote control), but I completely forgot if that was stated as being required, or mulled around as \u0022should be required\u0022 or the like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso note: be careful with your terminology. You say \u0022Kerbnet\u0022, but I think you might mean \u0022Commnet\u0022. Kerbnet is the built-in functionality of probe cores to visualize a planet\u0027s surface from orbit and set waypoints on it. Commnet is the communications network infrastructure feature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy answer above assumes you literally meant Kerbnet. If you meant Commnet, a local control point will absolutely, definitely work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, having an appropriate relay antenna on your crewed pod definitely works for both Kerbnet and Commnet, too (without requiring a local control point). In that case, your small probes could use your crewed pod as an intermediary step in order to reach back to Kerbin. Since your pod can talk to Kerbin but the probes aren\u0027t using it as a relay, that means the antenna you brought is a direct antenna. These are lighter, researched earlier in the tech tree and use less power than relay antennas, but they cannot, well, relay anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: You can find out if antennas are relay capable, and if probe cores are remote control capable, by looking at the detailed stats popup of the part(s) in the editor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-21T20:44:03Z\u0022 title=\u002210/21/2016 08:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-21T21:58:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think a local control point is supposed to be enough, either.
