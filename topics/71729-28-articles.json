The short version is that the GPS signal is below the noise floor. Rather than detecting the signal itself, the receiver detects the signal\u0027s effect on the randomness of the background noise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Longer version:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E As a crude example, say the background noise floor is a series of coin flips.

We expect the results to flip heads to tails or vice-versa at regular intervals and we compare how accurately the changes track with each of our satellite\u0027s unique fingerprint (the PRN code).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E When we get an exact match, we know which satellite we have and we know that it\u0027s telling us a data \u00221\u0022. If our result is exactly wrong, OTOH, we know that it\u0027s the same satellite, but it\u0027s sending us a data \u00220\u0022 because the satellite sends zeroes by inverting it\u0027s PRN code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E That\u0027s the gist of how the receiver works.
