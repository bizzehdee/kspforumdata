I think what happened was the docking port attached to the lander wasn\u0027t \u0022seated\u0022 in a way that KSP recognized as allowing fuel flow (or it didn\u0027t know where to route the fuel) because it\u0027s tilted at 10~15deg. Adding a fuel line from the inner docking port to the lander hull allowed me to shut off the outer docking port and cut off the fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
