I tested this design on Kerbin, and it worked fine. The idea was to use the lander legs to push the docking port up to a uniform height for surface docking in the standard way. So, I designed the legs to reach down lower than the wheels as in this picture in the VAB. You can see that the feet are a good distance lower than the wheels:\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi59.tinypic.com/jglaxg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jglaxg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Kerbin this design tested fine, presumably because the weight of the craft pushed the wheels higher in relation to the legs, but on Minmus, this happened:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi58.tinypic.com/207ujwk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022207ujwk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, my extended legs are now floating very far above the wheels, completely ruining the design. This won\u0027t dock with anything on the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is actually not the only problem. I\u0027m not sure why, perhaps because I designed this in the VAB instead of the SPH, the wheels on opposite sides from each other rotate opposite from each other, making it uncontrollable. (\u0026lt;-- Not sure about this actually, might just be uneven traction on Minmus.)This confuses me because everything was fine on Kerbin. I think the problem has something to do with the fact that before landing on Minmus, I had docked to another ship to transfer some excess fuel. I think the docking somehow messed up the orientation of the wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way I can salvage this craft without spending my last dime on a do-over?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T22:17:02Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 10:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cephalo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T22:03:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I am not mistaken, wheels in the VAB are shown with their suspension in the \u0022stowed\u0022 position.
