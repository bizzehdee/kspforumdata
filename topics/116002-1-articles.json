In real life, orbit determination is not a trivial task. Long range missions require very precise equipment (see Deep Space Network) and near-earth orbits can use a combination of either ground stations or GPS. Astronomical objects like planets, comets, or asteroids can be OD\u0027d using ground stations or space based observatories. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bottom line is that you need to determine a range from either radar ranging or parallax measurements (parallax is the difference in position observed between two concurrent measurements, which is how 3D imaging works). You also need a relative orientation, which can be determined by knowing the location of a ground station on the surface of the earth, or using the relative positions of astronomical bodies such as the sun or Polaris (the north star). Other methods include magetometry (measuring magnetic north using a digital compass) or integration of IMU output.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KAO\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KAO\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECorrect me if I\u0027m wrong here, but in the very beginning, they did indeed have difficulties and uncertainties regarding orbital speed.
