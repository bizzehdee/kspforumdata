But what about REAL spacecraft in REAL space? Especially in the \u0027early days\u0027.\n\nThey can calculate what velocity they NEED to achieve an orbit at any given altitude, but how do they know how fast they are ACTUALLY going? And when a stable orbit is achieved? There is no atmosphere to get an \u0027air speed\u0027 reading and obviously a car speedo won\u0027t work. What do they use as a frame of reference to get a \u0027reading\u0027 and how accurate is it? How did they do it in the 1960s? \n\nI know some of you guys and girls out there will have some knowledge about such things, so please enlighten me a little if you can. In the meantime I will try Google to see if that sheds any light.\n\nCheers.\n\nPandaman"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T22:14:57Z","Content":"\\* Ground stations\u0027 radar\n\n\\* Inertial guidance (you know how fast you\u0027re going at the start, you have accelerometers to track all the forces applied sans gravity)\n\n\\* Alignment based on reference points (horizon, fixed-stars, etc)"},{"CreatedByName":"KAO","CreatedById":30795,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T22:22:49Z","Content":"Correct me if I\u0027m wrong here, but in the very beginning, they did indeed have difficulties and uncertainties regarding orbital speed.

In real life, orbit determination is not a trivial task. Long range missions require very precise equipment (see Deep Space Network) and near-earth orbits can use a combination of either ground stations or GPS. Astronomical objects like planets, comets, or asteroids can be OD\u0027d using ground stations or space based observatories. \n\nThe bottom line is that you need to determine a range from either radar ranging or parallax measurements (parallax is the difference in position observed between two concurrent measurements, which is how 3D imaging works). You also need a relative orientation, which can be determined by knowing the location of a ground station on the surface of the earth, or using the relative positions of astronomical bodies such as the sun or Polaris (the north star). Other methods include magetometry (measuring magnetic north using a digital compass) or integration of IMU output.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Correct me if I\u0027m wrong here, but in the very beginning, they did indeed have difficulties and uncertainties regarding orbital speed.
