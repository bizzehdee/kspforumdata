The pilot was sitting in the main orbiters\u0027s can, and the co-pilot inside the manned lander module. After completing the rendez-vous with the refuelling orbiter, a small design oversight was noticed -- the engineers had blocked the manned lander\u0027s door by placing four spherical RCS tanks around the lander\u0027s tank instead of two. The Junior inside would be able to get out, but it would have been impossible to reenter the can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith an orange tank and half of fuel loaded in, KSC decided the whole contraption was spaceworthy enough, and allowed the test to be extended for as far as it could run before safely returning to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat the poor Junior-in-a-can couldn\u0027t suspect was the dummy ship would end doing a Grand Tour, visiting Mun, Duna, Jool and all its moons before heading back home.

Junior had to sit there trapped in the can for the whole trip, fiddling his thumbs for years while the captain did all the work.
