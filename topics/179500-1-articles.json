I would like to take this concept to a new, different mode of game play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve thought about Terra-Formed versions of the stock system for a while, complete with cities and towns, and with various contracts for these locations.\u00A0 Kerbal Kostructs would be used for the cities, with Kopernicus edits of the stock worlds would be used to tweak atmospheres and add oceans where needed. Everything would be balanced for career mode play, such as science rewards. Science performed in/near a city on Duna would be very little, whilst science collected in a remote area would be of a higher reward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe starting worlds that would be modified would be the Mun, Duna, and Laythe. The Mun would not have an atmosphere, however, it would have three or four extensive colonies, with landing pads and such. Duna would be something similar to how Mars is portrayed in Cowboy Bebop, with the midland sea containing an actual sea, along with two or three major cities. Laythe would be similar to Kerbin, with scattered cities along the shorelines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is just a loose concept, but I would like opinions on what everyone thinks, and suggestions are greatly appreciated!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
