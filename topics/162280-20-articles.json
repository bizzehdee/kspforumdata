Save for a short, thick beard trimmed precisely to a point, he wore it close-shorn to his scalp, so as to neither distract him in battle nor bring the scourge of lice. A red scar ran down one cheek, still not quite healed. He would forever remember the desperate face of the young kerb who delivered it, moments before he cleaved the boy\u2019s head from his shoulders.

His keen, narrowed eyes did not need a glass to spy the last few specks straggling out of the southern gate, yet some leagues distant. At last, at long last, the prize was within his grasp. Arstotzka. The shining City on the Hill, the paradox that was both beacon and bane. Never, for thousands of years, since the time of the Roamin\u0027s and before, had any force breached those mystic walls.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Emperor might have smiled, now, if he were one taken to smiling. Behind him, an entire legion of Imperial Guard stood ready, their breastplates spotlessly clean yet bearing the many scars of this long campaign. They hung in pairs from massive war-horses, each beast clad in heavy, angled steel plate that could turn aside massed pikes like willow branches. Once a formation was so pierced, the riders would strike at the very heart with their killing sticks. Halberds. Weapons yet unknown in this part of the world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe might have smiled, for the brigades of mounted archers wielding bows that could send arrows as long as a kerb is tall hundreds of spans afield, knocking riders from their mounts and tearing plate armor like cloth. He might have smiled, for the endless corps of infantry fed, armed, and trained by his own coin, bringing discipline unseen since Roamin\u0027 times. He might have smiled, for the cadres of engineers who even now felled every tree in sight to build siege towers, battering rams, and trebuchets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut mostly, he might have smiled for the secrets brought from a continent away. What had been mere parlor tricks in Gytep, he had made into the most frightful weapons the world would ever know. First, the \u003Cem\u003Egonne\u003C/em\u003E.

Melted with saltpeter and cast in hammered copper tubes as big as tree trunks, the sugar would unleash fire and smoke as if the very bowels of the Ninth Hell itself had been opened, launching the tube like a spear across hundreds of spans. The Dragons would drive their hardened steel tips deep into the thickest walls, and ignite a foul mixture of lamp oil, spirit of niter from rotted grain, and the essence of fermented night soil, to rend stone from stone and tear it down.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach one was worth a king\u0027s ransom.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIvan, the First of his name, had ransomed \u003Cem\u003Emany\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0kings.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToday, he would have victory, yet still he would not smile.

Hair, long yet sparse, clung to the sides of his head, trailing out in the breeze and occasionally revealing a stubborn bit of red still hiding among the white. His face was smooth, clean-shaven save for a line of white billowing white along his jaw that matched his head, and despite his purported age, the Emperor found could put no age to that face. It wore the hint of an amused little smile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the beast beside \u003Cem\u003Ehim\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0must be the daughter. Tales of her beauty had traveled far and wide, and Ivan now saw that every one was a lie. He thought that not even a thousand poets composing for a thousand years could find the words to do this one justice. Her face, unlike \u003Cem\u003Ehis\u003C/em\u003E, bore the cast of misery itself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd following behind her, just to the side... the Emperor saw this was no kerb but Death upon a saddle. This one wore a cloak that billowed in the wind, which seemed to make even the Emperor\u0027s hard eyes loose focus and drop away, as if it resisted being looked at. He wore no obvious weapon, only carrying a gnarled wooden staff, but for one such as this, that made no matter. His face might have been carved from stone.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe trio paused a short way off, before dismounting their strange beasts and approaching on foot.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIvan, son of Vlad, raised a hand in greeting as they did, \u003Cem\u003E\u0022Calichniye, Jebediah al\u0027Jedediah, Tamyrlin an Arstotzka!\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHail, Jebediah, son of Jedediah, Tamyrlin of Arstotzka!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe one with the funny little smile stopped a few paces off, and raised his own hand, \u0022hail, Ivan Kinslayer. Have ye come t\u0027slay me and mah kin, too?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Lord Marshal bristled at the insult in his own tongue, and everywhere within earshot hands reached for swords or staffs or nocks, but once more the Emperor stayed them with a simple finger. For a time, there was no sound but the distant whistling of the wind in the trees.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You would to well to keep your tongue on a shorter leash, Lord Tamyrlin,\u0022 Ivan\u0027s voice was like the grating of pebbles before a landslide, \u0022no blood need be spilt here this day. Or any other.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Tamyrlin seemed to consider this for a moment, his amused smile fading into a slight frown before rebounding, \u0022indeed. Why don\u0027t ye come down from there, and let us speak as simple folk, as \u003Cem\u003Emenh\u003C/em\u003E, like the old ones say?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce more hands found weapons, and once more the Emperor calmed them. A rustling susurrus began to spread through the crowd, as the Emperor stood in his \u003Cem\u003Ehowdah\u003C/em\u003E. With a sound of squeaking leather, he descended a small rope ladder, his feet hitting the ground with a metallic clank. He towered over all around him, a massive, imposing figure like a giant statue come to life. Moving slowly, deliberately, he unfastened his sword belt and passed it to an attending squire. No one else moved. No one made a sound. His footfalls were like the clomping of a steel golem, the sun seemed to dance and shimmer off the plates of his armor, his eyes blazed as the forges of a blacksmith\u0027s legion.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet he walked with his hands open, and outstretched, showing he held no blade or club. He stood before the Tamyrlin, looming like a building, a mountain, a planet, and his voice was the quiet rumbling of a distant, onrushing flood, \u0022no kerb need die here today, Lord Tamyrlin. Bend the knee, surrender the Staff and the city to me, and your people will be spared. I swear this, upon the Blood of my Fathers.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Tamyrlin met that fiery gaze, his odd little smile never failing, and spoke as an early spring breeze across a snowfield, \u0022your fathers\u0027 blood? And is their blood on yer hands too, like that of yer brother, and yer infant nephews yet in their mother\u0027s arms?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeather creaked. The distant flood grew nearer. Yet still no one moved.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then... the Tamyrlin held out his hand. In it was the Staff, a simple rod of perfect whiteness, narrowing to a point at one end. His fingers opened, the Staff balanced on his palm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah will \u003Cem\u003Egive\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0you the Staff,\u0022 the smile twitched just a bit, \u0022and the hand of mah only daughter, so that your young empire might have the heir it needs... but the secrets of Arstotzka must remain so. They were not meant for this world, but another long past... and yet to come. The \u003Cem\u003EAshan\u0027shoufa\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0on the walls have taken a vow to protect them, unto th\u0027 last day, and sworn upon that far graver than even blood.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe flood swept up all in its path, trees, boulders, buildings, and still it came, \u0022look before you. I have gathered the greatest army the world has ever seen! My forces number like the sands of the desert, and the stars of the sky! A \u003Cem\u003Emillion\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0kerbs stand at your gates. I have brought halberds from the east, longbows from the west, heavy horse from the south, and Seekers from the frozen north! I, too, bear secrets yet unknown to this world, and with them \u003Cem\u003EI will tear your walls \u003Cstrong\u003Edown\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0If I must.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOblivious, the wind blew on. The Tamyrlin\u0027s smile never faltered, never failed, as if he were thinking of a joke no one else in the world knew, \u0022the walls of Arstotzka have stood for many thousand years,\u0022 he said simply, \u0022they will stand another thousand yet.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIvan\u0027s lips curled into the hint of a sneer, the creases on his face deepened into caverns. He turned to the army in their thousands upon thousands, and stretched out his hands between the heavens and the land. The flood raged, smashing itself against a cliff face, rending stone from stone, \u0022witness me, all of you! I, Ivan, son of Vlad, Thirteenth of his Name, swear upon the Blood of my Fathers: if \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0my demands are met today, I will grant safe passage to the people called \u003Cem\u003EKermanni\u003C/em\u003E, and \u003Cem\u003Enot one hair of their heads shall be harmed\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen he rounded back on the Tamyrlin, raging like a mountain ripping in two, \u0022but I also swear by all the Nine Hells and everything else Below, \u003Cem\u003Eif you make me tear down those walls, I will leave not one stone upon another within, and every kerb, kerbelle, and kerblet will find their head on a stick lining the way from here to the City of Kerman!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 A sudden, slight pain bloomed just behind his right eye, as if perhaps he had screamed \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0loud.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Tamyrlin\u0027s head tilted just slightly, \u0022so then you agree, if I do \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0make you tear down those walls, you will take mah daughter and the Staff, and go out from this place in peace... and mah people will forever be under your protection, and enjoy safe passage in all lands that bend the knee to Ivan, son of Vlad?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIvan ignored the unfamiliar sensation in his head, and once more rumbled like a building storm, \u0022I so swear.\u0022 \u003Cem\u003ESomething... something was...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And so the bond is sealed...\u0022 the Tamyrlin said, and the girl made a sudden noise deep in her throat, raising a hand to her lips. He stepped back, raising the Staff to the sky, \u0022...by the blood of mah fathers... and mah own.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a long moment, nothing happened. Confused glances and muttered words passed amongst the gathered. Then the steady wind started to blow harder, and a great rumbling arose that was not of the Emperor. A flock of birds in a nearby tree took wing. A nervous horse snorted. The ground itself began to shudder.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sourcery!\u0022 someone yelled.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Sourcery!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 another echoed him.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn an instant, the Emperor was again enclosed in a wall of steel and flesh. All along the line, swords screeched in scabbards, bowstrings creaked.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022HOLD!\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EHold your weapons!\u0022 Ivan roared like a landslide. He shoved armored kerbs aside this way and that like paper dolls, forcing his way forward, \u0022you would go back on your word so readily, Tamyrlin?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Never in this life,\u0022 he said, his eyes cast skyward, veins straining on his face, \u0022or any other.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne by one, kerbs began to drop. Weapons clattered to the ground. Horses screamed and oxen brayed as they, too, fell. Ivan grunted, feeling an inexorable pull downward, as if the very grip of the world had strengthened. Around him, some Guards tried to crawl forward, daggers gripped in their teeth.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022HOLD!\u0022 he railed, \u0022by the Kraken\u0027s breath, \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eyou! \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EWill!\u003C/span\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EHOLD!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022 but he himself dropped with a clash of steel... and beheld a vision beyond imagination.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAhead in the foothills, the ground rent open, spewing out gluts of fire and molten rock. The clear day turned dark and angry, clouds churned and lightning split the sky. The very land heaved, and collapsed. The great hill the city was set upon began to sink, crumbling, and invert upon itself, becoming a vast depression.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet not a stone of the walls was disturbed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Ivan watched, the roiling clouds began to circle, whipping into a maelstrom centered on the city. Lightning crashed and thunder boomed, and all at once the clouds seemed to descend. Yet it was not mere cloud mist but water that slammed into the ground. The flow became a torrent, and the torrent a river, drowning the battered land. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet it rose softly over the distant walls, veiling them from this world, and not a stone was disturbed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCloser in the water continued to rise. From the soldiers still crushed upon the ground, a muffled cry rose up. A wall of water a hundred spans high and more now raced at them, building and churning, towering until it blocked out the sky. Helpless before it, kerbs offered up their feeble last cries to this life. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the very last moment, the wave broke against some unseen barrier, rising to the sky with a sound like the thunder of every war ever waged, and even the mighty Ivan hid his face in the dirt.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen he looked up again, the sun had returned. Placid waves lapped against the new shoreline of a wide lake, only spans away. The Tamyrlin lay upon the ground, the Staff still in his hand outstretched in offering, his blue eyes as intense in death as they had been in life. They bored into the Emperor\u0027s own.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIvan forced himself to his feet, unsteady, the great weight now lifted, and beheld the spectacle all around. Far away, on a narrow spit land flanked by forests, people huddled together. What had been a gentle rise was now a wandering coastland, cradling the front lines of his troops like a mother\u0027s arms. The ancient city, and all who remained in it, were gone.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a moment, the lines faded from Ivan\u0027s stern face, and he looked boyish and stricken. He slowly approached the Tamyrlin, and finally took the Staff. It felt smooth and strangely light in his hand. But the moment did not last, and the old chasms returned with twice the intensity. The Emperor cried out in a loud voice and tore the armor from his chest. He beat his own breast, and rent his garments.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Lord Martial approached, cringing, from behind, \u0022M... Majesty? Majesty? Shall I give the order to att\u2014?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe back of the Emperor\u0027s gauntlet caught him in the face, snapping his head back with a clash of metal. He dropped like a stone and was out before he hit the ground. Ivan clanked back and forth before the lines of bewildered kerbs, and roared like the breaking of a world.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Witness me, all of you!\u0022 he stripped off his gauntlets and dragged the point of the Staff across his left palm, then held the hand high and squeezed the blood out upon the ground, \u0022by my blood and the blood of all my Fathers, I, Ivan, son of Vlad, Emperor of all the Ussari, bestow my protection upon the People who call themselves Kermanni, and grant them right of free passage to all lands that bend knee to me!

From where he was, the Emperor peered at them, and where he did they shied back further still. None made a sound.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIvan squeezed more blood upon the ground, and spoke as soft and cold as the deep winter wind, \u0022and so the bond is sealed.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow he turned to the maiden, who was still huddled upon the ground. The stone-faced one next to her did not tense at his approach, but such a kerb need not do so. Ivan offered her his unmarked hand, and did not insult her with vain words.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe looked up and met his gaze. Tears wet her green dress in streaks that somehow looked to him like blood. Her eyes were full of sorrow and grief, and yet devoid of hate.
