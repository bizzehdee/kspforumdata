I\u0027m trying to build a design for lifting. I started large scale and watched time and again how everything falls apart for various reasons. I scaled back. This morning I was working with a single orange tank and mainsail with four large solid fuel rockets for beginning support. It then went to Asparagus staging with the thin long tanks (I really need to learn the designations). The payload was a three man crew replacement for my space station. Every time I tried this, the moment I decoupled the solid fuel boosters the Mainsail pushed its way up through my asparagus staging in wanton destruction. Sometimes physics wouldn\u0027t notice right away and they would be sharing space, but it happened everything. I added struts. That didn\u0027t help. I added more struts. Still didn\u0027t help.

The simplest thing you can do is to throttle down a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing to do is to press F3 after such thing happens and check in the log which part snapped first. Then you can try to reinforce that with struts. Because adding struts randomly where you feel they could help may sometimes even make the ship weaker. The most likely point to give way IMO is the connection between the Jumbo and the SAS module.

The \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ET-9-III-6S (6 sat) is the heaviest legit ship I\u0027ve ever made. 935 tons on the launchpad, 192 tons for the upper stage plus payload means the massive first stage is 743 tons!

The First stage looks like one big stage but it is actually 5 separate pieces attached to the 2nd stage (which is in an asparagus formation) so that the power is not forced on radial attachment points, but actually pushes the second stage (and the rocket) skyward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Y1TTfJq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Y1TTfJq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-04T16:52:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s likely the Mainsail is outputting more thrust than what you need for your remaining payload. The advice you\u0027ve got so far - throttling back - is sound. What you need to do once you\u0027ve separated the last set of boosters (assuming you don\u0027t pancake) is look at your gee meter. If you\u0027re above the green zone, you need to throttle back even more (and consider swapping out with a Skipper if you want to launch the design again).
