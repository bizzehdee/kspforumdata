They have detailed benchmarks you can compare for many CPU\u0027s and GPU\u0027s. Ideally, you will want to find hardware you are familiar with that you can compare to hardware you want. CPU benchmarks will all be artificial tasks, how well a CPU does at a certain type of job. I usually focus on the cinebench benchmarks. GPU\u0027s have artificial tests as well, but they also benchmark them on a powerful computer (that is otherwise identical for all the cards) and get frame rates, so you can see real world performance. The downside to this is that the test computer changes over time, so you\u0027ll usually only be able to compare GPU\u0027s within a couple of years of each other (this is where you will have to rely more on the frame rate tests. Focus on games that you own, or would like to own.

It depends on if you prepare properly, and how comfortable you are with tinkering. Most of the work is screwing things in. Plugging all the wires into the motherboard is also an adventure. You will want to read the assembly instructions for everything, and you\u0027ll probably end up reading more of your motherboard manual than you ever expected (good stuff, you\u0027ll want to hang on to that one).
