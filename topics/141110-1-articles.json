It\u0027s ALL docking ports, right? And you\u0027re trying to dock like ports together? And you\u0027ve not got some mod that enforces \u0022male\u0022 and \u0022female\u0022 ports? I don\u0027t know every mod on your list but figure hey, it\u0027s worth a shot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour best bet is to build a very simple stock craft that will drop one docking port onto another on the launchpad. Test it in a full stock install to make sure it works, and then install half of your mods and try it. If it fails, you know it\u0027s one of those mods, so try again with only half of THOSE installed. Repeat until you\u0027re down to 1 mod that is causing it, and then report the problem to them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s possible that there is a weird interaction between mods, so you may have to get clever in your testing. However I can\u0027t tell you the best way to do this as I\u0027ve never had that happen when doing this bifurcated testing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds daunting but really it\u0027s not. You\u0027ve got 33 mods so it will only take 5 or 6 splits to find it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
