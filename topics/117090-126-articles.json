From there it is just adding the resource to that container with a new resource = XXX entry;\n\ne.g.:\n\n    MODULE\n    {name = SSTUVolumeContainer//default placeholder volume; set by MFT module belowvolume = 100000enableContainerEdit = trueenableFuelTypeChange = truebaseContainerIndex = 0CONTAINER{\tname = Main Tank\tpercent = 100\ttankageVolume = 0.15\ttankageMass = 0.15\tdefaultModifier = standard\tdefaultFuelPreset = LFO\tresource = LiquidFuel\tresource = LqdHydrogen\tresource = Oxidizer\tresource = MonoPropellant\tresource = Aerozine50\tresource = NTO\tresource = ElectricCharge\tmodifier = standard\tmodifier = lbo\tmodifier = zbo\tmodifier = light\tmodifier = structural}\n    }\n\nSay if you wanted to add \u0027Supplies\u0027 to that tank, you would just add another entry below the existing resources that read \u0027 resource = Supplies \u0027.  Everything else is handled by the existing code for most resources (cost, volumes, densities, etc).\n\nIf the resources is intended to use 1-liter units you will need to make a volume entry for the resource as well, as CRP has not yet defined volume for their resources and it defaults to 5 liter units (whereas CRP is supposed to use 1 liter units as far as I know).  Examples for those can be seen in GameData/SSTU/Data/ResourceVolumes.cfg; create (or add through patch) a new SSTU\\_RESOURCEVOLUME root config node that matches the format of the existing entries (resource name and volume).\n\nSetting up the pre-set fuel-types, and setting up the default resources for a container are a bit more complex, but I could write something up for that as well if you are interested."},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-14T00:24:04Z","Content":"Thanks allot, is much less complicated than I anticipated.
