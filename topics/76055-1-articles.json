Considering that traveling to Mars, I would think in some ways, has parallels to Europeans traveling to the New World, I would expect that the people that go there have their own motivations and what not. So here\u0027s my thoughts and opinions, and I would seriously like to know how other people feel about the idea of traveling to Mars given these considerations:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ewith whatever necessary technology, you will (most likely) survive the trip there and (if you choose) back\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ethe expedition will consist of less than 10 people you most likely have never met before being chosen for the trip (you don\u0027t get to choose any of them! And for argument\u0027s sake let\u0027s say it\u0027s equal men and women)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eyou can\u0027t come home until Mars and Earth are in alignment for a return trip (I\u0027m going by my less-than-perfect non-sciency memory, but isn\u0027t it like 20-something years?)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ethe only interaction you can have with people on Earth is through phone and/or video calls\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my thoughts (and for the record, I\u0027m 25) -- first the positive: Currently my two biggest interests in life and career possibilities are agriculture and aviation. Going to Mars involves both of those things in some way. Currently, I\u0027m teaching students about nutrition and gardening. I think about what I want to do next, and I think it would be neat to work on an agricultural development project in a developing country. After that, maybe trying to farm at a research station in Antarctica, and after that... the moon... Mars? Obviously this probably won\u0027t all happen (maybe not even most of it), but it\u0027s fun to dream. The challenge and adventure of going to, living, and growing food on Mars is enticing, even if it\u0027s far-fetched. Plus there\u0027s the idea of being the first, and building something from absolutely nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is, however, that although I\u0027m not married, I do want to eventually have a family. If I left for Mars today, I wouldn\u0027t be back until I was in my 50s. That makes having a family hard, unless it was with another crew member and on Mars, which brings up another point. I\u0027d be seeing the same people for years. And years. It\u0027d be like the Real World, only on Mars, and for YEARS. I\u0027d be stuck with the same people, for better or worse, for a couple decades. THAT is scary. Plus, I couldn\u0027t visit my family or friends. At best, I\u0027d just see them on a video screen, which would really suck. And finally, I kind of like Earth. Yes, it has it\u0027s problems, but I like all the rivers and forests and animals. There wouldn\u0027t be any of that on Mars. It\u0027s basically a desert. There\u0027s barely even an atmosphere... or water. Even with terraforming it wouldn\u0027t be the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what would you do? I\u0027m interested in what people\u0027s motives for going/not going and their ages. I would assume younger people would be more willing to \u0022leave it all behind for adventure and science!\u0022 but maybe I\u0027m wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecha Pants","CreatedById":58006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T03:02:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReturn transfer windows come up WAY more often than once every 20 years, more like a little over two (the first one is about 1.5 years after arrival, and then one every 26 months after, if memory serves).
