Feel free to move it if necessary.\n\nAs of yesterday I\u0027m not receiving any email notifications to subscribed threads. I\u0027ve checked to see if they\u0027re going into my junk mail folder and they aren\u0027t. I\u0027ve also gone through my forum settings and everything is set to instant email notification. I\u0027ve also checked that my email address is the right one, it is. I\u0027ve sent myself a PM and I receive it here but there\u0027s no email notification.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated."},{"CreatedByName":"TontonSancho","CreatedById":142036,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T16:38:04Z","Content":"I registered today on this forum and I did not received my confirmation mail (the one with the link to click-on to confirm my account creation).\n\nRegards."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T16:43:50Z","Content":"Moved to the Kerbal Network forum, the place for all your forum-related questions."},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T16:56:27Z","Content":"I haven\u0027t gotten a subscription email in what feels like weeks, so you\u0027re certainly not alone.
