In my opinion if colony building and management gets too complex KSP2 could be something like a factorio (or a colony sim game) but with LOADS of micromanagment since even if you can automate payload deliveries to your colonies each time you want something different you need to make another rocket launch it and all that so here is the first question. What are the things that you wouldn\u0027t want in colony building?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn my opinion colony building will pose a new and interesting challenge that will allow us to launch rockets from other places and work on gigantic colonies\u00A0 that will be great on the other hand I think resource managment has to be simple: you finde ore you keep ore. Resources should be infinite because as I said before KSP2 is not factorio.\u00A0Imagine the pain that it would be if suddenly you have to move your enormous colony because you\u0027ve ran out of materials for rockets. This could make it painful to play because instead of playing a space sim you just spend hours trying to move a colony.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso you should be able to just put simple thigs like power poles and have kerbals build them because it wouldn\u0027t be fun to move power poles with rockets and move them around (but maybe the process could be sped up with rovers to get to places and build more easily)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-08-25T12:04:03Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2021 12:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Kapitalizing Every Word\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-25T18:00:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s seems like people are starting to over think what would be necessary to construct and operate a colony.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wouldn\u0027t expect it to be as granular as DSP or Factorio as where you have to plan every aspect of your production,\u00A0construction, and distribution to keep a forced high rate of production.

I actually think there are nuggets in Factorio and other city builders that are applicable and could form the core of KSP2 colonies, but I agree that unlike those games KSP\u0027s focus is building rockets and they would want to be hugely simplified, mainly through the reduction in intermediate resource types. You don\u0027t want colonies to be so stripped down that the act of resource production is utterly rote because that will make it boring, but you also don\u0027t want it to be so complicated that you\u0027re spending more time fiddling with resources than building and flying rockets. What makes these systems fun is to have a forgiving baseline performance, but with a little bit of tuning big rewards in terms of efficiency. This to me means managing a small set of inputs and converters to maintain balance and maximize your desired outputs. For instance processing ore into uranium at exactly the rate you need to keep nuclear power going, which in turn feeds your mining operation, keeps habitation modules going, and produces enough surplus to make new rocket parts and grow your colony. Maybe given its location one colony is very efficient at producing LH, but another is better at producing metals or LS and it makes sense to ship one to the other or to a space station in between. Then automating these deliveries becomes part of the overall fine-tuning players could manipulate to do make the best use of whats available. So long as the number of middle resources is kept low I think you get a lot of bang for your buck in terms of simple rules and dynamic, diverse potential strategies.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-08-25T18:16:56Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2021 06:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-25T18:24:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224024172\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204507\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221629914400\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022113880\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shdwlrd\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n55 minutes ago, shdwlrd said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaintaining your colonies isn\u0027t a necessity, the devs have said you can ignore your bases and colonies without them dying out.
