This is likely to be a remnant of old code from when science was only given in integer values (i.e., pre-dating the inclusion of administration building strategies)."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T10:14:03Z","Content":"The in-game UI shows a rounded value of your total science, if your value was rounded up previously and rounded down currently you will see a different number to what you expect.\n\nSee your persistent.sfs file for the accurate value to three decimal places, for example:\n\n    \tSCENARIO\t{\t\tname = ResearchAndDevelopment\t\tscene = 7, 8, 5, 6\t\tsci = 134.858"},{"CreatedByName":"DarkGravity","CreatedById":143383,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T09:47:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You won\u0027t get the \u00224\u002B1\u0022 points -- you *should* be getting 4.
