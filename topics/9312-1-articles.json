The mass per unit of fuel contained in the two tanks differs by a not insignificant 5%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis does have implications for craft design. It means that it will ALWAYS be more efficient to put any half tanks on the bottom of stages, rather then the top, as the fuel burnt for the same amount of thrust from the larger tank will dump more mass off your craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am curious as to what you guys think about this. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sgtblazing","CreatedById":18265,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-08T02:09:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou mislabled them. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E One would think the larger should be more economic as it has less container but more contents.
