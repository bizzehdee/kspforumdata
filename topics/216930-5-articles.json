There are a couple of reasons for this, not least of which is that every time we release an update, we divert resources that would otherwise be focused on continuing to improve the game. We are always balancing our desire to improve the current Early Access experience against long-term goals that involve more time investment. This is a very personal issue for me, because as a fan I want the game to be perfect and awesome right now! But since genies don\u2019t actually exist, that\u2019s not how we\u2019ll arrive at the best version of KSP2. We will continue to release updates prior to our big Science Feature update, and hopefully a slower update cadence will mean that when they do go out, they contain more robust improvements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout wanting to be as audacious as telling the devs what to do (there are plenty on the forum who consider themselves\u00A0 much better at \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E), why not distinguish between patches (bug updates) and feature updates?

At the moment there are still plenty of bugs that will stop people from playing the game, or from enjoying it at the level where they should.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xelo","CreatedById":218744,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-01T15:39:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224278703\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022216930\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221682954479\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002270807\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n53 minutes ago, regex said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe actually promised?

Most of the updates shown pre-release, were spearheaded by the art and vfx department.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo something happened in the software side of things, where Nate was less privy perhaps and it was understandable that he had a overly optimistic prediction.

Or when he released something buggy how rather then \u0027hey guys your gonna have to wait who knows how many weeks for us to fix it\u0027 at times we would see rapid fire hot patches that YES some times broke the game worse but other times rapidly fixed the game.. and you know what? It didn\u0027t matter, it was EA we knew it was EA we knew that we were playing Beta\u0027s the update cadence and rapid no QA tested stuff didn\u0027t bother us, we WERE the QA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat all seems to be lost here.. We have what at times feels like condescending remarks in press releases and discord statements, lack of open and honesty about what is going on, statements that seem well.. to contradict themselves (We aren\u0027t going to patch the game to fix bugs, because patching the game to fix bugs takes away from us being able to patch the game to fix bugs!). Etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor the first time in a long while, this last press statement made me change a positive review to a negative.. because if Take 2, PD, Intercept etc can\u0027t give time frames for when we can expect patches after 3 years of development, delays, can make statements like they are happy with how it released etc.. I can\u0027t recommend to my mates that they should buy into the game.

(I used to have a game dev company so I know how this works)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs he says, there is a certain overhead for every patch, big or small. You have to test everything against every change, you may have broken something that wasn\u0027t even related to the fixes in the patch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo there is a \u0027sweet spot\u0027 of the right number of fixes to incorporate and bundle up in to a patch. Only the devs are in a position to decide this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWho would want a daily update with 1 fix, to take it to extremes? Equally, we don\u0027t want to wait 3 months. The right cadence is somewhere inbetween. I do agree thought that the focus should be in fixing all bugs that are blockers to the current features being used, not eye candy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
